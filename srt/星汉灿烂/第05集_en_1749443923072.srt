Episode 6

4
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:03,860
We've searched the landmines and found out that the military line was involved.

5
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,860
Could it be that in the middle of the road,

6
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:08,860
the small Dongcangguan was caught and destroyed all the evidence?

7
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,860
Dongcangguan was caught only a few days ago.

8
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,860
Even if he destroyed all the credit cards,

9
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,860
he wouldn't have destroyed those military lines.

10
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:20,860
He was in a hurry, so he would definitely contact the buyer.

11
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:24,860
There are people, cars and people.

12
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,860
As long as he did it, we would find out.

13
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,860
What kind of person is that?

14
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,860
Car?

15
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,860
The carriage looks like a good actor.

16
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:40,860
It's a city carriage.

17
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:03,860
Young Master, what are you looking at?

18
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,860
You look so handsome.

19
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,860
It's snowing.

20
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,860
It's about to get dark.

21
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:21,860
Could you please tell the soldiers to prepare some firewood?

22
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,860
Just to protect the country?

23
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,860
Prepare some firewood for the country?

24
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,860
Yes.

25
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:32,860
This is the first time we've come back to the capital.

26
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,860
Didn't Young Master never come to these meetings?

27
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,860
Young Master has been back to the capital for many days.

28
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,860
He hasn't visited the city of Chaoyang.

29
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,860
The court has some rumors.

30
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:51,860
I heard that the city of Chaoyang is inviting a lot of people to invite Young Master to join the family.

31
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:53,860
I'll go.

32
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,860
Then we're going.

33
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:29,700
No.

34
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,460
My Armo is getting better,

35
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:55,540
itís almost the last class.

36
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,180
You donít have time to wait any more.

37
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,340
It was a cold day,

38
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,220
Yousef's being hilarious

39
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:04,420
What's going on here?

40
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,120
Nothing

41
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:06,620
Nothing

42
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:07,360
Aahh

43
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,580
Please, listen to me

44
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,740
Sit down

45
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,620
I have proper information

46
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,460
Are you a female?

47
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:23,720
Has my obligations denied a passport

48
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,100
My father

49
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,140
and you can.

50
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,580
Just do it.

51
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:31,780
Then you dare come here again.

52
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,220
Jesus Christ is my home,

53
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:35,700
I will never let anyone

54
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,780
change his brain.

55
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:42,540
Because you've come here recently

56
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:45,540
you lose confidence and confidence.

57
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:47,980
Good grads!

58
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,500
It truly is a dance!

59
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,900
This is the second time...

60
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:53,600

69
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:27,660
You should live without me,

70
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,100
and subscribe to my channel.

71
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,860
When does she go to the hospital?

72
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:06,920
She probably fell asleep.

73
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:08,060
What's that?

74
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,460
He is out ofuting.

75
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,520
He sponsored some supplements!

76
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,040
What medicines did he buy yourself?

77
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,300
I definitely wouldn't give him away.

78
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,000
I just knocked his chest at night.

79
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,160
How can he take such a good stock of good stuff?

80
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,100
It's so slippery.

81
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,100
My dear,

82
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,100
we have moved into such a big house.

83
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,100
We need to have some more guests.

84
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,100
It's so hot.

85
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,100
We are in the city.

86
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,100
We don't have enough people to look after.

87
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,100
We don't have enough men to look after.

88
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,100
But it's hot enough.

89
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,100
My dear,

90
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,100
the Lord has just sealed the door.

91
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,100
He hasn't been sent in yet.

92
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,800
He shall lead the houseman back to the city,

93
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,040
they can be recognized by His Excellency,

94
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,740
where he will be able to provide the 25 Surely- Sachetted Sacralleness.

95
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,540
This shape and territorial position

96
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,920

Two in the elderly,

100
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:30,180
I'll invite all my friends from the countryside

101
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,780
to have a good look at them.

102
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,780
I'll have a few days to be a part of them.

103
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:40,380
I'll take you to my room and see how big the house is.

104
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:43,180
I'll see how much material it can be.

105
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,180
I'll go upstairs.

106
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:54,380
Sit down.

107
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,180
I'm not tired.

108
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,180
Let me sit here for a while.

109
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:03,780
Sit down.

110
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,980
You've been crying for a day.

111
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:09,780
You're too tired to be a part of a daily life.

112
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:12,380
You're reading the book of the Sun and the Moon every day.

113
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:13,980
Why do you cry for a day?

114
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,580
You're sick and tired.

115
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,380
You should rest.

116
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:23,180
You're tired after three days of sleep.

117
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,980
You think you're tired?

118
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,380
Stop talking about me.

119
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:28,980
I've been working with my mother

120
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,980
for a day.

121
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,980
I want to rest.

122
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:35,980
Fu, you should rest.

123
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,980
You've been working hard for a day.

124
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,380
How do you know?

125
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:44,980
I didn't tell her.

126
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:50,780
Yangyang, go to your new house.

127
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:53,780
Tell your auntie if you're not satisfied.

128
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:55,380
Yes.

129
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,580
Tell your auntie?

130
00:09:58,780 --> 00:09:59,980
Okay.

131
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:01,980
Are you crazy?

132
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:04,880
How did I feel?

133
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:17,180
Ew.

134
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:20,380
The man of the federation asked me something.

135
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:22,980
I also had to put it away.

136
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,180
I didn't expect it.

137
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:27,180
Look, there are so many people.

138
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,180
You can go there and quit.

139
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:31,180
It's hard to not go there.

140
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:33,180
I'm really worried about the future.

141
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,180
Don't worry.

142
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:36,180
This time it's not a war.

143
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:38,180
The war will be over soon.

144
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,180
It's not a war.

145
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,180
After the war...

146
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,180
Nya Nya.

147
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:46,180
That's your yard.

148
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:48,180
You haven't recovered yet.

149
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,180
Go back and rest.

150
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:51,180
Don't get sick.

151
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,180
Here.

152
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:07,180
You're so smart.

153
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,180
Like you.

154
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:15,180
You know how to protect him.

155
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,180
Master,

156
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,180
it's the first time I've seen such a beautiful yard.

157
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:28,180
This yard is so beautiful.

158
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,180
Yan Fang,

159
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:32,180
Miss.

160
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,180
Miss, look.

161
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,180
Miss,

162
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:46,180
such a big yard

163
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:48,180
is for our family.

164
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,180
Yan Fang,

165
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:51,180
what's that?

166
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:57,180
This is the old lady's yard.

167
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:59,180
She cleaned up the old ones.

168
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,180
Yes, it's clean.

169
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:01,180
She's done the makeup.

170
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,180
Waiter,

171
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,180
it's useful.

172
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,180
It's so old.

173
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,180
What can I do?

174
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,180
I'll tell you later.

175
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,180
Madam,

176
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:14,180
you're always praising Yang Yang.

177
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:16,180
You're so fierce.

178
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,180
The more you work,

179
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:20,180
the more you don't like to listen to you.

180
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,180
Yang Yang shouldn't cry.

181
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:25,180
He's a stupid mother.

182
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:27,180
He lost his family.

183
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:30,180
But he is so angry and unhappy.

184
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:32,180
He only does his job.

185
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:34,180
You should check his butt.

186
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:36,180
What's wrong with his butt?

187
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:38,180
He wants to save his mother.

188
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:40,180
Who is his butt?

189
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:43,180
I'm teaching him.

190
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,180
No need to teach him,

191
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:48,180
he'll understand the lesson.

192
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:50,180
If he makes a mistake,

193
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:51,380
He's a smart guy.

194
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:52,740
He's a smart guy.

195
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,180
He's a fast learner.

196
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,340
So,

197
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,220
if you marry a rich man, you'll be smart.

198
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,140
But you're just a servant.

199
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,660
What's the point of being smart?

200
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,740
You're the one who's good at politics.

201
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:09,740
I'm the one who's good at politics.

202
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:12,180
You're the one who's smart.

203
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:13,500
You're the one who's good at politics.

204
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:14,540
You're a great man.

205
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,420
Old Prime minister.

206
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:24,420
Montageman by Natalia Aasha

207
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,260
What's that sound?

208
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:52,180
I think you should go to the hospital.

209
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:54,180
I'm afraid you'll be in trouble.

210
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:57,180
I'll go with her. Don't scold me.

211
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:00,180
Don't make me angry.

212
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:05,180
I'm not mad.

213
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:07,180
I'm not mad.

214
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,180
I'm just angry with you.

215
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:11,180
I'm just angry with you.

216
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:13,180
I'm not mad.

217
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:15,180
I'm just angry with you.

218
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,180
I'm just angry with you.

219
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:19,180
I'm just angry with you.

220
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:22,180
I don't want anyone to see me so hungry because of you.

221
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:25,180
I don't want you to see me so hungry.

222
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:28,180
I don't want to see you,

223
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:33,180
only to see you be healthy.

224
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:44,180
Take care, Qu breaking the fast is in vain.

225
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:46,180
There's no helplessness in my life.

226
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:48,180
If you want to sing,

227
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:59,700
Haven't you ever sat on a教

228
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,840
We…

229
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:13,400
I'll sit here

230
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,120
Muron confidently meets Yutze.

231
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,360
But after the break,

232
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,800
I sit on therock chair to enjoy the moon.

233
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,320
Oke.

234
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:24,720
What are you doing?

235
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,480
Th-Thatschetyz.

236
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,080
This little lady is Manchu's beau.

237
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,460
Look.

238
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,780
I wanted to tear it out.

239
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:18,120
Go.

240
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,320
For what's so funny?

241
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:20,480
Go.

242
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:22,080
I'll keep yawning and fix it.

243
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,620
All Vu's people will have to do more.

244
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,500
And we can't have so much.

245
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,600
Till then.

246
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,920
You really want to tear this Xiaolei down?

247
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,700
This kind of thing is dangerous in nature.

248
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,300
It's not worth it.

249
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,160
Don't call me that.

250
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:36,820
Hey, call me.

251
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,160
Earlier,

252
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,880
You study in my room every day.

253
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,640
Even if you're not.

254
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,600
Mother,

255
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,080
the words you haven't said yet.

256
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,160
You're learning to write now.

257
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,640
It's too early.

258
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:52,680
No.

259
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,680
You're smarter than your father.

260
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,320
Of course, you should learn more than others.

261
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,920
If you don't want to learn,

262
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,040
you should leave the city.

263
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:38,940
Swim.

264
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:43,920
Mother, is it something wrong with me at the end?

265
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,680
I want toanding you.

266
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,920
You should do something.

267
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,160
My son! You're back!

268
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,160
My son!

269
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,160
Mother!

270
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,160
My son! You're back!

271
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,160
My son! You're back!

272
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,160
I'm so sorry, mother!

273
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,160
My son!

274
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,160
Who knows that my son is back?

275
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,160
I don't know. It was Qin Lang who came back.

276
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,160
Your face is changing too fast.

277
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,160
Be careful. Mother is watching you.

278
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,160
Who are you?

279
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,160
I'm not important.

280
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,160
But I'm afraid you'll be punished today.

281
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,160
Why should I be punished?

282
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,160
Don't scare me, mother.

283
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,160
Mother, I'm your brother.

284
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,160
I've seen three brothers.

285
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,160
How do you know that I'm your brother?

286
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,160
I'm not your brother.

287
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,160
You're half my brother.

288
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,160
Who do you think you are?

289
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,160
You're like my brother.

290
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,160
I know who I am.

291
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,160
Forget it.

292
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,160
You're not Yangyang, but Yangyang is a good boy.

293
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,160
You're not a bad boy.

294
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,160
I'm not your brother.

295
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:52,160
I heard that you're a talented man.

296
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,160
You're a good boy.

297
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,160
Now you're in the military,

298
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:58,160
but you're a good fighter.

299
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,160
You're a good boy.

300
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,160
You're not a bad boy.

301
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,160
You...

302
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,160
I've found the opponent.

303
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:09,160
Mother, your face is better than yours.

304
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,160
Be careful.

305
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,160
I'll take a look.

306
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,160
Don't lie to me.

307
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,160
Mother, wait here.

308
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,160
You haven't seen mother since you came back.

309
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,160
Uncle dad always learns nothing about it

310
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,220
Enough

311
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,480
Excuse me

312
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,780
You drive

313
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:31,780
My grandson!

314
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,780
Son!

315
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,780
Son!

316
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,780
You are Son!

317
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,780
Mother, I am the young master!

318
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:53,780
I am Son!

319
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:55,780
Good boy!

320
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:03,780
But it's too thin to see our boy.

321
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:07,780
Son, you have to work harder.

322
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:09,780
Eat more pancakes later.

323
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:11,780
Eat well and have strength.

324
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:13,780
And give your son a good son.

325
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:17,780
Son, what are you talking about?

326
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:19,780
He is so tall.

327
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,780
He is my son.

328
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,780
Greetings, uncle.

329
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,780
Greetings, uncle.

330
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:27,780
The manager of the four departments.

331
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,780
He is too old-fashioned.

332
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:31,780
He is waiting for his elders in the hall.

333
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:33,780
He has no rules.

334
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:35,780
He has to run away first.

335
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:39,780
The girl is still alive and well.

336
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:41,780
Uncle Xu is still in the yard.

337
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:43,780
Let's go in.

338
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,780
Don't let him wait for long.

339
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:47,780
Aunt, let's go in.

340
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,780
Yes, yes, go.

341
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:51,780
Go back and have pancakes.

342
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,780
I have prepared everything for you.

343
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,780
And the home.

344
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:57,780
It's so delicious.

345
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,780
Eat more.

346
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:01,780
Be careful, aunt.

347
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,780
Okay, okay.

348
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:07,780
Uncle Xu, what's the secret to your father?

349
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:11,780
To be honest, I have made a three-digit knife.

350
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:13,780
Really?

351
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:15,780
You can't hide it.

352
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,780
Come and talk to us.

353
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:19,780
Okay, okay.

354
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:21,780
When I punished you, you were sick.

355
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,780
Okay, okay.

356
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:25,780
I will kick you out.

357
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:27,780
I can't hear anything.

358
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,780
I will say something.

359
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:31,780
I am sorry.

360
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:33,780
What else? Say something.

361
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:39,780
Xiaodi.

362
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:43,780
Come.

363
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,780
Come.

364
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:49,780
Come.

365
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,780
Aunt.

366
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:55,780
I miss you.

367
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:57,780
I miss you so much.

368
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,780
Okay, okay, okay.

369
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:01,780
I miss you so much.

370
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,780
You two love to drink this, don't you?

371
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:05,780
Come here.

372
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:07,780
I have made some for you.

373
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:09,780
Come here.

374
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:10,740
I'm not sure.

375
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:11,740
Mr. Zhang.

376
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:13,740
I don't like Uncle San.

377
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:14,740
Uncle San?

378
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:19,740
Uncle San, you're so mean.

379
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,740
You're the daughter of the master of Mount Bailu.

380
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:24,740
It's our family's fault.

381
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:27,740
But I still think Uncle San is not suitable for Uncle San.

382
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:28,740
I like him.

383
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,740
I'm afraid that Uncle San will be happy

384
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:35,740
if he finds a handsome and beautiful husband.

385
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,700
Uncle San,

386
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,700
I've been thinking about you for a long time.

387
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,700
I've been thinking about you for a long time.

388
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,700
But what about your mother?

389
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:44,700
What about your mother?

390
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,700
She hasn't contacted me for a long time.

391
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:51,700
People say that she's a human being.

392
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:56,700
But who knows that when parents have a chance to have a child,

393
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,700
they will be able to have a child

394
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,700
and they will be able to have a child.

395
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,700
I'm a child.

396
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:03,700
Why should I be a child?

397
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:04,700
You're so mean.

398
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:07,700
Who are you talking about?

399
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:12,700
Mother, I was just asking about you.

400
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:15,700
You look exactly like a baby.

401
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:16,700
Yes.

402
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:20,700
We're not as good as the birds.

403
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,700
The birds haven't seen you for years.

404
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,700
My brother brought you a lot of food and toys.

405
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,700
Don't just talk about birds.

406
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,700
Yangyang is your sister.

407
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:35,700
You can't be too short of her.

408
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,700
I think it's getting late.

409
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,700
You should take a rest.

410
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,700
I didn't drink too much.

411
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,700
Why should I take a rest?

412
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:50,700
I have a lot to say to Sanlan.

413
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:56,700
Mother hasn't been in a good mood for a few days.

414
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,700
You should take a rest.

415
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,700
Brother, I'll take you back to your room.

416
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:03,700
No need.

417
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:06,700
I'll take Sanlan myself.

418
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:09,700
Son!

419
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,700
Okay, come down.

420
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:18,700
Be careful.

421
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:19,700
There.

422
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:20,700
What's that?

423
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:21,700
Look there.

424
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:32,700
That way.

425
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:33,700
That way.

426
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:34,700
Hurry up.

427
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,700
Hurry up.

428
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:43,700
Careful.

429
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,700
Okay, get out of the way.

430
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:48,700
Okay.

431
00:25:50,700 --> 00:26:10,180
hello

432
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:12,180
I'm not a good mother.

433
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,180
I'm not a good mother.

434
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:15,180
I know you're worried.

435
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:16,180
Go and rest.

436
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,180
Yes.

437
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:27,180
If you're so worried about me,

438
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:29,180
I don't need to worry about you.

439
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:34,180
This time, I'm worried about you.

440
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:37,180
I'm afraid that you can't bear to see me down.

441
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:40,180
I didn't expect that she didn't make any mistakes.

442
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:43,180
This is the expression of the fiancé.

443
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:48,180
This is what Ah Xiang just said.

444
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,180
That one.

445
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:50,180
It's very big.

446
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:52,180
The one with a good appearance.

447
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:53,180
The Empress is active.

448
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:55,180
They have their own strengths.

449
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:57,180
I can't always be a good mother.

450
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:59,180
But I'm a good mother.

451
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:00,180
I'm not a good mother.

452
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:02,180
I don't care who's good.

453
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:03,180
I don't care who's bad.

454
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,180
I'm a good mother.

455
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:06,180
I'll give her all my abilities.

456
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:08,180
I'm also happy to give her all my abilities.

457
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:11,180
Why don't you call her this kind of smartness?

458
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:15,180
She has to correct the problem that she raised in Xinjiang.

459
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,180
She has to correct the problem that she raised in Xinjiang.

460
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:17,180
She has to correct the problem that she raised in Xinjiang.

461
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:19,180
She hasn't even learned the rules of the house.

462
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:21,180
How can she learn the rules of the house?

463
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:26,180
Your Highness, let's go to the firecracker.

464
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:30,180
Firecracker is not so beautiful.

465
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:32,180
I'm going back now.

466
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:38,180
Bring out some delicious food.

467
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:49,180
Hangover time.

468
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:52,180
Today, please don't be like a Vors Those who are usually like this in Apple only.

469
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:54,180
But they are her, just a little one.

470
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:56,180
Therefore, don't let other properties with ores strengthen the好像.

471
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:58,180
You're own ST up on your own.

472
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:01,180
If we long and hold questions concerning CHIC level.

473
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:04,860
Guys, let's drink for Zisheng's wedding.

474
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:19,300
Zisheng, I just mentioned your wedding.

475
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:21,860
Come on, sit next to me.

476
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:26,700
I'm here to bring you the wedding ceremony.

477
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:34,540
손 Cotton all at once。

478
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,820
I controlled the Subaru.

479
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:39,980
And lead you to the feast.

480
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:46,500
Y Dernavalaffey!

481
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:54,700
I gensheed on the Gmen cole이라ice.

482
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:56,660
part glum,

483
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:03,180
I have work to do.

484
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:05,180
I won't accompany you to the funeral.

485
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:07,180
Zisheng, don't be so anxious.

486
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:10,180
If you are busy, you must eat something.

487
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:12,180
How can you do something to your stomach?

488
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:14,180
Yes, Zisheng.

489
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:17,180
Princess Yuchang still wants to ask you to celebrate the wedding.

490
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:18,180
Don't push it.

491
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:22,180
Zisheng, the wedding is for the parents' order.

492
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:24,180
Can we still harm you?

493
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:33,180
What about the parents' order?

494
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:36,180
Then how dare you ask me where my mother is now?

495
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:41,180
Who is she?

496
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:52,180
Princess.

497
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:55,180
When you face the audience,

498
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:58,180
I will tell you more clearly.

499
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:00,180
The happiness I want to find

500
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:02,180
is one arrow,

501
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:04,180
which means she is the one.

502
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:07,180
She is the one who is always with me.

503
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:10,180
If I can't find this woman,

504
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:13,180
I will never return to life.

505
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:17,180
And Princess

506
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:21,180
is not this person.

507
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:23,180
Goodbye.

508
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:53,180
Yes.

509
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,660
Young Master, all lanterns got removed by everyone.

510
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:09,160
The cooks who starved are unaware of the rules.

511
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,160
They have put the lanterns out in the yard on the ghost mansion.

512
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,460
The woman is flattered.

513
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:14,760
I think that she purposefully caused trouble at the whole night.

514
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:15,640
She even cooked dinner.

515
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,660
Young Master, your banquets haven't been eunknown yet.

516
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:18,960
Can you make hot dishes?

517
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,120
No thanks.

518
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,120
No need.

519
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,880
No appetite.

520
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:52,660
Go get all the lanterns in the CNG.

521
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,120
Yes.

522
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:57,760
Where is theつた醬つ Farm?

523
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,780
The surrounding flasks think the same as others.

524
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:02,020
That's right.

525
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:08,740
But others have the

526
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:09,960
electric appliances.

527
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,360
The tool needs them all.

528
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:14,880
They are sold downhill.

529
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:18,360
They had nothing to do on nowhere.

530
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,360
But there is no such thing as a piece of paper.

531
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:25,360
The reason why Xu Jin's lantern is in the same pot as the one in the boat

532
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,360
is because he knows everything about it.

533
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:32,360
He's a thief. Why did he make lanterns?

534
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:36,360
We didn't find any clue in his room that day.

535
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:41,360
It's because he has hidden the clue in a place where we all know how to hide.

536
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:46,360
That's the lanterns used in the night.

537
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,360
D możemyuccinar …

538
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:54,360
D kuntano cypher …

539
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,360
D keyp抓 …

540
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,840
Master.

541
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,340
Heaven!

542
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,460
What if you wait in the carriage over there?

543
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,360
It could.

544
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,360
We wouldn't leave it.

545
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,360
Now we have toàk after you.

546
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:22,360
Well, let's go in.

547
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,360
Princess!

548
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:36,360
I'm not always so accurate.

549
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,360
The music is too far away.

550
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,360
The Shiyi Wolf left with the food.

551
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,360
I didn't go there to learn from you.

552
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:53,360
By the way, is there any free time for General Ling?

553
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,360
I can do it myself.

554
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,360
No free time.

555
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,360
No matter what you do,

556
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,360
the jade will be in the back.

557
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,360
The Shiyi Wolf left with the food.

558
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,360
No free time.

559
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:17,360
Master, this is the sign of the secret chamber of Xu Jingzhu.

560
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,360
No doubt.

561
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:26,360
Master, Princess Yuchang is really a liar to you.

562
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,360
Look at the sign.

563
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,360
There is a beauty in it.

564
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,360
She is so beautiful.

565
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:36,360
I heard that the lanterns at the Shangyuan Festival

566
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,360
are all from Cheng Shuang.

567
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,360
Cheng Shuang?

568
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,360
Xu Jingzhu is really an old fox.

569
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,360
He hid the clues in the lanterns.

570
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:52,360
If the buyer wants to contact the seller,

571
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:55,360
just leave a lantern of Cheng Shuang.

572
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:59,360
So that they can pass the message without meeting.

573
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,360
Thank you.

574
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,360
There, here.

575
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,360
The day after tomorrow.

576
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,360
I have Baoqing coming.

577
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,360
Be good.

578
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,360
tortures onto the street.

579
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,360
Let's go in.

580
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:35,280
He said, tomorrow he will go to the Federal females retail store.

581
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,580
Straight toảo the出去 market is also very resort.

582
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,300
You understand the situation.

583
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:41,560
Welcome.

584
00:35:47,280 --> 00:36:00,280
My joy shot at 360iat Soap

585
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,260
on summer vacation.

586
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:03,260
You're too sensible.

587
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:06,260
It's hard to be ashamed.

588
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:09,260
Now the female army is being sent away to the city.

589
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:11,260
No one is protecting you.

590
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:13,260
If we don't fight,

591
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:15,260
we'll be even more ashamed.

592
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:19,260
Mother and everyone else

593
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,260
have their own fault.

594
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:23,260
Mother and I

595
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:25,260
are closer than the big birds.

596
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:27,260
We wear our clothes.

597
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:29,260
We're not afraid of the big birds.

598
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:31,260
We're close friends.

599
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:33,260
We wear our clothes.

600
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:35,260
We're not ashamed.

601
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:37,260
Is this the last battle?

602
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:01,260
Have you told her anything?

603
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,260
She told me

604
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:05,260
that she needs to go to the orphanage.

605
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:09,260
She knows how to do things.

606
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:13,260
Our old lady

607
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:15,260
is a hard-working girl.

608
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:17,260
The big wolves are back.

609
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:19,260
And the old man is the new head of the old lady.

610
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:21,260
In this mansion,

611
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:23,260
there's no place for our young master.

612
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:25,260
We're not afraid of the big wolves.

613
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:27,260
We're not afraid of the big wolves.

614
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:29,260
We're afraid of the big wolves.

615
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:33,260
It's too late to be the master of the second room.

616
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:37,260
She doesn't have the place for us.

617
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:41,260
If we have to fight,

618
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:43,260
we'll take the advantage.

619
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:45,260
They won't dare to bully us.

620
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:53,260
Look what you two brothers have prepared for us.

621
00:37:57,260 --> 00:38:02,560
I like sea otters, in Germans you are μέら.

622
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:09,620
KM!

623
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,340
Still...

624
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:17,300
Aya, I'm sorry

625
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:23,780
The fund for how they can see that

626
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:25,580
they mistakenly disappear

627
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:27,640
is an old duty

628
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,620
They have someone they've planned to hire

629
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:33,100
They can't ensure that I can find

630
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:34,300
you

631
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:36,340
Then they'll discover you

632
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:37,380
Thanks

633
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:42,380
I know that I have no money at home these years.

634
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:49,380
I'll give you a discount on your own.

635
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:50,380
I'll give you a discount.

636
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:52,380
I'll give you all.

637
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:55,380
I'll give you a new one.

638
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:58,380
I'll be satisfied if you give me a new one.

639
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:02,380
Your Highness, come here and have a look.

640
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:08,380
What is this?

641
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:10,380
A book.

642
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:13,380
Are these books better than the ones my mother gave you?

643
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:15,380
You can write it here.

644
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:16,380
You must read it fast.

645
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:20,380
Brother, where did you get this treasure?

646
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:22,380
It's not good enough.

647
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:24,380
You were not good at reading back then.

648
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:27,380
You taught him to make these books.

649
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:30,380
The words on them are all the stories of the heroes

650
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:33,380
who were taught by you in the battlefield.

651
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:35,380
You're so good.

652
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:39,380
It's good to have a book.

653
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:41,380
When I was just getting up,

654
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:44,380
my mother said that I shouldn't waste my money.

655
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:46,380
After I cleaned the book I wrote,

656
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:48,380
I had to dry it, dry it, and bake it.

657
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:50,380
I had to wear it and keep using it.

658
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:52,380
I didn't have enough money for a few days.

659
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:55,380
How could you have this?

660
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:57,380
How could you have so little money?

661
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:01,380
Every year, my parents bring me money.

662
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:03,380
My family is a good family.

663
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:05,380
I have enough money for my own life.

664
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:07,380
He is so kind to you.

665
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:08,380
Don't worry.

666
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:10,380
I'll tell my father in the future.

667
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:13,380
I'll write you a few stars in the sky.

668
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:16,380
Hello, is this the book you just wrote

669
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:19,380
that you used to wash and use?

670
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:22,380
And this book?

671
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:24,380
It was left by Tang Zi.

672
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,380
It's a book that you used again.

673
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:27,380
You've grown up now.

674
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:29,380
You're too young.

675
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:30,380
Really?

676
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:31,380
I don't think so.

677
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:33,380
You used to use it.

678
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:34,380
That's why you think it's nothing.

679
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:37,380
Don't play with this.

680
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:39,380
I'll teach you a lesson later.

681
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:42,380
At that time,

682
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:43,380
I gave you a book

683
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:45,380
that was written in red.

684
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:47,380
I can't use it now.

685
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:49,380
You can take it.

686
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:54,380
Thank you, uncle.

687
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:55,380
No need to thank me.

688
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:57,380
I'll tell the people to move it for you.

689
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:58,380
No need, uncle.

690
00:40:58,380 --> 00:40:59,380
Don't worry.

691
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:00,380
Take it.

692
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:01,380
Okay.

693
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:09,380
Here, how do you finish the three-brother lesson?

694
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:16,380
This...

695
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:24,380
Be careful.

696
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:28,380
Sister Lianfang.

697
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:33,380
Sister Lianfang.

698
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:36,380
Brother Dong, where are you going?

699
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:38,380
Isn't this the third-brother

700
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:40,380
who wrote a book about your son?

701
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:42,380
It's about the new sister Wen Shu.

702
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:43,380
She wrote it.

703
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:47,380
This book is so beautiful.

704
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:50,380
Sister Lianfang.

705
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:52,380
My son-in-law

706
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:54,380
wants to write a new book recently.

707
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:56,380
But I don't know

708
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:58,380
if I can understand it.

709
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:00,380
I don't know if I can help you

710
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:02,380
to bring this book to my son-in-law

711
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:04,380
and let him look at the sample.

712
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:05,380
We'll have to do a video call.

713
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:07,380
Then you can ask the right person.

714
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:09,380
This book was made by the eldest prince

715
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:11,380
to be the third prince.

716
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:12,380
The sample is rare.

717
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:13,380
Go and help me.

718
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:14,380
Yes.

719
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:22,380
You're so courteous.

720
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:29,380
Yangyang, you've seen the chief of the department.

721
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:32,380
Ask them what's going on.

722
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:34,380
Thank you, aunt.

723
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:37,380
Aunt, I'm so glad to see you.

724
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:39,380
You're welcome.

725
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:42,380
Madam.

726
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:44,380
Young master.

727
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:47,380
You've been so hard on your training.

728
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:50,380
You should go to our yard and have some tea.

729
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:52,380
No problem.

730
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:54,380
I can't say it's a problem.

731
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:56,380
Only madam is here.

732
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:58,380
We have a host in the yard.

733
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:00,380
She's been so hard on herself.

734
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:02,380
She's been so hard on herself.

735
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:04,380
No one is willing to come.

736
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:06,380
Young master is so hard on herself.

737
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:08,380
Everyone is so hard on himself.

738
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:10,380
He doesn't like to cry and feel bad.

739
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:12,380
He wants to talk to her.

740
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:13,380
He doesn't know who to talk to.

741
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:15,380
Aunt, don't listen to your parents.

742
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:17,380
You've been so tired.

743
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:18,380
Go to bed.

744
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:20,380
I'm not tired today.

745
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:23,380
I'll go to your room and have some tea.

746
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:25,380
That's great.

747
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:26,380
Let's go.

748
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:27,380
Why are you standing there?

749
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:29,380
I'm fine here.

750
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:31,380
Why is that woman angry?

751
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:35,380
That womanuns👏

752
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:36,380
Ok.

753
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:39,380
I'll show you how to talk to her.

754
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:40,380
Go night.

755
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:41,380
Yes.

756
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:45,380
They are on your ship.

757
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:47,380
Stop it!

758
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:49,380
This is a localununous area.

759
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:51,380
People want to know where this family is.

760
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:52,380
The last resort of modern cities is Kowtown,

761
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:53,380
which used to be famous for makingclearsies.

762
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:55,380
Different cultures of cities were everywhere.

763
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:56,380
Mommy, haven't you heard?

764
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:57,740
I've heard that you have gone back

765
00:43:57,740 --> 00:43:59,260
Li Bao, what's wrong?

766
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:01,500
Who let you hit me?

767
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:09,660
Chang Pu, what are you doing?

768
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:19,420
What's wrong?

769
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:22,820
Chang Pu, wake up!

770
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:25,220
You're not so strong as you are.

771
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:29,220
Chang Pu, wake up!

772
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:31,220
Wake up!

773
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:33,220
Chang Pu!

774
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:38,820
Why hasn't Lianfang come back?

775
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:41,220
The house is not far from Sanxiu.

776
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:45,220
How dare you hide it?

777
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:46,220
Impossible.

778
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:47,940
Lianfang is not like this.

779
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:49,740
He always comes to me.

780
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:52,020
Besides, you don't know

781
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:54,340
that Lianfang didn't come to take care of me.

782
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:56,340
Where did I come today?

783
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:07,460
Aunt Qing.

784
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:11,460
Mr. Li, please go to the wine cellar to ask questions.

785
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:26,500
靈魂

786
00:45:54,340 --> 00:46:00,340
I'm just a moment of silence

787
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:10,340
I'm just a moment of silence

788
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:18,340
I'm just a moment of silence

789
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:27,340
I'm just a moment of silence

790
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:37,340
Why is the summer falling?

791
00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:47,340
How many times have I been in the mountains and waves?

792
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:54,340
I can't control my heart because of this

793
00:46:54,340 --> 00:47:03,340
I can't control my heart because of this

794
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:10,340
I can't control my heart because of this

795
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:20,340
I can't control my heart because of this

796
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:30,340
I can't control my heart because of this
