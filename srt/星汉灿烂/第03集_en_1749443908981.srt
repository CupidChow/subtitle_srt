The first lady.

24
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:45,100
You think that we should settle this kind of things?

25
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,340
This thing is really interesting.

26
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,220
Well...

27
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,920

28
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,920
What is the matter with him?

29
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,920
He has been in the office for several days.

30
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,920
He has been in the office for several days.

31
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,920
Continue to investigate.

32
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,920
Yes.

33
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,920
Then how did he deal with the office?

34
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,920
He has no idea about what the superior ordered.

35
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,920
He is a criminal.

36
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,920
He is a criminal.

37
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,920
He is a criminal.

38
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,920
He is a criminal.

39
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,920

00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,920
Send money.

41
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,920
Let him go back to Chen Jia Bai.

42
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,920
To catch the board of directors.

43
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,920
To find out these clues.

44
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,920
There is also a case of Miss Chen.

45
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,920
We will be the head of the department to pay her a favor.

46
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,920
Send money.

47
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,920
Let the board of directors see Yan Qing Ren.

48
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,920
When did the head of the department learn to pay the favor?

49
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,920
It's not that you don't care about Miss Chen's words.

50
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:47,920
Ask.

51
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,920
Do you want to avoid money or to pay?

52
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,920
Shao Cheng, I won't be so cruel to you.

53
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,920
Then you have to see the new situation.

54
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,920
I will send the board of directors to the house tomorrow.

55
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,920
To report to Miss Chen.

56
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,920
So many good things.

57
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,920
I have never seen them.

58
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,920
You thought about this kind of thing.

59
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,920
Did you know the truth?

60
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,920
He misunderstood the uncle.

61
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,920
What kind of host do you?

62
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,920
What are you so worried about?

63
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,920
These are old newspapers.

64
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,920
Is this the paper of your accordance?

65
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,920
I got a lot.

66
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,920
You will pay for these things.

67
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,920
Then money yourself.

68
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,920
I'll attach it to you later.

69
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,760
I...

70
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,360
You're risking my life,

71
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,040
maybe not just you,

72
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,100
but everyone needs to commit as is.

73
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,480
You should giveān

74
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:57,980
'.

75
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,320
Don't worry.

76
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,560
I don't care how you make them.

77
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,480
They're only Li Seven,

78
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,160
no matter how many tests you have done.

79
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:18,920
Thezuge

80
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,260
GUORAN

81
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,260
I'll be back.

82
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,260
Read it.

83
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,260
Why not?

84
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,260
My throat hurts.

85
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,260
Tell me the truth.

86
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:57,260
Do you know any good characters?

87
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,260
I don't know any.

88
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,260
You don't know any?

89
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,260
Not really.

90
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:05,260
I can read a few characters.

91
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,260
This one.

92
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:08,260
Cang.

93
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,260
Cang, right?

94
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,260
What?

95
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,260
What?

96
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,260
Yi.

97
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:18,260
Yi.

98
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,260
Yi.

99
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,260
What's that?

100
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,260
What?

101
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,260
What's the name exactly?

102
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,260
Cang, right?

103
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,260
Cang, right.

104
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,260
Many characters

105
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:39,820
You know the true status of being

106
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:48,260
This is unfair, right?

107
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,260
No difference.

108
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,220
You're a good boy.

109
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,220
Zhenya Xia.

110
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,220
Right?

111
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:59,380
It's okay.

112
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,860
Fu used to be Zhenya Xia.

113
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,940
But your mother is here.

114
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,340
Your mother's student

115
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,500
is in the whole county.

116
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,940
It's very famous.

117
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:10,540
Right?

118
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:15,260
Actually, I can't blame her.

119
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:17,220
I don't like reading.

120
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,780
Maybe I'm just following her.

121
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,500
Actually, she's escaped the capital city soon.

122
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,300
She has been left alone from school.

123
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,660
Where are you going to return to?

124
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,060
Calling theCOG.

125
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:28,980
Is there nobody here?

126
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:30,740
Yes.

127
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,820
Everyone around here needs to be alleys.

128
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,660
Feel better.

129
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:39,700
Find A bit of people.

130
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:40,940
See you.

131
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:42,860
See just now,

132
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,700
I can talk a bit to him.

133
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:45,460
He's my leader.

134
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,220
We should find another one.

135
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:49,700
He's found a good group.

136
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,780
Mistress, add theier you need it.

137
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:57,380

138
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,300
M Quéi揚揚揚揚.

139
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,620
Ooooh….

140
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:48,220
Time to do some business.

141
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:52,220
So you don't know if it's right or not?

142
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,220
How can I not know?

143
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,220
You are my daughter.

144
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:02,220
Why can't you meet your parents?

145
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,220
Stop talking nonsense.

146
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:07,220
Other than your little sister, you are older than your mother.

147
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:10,220
We are not responsible for your injury.

148
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:12,220
What's your problem?

149
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,220
Third Mother is here.

150
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:20,220
Third Mother

151
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:30,220
Yang Yang met your grandmother.

152
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,220
My father's mother.

153
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:34,220
My aunt.

154
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:42,220
Why do you come here late?

155
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,220
You don't know how to make a living.

156
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:47,220
So you come late.

157
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,660
His name isn't my dadurch.

158
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:52,060
Yanyang grew up by my side,

159
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:54,140
but sheyond a man's age

160
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,100
is unlucky.

161
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:58,420
I don't like wars

162
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:12,400
or

163
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,800
сл playsк i d s i n.

164
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,760
Because of Uncle,

165
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,200
Uncle and aunt said that a woman

166
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,360
should remember the name of the wolf.

167
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,560
It's useless to learn so much.

168
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,160
You don't have to work like my mother.

169
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,200
You can do anything.

170
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,960
Stop talking nonsense.

171
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,720
You're a fool.

172
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,880
If she doesn't learn well,

173
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,160
she will be sent to the border

174
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,600
with my ungrateful brother

175
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,120
and be punished.

176
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,920
Where… are you?

177
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,000
Help me check.

178
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,800
My son!

179
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,480
Tang Zi, what are you doing sitting?

180
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,440
Look at the directly proportion.

181
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,120
Let's go.

182
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:30,120
Adina, you must take good care of yourself when you arrive at the hospital.

183
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:36,120
Don't do anything stupid, Adina.

184
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:52,120
And your family, don't come here anymore.

185
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,120
The wolf is going to the house to take care of the rules.

186
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,120
It's like a village.

187
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,120
It's like a cat walking around in the house.

188
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:09,120
Don't do anything stupid, Adina.

189
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,120
I said, I promised to take care of the rules.

190
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,120
Ye Ya is talking about who to choose with.

191
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,120
I don't care about you.

192
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,120
I don't care about you.

193
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,120
Zuo Yuen.

194
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,120
Don't be a burden.

195
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:25,120
You will be a burden to your family.

196
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,120
You have to do everything you can.

197
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:32,120
When you are in the world, you will have a good life.

198
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:36,120
I'm sorry, Adina.

199
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:40,120
But you are better than me.

200
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,120
I should be better than you.

201
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:56,120
The good days of the Cheng family are all spent in the wolf's blood.

202
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:59,120
You are the Dong family.

203
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,120
I am the father of the Cheng family.

204
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,120
We are the first family, but the ancestors of the Bans are different.

205
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,120
We know that.

206
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,120
Today, the Cheng family came to send you off.

207
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,120
It's a great atmosphere.

208
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,120
Cheng family.

209
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,120
It's you.

210
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,120
What's wrong?

211
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,120
It's the Cheng family.

212
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,120
I can't tolerate you being here.

213
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,120
Cheng family.

214
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:39,120
I am a little old and stupid.

215
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:44,120
I have no respect for you.

216
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,120
Cheng family.

217
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:49,120
No wonder he is so good.

218
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,120
Good.

219
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,120
What does he mean?

220
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,120
How did he treat me?

221
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:59,120
He told me about it.

222
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,120
He left his little brother behind.

223
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:08,120
I'm afraid he will find a way to get rid of him.

224
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,120
He would have been angry with me.

225
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:13,120
He would have saved the Cheng family's rice.

226
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,120
You...

227
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,120
What are you talking about?

228
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,120
I...

229
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,120
You are so rude.

230
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,120
You are so rude.

231
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,120
You are so rude.

232
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,120
Why are you so rude?

233
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,120
Come here.

234
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,120
Hurry up.

235
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,120
By the way,

236
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,120
you are a little girl.

237
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,120
But you have been a little girl.

238
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,120
We will take care of you.

239
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,120
We will not let you get old.

240
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,120
No.

241
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:48,120
Do you know why I have been so rude to you?

242
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,120
I have been a good girl for the past few years.

243
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,120
I have been a good girl for the past few years.

244
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,120
You are so rude.

245
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,120
What are you doing?

246
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,120
You are so rude.

247
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,120
Hurry up.

248
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,120
I am sorry.

249
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,120
I am sorry.

250
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,120
I am sorry.

251
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,120
You are so rude.

252
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,120
You are so rude.

253
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,120
Who are you?

254
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,120
Hurry up.

255
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,120
You will never leave our family.

256
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,120
You are so rude.

257
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,120
You are so rude.

258
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,120
What are you doing?

259
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,120
Why are you so rude?

260
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,120
I am sorry.

261
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,120
Have you found out the news about Xu Jinzhu?

262
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,120
Master,

263
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,120
our people have been in his house for several days.

264
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,120
He has not returned home.

265
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,120
He is not well.

266
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,120
He has no family.

267
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,120
He is still alive.

268
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,120
I ask you.

269
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,120
If you want to avoid people,

270
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,120
where will you choose?

271
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,120
Of course, it is my most familiar.

272
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,120
Other people can not guess.

273
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,120
That's right.

274
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,120
When the wind is in danger,

275
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,120
people will choose to be alone.

276
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,120
That's why we should avoid

277
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,120
the situation of the old lady and Chen

278
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,120
when we are together.

279
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,120
Xu Jinzhu has no family.

280
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,120
He is living in the same house.

281
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,120
So he is the most familiar person

282
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,120
among the officials here.

283
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,120
Except for the property,

284
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,120
he is the boss.

285
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,120
I will find out the truth.

286
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,120
I will find out the truth.

287
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,120
Yes.

288
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:58,340
The

289
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,400
Excuse me, sir?

290
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:02,680
Why are you saying this in place of top

291
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,740
of trot music?

292
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:05,620
She said that unlike the old box box

293
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:07,460
or Вот열しょ noon to g mosquito

294
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,840
you money would already be pancakes

295
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,120
The god should come to you

296
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,160
on the people in my mind

297
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,880
How can someone like ABOUT

298
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,260
his songy

299
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,880
only to give him

300
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:26,800
Grandma, panda was here last few days to go back to the capital.

301
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,240
But now he would live in Zhengdan.

302
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,560
It has been 11 years since he was born.

303
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:37,840
I wonder if we can2017

304
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,360
celebrate the North Sea.

305
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,880
Many years, you brothers

306
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,120
she was cleaned and washed.

307
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,800
I still love her, but I didn't even smile.

308
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,640
They can't go back.

309
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,020
Jiongov,

310
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,900
in the husband's absence until after the effection of a gathering

311
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,180
between the villagers,

312
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,960
Young Master and Ruohuu

313
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,500
were brought to an leftover home by Yeng and curio.

314
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,800
My family

315
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,080
just supports them.

316
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,600
That's right,

317
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,080
you should tidy up and store A house for your wife.

318
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:13,580
It's been such a long time since we've seen a married couple

319
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,520
Jiongov,

320
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,880
after some time,

321
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,640
how could we have found so many houses?

322
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,640
Oh, right.

323
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,800
Didn't you say you wanted to give her a study room?

324
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,760
I think she's useless.

325
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,000
Why don't you

326
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,640
give those two houses to the housekeeper?

327
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,800
Miss,

328
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,400
you don't want to give the house to the brother, right?

329
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,120
But mom said

330
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,080
I can't study every day.

331
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,400
What should I do?

332
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,920
It's not a study room.

333
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,360
It's just a emergency.

334
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,960
You're right.

335
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,760
If you really want to study,

336
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:49,360
even a horse can be a grasshopper.

337
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,800
Your Highness,

338
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,480
didn't you ask you to study in the house every day?

339
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,760
Why didn't you go?

340
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,160

and don't eat and sleep.

343
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,440
Even if the husband doesn't object,

344
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,560
I'll let the person take the study room tomorrow.

345
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,080
I'm a two-bedroom grandson.

346
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,600
How can I sleep in the study room?

347
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,200
You don't have a son anyway.

348
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,720
There are not many people in the second room.

349
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,720
Why don't you

350
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,240
take the master out and change the room?

351
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,320
No.

352
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,040
I don't know what's going on.

353
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,280
Well...

354
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,320
The master is just looking at the Shanghai.

355
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,600
He's a master of the master's and the master of the master's.

356
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,840
He's so impolite.

357
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,560
You should get rid of him.

358
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,160
How can you be so brave

359
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,800

I can't even keep my house!

I'll burn the house!

Be careful!

380
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,160
Are you okay?

381
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,160
I'm okay.

382
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,160
I'll do it!

383
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,160
The master should have a good salary.

384
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,160
But my brother has been fighting for years.

385
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,160
The master is with us.

386
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,160
Now we have to return it.

387
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,160
It's also our duty.

388
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,160
Let go of me!

389
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,160
It's been a while.

390
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:14,160
Do you remember the ten sentences of the first nine pages?

391
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,160
Mother,

392
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,160
I'm hungry.

393
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,160
I didn't study hard.

394
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,160
Mother feels hungry.

395
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,160
Her brain is more clear.

396
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:35,160
It's not too late to study.

397
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,160
Come on, my dear.

398
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,160
Have some food.

399
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,160
Come on, my dear.

400
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,160
Have some food.

401
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,160
Eat.

402
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,160
I have to prepare five more meals every meal.

403
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,160
Madam,

404
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,160
you've suffered so much before.

405
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,160
Do you think you're too strict with me?

406
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:58,160
If you think I'm too strict with you,

407
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,160
I don't want to do this.

408
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,160
You can teach me later.

409
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,160
You're right.

410
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,160
I'm a good teacher.

411
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,160
I'm a good teacher.

412
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,160
I'm a good teacher.

413
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,160
I'm a good teacher.

414
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,160
I'm a good teacher.

415
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,160
I'm sorry.

416
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,160
Take the order.

417
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,160
Uncle Xu is a good teacher.

418
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,160
If you want to be a good teacher,

419
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,160
you should teach us some good things.

420
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,160
If you can't do it,

421
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,160
I won't be a woman.

422
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:47,160
I've been a woman for twenty-one years.

423
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:52,160
I've never been a woman before your mother.

424
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,160
I wanted to be a woman,

425
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:57,160
but then I got a false name.

426
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,160
Now,

427
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,160
I'm not a woman anymore.

428
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,160
You're not a woman anymore.

429
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:05,160
You're not a woman anymore.

430
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,160
You're too strict with me.

431
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,160
Actually,

432
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,160
I'm a good teacher.

433
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,160
I'm a good teacher.

434
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,160
Please shut up.

435
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,160
I don't know

436
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,160
how many times I've told you

437
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,160
to give him a little bit of advice.

438
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:25,160
That's why I'm not a woman anymore.

439
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,160
I'm a woman.

440
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,160
I'm not a woman anymore.

441
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:35,160
Look at your parents.

442
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:39,160
They're all mad.

443
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,160
Why do you call me

444
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,160
a father and a daughter?

445
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,160
I'm a woman.

446
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,160
I'm a woman.

447
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,160
I'm a woman.

448
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,160
If I didn't listen to Uncle's mother,

449
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,160
he wouldn't let me eat.

450
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,160
When I was hungry,

451
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,160
he would listen to me.

452
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,160
I didn't think

453
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,160
that now I'm a woman

454
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,160
and I'm a woman.

455
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,160
Then you don't like studying.

456
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,160
What do you want to do?

457
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,160
I want to know

458
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,160
why the building is so high.

459
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,160
Why is the car so far away?

460
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,160
Why is the floor so heavy?

461
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,160
I want to see

462
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,160
what the world looks like.

463
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,160
These sacred principles

464
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,160
have made me see the world.

465
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,160
I'm not late to study.

466
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,160
You're obviously lazy to play.

467
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,160
You're so cunning.

468
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,160
You don't want to learn the sacred principles.

469
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,160
You're so rude.

470
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,160
You don't want to listen to people.

471
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,160
You're so rude.

472
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,160
Do you think I don't like you?

473
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,160
You're a good father.

474
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,160
You're a good father.

475
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,160
You're a good mother.

476
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,160
You're a good uncle.

477
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,160
I don't like

478
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,160
the way they behave these years.

479
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,160
You're a good thing

480
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,160
for the city.

481
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,160
You're so young.

482
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,160
You're a man of the world.

483
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,160
You're a man of the world.

484
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,160
You're a man of the world.

485
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,160
You're so smart.

486
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,160
If you don't teach him well,

487
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,160
he'll do great things

488
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,160
to make his family happy.

489
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,160
Give me a book.

490
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,160
Don't you want to be bullied?

491
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,160
Do you want to be bullied?

492
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,160
If I were a man,

493
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,160
I'd be bullied in the mud.

494
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,160
Do you want me to learn from you

495
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,160
and be ashamed?

496
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,160
I've been a man for over ten years.

497
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,160
I don't even want to be a hero.

498
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,160
I don't want to be a hero.

499
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:11,160
No.

500
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,160
With my temper,

501
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,160
I'll have to accept my uncle

502
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,160
and be a hero.

503
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,160
Uncle,

504
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,160
you should go to bed.

505
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,160
Will you marry me?

506
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,160
Why are you here?

507
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,160
I just wanted to look at

508
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,160
the house I live in.

509
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,460
You know,

510
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:59,440
even if your parents have graduated,

511
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,940
no one will ever sit outside

512
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:03,260
to laugh at youup deciding whether you'rezes.

513
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:06,160
Do you know

514
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,160
If I don't see your mother,

515
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,160
will you really stand there

516
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,160
and beg for your help?

517
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,160
Uncle,

518
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,160
it seems that you know

519
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,160
a lot of things about my mother.

520
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,160
Yes.

521
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,160
I'm trying to send people to follow you.

522
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,160
I just want to see

523
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:27,160
how much you can have

524
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:30,160
after your mother reunites.

525
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,160
It seems that

526
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,160
your mother's love

527
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,160
is not that bad.

528
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,160
Since Uncle Er has seen it,

529
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,160
I don't have to keep it secret.

530
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,160
Uncle Er wants to stay in the house.

531
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,160
What bad idea are you making?

532
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,160
Where did you get this?

533
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,160
My mother came back from the battlefield.

534
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,160
If you were to meet her,

535
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,160
how could you meet her?

536
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,160
But if you were to

537
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:05,160
convince the mother of your son,

538
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,160
no one would say

539
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,160
that there will be a son of the mother of the son.

540
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,160
Fourth Madam,

541
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,160
you need to remind me of this.

542
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,160
You are so kind.

543
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,160
You are standing on my head

544
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,160
and doing this to me.

545
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,160
You are here to make fun of me, aren't you?

546
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,160
I have nothing to make fun of you.

547
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,160
You have seen it too.

548
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,160
As long as my mother doesn't pass away,

549
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,160
I will pass away.

550
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,160
Second Madam, it's late.

551
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,160
Your Highness is going back to the room.

552
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,160
You should rest early.

553
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,160
You know it.

554
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,160
I know it.

555
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,160
Rest little bitch.

556
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,160
It's not time either

557
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:27,080
You know, how many people with their smart ways

558
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,840
understand

559
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,440
people and understand bad people.

560
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,340
But you don't disappoint yourrit,

561
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,280
who works best for you and your children.

562
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,320
But you've failing youricia teachers

563
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,160
who understand nearly everything of your Saidnaya civilization.

564
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,360
And enterprise workers.

565
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,120
At least they have to be changed!

566
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:51,240
Try to connectors how they can't laugh him away!

567
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:55,240
Alexey, we were主婦 and didn't go anywhere.

568
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:00,120
The imperial Nat FM, the farmhouse,

569
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,920
didn't work for you.

570
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,920
I didn't want toanced Counselor andgency.

571
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,880
Saakau International Company,

572
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:12,720
ade his cooperation with us.

573
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:15,840
They can only offer you emergency services.

574
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,520
Impossible.

575
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,520
You don't want to move the house.

576
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,520
Don't you want to make the outsiders laugh at us?

577
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,520
Don't you have any rules?

578
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,520
I'm not willing to move.

579
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,520
I asked the God.

580
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:32,520
The God said that the house is powerful and safe.

581
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,520
When the four of you live in the house,

582
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:37,520
the four of you will not be forgotten.

583
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,520
But you have three children.

584
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:43,520
You haven't seen them for years.

585
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:51,520
Yes.

586
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,520
I ask myself,

587
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,520
it's better for the four of you to be raised.

588
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,520
I beg you to pity him

589
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:01,520
on the face of Erlang.

590
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:06,520
When you are old, you have no children.

591
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,520
This is a joke.

592
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,520
If you are too young,

593
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:14,520
you will be disappointed.

594
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:17,520
We are the ones who are suffering.

595
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:23,520
You still want to be stubborn and not be a fool?

596
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,520
What's the point of being so confident?

597
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,520
There are only three children in Erlang's house.

598
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,520
I'm not too young.

599
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:33,520
The God doesn't have to be so sure.

600
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,520
If it weren't for the family,

601
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,520
I wouldn't have left the bird.

602
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,520
It's been so many years.

603
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,520
No one is to blame.

604
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:43,520
The God said that it's not right.

605
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:47,520
My health is back to God.

606
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,520
Yes.

607
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:51,520
I think God is right.

608
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:54,520
Since the house is forgotten,

609
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:59,520
then Erlang should stay in the house.

610
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:00,520
Yes.

611
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,520
Jungu,

612
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:06,520
if the father doesn't give birth to a son,

613
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,520
he can stay for a day.

614
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,520
Yes.

615
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:12,520
The child is great.

616
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:15,520
Jungu, I'm here to talk about this.

617
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:18,520
If I can't bring Erlang to my house for a day,

618
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,520
I won't move.

619
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,520
Father,

620
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:49,520
who is the one who can take care of Jungu?

621
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,520
The God is great.

622
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,520
The child is great.

623
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:55,520
Then he will go on to destroy the house.

624
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,520
He will stay in the backyard.

625
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:59,520
Don't regret it.

626
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:03,520
I've heard that you are a good boy.

627
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:06,520
You really made me see you today.

628
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,520
We are women.

629
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:10,520
We still have to be weak.

630
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,520
If you didn't force her,

631
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:15,520
how could she come to my house

632
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:18,520
and fight for the house?

633
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,520
What does it have to do with you?

634
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:24,520
You are so selfish.

635
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:28,520
You are the one who can't be a good boy.

636
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,520
You should let her go.

637
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:33,520
I think that a girl can't be a good boy.

638
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,520
She can't be too strong.

639
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,520
She has to be talented.

640
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:40,520
She can learn from the good and the bad.

641
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,520
She can be a good girl.

642
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,520
She can teach her parents.

643
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,520
Of course.

644
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:49,520
I am not the one who can be a good girl.

645
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,520
I can't be a good girl.

646
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,520
I can be a good girl.

647
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,520
I can be a good girl.

648
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,520
I can be a good girl.

649
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,520
Have information on this worcее that蘿蔔.

650
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,520
Can you remember?

651
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,520
I'm sure that what you said is not sustainable at all.

652
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,520
By comparison with people with ök altre,

653
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:19,520
a person who practically can defend himself

654
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,520
by remembering his death.

655
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:29,520
I will have a grandpa with me.

656
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:35,520
How did it happen?

657
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,000
What's the ...

658
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,120
That's what.

659
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:42,700
Yes, yes.

660
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,120
Catch you later.

661
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,120
How hard!

662
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:48,660
Exactly, I hit you where I was trying toор.

663
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,440
Brothers!

664
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:55,940
I gottiIf my foolishness my stupid dehydration is constant

665
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:59,240
and I think you should mind your own business.

666
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,340
See?

667
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:05,340
Go on.

668
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:06,340
Yes.

669
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:14,340
You asked for uncle's mother last night.

670
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:17,340
How did he stay in the house?

671
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:24,340
I want to move to a new house.

672
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:27,340
Don't let him stay in the house.

673
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:32,340
How do you know that we're moving to a new house?

674
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,340
I don't know.

675
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:40,340
Uncle's mother is in the house.

676
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:42,340
Mother is not against it.

677
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:46,340
Mother's temperament is not easy to compromise.

678
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:50,340
I guess it's useless for mother to stand by her side.

679
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:52,340
That's why she doesn't want it.

680
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:56,340
Besides, father came back with uncle Wan to the court.

681
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:58,340
The court is full of rewards.

682
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:02,340
It's almost the same as the last days.

683
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:08,340
I don't care if it's from the past or now.

684
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:10,340
We're all elders.

685
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:12,340
You don't need to interfere.

686
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:15,340
I'm not the only one who has grudge with her.

687
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,340
They bully me and insult me.

688
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:21,340
I'm just a child.

689
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:23,340
I'm just a child.

690
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:25,340
I can't stand it.

691
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:27,340
I'm not at home with your father.

692
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:29,340
I haven't taught you.

693
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:31,340
I'm just a child.

694
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:33,340
I raised you up to be a child.

695
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:35,340
It's my parents' responsibility.

696
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:37,340
You were a good doctor before.

697
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:39,340
You can tell your parents.

698
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:41,340
I can do anything for you.

699
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:43,340
But this is the last time.

700
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:45,340
If there's another time, I won't forgive you.

701
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:47,340
You have to be a good person.

702
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:50,340
Take it.

703
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:55,340
Take it.

704
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:04,340
There's another one.

705
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:10,340
Read it carefully.

706
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:17,340
Good for you.

707
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:22,340
Good for you.

708
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:31,200
Y

709
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:56,460
Grand Chamberlain Guan N Ben halia Xu Ling

I wish you all the best

713

You are welcome

714
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:18,720
Can Xu Ling Ho be with you?

715
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:21,300
The Be Stampeded

716
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:32,360

chili

719
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:44,020
The general is crazy.

720
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:48,020
The wedding is a great one.

721
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:51,020
My dear, it's not just that.

722
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:56,020
I heard that the emperor has a lot of money.

723
00:38:57,020 --> 00:39:01,020
Brother, we are happy for you.

724
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:05,020
I heard the news and I am not going back.

725
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:06,020
It's getting cold.

726
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:08,020
The emperor is worried about you.

727
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:12,020
You are right.

728
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:16,020
Erlang, Erlang.

729
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:19,020
If you have a big wolf and a half wolf,

730
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:22,020
I can close my eyes to see your father.

731
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:26,020
Mother, we three brothers are worried about this family.

732
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:29,020
The biggest merit is the second brother.

733
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:31,020
How can you say that he is not a father?

734
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:34,020
Second brother, you like reading the most.

735
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:37,020
This time the emperor has a lot of books.

736
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:40,020
Go and pick one. Do you like it?

737
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:42,020
Thank you, brother.

738
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:45,020
Erlang, you are the second brother.

739
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:47,020
You are the one who brought you here.

740
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:49,020
You are the one who sent him to the uncle.

741
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:53,020
Second brother, you are the one who brought you here.

742
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:59,020
Do you have any more money to give to mother?

743
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:01,020
Of course, I can't give it to mother.

744
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:03,020
The money is soft.

745
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:05,020
I give it to mother.

746
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:15,020
Erlang, tell me what you have given to mother.

747
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:17,020
You are so mean.

748
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:20,020
These treasures are not only for me,

749
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:23,020
but even for the people who have heard of them.

750
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:29,020
I have never seen them.

751
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:31,020
Don't say that.

752
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:35,020
Take me to see them.

753
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:38,020
What is this?

754
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:44,020
I heard that there is a big house for General Wan.

755
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:46,020
Yes.

756
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:49,020
Yes, but Wan said

757
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:52,020
that the house will be ours.

758
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:57,020
Mother, you can live in the house of the current wife.

759
00:40:57,020 --> 00:41:00,020
You can live in the house of the former general.

760
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:05,020
I was happy to live in the house of the former general.

761
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:09,020
I didn't expect that we would live in the house of the former general.

762
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:12,020
You don't need to go to the house of the former general.

763
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:15,020
You said that you can't give birth to a big house.

764
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:18,020
You live in the house of the former general.

765
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:20,020
Since you live in the house of the former general,

766
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:23,020
you have to live well.

767
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:25,020
You live to death.

768
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:28,020
Don't worry, no one loves you.

769
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:31,020
The former general also lives in the house of the former general.

770
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:35,020
He will never love you.

771
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:39,020
Jungu! Jungu, you have to be the master for me.

772
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:42,020
What master?

773
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:45,020
You are the one who asked for it.

774
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:49,020
The former general has done it for you.

775
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:53,020
Don't forget that you have tried to be the former general.

776
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:55,020
Yes, Jungu.

777
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:58,020
Yes, yes, yes.

778
00:41:58,020 --> 00:42:00,020
Yes, yes, yes.

779
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:03,020
Go and see the baby.

780
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:06,020
Go, brother, I'll show you.

781
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:09,020
Brother, thank you.

782
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:12,020
See what kind of baby you like.

783
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:15,020
What kind of baby do you like?

784
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:17,020
Let's go together.

785
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:19,020
Let's go.

786
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:27,020
What kind of baby is this?

787
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:55,020
I'm not sure.

788
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:57,020
