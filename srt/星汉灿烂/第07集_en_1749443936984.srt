00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,860
Congratulations on your first day of marriage!

10
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,860
Congratulations!

11
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,860
Man, you're so lucky!

12
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,860
Today is a great day!

13
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,860
By the way,

14
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,860
in a few days,

15
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,860
the family will have a big birthday banquet.

16
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,860
You'll all be here.

17
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,860
I'm so happy to celebrate my birthday.

18
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,860
I'm not going to visit you.

19
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,860
Why are you so excited?

20
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,860
He was planning to come.

21
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,860
But my mother-in-law is at home.

22
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,860
He's blaming himself.

23
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,860
The day before yesterday,

24
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,860
he went out to run a horse.

25
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,860
He was so excited.

26
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,860
By the way,

27
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:37,860
where's your daughter?

28
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,860
Let me see.

29
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,860
Yang, come and see Uncle Wan.

30
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,860
Come on.

31
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,860
Uncle Wan, take care.

32
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,860
Okay.

33
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,860
Okay.

34
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,860
I thought you complimented your daughter

35
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,860
and that you had a little girl.

36
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,860
I didn't expect that.

37
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,860
You really have a good daughter.

38
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,860
Oh, right.

39
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,860
Take this, my lady.

40
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,860
This is the gift from Uncle Wan.

41
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,860
Take it.

42
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,860
Thank you, Uncle Wan.

43
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,860
No need.

44
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,860
It's just a child.

45
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,860
It's not too expensive.

46
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,860
It's not expensive.

47
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,860
It's a good thing that you're worthy of our daughter.

48
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:23,860
My lady,

49
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,860
I'll take care of it.

50
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,860
If you have any grievances,

51
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,860
I'll take care of them.

52
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,860
Especially

53
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,860
the grievances of your mother.

54
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,860
I'll do it.

55
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,860
My lady,

56
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,860
stop talking about it.

57
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,860
Go to the grave to pray.

58
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,860
Take these things.

59
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,860
Why don't you follow the rules?

60
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,860
Father,

61
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:53,860
it's too much.

62
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:55,860
You're the one who's talking about the rules.

63
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,860
You're the one who's talking about the rules.

64
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,860
If you do anything,

65
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,860
you'll have to take the rules.

66
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,860
How boring is that?

67
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,860
Who said that?

68
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,860
I'm not like the old man

69
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,860
who goes out now.

70
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,860
Thanks to my aunt Yan.

71
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,860
The original owner is Mr. Yuan.

72
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,860
Mr. Yuan,

73
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,860
please.

74
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,860
The traffic is far away from my house.

75
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,860
When did you come here?

76
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,860
General,

77
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,860
I didn't invite Yuan.

78
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,860
General, you're not old.

79
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,860
I'm not too old.

80
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,860
I heard that Yuan

81
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,860
is like a fox.

82
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,860
What bad ideas

83
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,860
do you have?

84
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:41,860
I dare not

85
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,860
to fight against you.

86
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,860
Mr. Yuan,

87
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,860
my father is a teacher

88
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,860
in the house of Mr. Qu Ling.

89
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:53,860
My father said that he always praised

90
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,860
my little brother.

91
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,860
I've been looking after him.

92
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,860
I heard that he's a good man

93
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,860
so I came here.

94
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,860
But

95
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,860
my eldest son is not at home.

96
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,860
I'm just kidding.

97
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,860
I thought that if I could see

98
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,860
his talent,

99
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:13,860
I would be the one to see him.

100
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,860
Mr. Shan Jian, please.

101
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,860
I didn't expect

102
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,860
that my eldest son

103
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,860
would be so good.

104
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,860
Brother Guan,

105
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,860
please come in.

106
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,860
Hello,

107
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,860
I'm here.

108
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,860
My father sent me yesterday.

109
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,860
I'm here.

110
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,860
Please.

111
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,860
Mr. Liu.

112
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,860
Hello,

113
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,860
I'm here.

114
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,860
What a nice name.

115
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,860
You're so polite.

116
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,860
We're going to the tavern.

117
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,860
Mr. Song, Mr. Li.

118
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,860
Mr. Li, Mr. Li.

119
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,860
Mr. Li, Mr. Li.

120
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,860
He's a genius.

121
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,860
Come with me.

122
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,860
Come on.

123
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,860
Come here.

124
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,860
Come here.

125
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,860
Come on.

126
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,860
Come here.

127
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,860
Mr. Cheng, Mr. Li.

128
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,860
You even have a good wife.

129
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,860
You're a good wife.

130
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,860
You're the one who has seen

131
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,860
my young master.

132
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,860
That's so tender.

133
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,860
Although the appearance

134
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,860
hasn't changed much,

135
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,860
it's not like

136
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,860
I'm 18 years old.

137
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,860
I'm not 18 years old.

138
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,860
I'm not 18 years old.

139
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,860
You're so nice.

140
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,860
You're so nice.

141
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,860
You've got two years of experience.

142
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,860
Why don't you trust him?

143
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,860
You're so embarrassing.

144
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,860
How can I do that?

145
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,860
I'll do it.

146
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:17,860
OK.

147
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,860
Mr. Cheng.

148
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,860
This is General Che Xi,

149
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,860
the daughter of the royal family.

150
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,860
She's the mother of the Emperor and the daughter of the Empress.

151
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,860
She's also here with us

152
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:47,860
to celebrate the wedding.

153
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,860
I don't want to come.

154
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,860
My husband and General Cheng are far away.

155
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,860
They're not coming to celebrate.

156
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,860
OK.

157
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,860
I'm going to be the wife

158
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,860
of these old women.

159
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,860
Hurry up.

160
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,860
Please take your bags.

161
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,860
Yes.

162
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,860
Please.

163
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,860
The wife of General Che Xi.

164
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,860
She's really a good wife.

165
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,860
She's really a good wife.

166
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:31,860
Yes.

167
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,860
I heard that

168
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,860
she's too rude to her.

169
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:37,860
Her parents

170
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,860
kept her in the room.

171
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,860
They even took her out.

172
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,860
But it's not like

173
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,860
she's a good wife.

174
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,860
She's a good wife.

175
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,860
She's a good wife.

176
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,860
She's a good wife.

177
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,860
But it's not like that.

178
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,860
She has parents now.

179
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,860
She won't meet us again.

180
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,860
You can sit here for me.

181
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:01,860
I have nothing to do with it.

182
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,860
But some people

183
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,860
are shy.

184
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,860
I don't know who's more rude.

185
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,860
My sister

186
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:11,860
raised me in the name of my mother.

187
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,860
My mother taught me well.

188
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,860
No wonder she's a good wife.

189
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,860
Didn't you say that Mr. Shan Jian

190
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,860
is here today?

191
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,860
Why didn't you see him?

192
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:29,860
Mr. Wang also came to see Mr. Shan Jian.

193
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,860
What else?

194
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,860
I'm just bored of coming here.

195
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,860
I heard that the Cheng family is lively

196
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:37,860
and I'm over the bridge.

197
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,860
Mr. Shan Jian is here.

198
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,860
Look. Mr. Shan Jian is here.

199
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,860
Mr. Shan Jian.

200
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,860
I'm Yuan Shen from Jiao Dong.

201
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,860
I'm here to ask you about your wife.

202
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,860
Oh, okay.

203
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,860
Okay.

204
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,860
This lady.

205
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,860
I'm sorry.

206
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,860
I'm sorry.

207
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:13,860
In the name of Jiao Dong

208
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,860
in the name of the lord of the world

209
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,860
the emperor's majesty

210
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,860
and the emperor's love

211
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,860
are in the hands of your own laws.

212
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,860
I'm sorry.

213
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,860
I'm sorry.

214
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,860
I'm sorry.

215
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,860
I'm sorry.

216
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,860
I'm sorry.

217
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,860
I'm sorry.

218
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,860
I'm sorry.

219
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,860
I'm sorry.

220
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,860
I'm sorry.

221
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,860
Why did you come out?

222
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:44,860
Come on, put on your hat. Don't move.

223
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:48,860
I'd rather die than sit with them.

224
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:51,860
These people are so arrogant.

225
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,860
I can't fight with them.

226
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,860
Come out and say something.

227
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:58,860
Why did you have to see them?

228
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:01,860
Have you seen them before?

229
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,860
You just came here to see a handsome man.

230
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,860
I don't care about him.

231
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:08,860
I'll go and get some rest.

232
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,860
Don't bother me anymore.

233
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,860
You're not here to see a handsome man?

234
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,860
You?

235
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,860
What?

236
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:44,860
You're not welcome here?

237
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:54,860
You're not welcome here?

238
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:57,860
I'm not welcome here.

239
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:00,860
I'm just here to see a handsome man.

240
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,860
I'm not welcome here.

241
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,860
You're all here to see a handsome man.

242
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,860
You can go together.

243
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,860
But I'm here to see a handsome man.

244
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,860
I'm here to see a handsome man.

245
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,860
I'm just here to see a handsome man.

246
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,860
You're not welcome here.

247
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,860
Why did you come here?

248
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,860
You're a receptionist in the city.

249
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,860
Why are you here?

250
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,620
dishes with three sweet Uncle

251
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:35,980
of the world and in memory?

252
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:39,100
Appearances of Art gave me

253
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,260
different collaborators.

254
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,100
Secondations don't Chanon,

255
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:46,100
Master sent me to bring me

256
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,940
Whoo...

257
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:49,860
Good!

258
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:50,700
They are both good people.

259
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,540
I order just to bring

260
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:54,500
language three uncle of court and master.

261
00:12:58,460 --> 00:12:59,140
Master asked me to

262
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:01,300
speak to you

263
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,300
Why do you have to make such a big circle?

264
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:07,300
Some of them are not made for outsiders.

265
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:11,300
They are just to make Mr. Niu a burden.

266
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:16,300
It's not a big deal. It's a small deal.

267
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,300
Tell me.

268
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,300
You'll agree to this soon?

269
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,300
Mr. Niu wants to talk to his parents.

270
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,300
Just tell them.

271
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,300
Mr. Niu only wants to tell them that

272
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:35,300
Feng Xiyan is a man who is eager to marry a man.

273
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:41,300
He is a man who is eager to marry a man.

274
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:53,300
I beg you, but Feng Xiyan is a man who is eager to marry a man.

275
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:01,300
Do you have any difficulties?

276
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,300
I don't understand.

277
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:07,300
I didn't understand what Mr. Yuan said.

278
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:10,300
Can you remove those messy things?

279
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:13,300
It's not messy. It's called a burden.

280
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,300
Then remove those messy things.

281
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,300
Just say one word.

282
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,300
I'll remember it.

283
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,300
Okay.

284
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,300
Okay.

285
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:30,300
Mr. Niu is a man who is eager to marry a man.

286
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,300
I know.

287
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,300
He must not remember it.

288
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,300
I'll remember it.

289
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:07,300
After I left, they were there to take me away.

290
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,300
No.

291
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,300
Mr. Yuan came.

292
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,300
They are now trying to surprise us.

293
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,300
Look.

294
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:18,300
Who invited Yuan Shanjian?

295
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,300
Who invited him?

296
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:22,300
How did he and Yuan Shanjian get in touch?

297
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,300
I heard from Mr. Yuan that

298
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:27,300
the father of the eldest brother and his father

299
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,300
were in the same family.

300
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,300
It's a long story.

301
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,300
Besides, my brother is not at home.

302
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,300
Why is he in a relationship with my family?

303
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,300
He is really a man who is eager to marry a man.

304
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:43,300
At this moment, he can't be like this.

305
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,300
Mr. Yuan,

306
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:50,300
do you think he is a good man?

307
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,300
I...

308
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,300
I've never talked to Mr. Yuan.

309
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,300
I know it's bad.

310
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,300
If you talk to him,

311
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,300
you'll know his temperament.

312
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,300
But he is just a man who is eager to marry a man.

313
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,300
It's a big deal.

314
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,300
Tell me.

315
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,300
Mr. Yuan,

316
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,300
I'd like to ask you a question.

317
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,300
Have you ever heard of a man like this?

318
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,300
Father.

319
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:24,300
He was born in the city of the south.

320
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,300
What? The palace of the city?

321
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,300
The south?

322
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,300
What?

323
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,300
What?

324
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:34,300
The world is just a dream.

325
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,300
What is it?

326
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,300
Is it the name of the husband of Sima?

327
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,300
Is it common?

328
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,300
Maybe.

329
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,300
Is this father famous?

330
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,300
It's not that famous.

331
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,300
But the world loves him so much.

332
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,300
He is not a man of the city.

333
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,300
So he often plays with the girls in the palace.

334
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,300
Mother,

335
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,300
I'll teach you some lessons.

336
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,300
You know it better than others.

337
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,300
No need.

338
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,300
I think I'm good now.

339
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,300
No need to teach.

340
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,300
You are good.

341
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,300
The girl is here.

342
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,300
The girl is here.

343
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,300
The girl is here.

344
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,300
The girl is here.

345
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,300
The girl is here.

346
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,300
The man on the ground is the girl.

347
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,300
Is he your lover or mine?

348
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,300
Of course he is.

349
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,300
He is the man of the city.

350
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,300
If he wasn't the man of the city,

351
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,300
we wouldn't let him go with the girl

352
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,300
to the royal family.

353
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:02,300
What about the girl?

354
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,300
Where did you come from?

355
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,300
General Huizheng.

356
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:28,300
I was the one who bought the goods.

357
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,300
I have some guests here.

358
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:33,300
They are waiting for the culprit to come to the lamphouse.

359
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,300
Go.

360
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,300
I've checked.

361
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:44,300
The lamphouse is different from the one you have.

362
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,300
It's a big problem.

363
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,300
We can't leave the lamphouse like this.

364
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,300
We have to wait for it.

365
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:54,300
We have to go back to the school.

366
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:57,300
It proves that we didn't find the wrong person.

367
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,300
Did you find out the clue

368
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,300
to the joke of the deceased?

369
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,300
The young man didn't find out.

370
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,300
He was a young man.

371
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,300
He was a man of the city.

372
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:10,300
He had a hard time.

373
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,300
But he was a man of the city.

374
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,300
He was a man of the city.

375
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,300
He had a lot of products.

376
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:19,300
He had some shops in the city.

377
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:22,300
But he didn't make the food for the business.

378
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:25,300
He wanted to sell the shop.

379
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:28,300
But he didn't sell the shop.

380
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,300
He had some money.

381
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,300
He opened some shops.

382
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:35,300
He had been in the shop for half a year.

383
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,300
The deceased was out of business for half a year.

384
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,300
They said they didn't care.

385
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,300
No one believed them.

386
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:44,300
They asked the deceased to find the trouble.

387
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,300
They must have broken their business.

388
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:50,300
The deceased can't bear to see the poor.

389
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:53,300
He will make a move again.

390
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,300
Once he finds out,

391
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:59,300
we will find the man behind the back of the car.

392
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,300
Isn't that the car of the city?

393
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,300
Young Master, sorry.

394
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,300
Dr. Chun went to the mansion.

395
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,300
Let's go back.

396
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,300
Young Master, we are here.

397
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,300
Let's go back.

398
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,300
Let's go back.

399
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,300
Let's go back.

400
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,300
Let's go back.

401
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,300
Let's go back.

402
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,300
Let's go back.

403
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,300
Let's go back.

404
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,300
Let's go back.

405
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:06,300
Young Master, you've been here for a long time.

406
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:11,300
Are you from the mansion of General Cheng?

407
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,300
Yes.

408
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:14,300
My master is far away from here.

409
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,300
He wants to go to some new places.

410
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,300
Please follow me.

411
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,300
Young Master Yuan,

412
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,300
it's cold outside.

413
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:24,300
Why don't you go inside?

414
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,300
No need.

415
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,300
Young Master Yuan,

416
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,300
I haven't seen you for a long time.

417
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,300
My brother is even a good boy.

418
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:38,300
When did you sing in the city?

419
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,300
I think you are mistaken.

420
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:43,300
Feng Xu Yan is a man of the city.

421
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,300
He is a man of the city.

422
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,300
He is a man of the city.

423
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,300
He said that he would care about

424
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,300
father and not the teacher next time.

425
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,300
Okay.

426
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,300
Father.

427
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:00,300
Father.

428
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,300
The scenery is good today.

429
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,300
I'm here for nothing.

430
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:07,300
I want to talk to people about the teacher's singing.

431
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:10,300
I don't know if you have time.

432
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,300
I don't want to talk.

433
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:20,300
Where is the teacher's singing?

434
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:23,300
Where's the teacher singing?

435
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,300
Go inside and take a look.

436
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:29,300
Wait for the teacher to open the door for you.

437
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:32,300
Wait for the teacher to open the door.

438
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,300
Hey!

439
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,300
You messed it up!

440
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,300
Do you want to get out?

441
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:45,300
Everybody is acting for government.

442
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,500
I'm not going to tell you.

443
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,300
You don't have to forget.

444
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:52,100
Do you know the reason why you can't find the right to speak?

445
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:52,700
No.

446
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:54,820
That's right.

447
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:55,700
I've made a promise.

448
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:56,900
What can I do?

449
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,900
I don't have a horse and no four-piece horse.

450
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,900
The world is

451
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,500
not about begging,

452
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,500
forcing,

453
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,900
using these three elements.

454
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:08,100
Since you don't want to talk,

455
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,900
I have another way.

456
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,300
All right.

457
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:18,900
Don't worry.

458
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,300
I can't take you in.

459
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,300
I have a reputation.

460
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,500
If you're willing to tell me,

461
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,500
I'll do anything for you

462
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,900
as a reward.

463
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,100
Anything is fine.

464
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,900
You're a rebel.

465
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,500
You're a traitor.

466
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,700
You can't marry these three elements.

467
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:39,900
You can't marry them.

468
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:42,300
When did I say

469
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,500
I wanted you to marry me?

470
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,900
When did I say

471
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,300
I wanted to marry you?

472
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,900
You never wanted to marry me.

473
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,300
You really want to marry me?

474
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,100
You're not a traitor.

475
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,700
You just want to be with me

476
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,500
and come to see me.

477
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:00,700
If you really don't want to have any relationship with me,

478
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,100
why don't you tell me

479
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,900
that you and I are not a couple?

480
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,300
From now on,

481
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,500
we'll be friends.

482
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,100
Good point.

483
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,500
Mr. Yuan,

484
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,300
it's my fault.

485
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,700
Mr. Yuan just called me back

486
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:26,500
and made me a woman.

487
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:29,900
I'm sorry for the delay.

488
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,100
How about this?

489
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,700
I'll go back today

490
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:33,900
and bring the flowers to Uncle San.

491
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,300
You don't have to thank me.

492
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,100
Please forgive me.

493
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:41,100
We'll be together after this.

494
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:44,100
If I still need you to tell me,

495
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,500
what should I do?

496
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,300
If Uncle San doesn't want to marry me,

497
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,300
Mr. Yuan will let me go.

498
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,100
I won't push him away.

499
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:53,100
If Uncle San doesn't like me,

500
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,500
I'll be his elder.

501
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,300
Mr. Yuan,

502
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,500
we'll be together forever.

503
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:11,100
We'll be together forever?

504
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:13,100
You said that

505
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:15,100
and I said that.

506
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:22,900
You're always looking after each other.

507
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,900
I've been to your general's mansion

508
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,100
and I've been cold and clear.

509
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,900
Don't say that you're a firework.

510
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:30,700
You don't even have a few flowers.

511
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:33,300
I don't even have a maid.

512
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,700
Where's your Young Master?

513
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,500
I like the scenery.

514
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,700
I don't like flowers.

515
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:41,900
Zisheng,

516
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:46,300
no wonder you're all those wild men.

517
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,300
They don't understand.

518
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:51,300
I think you're a very cold and warm person

519
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,700
in your general's mansion.

520
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,700
Why are you here?

521
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,500
I'm your aunt.

522
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:01,100
We're family.

523
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,700
I can't come here.

524
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:06,100
We're indeed family.

525
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:09,300
You and Cheng Ranhou are brother and sister.

526
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:13,300
I'm your aunt now.

527
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:15,900
But you've been out of my house for a long time

528
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,900
and climbed into Cheng Ranhou's bed

529
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,500
and did his duties.

530
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:25,300
You're a family now.

531
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:31,100
Even if you hate us as parents,

532
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:33,500
don't be afraid of yourself.

533
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,700
Princess Yuchang of Prince of Ruyang's mansion

534
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:38,100
is really kind and loyal to you.

535
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,700
You must cherish this good marriage.

536
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:41,700
Look,

537
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:44,700
after a few days, you'll be the princess's birthday.

538
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:48,100
You'd better go.

539
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,900
Thank you so much.

540
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:54,900
Everything will be on your hand now.

541
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,700
Pay off.

542
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:10,300
I haven't finished yet.

543
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,300
Where are you?

544
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:29,980
Give me my bike.

545
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:33,420
Well, now we still have our v industry.

546
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:38,420
Is that person here for charity, but not especially?

547
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:41,540
He himself is going to the폰.

548
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,380
Why not?

549
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:47,180
Have I done something wrong?

550
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:49,620
If you still wanna keep the money,

551
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:51,780
then put it in your hand.

552
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,460
Soy, why?

553
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:01,980
I...

554
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:12,980
Mr. Yang.

555
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:17,980
Yuan Shanjian.

556
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:20,980
You finally came back.

557
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:21,980
I'm sorry.

558
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:29,980
I just need you to take care of my sister.

559
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,980
I'll exchange the steel with you.

560
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:32,980
Don't worry.

561
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:34,980
I'll take care of the city

562
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:35,980
without my sister

563
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:38,980
and make you even more beautiful.

564
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:39,980
Here.

565
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:48,980
This...

566
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,980
Isn't this the book I gave you?

567
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:52,980
Is it...

568
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:55,980
not in the past?

569
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:56,980
I'll take the book

570
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:59,980
and report it to the hospital.

571
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:02,980
I'll give you some of the information.

572
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:03,980
I'm warning you.

573
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:06,980
If you can learn more about the nature of the world,

574
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:09,980
don't be so stubborn about the marriage.

575
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:11,980
You won't be able to read this book.

576
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:12,980
You...

577
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:16,980
You're not a good man.

578
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:28,980
I heard that Yang Si Kong

579
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,980
is a famous man in the capital.

580
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:32,980
His family is very friendly and clean.

581
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,980
He's kind and gentle.

582
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,980
He's not a good man.

583
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:38,980
How could he abandon his wife?

584
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:40,980
It's okay.

585
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:43,980
He didn't even dare to tell anyone about what happened today.

586
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:45,980
Young Master,

587
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:47,980
I don't want to ask you about your marriage.

588
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:50,980
I shouldn't have mentioned it.

589
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:53,980
But I've always been looking at you.

590
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:56,980
I'm a little worried.

591
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,980
You're already married at the age of 20.

592
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:01,980
When are you going to get married?

593
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:03,980
Who said that people must get married?

594
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:07,980
My parents and mother got married in the age of 20.

595
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:09,980
But they can't say a word.

596
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:13,980
If I don't get married after marriage,

597
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,980
I'll never get married.

598
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:18,980
Is there a woman in the world

599
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:20,980
who doesn't have a single one?

600
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:22,980
Do you think it's interesting

601
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:23,980
and want to get married?

602
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:25,980
If you think it's interesting,

603
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:27,980
you must get married.

604
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:29,980
Marriage is a family business.

605
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:30,980
It's a family business.

606
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:32,980
It's a family business.

607
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:34,980
But it's just me.

608
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:37,980
I've always been wrong.

609
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:39,980
I've never done anything

610
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:42,980
that I've never done before.

611
00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:00,980
Your wife's husband is more handsome than your father.

612
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:02,980
If you want to be in the hospital again,

613
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:04,980
be careful not to touch your face.

614
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:07,980
You'll be in a tough situation

615
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,980
if you're a military officer.

616
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:14,980
I don't think your wife is a wife.

617
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:16,980
Don't say it's a compliment.

618
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:18,980
Even if you show off on my face,

619
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:21,980
I'll still respect you.

620
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:23,980
Uncle!

621
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:25,980
Uncle!

622
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,980
Uncle,

623
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:29,980
I have something to tell you.

624
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:32,980
Please come back to my house.

625
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:36,980
Haven't you seen your elders?

626
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:38,980
What's the important thing?

627
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:39,980
What's the matter?

628
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:41,980
Don't bother him.

629
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:42,980
Come here.

630
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:45,980
If you have something to say,

631
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:46,980
just say it.

632
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:56,980
It's okay.

633
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:57,980
Say it.

634
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:59,980
You don't know what I'm talking about.

635
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:02,980
I can say it.

636
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:03,980
Say it.

637
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,980
There's a person named Yuan Shanjian.

638
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:11,980
He asked me to come to him.

639
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:13,980
He said he's a rich man

640
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:16,980
who's been making troubles for a long time.

641
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,980
He's a rich man.

642
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,980
He's a rich man.

643
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:27,980
I don't remember what he's talking about.

644
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:30,980
He's saying that he's a poor man

645
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:32,980
who's only good at talking.

646
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:34,980
A poor man?

647
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:38,980
Why didn't he ask you to tell him?

648
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:42,980
Is this Yuan Shanjian

649
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:45,980
the little disciple he said that year?

650
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:48,980
Little disciple?

651
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:53,980
It's him.

652
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:56,980
What does he want to do?

653
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:02,980
How do I know?

654
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,980
He said those words anyway.

655
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:06,980
He didn't say anything else.

656
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:09,980
He's lying.

657
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:11,980
What's that?

658
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:14,980
I've known him for more than ten years.

659
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:16,980
I remember.

660
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:18,980
I must have been a crazy man

661
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:20,980
who's been making troubles for me

662
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:22,980
for ten years.

663
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:24,980
I didn't know that.

664
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:26,980
I see.

665
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:30,980
But you've been coughing for a long time.

666
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,980
Why is he still thinking about it?

667
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,980
Wait for me.

668
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:17,980
Where the hell are it?

669
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:32,980
Where?

670
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:34,980
Please send it to me.

671
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:39,240
Uncle L됐 virus is not a common disease.

672
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:42,080
My words are not a common.

673
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:51,500
Cle timeless world הק vi

674
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:57,680
neithergeht lang

675
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:02,900
Peter

676
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:07,180
Money

677
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:12,340
Happy birthday

678
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,340
Other people say things that are quite general

679
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:18,500
They are less occupied

680
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:22,000
So, this is it?

681
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:25,260
Don't you dare,"

682
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:28,300
Uncle of the Third Uncle can tell me

683
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:30,660
Why didn't the inner circle gone?

684
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:33,300
Must it pierce through me?

685
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:37,340
I told you,

686
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:41,340
You're a good friend and a good teacher.

687
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:43,340
Don't come to see me again.

688
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:46,340
Don't send me a letter of your love.

689
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:49,340
That's the father's word.

690
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:52,340
I didn't expect that man to be a good man.

691
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:53,340
You agreed.

692
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:56,340
I see.

693
00:35:57,340 --> 00:36:01,340
But how did you know the woman in the ring?

694
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:03,340
About this.

695
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:04,340
I'm sorry.

696
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:09,340
You're so funny.

697
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:12,340
You...

698
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:23,340
I asked you to ask about the matter.

699
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:25,340
Have you ever asked about it?

700
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:29,340
Mrs. Cheng went to the store to pick up the birthday cake.

701
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:32,340
Princess Yuchang gave it to her family and left the post.

702
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:35,340
I asked about the man in the ring.

703
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:41,340
Did he go to the restaurant today?

704
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:43,340
We've been looking for the man in the ring for days.

705
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:47,340
He's been with General He's daughter and Zhao Jun.

706
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:49,340
Dong Cangguan is a good friend.

707
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:51,340
Xu Jingzhong is a good friend.

708
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:54,340
If the man in the ring wants to do military business,

709
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:57,340
he can only do military business from other places.

710
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,340
If he becomes General He's son-in-law,

711
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:02,340
it's more convenient to get the man in the ring.

712
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:06,340
General He may not be with him forever.

713
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:09,340
That's the nature of the man in the ring.

714
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:13,340
It's a good idea to have a few people in the ring.

715
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:15,340
General He is a good friend.

716
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:19,340
Is Princess Yuchang still in the ring?

717
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:22,340
We're going to the Prince of Ruyang's house.

718
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:25,340
I'm leaving early.

719
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:30,340
No, Young Master, you said you're not going.

720
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:35,340
General He is old and he will go to Prince of Ruyang's house

721
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:38,340
to celebrate Princess Yuchang's birthday.

722
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:40,340
Since he's not interested in her,

723
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:43,340
he will go there too.

724
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:46,340
Fei.

725
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:51,340
Are you feeling better?

726
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:53,340
It's just a temporary job.

727
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:55,340
I've done it.

728
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:57,340
Okay.

729
00:37:57,340 --> 00:38:00,340
Then I'll go to the Prince of Ruyang again.

730
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:02,340
Why?

731
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:04,340
You threw away the important information.

732
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:06,340
Don't you know the Prince of Ruyang?

733
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:08,340
I...

734
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:10,340
Find the information.

735
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:12,340
It's a crime.

736
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:16,340
Go!

737
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:29,340
They're so big.

738
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:42,340
The clothes are so good.

739
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:44,340
I think the color of the princess' dress

740
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:46,340
is not the same as the one in the royal family.

741
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:48,340
The dress is good too.

742
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:50,340
It's a big dress.

743
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:52,340
That's true.

744
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:54,340
I can't stand it.

745
00:38:57,340 --> 00:39:00,340
Don't run around.

746
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:08,340
Who is that?

747
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:11,340
He's the one who threw away the clothes.

748
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:13,340
He's the one who threw away the clothes.

749
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:16,340
How many girls are there in the house?

750
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:18,340
13.

751
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:20,340
The whole family is the same.

752
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:23,340
But they think they're the biggest girls in the whole capital.

753
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:25,340
They're always looking for girls.

754
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:28,340
Who are you talking about?

755
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:33,340
Chesong!

756
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:35,340
Chesong!

757
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:42,340
Hello, uncle and aunt.

758
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:47,340
Are these girls Shaoshan and Yangyang?

759
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:50,340
How did you two wear this dress?

760
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:53,340
I'll ask someone to give you some beautiful clothes.

761
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:55,340
Thank you, uncle.

762
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:57,340
The people here are very gentle.

763
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:58,340
Yes.

764
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:00,340
You're so kind.

765
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:02,340
What kind of gentle?

766
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:04,340
Come on, Ziya.

767
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:07,340
I'll make you some clothes.

768
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:19,400
Let's drink.

769
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:29,340
Are there more finishes?

770
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:33,340
Here is some.

771
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:40,340
Unlike fashion freeze and colors.

772
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:46,340
This time, take photos even more.

773
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:49,340
This is much better.

774
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:53,340
Be careful.

775
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:59,340
It's good.

776
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:06,340
Dear parents, I'll take you two...

777
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:07,340
Go.

778
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,340
Go.

779
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:12,340
Zi will take you to the market.

780
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:15,340
I'm telling you, don't be afraid. I'm here.

781
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:18,340
I'll take it.

782
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:24,340
Are you sure?

783
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:27,340
The woman who broke the mistake is the 4th wife of the Cheng family?

784
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:28,340
Yes, she is.

785
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:30,340
That night, if it wasn't for her,

786
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:33,340
the queen and General Lin had already saved the Cheng family.

787
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:35,340
The queen will look at the situation today,

788
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:37,340
I invited her to come today

789
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:40,340
to give the queen the evil spirit.

790
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:42,340
Let's go.

791
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:49,340
Where are we going?

792
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,340
There are so many delicious food.
