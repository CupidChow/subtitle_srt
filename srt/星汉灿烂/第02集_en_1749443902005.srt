00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:08,540
Young Master, His Majesty didn't blame you for not coming into the palace

9
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:09,820
so he went straight to the case

10
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,660
How could he blame you?

11
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,660
Young Master is His Majesty's son

12
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,660
How could His Majesty be so heartless?

13
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:19,660
Young Master, His Majesty didn't give him the order to come here

14
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,580
We wanted to take a look on him

15
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:22,620
But his family was killed

16
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:29,580
Did you give him the order?

17
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:30,940
Although we are still in the war

18
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:32,940
Did you know that he was killed?

19
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:34,380
In the Khachuan border official's order

20
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,940
His Majesty said it wouldched the aspects of public malls

But regarding the military shoes

22
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,500
His Majesty's will is beingVISIED

23
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:46,380
Let's not investigate over

24
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,660
I've never said it's not long.

25
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:52,660
To exchange military service,

26
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,660
I've been so busy with it for years.

27
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:55,660
I can't return it.

28
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:00,660
Didn't you say you can return it?

29
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,660
You're so stupid.

Don't be afraid to hide this.

34
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:42,660
You must take care of yourself.

35
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,660
Don't make any trouble.

36
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:47,660
This is my fault.

37
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,660
I didn't hide the old man.

38
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:50,660
I thought

39
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,660
I would hide the old man

40
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:54,660
and pretend to be a nobody.

41
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,660
But my mother said she was cruel.

42
00:03:58,660 --> 00:03:59,660
She hated me and the old man

43
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:00,660
who punished her.

44
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,660
She was so cruel.

45
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:03,660
She was so cruel.

46
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,660
You are so stupid.

47
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:07,660
You dare to hide the criminal

48
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:08,660
and commit a crime

49
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,660
as a criminal.

50
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:11,660
If you are so cruel

51
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:12,660
and you are a military official,

52
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,660
you are so bad.

53
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:15,660
According to you,

54
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:17,660
the father of the four wives

55
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:18,660
was arrested.

56
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:19,660
It's not a big deal.

57
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,660
You are a good man.

58
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,660
If you are a military official,

59
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,660
why don't you kill your wife?

60
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:26,660
If you don't,

61
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,660
you can just kill your wife.

62
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:29,660
Don't bully me.

63
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:30,660
I am a wife of a family.

64
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:31,660
I am a woman.

65
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:32,660
I am a woman.

66
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:33,660
I don't know the truth

67
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:34,660
about the official.

68
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:35,660
But I know

69
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:36,660
a family is in a hurry

70
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:37,660
to sell their shares.

71
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:38,660
How can they sell their shares?

72
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:40,660
I should

73
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:41,660
find a way

74
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:42,660
to get the money out of it.

75
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:44,660
Do you think

76
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:45,660
the military official

77
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,660
is so old

78
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,660
and he is still in pain?

79
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,660
The military is a criminal.

80
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:52,660
I don't have the ability

81
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:53,660
to kill people.

82
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:55,660
I don't care.

83
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:56,660
Dala,

84
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,660
you can't get out of this.

85
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:00,660
Dala.

86
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:01,660
Dala.

87
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:03,660
You only have

88
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,660
a family of your own.

89
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,660
You don't care about your father

90
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,660
and my mother-in-law.

91
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:10,660
Last time,

92
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,660
I asked you to get 20,000 yuan

93
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,660
and give you a wife to get married.

94
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,660
You are so mean.

95
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:17,660
How much money

96
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:18,660
is it

97
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:19,660
to get married to your brother?

98
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,660
You even have a little eye.

99
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:24,660
Your brother is your brother.

100
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,660
You are my brother.

101
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,660
Isn't he your brother?

102
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:31,660
Other relatives

103
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,660
are taking the wife's dowry

104
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:34,660
to make a husband.

105
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:35,660
My father

106
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:36,660
is taking the money

107
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:37,660
from the husband

108
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,660
to make a wife.

109
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:40,660
It's not getting married.

110
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:41,660
It's getting married.

111
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:43,660
It's getting old.

112
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:44,660
It's the right time

113
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:45,660
to get married to your father.

114
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:47,660
Besides,

115
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:48,660
the money

116
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:49,660
was exchanged

117
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:50,660
for the money

118
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:51,660
I got in the battlefield.

119
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:52,660
Why didn't he ask for it?

120
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,660
He was a family member.

121
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,660
He was married to his mother.

122
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:57,660
I think

123
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:58,660
it's better to

124
00:05:58,660 --> 00:05:59,660
figure out

125
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:00,660
the real reason for my father's marriage.

126
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,660
Are you

127
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:03,660
always taking money

128
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:04,660
to make a wife?

129
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:08,660
My dear,

130
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,660
you are so mean.

131
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:14,660
You are

132
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:15,660
a good man

133
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:18,660
for your own good.

134
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,660
Come here.

135
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,660
Get out of here.

136
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:36,660
Uncle

137
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:37,660
Uncle

138
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,660
you are so busy this time.

139
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:41,660
The house is still

140
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:42,660
in the middle of the harvest

141
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:43,660
and you are moving out.

142
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:44,660
I have moved

143
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:45,660
several houses in the backyard

144
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:46,660
and you are living in

145
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:47,660
a big house.

146
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:48,660
It's also a good place for you.

147
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:49,660
You are so busy.

148
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:50,660
You let us

149
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,660
live in the flat.

150
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:52,660
It's a lie.

151
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:54,660
How can it be a lie?

152
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:55,660
Isn't Uncle and Madam

153
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,660
not the same age as them?

154
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:58,660
I can

155
00:06:58,660 --> 00:06:59,660
make you

156
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:00,660
feel at home.

157
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:16,660
I have a plan for the house.

158
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:20,820
I will tell you

159
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:21,660
why I moved it.

160
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:22,660
Go.

161
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,660
I need to pay a visit to the building

162
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:31,660
at anyway.

163
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,820
I don't want to

164
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:35,660
to pay for

165
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:36,660
dinner

166
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:38,660
at this time.

167
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:19,900
Muzhu Muzhu,

168
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,180
you're bargaining your breakfast

169
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,540
and you're still unmarried.

170
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,700
I shouldn't have done that,

171
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,300
I didn't think that would sting.

172
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,580
Come, his private room is here.

173
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:39,820
I got it.

174
00:08:48,660 --> 00:09:02,960
곱

175
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:21,460
Mrs. Zhong married into the city for more than ten years.

176
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:24,660
She thought of raising her mother's ten-year-old nephew, Yao Ge.

177
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:27,460
A few days ago, Yao Ge brought her to the mansion to live.

178
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,260
The female servant was kind too.

179
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:31,660
She gave her a honeycomb as a gift.

180
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:34,860
Unexpectedly, when the honeycomb opened, there was a wild wind.

181
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,060
The wild wind blew Yao Ge's head full.

182
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:39,660
Mrs. Zhong let the female servant to touch the letter.

183
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,660
It was the end of the low-water-cold war,

184
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:43,460
and she was thrown into the barn.

185
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,660
This is a very poisonous thing.

186
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,660
I really should have let the second brother fix it.

187
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,860
The honeycomb of the full-fledged honeycomb

188
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,060
was opened by Yao Ge by herself.

189
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:54,660
Or by the female servant herself.

190
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:58,660
The honeycomb was opened by the male servant.

191
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:03,660
Even the 10-year-old child can't even open the lid.

192
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:06,660
Why did the female servant open it by herself?

193
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:09,660
Why didn't the honeycomb go into the room?

194
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:13,660
It was eaten in the garden of the garden of the flower garden.

195
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:15,660
Some things are done by the female servant.

196
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,660
The medicine is made properly.

197
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:20,660
In case of a fall, it's better to do it.

198
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:26,660
General, I asked the doctor just now.

199
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:30,660
The lady fainted this time not because of the cold.

200
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:34,660
But because she was injured and had a stomachache.

201
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,660
That's because the female servant was hungry.

202
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:41,660
They didn't even give them a bowl of rice.

203
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:44,660
They brought the female servant back in a hurry and sent some food.

204
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,660
The female servant was hungry for a few days.

205
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:48,660
She ate a lot of food.

206
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,660
She ate this one and didn't have the next one.

207
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:52,660
Why did she have to do this?

208
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,660
We're fighting outside.

209
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:58,660
The female servant is at home and can't eat and drink.

210
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:01,660
Who knows? She even doesn't know how to live.

211
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:03,660
Okay, I got it.

212
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,660
You can go now.

213
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,660
Yes.

214
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,660
The female servant is with the female servant.

215
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,660
She has left a letter of care.

216
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:16,660
But I didn't expect her to be so angry.

217
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:18,660
Now that I'm back,

218
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:21,660
these things will definitely not happen again.

219
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:24,660
The sky is not bright.

220
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:27,660
General, don't you still want to go to the second floor?

221
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,660
I'll go and see.

222
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:41,660
They all say that you're sick and have a stroke.

223
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:44,660
The young lady is so poor.

224
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:47,660
I don't know how long she'll last until she's fully recovered.

225
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:51,660
She's recovered recently.

226
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,660
She just gave us a tour.

227
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,660
She picked up a baby to cure her.

228
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:57,660
My mother is a doctor.

229
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,660
She's afraid that she'll see me in the hospital.

230
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:02,660
But why is she pretending to be a doctor?

231
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,660
It's still your idea.

232
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:07,660
She's been taking a long time to recover.

233
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,660
They can't stop their eyes.

234
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,660
They're really mad.

235
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:14,660
These people are jealous of the female servant.

236
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,660
They're so mean.

237
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:20,660
It's not that I'm being too harsh on them.

238
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,660
I just let them go.

239
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,660
The female servant of the family

240
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,660
probably won't even ask for her old lady's help.

241
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,660
Don't worry.

242
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:31,660
If you're a woman,

243
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,660
you'll be dead many times.

244
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:37,660
General, you're a wise woman.

245
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:41,660
There's no one who can defeat a man like you.

246
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:45,660
It's just that you're willing to help me.

247
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,660
I'll be a good daughter

248
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:52,660
to make you and my mother happy.

249
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:55,660
I'm really proud of you.

250
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,660
I'm not a good husband.

251
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:02,660
I'm just worried that I won't be able to handle it for more than ten years.

252
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,660
I'm just worried about you.

253
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,660
I can only be strict with my family now.

254
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:10,660
I'll have to pay the cost of my life.

255
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,660
Don't bully me.

256
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:16,660
Instead, you're here to teach me.

257
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,660
But he's not as close as I am.

258
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:21,660
It seems that I still have to come here myself.

259
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:29,660
You sent someone to monitor the Cheng family.

260
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:31,660
Have you been working for them?

261
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:34,660
I heard that they're all women.

262
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:36,660
I heard that the wife of the old lady

263
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:39,660
sent her own child to take care of her.

264
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,660
I've checked it.

265
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,660
There's no one in the Cheng family.

266
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,660
Except the wife of the second house.

267
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,660
I've checked it on the Zolan 5.

268
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:53,660
It's the second house's uncle and the house's wife.

269
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:56,660
Master, this is the package from the little man from the Cheng family.

270
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:59,660
He said that the second house's wife was sent to you.

271
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:04,660
Do you want to use money to destroy the Young Master's factory?

272
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,660
Why is it a bunch of rubbish?

273
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,660
What's wrong?

274
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:34,660
The Cheng family is really more filial than filial.

275
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:48,660
Master, as you can see, the factory is really in trouble.

276
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:56,660
The Dongcang House has invested 80,000 yuan in this factory.

277
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,660
It's a low-cost factory.

278
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:00,660
It must be a waste of money.

279
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:03,660
Master, you haven't thrown the woman from the Cheng family.

280
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:06,660
The woman from the Cheng family sent these.

281
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:09,660
Do you want to tell us about the factory?

282
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:19,660
The Dongcang House has been in a lot of trouble since the beginning of the year.

283
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:22,660
But the years have passed.

284
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:27,660
It's really interesting.

285
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,660
The wife of the Cheng family is so big and so famous.

286
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:33,660
I don't want to sell our factory.

287
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:36,660
The wife of the Cheng family wants us to help her.

288
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,660
Why should we help her?

289
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:47,660
She must have been worried about herself long ago.

290
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:51,660
She must have been worried about herself.

291
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:06,660
I don't want to drink. Take it away.

292
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:09,660
This is the medicine that the master asked the princess to give.

293
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,660
It's so good.

294
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,660
I'm fine.

295
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,660
Why do you still have to drink this?

296
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:18,660
It's not just the medicine.

297
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,660
You should drink it.

298
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:22,660
You can have it after you finish it.

299
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:24,660
You drink it for me.

300
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,660
Here comes the medicine.

301
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,660
My son is still not well.

302
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,660
Your Highness, I've seen your father.

303
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:57,660
My son is not in a hurry.

304
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:03,660
He's still so weak.

305
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,660
It's all because of the position.

306
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,660
He's lost his health.

307
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,660
He can't even make it up.

308
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,660
Take it.

309
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,660
The medicine is almost cold.

310
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,660
Drink it for the girl.

311
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,660
Yes.

312
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,660
Come on.

313
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,660
I'm so tired.

314
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,660
Father.

315
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,660
It's too bitter.

316
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,660
You should take it to the hospital.

317
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,660
I'll take it to the hospital.

318
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,660
Okay.

319
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:57,660
Okay, I'll take it.

320
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,660
I'll go to the hospital.

321
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:01,660
Okay.

322
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,660
You're so tired.

323
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,660
Why don't you go to the hospital?

324
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,660
Take some medicine.

325
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,660
The medicine that the doctor gave you

326
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,660
can't be added to your body.

327
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,660
The so-called cold medicine is bitter.

328
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,660
If you don't feel well,

329
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:22,660
you should drink it every day.

330
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,660
You're right.

331
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:28,660
Listen to me.

332
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:30,660
Drink it.

333
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:34,660
Good girl.

334
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:36,660
You're so kind.

335
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,660
Look at the surprise.

336
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,660
Look at the backlight of the chance for justice.

337
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,660
God, my house child gave birth to a pretty girl.

338
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,660
Ievil holding in her hands

339
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:55,660
INAUDIBLE a candy-p Paste

340
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,660
My house child didn't it for me, instead,

341
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,660
everyone has to get married.

342
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,660
Talk to me, general.

343
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:04,660
People in your house should be lovedgestly educated.

344
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:08,920
Oh yeah, let's get some more.

345
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:28,960
The runtime is here!

346
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:33,700
Leave that there, I assure you專注意整 на п ül send.

347
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:36,660
I can't live anymore.

348
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:37,660
I can't live anymore.

349
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:39,660
Why would you do that?

350
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:41,660
Look at her.

351
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:42,660
She's so cute.

352
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,660
I can't live anymore.

353
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,660
I can't live anymore.

354
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,660
I don't care about you.

355
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:49,660
My lord.

356
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:50,660
My lord.

357
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,660
Don't think about it.

358
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,660
My child.

359
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:55,660
Even if you die,

360
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:57,660
you can't die now.

361
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:58,660
If you die,

362
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,660
no one will be able to save you.

363
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,660
Oh, my god!

364
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:05,660
What did we do?

365
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:07,660
We're going to be singed.

366
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:09,660
If you play a play in the hospital,

367
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:12,660
you can play the role of a playboy.

368
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:15,660
I can't live anymore.

369
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:17,660
I want to dance.

370
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:19,660
Don't stop me.

371
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:22,660
What's wrong with you?

372
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:24,660
I don't want to.

373
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,660
I want to dance.

374
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,660
I don't want to dance.

375
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,660
Mother.

376
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:35,660
What are you doing?

377
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:37,660
Why did you push me?

378
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:39,660
I was so scared.

379
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,660
What are you doing?

380
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,660
You're so small.

381
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,660
Can you jump in?

382
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,660
You can't say that.

383
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,660
You're so small.

384
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:51,660
You're so big.

385
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:52,660
You're so small.

386
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,660
You can't play the role of a playboy.

387
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,660
You can't say that.

388
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:58,660
You can't say that.

389
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:00,660
You're so small.

390
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,660
You're so small.

391
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:05,660
You can't jump in.

392
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,660
I want to dance.

393
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:09,660
I want to dance.

394
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:10,660
I want to dance.

395
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,660
I want to see father.

396
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:13,660
Mother.

397
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:14,660
Take my phone.

398
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:16,660
I want to dance.

399
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:18,660
Grandpa.

400
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,660
Are you all right?

401
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:23,660
You pretend to be small and act like you're okay.

402
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:25,660
You're so small.

403
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,660
Why are you so small?

404
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,660
I didn't think that you're so big.

405
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:31,660
Do you really want to see me pretend to be small?

406
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:33,660
Uncle Xu is still looking at us.

407
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:36,660
He's so small.

408
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:38,660
You're so small.

409
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:40,660
You're so small.

410
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:42,660
You're so small.

411
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:44,660
You're so small.

412
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,660
I want to dance.

413
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:50,660
I want to dance.

414
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:54,660
Do you think you can play the role of a playboy?

415
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:56,660
Although the father is a kind man,

416
00:21:56,660 --> 00:22:00,660
he is a great general who has a good character.

417
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:03,660
He's good at dancing.

418
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:06,660
He's been with his mother for years.

419
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:09,660
He's married and has a good husband.

420
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:13,660
And he's been with his mother for a long time.

421
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:15,660
I can't help it.

422
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:17,660
I'm so sorry.

423
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:19,660
I'm so sorry.

424
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:23,660
Isn't it hard to be a man?

425
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:25,660
At least, a family can save a man.

426
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:27,660
You have to save a man first.

427
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:28,660
Yes.

428
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:29,660
My general,

429
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:31,660
I'm sorry.

430
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:33,660
I'm sorry.

431
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:35,660
I'm sorry.

432
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:37,660
I'm sorry.

433
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,660
I'm sorry.

434
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,660
I'm sorry.

435
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,660
My general,

436
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,660
we fell into the recovering of misfortune to a Samkhana.

437
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:47,660
Diezu cannot return the favor at all.

438
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:50,660
You want to let us down.

439
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,660
If you want to escape my Plaza,

440
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:54,660
go away.

441
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:57,240
You have to

442
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,040
make me laugh.

443
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,780
Earlier, I told my mother

444
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:05,740
how I � longitudinal umptastic created by SAP.

445
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:06,540
It's true.

446
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:07,540
My daughter is an unborn.

447
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:09,460
Why it's so serious?

448
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:11,380
Why do you have to claim to her?

449
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:13,380
He's not his real son.

450
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:14,380
He's not his real son.

451
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:16,380
He's not his real son.

452
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:21,380
Oh, my God!

453
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:25,380
The death of several brothers of Liang family

454
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:29,380
is the only way to save your uncle.

455
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:32,380
If not because of his suffering,

456
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:37,380
how can we raise the money for the poor?

457
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:42,380
How about we move all the money we have in our house to the uncle?

458
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:45,380
Yes, yes, yes.

459
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:49,380
Why?

460
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:51,380
You can't save your uncle.

461
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:53,380
That's your uncle.

462
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:55,380
We're a family.

463
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:56,380
We can't separate.

464
00:23:56,380 --> 00:24:00,380
No, we can't.

465
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:03,380
Lin Buyi is a real son.

466
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:06,380
Lu Fei Hai just took the war and returned to the capital.

467
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:09,380
I can't even take him with me.

468
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:11,380
How can I take him with me?

469
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:13,380
You're a real son.

470
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:16,380
You can't save your uncle.

471
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,380
Yes.

472
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:21,380
Okay.

473
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:26,380
I'll sue you for your crime.

474
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:30,380
I heard that the current emperor is the most filial.

475
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:32,380
The officials are accused of the crime.

476
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:35,380
The officials are accused of the crime.

477
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:37,380
The officials are accused of the crime.

478
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:39,380
I don't think you're afraid of it.

479
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:42,380
Jun, you know that the officials are guilty of the crime.

480
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:45,380
If the officials are accused of the crime,

481
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:48,380
what will happen to the military?

482
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:52,380
No one knows.

483
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:54,380
Mother, the police are here.

484
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:58,380
If you don't want to take the blame for the crime,

485
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:01,380
I'm not afraid of the emperor.

486
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:05,380
Now you're a big son.

487
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:10,380
You're here to take the country.

488
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:15,380
I don't want to eat and drink since the beginning.

489
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:18,380
Do you think that the old lady is really begging for it?

490
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:20,380
How will you take it?

491
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:22,380
It's been ten days and a half.

492
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:24,380
She won't be able to die.

493
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:26,380
Have you seen enough?

494
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:28,380
No.

495
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:30,380
It's the first time.

496
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:56,380
I've seen mother.

497
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:01,380
Are you crazy?

498
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:04,380
Maybe she just came out of the air.

499
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:06,380
She was blown away.

500
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:08,380
Don't worry.

501
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:13,380
Since you're not, why are you not lying on the bed?

502
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:15,380
I'm not lying on the bed.

503
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:17,380
I'm not lying on the bed.

504
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:19,380
I'm not lying on the bed.

505
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,380
I'm not lying on the bed.

506
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:23,380
What's wrong?

507
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:27,380
It's windy outside.

508
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:29,380
Let's go back to the room.

509
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,380
Don't go out.

510
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:33,380
I know, mother.

511
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:57,380
I thought that my parents would be happy to see me.

512
00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:02,380
Now I think that I'm not as good as I used to be.

513
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:06,380
But mother is strong.

514
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:08,380
She loves you.

515
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:10,380
She's doing it for your own good.

516
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:12,380
I'm not a good mother.

517
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:14,380
I'm not a good mother.

518
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:16,380
I'm not a good mother.

519
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:18,380
I'm not a good mother.

520
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:20,380
I'm doing it for your own good.

521
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:24,380
I'm not a good mother.

522
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:51,380
Where are you taking me?

523
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:00,380
He's so shameless.

524
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:03,380
The young master asked him to lie in front of the young master.

525
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:06,380
The young master is so smart.

526
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:08,380
How can he not see his art?

527
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:11,380
Well, he's not a good man.

528
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:16,380
What's this?

529
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:18,380
It's a knife.

530
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:20,380
You can't get it in.

531
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:22,380
And then you dig it.

532
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:27,380
It's good.

533
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:30,380
Someone asked you to give me a thousand dollars.

534
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:33,380
You just make a hole in your eyes.

535
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:35,380
And then you give me a thousand dollars.

536
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:38,380
Open the door.

537
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:48,380
Open the door.

538
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:50,380
Open the door.

539
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:54,380
Open the door.

540
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:56,380
Open the door.

541
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:57,380
Help.

542
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:58,380
What's going on?

543
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:00,380
Help.

544
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:03,380
General Cheng has already asked for your help.

545
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:05,380
He's a good man.

546
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:07,380
Now, no matter what you do,

547
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:10,380
you're all out of your mind.

548
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:14,380
I hate lying the most in my life.

549
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:17,380
But I've met a liar.

550
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,380
I've been blinded.

551
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:21,380
I've been killed.

552
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:27,380
Now I'm not pretending to be a man.

553
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:32,380
How dare you lie?

554
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:34,380
I'm a man.

555
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:36,380
Come on.

556
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:42,380
Of course.

557
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,380
Take him away.

558
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:50,380
General Cheng.

559
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:52,380
I'm so sorry.

560
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:54,380
I'm so sorry.

561
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:56,380
I'm so sorry.

562
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:58,380
I'm so sorry.

563
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:03,380
I'm so sorry.

564
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:05,380
I'm so sorry.

565
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:07,380
I'm so sorry.

566
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,380
I'm so sorry.

567
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:11,380
I'm so sorry.

568
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:13,380
I'm sorry.

569
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:21,380
I'll go to the doctor and ask him about your situation.

570
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:23,380
Don't make me feel sad.

571
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:26,380
After all, he's a man.

572
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:28,380
I'm afraid he'll be in trouble.

573
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:31,380
My dad...

574
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:34,380
who is she?

575
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:42,380
What's your dad's problem?

576
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:44,380
I already told you.

577
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:47,380
She's such a play dodger.

578
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:50,380
She knows what they have to deal with.

579
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:56,380
What's the big big problem?

580
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:58,380
Then I was surrounded by criminals.

581
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:02,380
I was kicked out in the face of the knife.

582
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:07,380
The letter sent by Cheng Xiao Wei was just cut off by Chang Mao.

583
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:09,380
It's so dangerous.

584
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:12,380
Cheng Xiao Wei's weapons are better than Han Fei's.

585
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:14,380
Chang Mao was cut off.

586
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:17,380
Cheng Xiao Wei lost his weapons.

587
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:21,380
He was forced to fight with his enemies.

588
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:25,380
That's why he sacrificed his life for our family.

589
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:28,380
He is injured.

590
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:31,380
Where are you going?

591
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:33,380
Take off your clothes.

592
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:34,380
I'm still here.

593
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:37,380
I've seen everything you've done.

594
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:39,380
Take off your clothes.

595
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:42,380
Dalao.

596
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:46,380
Dalao.

597
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:48,380
I asked you to fight.

598
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:50,380
I wanted you to fight with your enemies.

599
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:53,380
But I didn't want you to die.

600
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:55,380
The sword is beautiful.

601
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,380
I'm only taking it with my life.

602
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:59,380
I've told him.

603
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:03,380
I think I can make the army see the truth and share it with the world.

604
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:15,380
The sword is the life of a soldier.

605
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:18,380
There are still some things that are dark.

606
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:22,380
Take the weapons that are scattered and replaced with good ones.

607
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:25,380
It's so kind of you.

608
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:30,380
Madam, madam Dong, please come in.

609
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:36,380
She's really nice.

610
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:41,380
Please come in.

611
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:43,380
Yes.

612
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:47,380
Sister, please go down and have a rest.

613
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:49,380
Thank you, madam.

614
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:55,380
Madam, I'm here to take care of the father.

615
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:58,380
I'm sorry, I can't take care of the child.

616
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:00,380
Even if he's not willing to take care of the child,

617
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:02,380
he may not be willing to let the father go.

618
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:05,380
But I've been punished today.

619
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:09,380
It's just that the father of Dong is responsible for the child's death.

620
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:14,380
Then the child was killed and replaced by the father of Dong.

621
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:17,380
The whole family was taken over and replaced by the Dong family.

622
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:19,380
Great.

623
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:21,380
This idea is great.

624
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:24,380
This idea is really great.

625
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:26,380
The nephew is a general.

626
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:28,380
He's been punished for the crime.

627
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:31,380
His Majesty will be more generous.

628
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:34,380
Dito is just a matter of money.

629
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:41,380
Zi, I think it's better to let the nephew go to the end of this crime.

630
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:51,380
You bastard!

631
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:54,380
You dare to hurt my child?

632
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:58,380
Yesterday, the family was in a hurry.

633
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:00,380
I felt something was wrong.

634
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:02,380
So I invited the late God.

635
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:07,380
I heard that the Cheng family was forced to be married.

636
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:10,380
The late God was right.

637
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:13,380
The Cheng family really wants to be the king.

638
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:16,380
So I invited the late God.

639
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:20,380
That's right. The Cheng family really wants to be the king.

640
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:24,380
Now, even the second house's clothes are all over the place.

641
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:26,380
It's all because of you.

642
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:30,380
You guys are all not good.

643
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:33,380
Come on, push this bastard out of here.

644
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:36,380
If anyone dares to put him in, I'll break his legs.

645
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:38,380
Zi, he said it himself.

646
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:40,380
Shut up! He said it himself!

647
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:43,380
He said it himself!

648
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:48,380
He said it himself!

649
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:51,380
Cause I have food in all locations.

650
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:56,380
I do not know what will happen.

651
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:59,380
I don't understand why the family got married?

652
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:01,380
Do they have room to sleep?

653
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:03,380
No, this sounds bad, wordless.

654
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:06,380
The aunt of grand-owl had a couple ofнow.

655
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:08,380
As He changed her.

656
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:11,380
Her Mustafa.

657
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:14,380
She gave her kindPeople.

658
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:15,780
for the stable business.

659
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:18,300
Is it possible for you to get relived

660
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,980
all your duties for your brother as a father?

661
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:23,940
No. I don't want to.

662
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:25,660
I don't want to...

663
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:45,180
Out of your hands!

664
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:48,500
And she's not afraid to give birth to babies in her house anymore.

665
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:03,880
Fairy pista,

666
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:05,740
the mar autonomous system of theLES初跳

667
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:08,600
isn't very good in the first place,

668
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,160
as the same time,

669
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:13,700
and the truth is however,

670
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,700
I can't speak, I can't speak.

671
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:18,700
I'm not good enough for you.

672
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,700
I'm not good enough for you.

673
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:28,700
You have your own merits.

674
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:31,700
Okay, okay. Let's eat.

675
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:35,700
Fu, I feel unwell.

676
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:38,700
I'm afraid my stomach is still not well.

677
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:43,700
Your Highness, I heard a rumor about a stomachache when I was eating.

678
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:48,700
The saint said that the food is not good for children.

679
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:50,700
Which saint said that?

680
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:54,700
Your Highness, eat more meat.

681
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:57,700
You must be hungry in the dressing room a few days ago.

682
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,700
Thank you, Your Highness.

683
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:04,700
If you are not well, you should eat less meat.

684
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:06,700
You are just in time for the ginger.

685
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:11,700
I'm not well.

686
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:36,700
A-mu, are you hungry?

687
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:39,700
Come, eat some.

688
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,700
Come.

689
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:51,700
You haven't seen your son for over ten years.

690
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:56,700
Let's see if he has changed.

691
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,700
What?

692
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:07,700
I know A-mu is worried about you.

693
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:09,700
He is a亲.

694
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:13,700
But it was nothing, pure love.

695
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:18,640
Ever Policy

696
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:30,700
You are A-mu's only child.

697
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:34,700
How could A-mu have worry about you?

698
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:39,700
I've been waiting for you for years.

699
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:41,700
You've been through so much.

700
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,700
You've been through so much.

701
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:47,700
I thought you were in danger.

702
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:51,700
I didn't know how to deal with this.

703
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,700
I wanted to write to you,

704
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,700
but you didn't agree.

705
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,700
I didn't want to let you know

706
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:01,700
that I was the one who wrote to you.

707
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:05,700
But no matter how hard you try,

708
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,700
you've taken away the price of the man's company

709
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:09,700
and not paid for the Xiao family.

710
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,700
His dowry went to the head.

711
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:13,700
But I'm a city man.

712
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:17,700
I'll never raise the price of the man's family

713
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:19,700
again.

714
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:23,700
Xiao Yuan Yi is a second-hand man.

715
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:25,700
He's a rich man.

716
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:27,700
He's got all the assets.

717
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,700
You still like him so much?

718
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,700
I do.

719
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:33,700
I don't want to marry anyone but him.

720
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:35,700
Son, son.

721
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:37,700
I love you and San Lang the most.

722
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:41,700
But since you two got married,

723
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,700
you've been only thinking about your husband.

724
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:45,700
You've said something to him.

725
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:47,700
You've never cared about me.

726
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:53,700
Isn't it the same for a man to marry a city man?

727
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,700
After a hundred years,

728
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:57,700
you and I are the same.

729
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,700
You and your son have to be the same.

730
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,700
You're the same.

731
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,700
Can't we just buy a piece of it?

732
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:09,700
I see.

733
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,700
I envy you two.

734
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,700
We're both in the same business.

735
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:15,700
Me?

736
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:17,700
I envy you two.

737
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,700
Father,

738
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:23,700
I'm really jealous

739
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,700
of you two.

740
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:27,700
Father,

741
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:29,700
do you have a person who likes to watch?

742
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,700
If you have a person who wants to marry,

743
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:33,700
you...

744
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,700
We're not going to stop you.

745
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:37,700
What are you talking about?

746
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:39,700
When did I say I wanted to marry?

747
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:41,700
You son.

748
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,700
I'm not a bad man.

749
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:45,700
I'm a good man.

750
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:47,700
I'm a good man.

751
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:49,700
If I want to marry,

752
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:51,700
I'm not going to be a good man.

753
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:53,700
If I want to have a new brother and sister,

754
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,700
I'm sure he will be like a father and a son.

755
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:57,700
I...

756
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:01,700
Okay.

757
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:03,700
Okay.

758
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:05,700
If you leave first,

759
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:07,700
I'll give you a new father

760
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:09,700
and find a good man to marry.

761
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,700
Then you'll have a new son.

762
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:13,700
I'm not afraid.

763
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:15,700
We're not the kind of people who want to have a new son.

764
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:17,700
You...

765
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:19,700
You...

766
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:21,700
You're not a son.

767
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:23,700
You...

768
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,700
You...

769
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:27,700
Look at my father giving me a mother.

770
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:29,700
Is he still a mother?

771
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:31,700
He's a father.

772
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:33,700
Why did he give us a mother

773
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,700
to marry him?

774
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:37,700
You mean

775
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:39,700
these are all my calculations?

776
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:53,700
As a mother,

777
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,700
you don't talk in front of me

778
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:57,700
and you're a good-for-nothing.

779
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:59,700
You're really not like me.

780
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:01,700
Put your hands out.

781
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:03,700
Put your hands out.

782
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:22,700
From tomorrow,

783
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:25,700
you'll stay in the house and be a courtesan.

784
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:27,700
You can't leave without finishing the exam.

785
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:28,700
But...

786
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:30,700
But I don't want to say it.

787
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:32,700
I've never been to the court before.

788
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:34,700
You're a senior.

789
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:36,700
You should study at home.

790
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:53,700
I brought the chieftain to take care of the wrongdoers.

791
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:55,700
You misunderstood me.

792
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:58,700
I didn't bring the chieftain to hit you.

793
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:02,700
You're already a hard-working man.

794
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:04,700
You're only a chieftain.

795
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:06,700
Go to persuade him.

796
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:14,700
Young master,

797
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:16,700
don't be sad.

798
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:32,700
I'm so sad.

799
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:36,700
I don't know how to look at you anymore.

800
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:40,700
I'm not good at smiling.

801
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:44,700
I'm not good at being a good-for-nothing.

802
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:48,700
I'm not good at being a good-for-nothing.

803
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:52,700
I'm not good at being a good-for-nothing.

804
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:55,700
I'm not sad

805
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:59,700
because I lost you.

806
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:03,700
Don't know what that means.

807
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:05,700
We're in pain.

808
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:24,700
Easy.

809
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:28,700
What's wrong?

810
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:30,700
I'm a good person. I'm a good person.

811
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:32,700
I'm a good person. I'm a good person.

812
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:34,700
I'm a good person.

813
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:36,700
What did you say?

814
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:38,700
You're asking for a husband?

815
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:40,700
Am I wrong?

816
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:42,700
I think he's a good guy.

817
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:44,700
I'm afraid he's a good guy.

818
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:46,700
You're right.

819
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:48,700
I should give you another one.

820
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:50,700
I'm a good person.

821
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:58,700
I think Erlang can enter the world.

822
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:00,700
He's a good person.

823
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:02,700
He's a good guy.

824
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,700
He's a good guy.

825
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:06,700
Even if he's a good guy,

826
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:08,700
we can always help him.

827
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:10,700
Besides, he's a good guy.

828
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:12,700
He doesn't want us to be punished.

829
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:14,700
But I didn't expect that he's a good guy.

830
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:16,700
He doesn't even talk about Erlang.

831
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:18,700
He's a good guy.

832
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:20,700
He left the child to Ge Sh.

833
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:22,700
He's been studying the past.

834
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:24,700
He's been studying for ten years.

835
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:26,700
He's been watching the elders' jokes.

836
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:28,700
What's the point of being a good girl?

837
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:30,700
Madam, you're not bad.

838
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:32,700
Xiao Jiao Hu,

839
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:34,700
since Ge Sh hasn't been taught well,

840
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:36,700
we can teach him slowly.

841
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:38,700
Slowly?

842
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:40,700
I can't teach him well.

843
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:42,700
If I don't teach him well,

844
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:44,700
will he be taught by his husband?

845
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:46,700
What's this?

846
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:48,700
Yesterday,

847
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:50,700
the family's vermin didn't produce the vermin.

848
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:52,700
I felt something was wrong.

849
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:54,700
I invited an old god.

850
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:58,700
This is your bird.

851
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:00,700
You secretly changed the vermin.

852
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:02,700
You pretended to be a ghost and scared the military.

853
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:04,700
He just turned the military's superstition.

854
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:06,700
He deliberately made a mistake.

855
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:10,700
I said, how did the vermin make a mistake?

856
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:12,700
How did the vermin make a mistake?

857
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:14,700
My wife is smart.

858
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:16,700
She's so smart.

859
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:18,700
You're protecting her?

860
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:20,700
If she's my soldier,

861
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:22,700
I'll drag her out and beat her up.

862
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:24,700
I saw the doctor's clothes.

863
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:26,700
They were not suitable.

864
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:28,700
You had to bring the silk in the room.

865
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:31,700
Then, you gave him some more suitable clothes.

866
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:54,700
I know, madam,

867
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:56,700
you want to make up for it.

868
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:58,700
You want to teach him well.

869
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:00,700
But the military is still in the early days.

870
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:02,700
We've only been back for a few days.

871
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:04,700
I made a wrong choice.

872
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:06,700
I made the bird

873
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:08,700
turn into this one today.

874
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:10,700
I can't make a mistake again.

875
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:12,700
I'll let him go.

876
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:14,700
I'll forget his life.

877
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:16,700
I'll forget his life.

878
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:18,700
I'll forget his life.

879
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:20,700
I'll forget his life.

880
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:22,700
I'll forget his life.

881
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:24,700
I have to take care of this child.

882
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:52,700
I'll forget his life.

883
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:22,700
The End

884
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:52,700
The End
