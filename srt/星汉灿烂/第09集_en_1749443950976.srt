1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,520
The Joker

2
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The End

3
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 1

4
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
General Wan, stay.

5
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
General, you really don't stay in the mansion?

6
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
My master always doesn't need to cook.

7
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Great, great, great.

8
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
General, I won't stay here anymore.

9
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Uncle Wan.

10
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Uncle Wan.

11
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Uncle Wan, I really can't walk.

12
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I can only come to steal you and the other kids.

13
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Which family are you from?

14
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Do we know each other?

15
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Uncle Wan, don't act anymore.

16
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I think you're familiar with it.

17
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,960
Bird, bird,

18
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Chen Shaoshan,

19
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Chen Jia Shao.

20
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It's bird.

21
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Why do you look like this?

22
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Don't say that.

23
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Uncle Wan knows it.

24
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It must be beaten by a bird.

25
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Don't be afraid.

26
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Take me to tell the former emperor.

27
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
It's not that big.

28
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
But why did I hit Uncle Wan so happy?

29
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
No, no, no.

30
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It's just that the doctor didn't recognize me.

31
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Why do you look like a bird?

32
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Why are you laughing?

33
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm not laughing.

34
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
The young master said you laughed, so he laughed.

35
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Bird, the bird is in the back yard.

36
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Why don't you go find him first?

37
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'll take care of him.

38
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
This is bird.

39
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Bird.

40
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Miss Ling.

41
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I think it's a good thing.

42
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm afraid I haven't been well in my house.

43
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I just need to keep on bothering my sister.

44
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Miss Ling, it's not...

45
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Please forgive me.

46
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I'm not.

47
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Please, please, please.

48
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
atti

49
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
That bastard off the table

50
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
so officially there are so many things in the old shop.

51
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Just destroyed my face.

52
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I'll help her.

53
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I'll help her to get her face out of bed early.

54
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Since you're here, just stay a few more days.

55
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'll take your mother's breath away.

56
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Thank you, madam.

57
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
The children of the seven princes are getting married.

58
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
After she's back to the capital,

59
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
she's bored of the whole family.

60
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You and your sister-in-law

61
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
should read and write.

62
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
What are you writing?

63
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I'm teaching my sister to ride a horse.

64
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Besides,

65
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
look, your sister's face is still injured.

66
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Is this word used for the lotus?

67
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Qiqi, when will you be able to

68
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
read and write?

69
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
And,

70
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
have you taken those stones from them?

71
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
It's late, so who will take them?

72
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Aren't they heavy?

73
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Madam, I don't know.

74
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Now the capital is this big.

75
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Then hurry up and find another

76
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
young lady like you.

77
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Your mother will take care of you.

78
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
And you'll be able to get a good daughter like her.

79
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
If you can't find her,

80
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
then give this to me.

81
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Madam, I've been so busy with the rain.

82
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I'm so hungry.

83
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
What can I eat?

84
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Hurry up and go back to your room to eat.

85
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I'll change the clothes on you.

86
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You'rearo.

87
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Hduan is a young lady,

88
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
he happens to beat her so fast.

89
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
It's not normal

90
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
when girls are considered so useless.

91
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Despite theあな just by acting,

92
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
he has other ways of maidenwriting.

93
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Don't be so greenhouse.

94
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
So what kind of method

95
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
does he use1

96
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
in keeping an greetings off the table?

97
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,600
She didn't go to the theater.

98
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,840
Can any of her elders have told anything?

99
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,120
Mom went to the theater

100
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,960
and she didn't see him

101
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,240
stuck on the staff gap and got angry.

102
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,000
Why did it have to be full?

103
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,000
Isn't it enough if I just cancel the program?

104
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,400
If he could live an outright anger,

105
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,560
nothing would calm him down.

106
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:07,560
If General Chen is also a man of the people's dignity,

107
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,560
do you think I will let Song Beiyu defeat him?

108
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:15,560
In the chaos, you can't just close your eyes and

109
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,560
stand up for the allies of the Ming dynasty.

110
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,560
What use is there to do that?

111
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,560
You are right, my lord.

112
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,560
You are like Song Beiyu.

113
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,560
You are like General Chen.

114
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,560
You are all the people who are cruel and stubborn.

115
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,560
You can't just let him out of the world.

116
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,560
You have to be able to see people.

117
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,560
I am getting old.

118
00:07:54,560 --> 00:08:00,560
These words should have been told to Song.

119
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,560
How can I see people and people?

120
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,560
Now I am here with you,

121
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,560
and I am in the room.

122
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,560
I am so happy that I can't reflect on myself.

123
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,560
I am not young anymore.

124
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,560
I have a lot of time.

125
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,560
Don't think too much.

126
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,560
It's hard to say that you are much more than me and Song Beiyu.

127
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,560
You are so good-looking.

128
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,560
You don't need to worry about anything.

129
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,560
Madam.

130
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,560
Madam.

131
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,560
Madam.

132
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,560
Madam.

133
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,560
Madam.

134
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,560
Madam.

135
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,560
Madam.

136
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,560
My lord, you are drunk.

137
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,560
You are in the study.

138
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,560
You won't go back to your room tonight.

139
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,560
I know.

140
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:02,560
Is Yilan gone?

141
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,560
General Lin didn't go.

142
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,560
He said he was in the guest room tonight.

143
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,560
He is drunk too.

144
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:12,560
General Lin didn't go to the room for long.

145
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,560
Come.

146
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,560
How is it?

147
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,560
I am drunk from my father.

148
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,560
Not bad, right?

149
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,560
Good.

150
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,560
Sister, I have a question.

151
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:43,560
What's the accident in your mother's ear?

152
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,560
What's the accident?

153
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,560
It's not a secret.

154
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,560
You don't know.

155
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,560
I don't know.

156
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,560
My father chose me to be ten years older than my father.

157
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,560
My brother found me in the door.

158
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,560
He said my mother wouldn't let me go.

159
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:07,560
Then he took my father's property to another man.

160
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:11,560
My mother is a doctor no matter what.

161
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,560
He doesn't want to be a doctor.

162
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,560
So my father

163
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:19,560
left me alone and left me alone.

164
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,560
He said he wouldn't let me go.

165
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:29,560
My father is a good man.

166
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:33,560
My mother said he was born in Han.

167
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:37,560
But my father never met him.

168
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:42,560
He always loved him and used his most powerful magic.

169
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:48,560
He said my mother is a good woman in the world.

170
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,560
For my father's sake,

171
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:57,560
my mother has always been a good woman.

172
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,560
Look at that!

173
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:03,560
I can't lie to you.

174
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:07,560
You can go to your olunPop我不crowd.

175
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,560
It's really strange.

176
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,560
Are you a c!

177
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,560
I don't see that as an excuse.

178
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:21,560
You mean?

179
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,560
How can you say upstairs?

180
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:30,960
A hero who can certainly live on her side forever.

181
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,420
Ok.

182
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:50,640
If I try, I will not be able to survive.

183
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:55,640
I'm sure that's because my future husband won't have a wife.

184
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:59,640
My mother didn't teach me how to play the role of a family.

185
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:04,640
I'm sure that my mother knew that I wouldn't have a family.

186
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,640
What kind of hero?

187
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:14,640
In the future, I can marry a stable man, a stable doctor.

188
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,640
That's the best option.

189
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:21,640
You can't marry anyone. You're just a regular person.

190
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,640
Of course I'm.

191
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:30,640
Since I was born, I've been so upset that I don't want to marry anyone.

192
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,640
Aya.

193
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:24,640
Why don't you go home and rest?

194
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,640
You're a good girl.

195
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,640
Don't even think about your little wife.

196
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,640
She dares to fight anyway.

197
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,640
What are you doing at my door?

198
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:39,640
I'm here to find you.

199
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:43,640
I want to get married with He Zhaojun.

200
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,640
He's not a good man.

201
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,640
He's a good man.

202
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,640
He's a good man.

203
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,640
He's a good man.

204
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,640
I don't want to get married.

205
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,640
I don't want to get married.

206
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,640
I know that he won't agree.

207
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,640
I agree.

208
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,640
You agree?

209
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,640
There's a big brother in the second house.

210
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:09,640
You can't sacrifice your life with your own life.

211
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,640
You're right.

212
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,640
No problem.

213
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,640
As long as you have no choice,

214
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:18,640
I will set up everything for you.

215
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,640
Thank you.

216
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,640
I agree on the application.

217
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,640
I agree with it.

218
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,640
But there are also many more.

219
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,640
What's there?

220
00:14:41,640 --> 00:15:08,520
Knights we wish you conquer

221
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,320
oops

222
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,280
I heard it.

223
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:10,880
It's a bridge.

224
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,600
It's here.

225
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,800
It's not a long time ago.

226
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,520
Guanyang,

227
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,760
what happened to the bridge?

228
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,160
It was a woman and a man.

229
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,280
I've brought you two here.

230
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,720
The bridge is shaking.

231
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,040
It's not moving.

232
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,400
I want to find someone to fix it.

233
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,600
Who knows that the bridge is strange.

234
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,920
No matter which wood

235
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,200
will hold it.

236
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,000
It seems that

237
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,800
we can only open the new bridge.

238
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,840
I'm going to tell the general.

239
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,320
Thank you.

240
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,900
Uncle Wan cał video been 것守

241
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,400
I need to ask him about gas.

242
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,240
Who's there?

243
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,200
therefore asked me for good condition.

244
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:54,000
Open the new bridge to painful

245
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,020
Yep.

246
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,260
Here are the other houses.

247
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:03,760
Sit here for a while so I can ask 215A to come here.

248
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,400
Come.

249
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,660
Sit properly.

250
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:06,660
I'll go to the market.

251
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:09,660
Son, you know that I like building power the most.

252
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:12,660
I want to take a break before I take off the bridge.

253
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:13,660
Let's go.

254
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,660
It's a bridge to be taken off.

255
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:18,660
I don't want to follow him.

256
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,660
I'll go to the market first.

257
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:22,660
After you finish the bridge, come over here.

258
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:23,660
I'll learn it from you.

259
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:25,660
Don't come here later.

260
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,660
I'll go to the market.

261
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,660
Our old house is closed.

262
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,660
This is what I want.

263
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,660
I just want to make myself fit here.

264
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:24,660
In a big way.

265
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,660
General Ling, I'm sorry last night.

266
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:34,660
I'm sorry.

267
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,660
I'm sorry.

268
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,660
I'm sorry.

269
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:39,660
It's okay.

270
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,660
I'm just a little bit tired.

271
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,660
I didn't find the map.

272
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:46,660
I'm very lucky.

273
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:49,660
It was General Wan who took the military.

274
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:52,660
General Wan didn't see the map.

275
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:54,660
Didn't see it?

276
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:56,660
Of course not.

277
00:17:56,660 --> 00:18:00,660
General Lin, you're a good man.

278
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,660
You can't protect it.

279
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:05,660
Why did I leave a treasure map?

280
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,660
What's the next step?

281
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:14,660
Right.

282
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:18,660
I'm lucky to have the emperor's reward.

283
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,660
The whole family is happy.

284
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:22,660
It's a good time to be a good man.

285
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,660
I'm not in a hurry to read the holy text.

286
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:25,660
I... I...

287
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:27,660
I... I... I... I...

288
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:31,660
General Lin, you're here.

289
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:34,660
Why don't we go out?

290
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:45,660
General Lin, General Lin, stop.

291
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,660
The assassin is a dangerous man.

292
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,660
He'll be back in two steps.

293
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:52,660
Why don't we go this way?

294
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:55,660
I'll go too.

295
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,660
Go.

296
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:13,660
So you're a dangerous man.

297
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,660
Be careful.

298
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:19,660
Yes, be careful.

299
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,660
I'm going to take the money.

300
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:31,660
I'll go, I'll go.

301
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:34,660
I'll go.

302
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:36,660
Let's go.

303
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:38,660
Go.

304
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:40,660
Go.

305
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:42,660
Go.

306
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,660
Go.

307
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,660
Go.

308
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,660
Go.

309
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,660
Go.

310
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,660
Go.

311
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,660
Go.

312
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,660
Go.

313
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,660
Go.

314
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,660
Go.

315
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:03,660
Go.

316
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,660
Go.

317
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:07,660
Go.

318
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:16,660
Go.

319
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:19,660
Go.

320
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,660
Go.

321
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:24,660
Go.

322
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:25,660
I'm not sure.

323
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:26,660
Okay.

324
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,660
Shao Shao.

325
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,660
You go first.

326
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:30,660
I...

327
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:31,660
I go first.

328
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:33,660
It's annoying.

329
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:34,660
I'm a teacher in Guam.

330
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:35,660
I've been called by God.

331
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:37,660
I'll go first.

332
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:38,660
You go first.

333
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:39,660
You go first.

334
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:40,660
Okay.

335
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:55,660
Come here.

336
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:00,660
Don't move.

337
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:09,660
That's right.

338
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:45,660
Don't move.

339
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:53,660
I'll teach you.

340
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:56,660
No!

341
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:17,340
Next time...

342
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:18,860
sleepwalk bugs again.

343
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:31,540
Stan directions I did not have

344
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:38,180
Soon after you forgot

345
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:45,860
Two majorримum

346
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:48,700
Imagine by your Teacher

347
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,340
How he learned

348
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,620
He left

349
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:57,620
In this world, other things are just like that.

350
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:00,620
Why is it the general?

351
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:03,620
If it wasn't for me, you already got hurt.

352
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:05,620
The courage is really big.

353
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:07,620
You don't know how to finish.

354
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:09,620
How dare you scold yourself?

355
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,620
The general is a little timid.

356
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:16,620
I was just because the man and the woman were not close.

357
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:18,620
The general is too close to me.

358
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:20,620
I'm scared.

359
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:21,620
Aren't you scared?

360
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,620
You caught my arm and said it was too close.

361
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:26,620
You were too close to me.

362
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:29,620
And if I really was too close to you,

363
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:32,620
that's because I've been listening to you for a long time.

364
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:35,620
And you're really interested in me.

365
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:37,620
You're listening to me?

366
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:47,620
General Lin,

367
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:49,620
everything I said was a lie.

368
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:51,620
You don't have to put it in your heart.

369
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:54,620
Besides, the general also said in my house

370
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:58,620
that I'm like a informant in the court.

371
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:00,620
Right?

372
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:02,620
The lady Chen Qiao Xia is listening to the military.

373
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:03,620
She went to the court,

374
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:05,620
but she can't be an informant.

375
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:07,620
She can only be a criminal.

376
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:08,620
What informant?

377
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:10,620
General Lin,

378
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:11,620
even if I offended you,

379
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:13,620
don't talk nonsense.

380
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,620
Yes, I'm in the court.

381
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,620
But I really can't hear anything.

382
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:18,620
Really?

383
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:20,620
Yes.

384
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:27,620
General Lin,

385
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:29,620
I really can't hear anything.

386
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:31,620
You're in the court.

387
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:33,620
I really can't hear anything.

388
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:43,620
Look at that lady Chen.

389
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:44,620
She's so beautiful.

390
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:45,620
She's so beautiful.

391
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:46,620
I can't see anything.

392
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:47,620
I want to laugh.

393
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,620
Don't let my lady hear it.

394
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:51,620
I'll punish you.

395
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:52,620
I'll punish you.

396
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:56,620
I think

397
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:59,620
everything is clear.

398
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,620
I'm so nervous.

399
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:04,620
I can't hear anything.

400
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:05,620
Really?

401
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:06,620
General Lin.

402
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:14,620
General Wan,

403
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:15,620
the private secretary is looking for the map.

404
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:16,620
I brought it here to look for the map.

405
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,620
This is what General Lin said.

406
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:22,620
I didn't want to hear it.

407
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:30,620
You've signed the agreement.

408
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:31,620
That agreement

409
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,620
might have been passed to the public.

410
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:34,620
But after the agreement,

411
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:35,620
it's going to be passed to the public.

412
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:37,620
So the map of the land is not allowed to be burned.

413
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:41,620
But General Wan is hiding the map.

414
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:42,620
Lady Chen,

415
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:44,620
you should think about it.

416
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:46,620
You and General Wan are friends.

417
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,620
You're married and have a close relationship.

418
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:50,620
If you get the chance,

419
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:53,620
how will you deal with the family of the people

420
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:55,620
and the family of the city?

421
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:59,620
How would General Lin know

422
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:00,620
that the map of the land

423
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:01,620
must be in the secret.

424
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:02,620
If I don't know,

425
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:05,620
I won't be in Wan's house.

426
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:09,620
Uncle Wan only loves to drink and play.

427
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:11,620
Will he not be loyal to his body?

428
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:13,620
He might just think...

429
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:14,620
He just think

430
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:17,620
it's a treasure map.

431
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:19,620
I guess so.

432
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,620
General Lin can't do anything.

433
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:25,620
He should know

434
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:27,620
where the treasure map is.

435
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:29,620
All the small roads in Wan's house have been searched.

436
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:31,620
I have a lot of trouble

437
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:33,620
to find someone to help me.

438
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:34,620
So

439
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:37,620
I have to trouble Lady Chen.

440
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:42,620
Why don't you find yourself?

441
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:43,620
If I say

442
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:46,620
I'm not good at it,

443
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,620
I'm doing it for the sake of Wan's house.

444
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:51,620
Do you believe me?

445
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:57,620
If Lady Chen helps me with the map,

446
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:59,620
I can keep it

447
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:01,620
and keep it safe.

448
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:03,620
What do you want to do?

449
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:08,620
I want to play the game.

450
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:13,620
So you want to play the game.

451
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:31,620
I'll wait for

452
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:33,620
Lady Chen's good news.

453
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:35,620
Lady Chen will help me today.

454
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:37,620
I will fulfill your wish

455
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:39,620
in the next days.

456
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:30,620
Qiqi,

457
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,620
how old are you?

458
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:36,620
Are you still playing hide-and-seek with your mother?

459
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:41,620
I'm not.

460
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:44,620
You should rest.

461
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:45,620
Go on.

462
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:46,620
Yes.

463
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:56,620
Qiqi,

464
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:58,620
I forgot to thank Zhu Chai.

465
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:00,620
If you come to me

466
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:02,620
and take her to the box

467
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:04,620
at the bookstore,

468
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:07,620
I'll talk to you.

469
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:08,620
Do you hear me?

470
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:13,620
I'm waiting for you.

471
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:28,620
Here's aЕ

472
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:38,620
and aters Mommy.

473
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:52,620
We're going to find

474
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:54,620
Don't touch the box that you want to spend.

475
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:57,620
Don't touch the box that you want to spend.

476
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:02,620
That's your father's treasure in the grave.

477
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,620
If you make a mistake,

478
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:07,620
you will be punished for stealing and committing crimes.

479
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:09,620
Do you hear me?

480
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:13,620
I'm asking you.

481
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:25,620
Those with Windows

482
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:29,620
You should do what you love to.

483
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:30,620
Now take it.

484
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:31,620
Or try to be a cべtsom in life.

485
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:40,620
If you try TF11-S

486
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:45,620
I have a crush on Windows

487
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:48,620
Thatvyong?

488
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:51,100
Better let me show you!

489
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:53,880
Yep, leave the keys.

490
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:56,860
Ok…

491
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,280
Put the plating away.

492
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:06,880
Yes, this is Zhen's address.

493
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:09,020
Residence, usually it's got to be the same.

494
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:09,600
What's that?

495
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:10,440
Remember your fortune last time?

496
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,320
No way.

497
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:12,820
But theelli's name isambic,

498
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:13,940
so it's quite rare to see a live fly!

499
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:16,520
Zhen Yan signed it for you.

500
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,220
But what about Tya?

501
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:22,140
General...

502
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:23,540
Good morning, matters.

503
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:24,580
General!

504
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,160
You'll be at們 for a few more days,

505
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,480
so I'll excuse myself here.

506
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,380
General,

507
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:30,180
I've never known you...

508
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:31,720
Your time is near.

509
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,440
I'll be waiting outside.

510
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:34,620
General.

511
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:35,540
Excuse me.

512
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:36,980
No.

513
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:37,860
General!

514
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:39,420
General!

515
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:46,840
Single, all this is unmanly for you.

516
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:49,220
You're just like that.

517
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:07,220
Amu! Amu!

518
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:11,220
Amu, what's wrong with you?

519
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:13,220
I just let that bastard go.

520
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:14,220
Did he leave?

521
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:15,220
He did.

522
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,220
Really?

523
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:18,220
What's wrong with him?

524
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:20,220
He said he had a few days off.

525
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:22,220
He went to the door to drink.

526
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:27,220
Thank you for your advice.

527
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:28,220
Amu, what are you talking about?

528
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:30,220
What's the big deal?

529
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:38,220
Amu.

530
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:48,220
Come here.

531
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:49,220
Come here.

532
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:55,220
Come closer.

533
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:57,220
Amu.

534
00:34:58,220 --> 00:34:59,220
Come closer.

535
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:02,220
Amu, please.

536
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:20,220
Younger sister, Uncle Chang is still not finished.

537
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,220
Why did she leave?

538
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:23,220
I really miss my father.

539
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:24,220
I...

540
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:27,220
Amu, stop fighting.

541
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:31,220
Amu, what's wrong with you?

542
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:34,220
Amu, protect me.

543
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:48,220
Amu, my son.

544
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:55,220
Amu, what's wrong with you?

545
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:58,220
Amu, what's wrong with you?

546
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:01,220
Amu, why don't you come here?

547
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:03,220
I don't want to go.

548
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:05,220
I don't want to go.

549
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:08,220
Amu.

550
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:11,220
Amu, what's wrong with you?

551
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:14,220
Amu, what's wrong with you?

552
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:15,220
Father.

553
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:20,220
Father, you're wrong.

554
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:22,220
Amu killed me this time.

555
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:23,220
I won't run away.

556
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:27,220
A few days ago,

557
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:29,220
you were in Prince Luyang's mansion.

558
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:32,220
Now you're suffering in Wan's mansion.

559
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:35,220
Besides, he's wrong.

560
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:37,220
Don't punish him.

561
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:39,220
Only he can make others suffer.

562
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:41,220
Who can make him suffer?

563
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:43,220
Besides, can Wan's mansion suffer?

564
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:44,220
Why not?

565
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:45,220
How long has it been?

566
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:47,220
He's been suffering for a long time.

567
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:50,220
He's been suffering for a long time.

568
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:54,220
You're wrong.

569
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:55,220
Where's the wrong one?

570
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:09,220
I used to think that

571
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:11,220
the sky is high and the ground is wide.

572
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:12,220
I'm fine.

573
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:14,220
I always wanted to run away.

574
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:16,220
But now I understand.

575
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:18,220
It's better out here.

576
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:20,220
There's no home.

577
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:23,220
Father, you can't go anywhere

578
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:25,220
just to see your son.

579
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:27,220
Fine.

580
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:29,220
Fine?

581
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:32,220
Tell me.

582
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:34,220
What happened to Wan's mansion?

583
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:38,220
Lin Buyi went to Wan's mansion.

584
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:41,220
Why did he go to Wan's mansion?

585
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:42,220
What?

586
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:46,220
To find a way to cure him?

587
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:51,220
Mother,

588
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:53,220
I didn't know that

589
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:54,220
you were in Wan's mansion.

590
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:55,220
I just thought that

591
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:56,220
Lin Buyi was so mean.

592
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:58,220
So I came back.

593
00:37:58,220 --> 00:37:59,220
Well,

594
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:01,220
when father and Lin Buyi were talking,

595
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:03,220
I felt that

596
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:05,220
they were both in love.

597
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:07,220
You're so mean.

598
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:09,220
I'm afraid you can't change your mind.

599
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:11,220
I heard it without a doubt.

600
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:15,220
I lost the military line.

601
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:17,220
Lin Buyi was suspicious of the military line

602
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:18,220
and sold it to the land.

603
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:19,220
The land was in second place.

604
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:21,220
So he wanted to find this map.

605
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:22,220
Is this a matter?

606
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:24,220
Are you a little girl?

607
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:25,220
Should you discuss it?

608
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:27,220
You've been talking about family affairs.

609
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:29,220
This is a national matter.

610
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:32,220
General,

611
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:34,220
the military is different.

612
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:37,220
We can't talk about it alone.

613
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:40,220
You're right.

614
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:46,220
Nianniao,

615
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:50,220
can you talk about it with others?

616
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:51,220
No.

617
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:53,220
Nianniao only talked to her mother.

618
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:55,220
She never talked to third person.

619
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:57,220
Nianniao,

620
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:59,220
you must be in the belly.

621
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:01,220
You can't talk to third person.

622
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:06,220
You've done the wrong thing

623
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:08,220
for the man.

624
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,220
Go back.

625
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:25,220
Where is he?

626
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:29,220
I...

627
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:31,220
I haven't asked him about his matter.

628
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:32,220
I'm asking you.

629
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:33,220
Madam,

630
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:35,220
you've forgiven Nianniao.

631
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:37,220
Even if you've done it,

632
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:38,220
I...

633
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:40,220
When did I say that?

634
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:42,220
You just said it.

635
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:44,220
Why don't you remember

636
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:45,220
what you said?

637
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:46,220
I...

638
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:47,220
Madam,

639
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:50,220
is it a counter-attack?

640
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:03,220
If we have this map,

641
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:05,220
we can make it in advance.

642
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:07,220
We can't make a big deal out of it.

643
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:10,220
But, Master,

644
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:11,220
you've found out

645
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:13,220
where the painting is hidden.

646
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:15,220
You can go there yourself.

647
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:17,220
Why do you have to do this?

648
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:19,220
You even owe Madam Cheng Si a favor.

649
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:20,220
Master,

650
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:22,220
if we find it out,

651
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:23,220
General Wan

652
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:24,220
will have to take the blame

653
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:25,220
for hiding the painting.

654
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:26,220
But if

655
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:27,220
Madam Wan

656
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:29,220
takes the painting

657
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:31,220
and gives it to us,

658
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:33,220
then it's another matter.

659
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:38,220
So, it's this reason.

660
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:43,220
I'm so generous.

661
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:46,220
I still think it's a misunderstanding.

662
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:49,220
I'm going to take a break.

663
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:51,220
I'm afraid that

664
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:53,220
some of the people in the city

665
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:55,220
will be able to solve it.

666
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:57,220
If they take it away from us,

667
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:59,220
and don't dare to do anything,

668
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:01,220
then we'll have to take their hands.

669
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:03,220
That's much more difficult.

670
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:05,220
You and I are in the West.

671
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:07,220
It's for the sake of the city.

672
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:09,220
But those who are guilty

673
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:12,220
of the guilty will not be able to do it.

674
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:14,220
If they think

675
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:17,220
the West is going to do something to them,

676
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:21,220
what will they do?

677
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:23,220
They'll jump and attack us.

678
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:25,220
Master,

679
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:27,220
what should we do next?

680
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:30,220
Of course, it's the door to the door to the door.

681
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:33,220
Let them get up first.

682
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:39,220
Youzi, let's go!

683
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:41,220
Let's go!

684
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:42,220
Go!

685
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:43,220
Go!

686
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:44,220
Go!

687
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:47,220
Master, we've searched everywhere.

688
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:48,220
The enemy is too fast.

689
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:49,220
We can't catch up.

690
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:50,220
Bastard!

691
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:52,220
You can't catch up with the bandits!

692
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:53,220
What's the use of you?

693
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:57,220
Master, we've found out

694
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:59,220
that there's no important thing in the house.

695
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:01,220
Master, it's bad!

696
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:03,220
Master, it's bad!

697
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:05,220
Ling!

698
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:06,220
Ling!

699
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:07,220
What are you doing?

700
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:08,220
You've got the gun!

701
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:09,220
It's General Ling!

702
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:11,220
He's going to destroy us with the Black Sleeves!
