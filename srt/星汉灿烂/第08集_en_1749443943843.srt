1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,520
to be continued

2
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,880
and

3
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:51,580
Magic

4
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,240
I didn't have any choice.

5
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,080
Kizhi is here.

6
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,760
questioned.

7
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,420
Why wouldn't I judge at all?

8
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:14,080
Kizhi praised me to death,

9
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,820
then he said that someone is gonna answer it.

10
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,640
We were on the sidelines talking and we weren't able to take her

11
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,860
to the ring.

12
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,760
I guessed her мне.

13
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,380
Ye Ye didn't care about me.

14
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,640
We just got married.

15
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:28,480
When we were young,

16
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,480
after they showed

17
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,480
Try it.

18
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,480
Try it.

19
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,480
I think it's the first time for you to eat it.

20
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,480
Eat more.

21
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,480
It's just a gold spoon.

22
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,480
It's very good.

23
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,480
I've never had a stick.

24
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,480
Gold spoon is for you.

25
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,480
You never had it before.

26
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,480
177, today is the birthday of the princess.

27
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,480
The man who wrote the words of the devil is like a cat.

28
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,480
When the night comes, the family will take the treasure with them.

29
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,480
The emperor is afraid that I'm the daughter of the witch.

30
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,480
What?

31
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,480
You want to say the emperor is also a man like a cat?

32
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,480
This morning, it's really delicious.

33
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,480
Sister Chengjia, you're wrong.

34
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,480
This is not the real morning.

35
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:31,480
This morning, it's made of sugar and milk.

36
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,480
It's not the morning.

37
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,480
The emperor is the best singer.

38
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,480
You're going to be a snake.

39
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,480
Don't talk about the emperor.

40
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,480
You don't see your own clothes.

41
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:50,480
Yes, it's so bright.

42
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,480
Why do you wear a coat and follow the earth?

43
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,480
I'm afraid you don't want to be a golden treasure.

44
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,480
The 777-th prince and the general have been fighting for years.

45
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:06,480
It's not easy to follow the emperor's family.

46
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,480
Who will spend more time on the work?

47
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,480
It's a good idea.

48
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,480
Besides, the soldiers are fighting in the battlefield.

49
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,480
You're in the capital of the country.

50
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,480
We're the five generals in the capital.

51
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,480
But it's not easy.

52
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,480
We don't eat and drink in the camp.

53
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:27,480
Besides, the children are good at cooking.

54
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,480
They are good at cooking.

55
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,480
They are good at cooking.

56
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:35,480
They are good at fighting.

57
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,480
You think about the server.

58
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:41,480
You don't know how to be funny after we're the five generals.

59
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,480
Russian

60
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,480
Russian

61
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,480
Russian

62
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,480
Your Majesty, the general is here.

63
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,480
Russian

64
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,480
Sister Cheng's temperament is too high.

65
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,480
We are just kidding.

66
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:08,480
Don't make a joke in front of the guests.

67
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,480
Where are the guests from?

68
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,040
You?

69
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,400
You?

70
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,440
Or you are a guest?

71
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,520
Wang Ling,

72
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,400
you are so insolent.

73
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,760
It's Shiyi Lang.

74
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,440
Shiyi Lang is here today

75
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,400
to celebrate the birthday of the princess.

76
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,400
I forgot.

77
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,080
Sister Cheng Jia

78
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,160
seems to be locked up in the closet all the time.

79
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,400
She has never seen Shiyi Lang before.

80
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,360
How about this?

81
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,440
Today,

82
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,680
you should listen to her.

83
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,280
You might not be able to look at her.

84
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,320
Wang Ling,

85
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,120
look at your face.

86
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,600
You want to see Shiyi Lang?

87
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,640
Go and see her.

88
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,520
She is just a little sister.

89
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,000
Who else do I think it is?

90
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,160
It's Shiyi Lang.

91
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,920
I'll be in your company.

92
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,920
By the way, Wang Ling,

93
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,960
Shiyi Lang has been watching me for a long time.

94
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,680
But I'm not interested in her.

95
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,600
I can only feel awkward when I see her.

96
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,200
I'll be with you.

97
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,720
Here are your paintings.

98
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,480
What do you think?

99
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:47,800
cktneed

100
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,880
Great painting.

101
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,120
It's like

102
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,600
you are

103
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,440
no features in my life.

104
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,840
Shiyi Lang,

105
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,120
Do you really want to fire me?

106
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,540
Not a good idea.

107
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,820
Damn.

108
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:24,480
The WHAT is better than nothing?

109
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,840
Hello?

110
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,400
General Ling, take a seat.

111
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,400
Maybe it's because of the weather.

112
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,400
I...

113
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,400
Oh, my stomach.

114
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,400
Let's go.

115
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,400
General Lin, you can accept my invitation.

116
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,400
You came to my birthday party.

117
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,400
I'm very happy.

118
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,400
I regret it already.

119
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,400
I can't tolerate the royal family.

120
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,400
General Lin, you've been working in the battlefield.

121
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,400
I can't wait for the sun to set.

122
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,400
How can I not tolerate it?

123
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,400
I was just trying to make you laugh.

124
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,400
If I can't look at the new martial arts,

125
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,400
I won't invite some of my sisters here.

126
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:21,000
But I don't have any martial arts

127
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,400
in this time.

128
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,400
You're so sweet.

129
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,400
You just left with your sister.

130
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,400
You haven't been in the military yet.

131
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,400
General Lin, where are you going?

132
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,400
You're starting the martial arts ceremony.

133
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,400
I'll talk to the five generals.

134
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,400
Wait.

135
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,400
Shiyi Lang is Lin Buyi.

136
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,400
Lin Buyi is Shiyi Lang.

137
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,400
You don't even know what Shiyi Lang looks like.

138
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,400
You just said he's close to you.

139
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,400
I didn't mean to bully Wang Lin.

140
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,400
Who knew that?

141
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,400
General Lin seems to be very familiar with the Empress.

142
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,400
Who is familiar with her?

143
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,400
Do you remember the old man who was arrested?

144
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,400
When he was arrested,

145
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,400
I sent a message to him.

146
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,400
He was so hot-headed.

147
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,400
He came to my house and said something to me.

148
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,400
Do you know that

149
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,400
the new one, Princess Yuchang, is Lin Buyi?

150
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,400
That day, the light was on.

151
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,400
Princess Yuchang fell into the water.

152
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,400
Do you know that?

153
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,400
I know.

154
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,400
I was just having a hot bath that day.

155
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,400
But I found Princess Yuchang was in the water.

156
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,400
She was pretending to be a puddle.

157
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,400
She was on the way to the pool.

158
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,400
I forced her to throw her into the pool.

159
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,400
Shiyi!

160
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,400
Then she fell into the water.

161
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,400
You did it then!

162
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,400
I've heard that Princess Yuchang was a weakling.

163
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,400
She was doing it for Lin Buyi.

164
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:56,400
I didn't know that she was being fooled by you.

165
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,400
When she came back,

166
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,400
both eyes were like a rotten peach.

167
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,400
Everyone in the city was laughing.

168
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,400
Xia Zi,

169
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,400
this is the end.

170
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,400
Don't tell anyone about it.

171
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,400
Don't let my mother know.

172
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,400
She will slap me.

173
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,400
What is this?

174
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,400
It's a deep-sea.

175
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,400
It's like a red-eyed man.

176
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,400
He won't come or slap me.

177
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,400
Me neither.

178
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,400
I hate it the most.

179
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,400
I hate it when people are more interested in the family.

180
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,400
I hate it when the members of the family are more interested in me.

181
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,400
I hate it when the world is more interested in Fu.

182
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,400
She's not like the parents of the family.

183
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,400
She's a stubborn girl.

184
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,400
She's not going anywhere.

185
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,400
Qi Qi and Wan Bo Fu

186
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,400
are really thinking like this.

187
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,400
Of course.

188
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,400
I think

189
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,400
you and Qi Qi are

190
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,400
like a game of chess.

191
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,400
I think that A Zi is a good girl.

192
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,400
But she doesn't seem like a good person.

193
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,400
She's the youngest in the family.

194
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,400
She's also the boss.

195
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,400
Who's the boss?

196
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,400
This is a real boss.

197
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,400
He knows the rules behind it.

198
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,400
Where is he?

199
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,400
I'm afraid that he's with the company.

200
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,400
He's with the company.

201
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,400
Let's go.

202
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,400
Let's find him.

203
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,400
Wait, Qi Jia Zi.

204
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,400
I'm not going.

205
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,400
You go first.

206
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,400
I'll go around.

207
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,400
Be careful.

208
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,400
Those girls look weak.

209
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,400
They don't have a good match.

210
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,400
Wen Jiang Yang, you go with me.

211
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,400
Go, hurry.

212
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,400
Qi Qi.

213
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,400
I'll go with you.

214
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,400
I'll go with you.

215
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,400
Don't follow me, Prince.

216
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,400
Sister Zhao Jun.

217
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,400
Sister Zhao Jun.

218
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,400
Wait for me.

219
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,400
Prince, don't be like this.

220
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,400
Sister Zhao Jun.

221
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,400
Sister Zhao Jun.

222
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,400
Sister Zhao Jun.

223
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,400
Prince, don't be like this.

224
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,400
What's the matter with the princess's birthday?

225
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,400
I'm very angry with you today.

226
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,400
I have a wish to marry her.

227
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,400
But you always avoid me.

228
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,400
But I'm not good at everything.

229
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,400
I'm not good at making sister Zhao Jun's birthday.

230
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,400
We only know each other for a few days.

231
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,400
Now, it's too fast to propose.

232
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,400
Besides,

233
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,400
I have a engagement.

234
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,400
You mean the guy from the building?

235
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,400
Didn't you say that

236
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,400
he's stupid and only knows how to teach you?

237
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,400
But if I get married,

238
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,400
Aya will be disobeyed.

239
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,400
You always consider for her.

240
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,400
But she doesn't know how to cherish you.

241
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,400
She always makes you angry.

242
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,400
I feel sorry for her.

243
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,400
Are you my wife?

244
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,400
Are you from the Cheng family's biological mother clan?

245
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,400
You look like a dicky.

246
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,400
What's wrong with you?

247
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,400
My parents marry me.

248
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,000
I don't wear this color anymore.

249
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,400
What's your parents' business?

250
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,560
You've received Mrs. Sang's letter.

251
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,960
It's none of your business.

252
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,120
If you want to thank me,

253
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,320
just say it.

254
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,120
If you come up, say you're angry.

255
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,160
Thank you, young master.

256
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,680
I've been in the jade world

257
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,800
and I've been busy.

258
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,480
I've been feeling better.

259
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,760
I'm here to thank you.

260
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,320
I'll do my best.

261
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,000
If you're upset,

262
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,480
I won't do it.

263
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,520
Okay.

264
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,320
I'll do it.

265
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,040
But don't worry.

266
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,320
I won't let you rebel against me.

267
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,000
I won't let you be betrayed.

268
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,800
I won't let you marry me.

269
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,080
Let's not go through this.

270
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,880
Who said no to you?

271
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,360
You're right.

272
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,400
Zhejiang

273
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,200
Don't laugh.

274
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,260
Stop it.

275
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,720
Don't laugh.

276
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,200
I'll admit it.

277
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,000
I'll accept it.

278
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,120
But don't be like this.

279
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:35,720
Okay?

280
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,240
I'll forgive you.

281
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,600
No, Sob signs are not so much heroes.

282
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,920
Iilling never do.

283
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,440
Ição is reborn.

284
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,760
I won't let you be a fool.

285
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,760
I won't let you be a fool.

286
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,760
You just go to marry her.

287
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,760
I never leave you with a marriage.

288
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,760
I just want to be with my family.

289
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,760
I've never had the chance to see you.

290
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,760
Fine.

291
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:01,760
You're so naive.

292
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,760
Then you should go.

293
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,760
Why don't you marry her?

294
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:05,760
She's never like you.

295
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,760
She's kind and kind.

296
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,760
She's more than a thousand times better than you.

297
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,760
Bye-bye.

298
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,760
Listen,

299
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,760
I'll go with her to the wedding.

300
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,760
When she comes,

301
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,760
we'll go to the mountain.

302
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,760
She met a good friend in the city.

303
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,760
She said she'd send me off.

304
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,760
I don't know how long I'll be with her.

305
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,760
Maybe you'll never see her again.

306
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,760
Fine.

307
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,760
I'll do it.

308
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,760
Fine.

309
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,760
Stop!

310
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,760
What are you looking at?

311
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,760
You're looking at me like a pig.

312
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,760
Sorry, young master.

313
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,760
Don't take it to heart.

314
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,760
I'm not the only one who's...

315
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,760
Xuan Sheng, you bastard.

316
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,760
Why don't you take me with you?

317
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,760
Men and women are not close.

318
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,760
Besides,

319
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,760
you're not going to marry me.

320
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,760
I'm going to tell you

321
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,760
what happened today.

322
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,760
I can't.

323
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,760
Do you know who they were?

324
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,760
The man was a second-hand right-hand man in the East.

325
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,760
He was a right-hand man.

326
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,760
The other was a female.

327
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,760
He Zhao Jun.

328
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,760
He Yong's daughter.

329
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,760
They're close.

330
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,760
I don't want to know.

331
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,760
What's the relationship between them?

332
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,760
You're a big man.

333
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,760
You're not as good as a teacher.

334
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,760
You're like a teacher.

335
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,760
You're like a teacher.

336
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,760
You should learn from your teacher.

337
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,760
You're a good teacher.

338
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,760
You're a good teacher.

339
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,760
Mrs. Cheng doesn't have a plan for you.

340
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,760
Should I go back to the capital

341
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,760
and ask for a female teacher for your sisters?

342
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,760
I can recommend you.

343
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,760
Go away.

344
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,760
If Xiao He and his sisters get married,

345
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,760
then this case will be more complicated.

346
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,760
This case must be solved as soon as possible.

347
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,760
Go and check.

348
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,760
Which officials have come to the capital

349
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,760
for the past six months?

350
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,760
The Young Master

351
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,760
suspected that he had a relationship with the Young Master.

352
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,760
Several soldiers have been in the capital.

353
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,760
The capital has been in the capital for many years.

354
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:25,760
There's no war.

355
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,760
Why did they buy so many soldiers?

356
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,760
I'm afraid the capital has a second-hand.

357
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:34,760
We must make a plan.

358
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,760
This life

359
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,760
is really a problem.

360
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,760
The capital doesn't have an official.

361
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,760
What happens to me?

362
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,760
Look at where I'm peaking.

363
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,760
Where?

364
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,760
My camera is just a little bit off.

365
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,760
맛있게.

366
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,760
It doesn't work.

367
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,160
Help!

368
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,560
The third lady is in the water!

369
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,160
Help!

370
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,160
Help! Help!

371
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,160
Taro!

372
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,160
Help!

373
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,160
Help!

374
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,760
Help! Help!

375
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,760
Help!

376
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,760
Help!

377
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,760
Help!

378
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,760
Taro, come here!

379
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,760
Taro!

380
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,760
Be careful!

381
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,760
Why are you in the water?

382
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,760
I knew it!

383
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,760
I can only do it when I'm in the water.

384
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,760
Don't be so ashamed to marry them!

385
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,760
Shame?

386
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,760
You're not only a good lady,

387
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,760
but also a good man.

388
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,760
Is the world more beautiful than you?

389
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,760
That's right.

390
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,760
You're a good lady.

391
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,760
You're a good lady.

392
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,760
You've been abandoning your parents since you were a child.

393
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,760
If your parents didn't teach you,

394
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,760
how would they know what a bright and bright future is?

395
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,760
What rules are they in?

396
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,760
The reason for your loss of your parents' lives

397
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,760
is only because you're such a good lady.

398
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,760
Only a good lady can do it!

399
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,760
Get up!

400
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,760
Get up!

401
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,760
Get up!

402
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,760
Get up!

403
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,760
Let me bully you!

404
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,760
Stop!

405
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,760
Let me bully you!

406
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,760
Let me bully you!

407
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,760
Let me bully you!

408
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,760
Stop!

409
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,760
Get up!

410
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,760
I'll beat you to death!

411
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,760
Stop!

412
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,760
Stop!

413
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:09,760
Stop it!

414
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,760
Stop it!

415
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,760
Let me go!

416
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,760
Let me go!

417
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,760
Let me go!

418
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,760
Are you crazy?

419
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,760
You're going to beat me!

420
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,760
You're a criminal!

421
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,760
You're a criminal!

422
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,760
You're going to fight!

423
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,760
You're going to fight!

424
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,760
The word of the city is really...

425
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,760
really...

426
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,760
really...

427
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,760
Let me go!

428
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,760
Let me go!

429
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,760
Look at her!

430
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,760
Why are you so stubborn?

431
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,760
Who taught a woman such a bad manners?

432
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,760
The Wang family is my family's most important.

433
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,760
How can you let your mother out of the business?

434
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,760
It's a mistake!

435
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,760
How can you let your mother out of the business alone?

436
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,760
The old lady is angry.

437
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,760
There are mistakes in everything today.

438
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:11,760
But even if you're angry, you should find a doctor

439
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,760
to see the Wang family's son.

440
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,760
If he gets a scar,

441
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,760
I'm afraid he'll be late.

442
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,760
The young sister is so serious about it.

443
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,760
The Wang family's wife is so cruel to you.

444
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,760
You...

445
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,760
I've never been so cruel to anyone.

446
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:29,760
She was the one who hit me first.

447
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,760
She was a lunatic!

448
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,760
Where's the evidence?

449
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,760
I...

450
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,760
That's right.

451
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,760
I was the one who hit you first.

452
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:47,760
I went to habrточprey that Mr.設�

453
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,760
so he could hit abbreak also,

454
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:54,760
but the guy always TechnRo sent sent me a message!

455
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,760
OMG!

456
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,980
What a reliable sister!

457
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,220
What in the world?

458
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:11,220
I'm a fatherless mother, I can't teach.

459
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:13,220
I'm a fatherless mother, I can't teach.

460
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:17,220
I can't do anything about the fact that people are so cruel.

461
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:21,220
So, today's matter is our parents' matter.

462
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:24,220
We can't teach our daughter well.

463
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:27,220
Ling'er always has a sharp tongue and a heart.

464
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,220
She doesn't know how many people she has offended.

465
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:31,220
Even if she says something wrong today...

466
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:33,220
She doesn't say anything wrong.

467
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:35,220
The truth is...

468
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:40,220
She says everything right.

469
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:43,220
I can't change this matter.

470
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:46,220
If she makes me a family member and pushes me down,

471
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:48,220
I can't forgive her.

472
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:50,220
You're not going to hit me?

473
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:54,220
Is it because you're so stupid that you want to study hard?

474
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:57,220
Do you know that people are so cruel and rude?

475
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:59,220
Is it because of the family's education?

476
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:02,220
Today, they said that we were so weak after we were five.

477
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:04,220
But the sister of Cheng Yang, who knows the rules,

478
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:06,220
she was dumped by them.

479
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:08,220
Yang Yang, do you think...

480
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:12,220
Yang Yang, can you still speak?

481
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:14,220
I can't speak.

482
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:17,220
Look at Yang Yang.

483
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:22,220
What do you think?

484
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:24,220
It's just a joke between sisters.

485
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:26,220
How can you make a mistake easily?

486
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:28,220
If Wen Xiu Jun finds out,

487
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:31,220
will you be punished?

488
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:34,220
It's just a joke between the girls.

489
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:36,220
You can't hurt her.

490
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:38,220
If the old lady wants to be punished,

491
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:40,220
she has to be punished together.

492
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:43,220
You should do it first.

493
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:47,220
It's just that Yang Yang and the others will be in the water first.

494
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:50,220
They want to use half of the horse and put me in the lake.

495
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,220
You're a liar!

496
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:54,220
You're so rude.

497
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:56,220
How can you say that?

498
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:58,220
General Ling is here.

499
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:04,220
Now what?

500
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:13,220
Young servants?

501
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:27,220
S Birch.

502
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,220
Present your son.

503
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,420
You four are the ones who suggest trouble in WWR

504
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:35,420
and are now having an excellent failure.

505
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:39,700
And there are witness invоartment.

506
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:44,020
If you wish to investigate since you are in oral maximum,

507
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:44,580
03 pleasure token

508
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:45,660
needs only an evidence.

509
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:48,880
So...

510
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:52,840
nicer.

511
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:00,180
You are so amazing, YE Yong!

512
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:03,180
Why did you pick up a bunch of bad rope?

513
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:05,180
I said it was half horse rope.

514
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:09,180
If you don't believe me,

515
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:11,180
look at the hands of Mr. Lu's daughter.

516
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,180
He killed someone,

517
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:18,180
but his hand was still touched by half horse rope.

518
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,180
He died.

519
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:24,180
He was innocent.

520
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:33,180
Where did you say that?

521
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,180
It's just a family matter.

522
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:36,180
It's a matter of family.

523
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,180
If you don't believe me,

524
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:38,180
if you don't believe me,

525
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:40,180
I'll kill myself

526
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:42,180
tomorrow.

527
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:01,180
I'm leaving.

528
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:20,180
I've said it before.

529
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:22,180
It's just a joke.

530
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:25,180
It's worth it for our elders

531
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:27,180
to be so heartless.

532
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:28,180
What else can I say?

533
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:30,180
What else can I say?

534
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:34,180
I think it's better to forget about it.

535
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:37,180
Exactly.

536
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:39,180
Mr. Lu's mother, Wen Xiu Jun,

537
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,180
is not here today.

538
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:42,180
Of course, she'll forget about it.

539
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:43,180
Otherwise,

540
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:45,180
we can't do this easily.

541
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:47,180
What do you think, Mrs. Cheng?

542
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:48,180
Mrs. Cheng.

543
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:58,180
It hurts.

544
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,180
Nya Nya!

545
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,180
Nya Nya!

546
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:07,180
Nya Nya!

547
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,180
Nya Nya!

548
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:11,180
Nya Nya!

549
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,180
Nya Nya!

550
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:19,180
Nya Nya!

551
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,180
Nya Nya!

552
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,180
You're so stubborn, Mrs. Wang.

553
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:26,180
You've been treated so well

554
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:28,180
and you've been beaten like this.

555
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,180
They're so arrogant.

556
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:33,180
What do you mean by being beaten like this?

557
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:37,180
You've never seen Mrs. Wang.

558
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:38,180
I was beaten like that.

559
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,180
It's so cruel.

560
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:42,180
Don't worry.

561
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,180
I've beaten myself.

562
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:44,180
I've got a way.

563
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,180
You beat yourself?

564
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:49,180
Mr. Lu.

565
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:51,180
You beat yourself?

566
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:54,180
What's the point of being so sad?

567
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:06,180
You see?

568
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:09,180
Both sides are quite good.

569
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:14,180
Don't worry.

570
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:16,180
Don't look at the current situation.

571
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:18,180
If you keep on doing it,

572
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:20,180
you'll be different.

573
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:23,180
I've got a bad feeling about it.

574
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:26,180
It's so hard to keep it.

575
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:28,180
I can't sleep for a few days.

576
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:30,180
I can't sleep for a few days.

577
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:37,180
Mr. Li.

578
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:39,180
The female soldier wants to ask you about the painting in the wine cellar.

579
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:41,180
I'll go and ask the female soldier.

580
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:43,180
I'll ask him to go to the wine cellar.

581
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,180
I'll wait for his life.

582
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,180
Yes.

583
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:46,180
Wait.

584
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,180
The eyes are bigger.

585
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:52,180
The eyes are bigger.

586
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:56,180
Are you tired?

587
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:02,180
Keep it like this.

588
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:04,180
Tell them that we're not going to let them go.

589
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:06,180
We'll go to the wine cellar.

590
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:07,180
I'll go to the wine cellar.

591
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,180
I'll go to the wine cellar.

592
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:10,180
Tell them that we're not going to let them go.

593
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:12,180
Go.

594
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:15,180
Keep eating.

595
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:39,180
Father.

596
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:41,180
Mother.

597
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:46,180
Father.

598
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:48,180
Mother.

599
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:57,180
Didn't you say that we're just making a scene?

600
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:01,180
The new wife of the king has hit you like this.

601
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:04,180
My son.

602
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,180
Does it hurt?

603
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:07,180
Can you see your father?

604
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,180
I'm not worried.

605
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,180
I'm not worried.

606
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,180
Father.

607
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,180
Father.

608
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:17,180
Father.

609
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:19,180
Here.

610
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:21,180
Father.

611
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:24,180
All right.

612
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:27,180
It's not just a bird.

613
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:28,180
General.

614
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:31,180
Don't look at your own child.

615
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:35,180
The other women's faces are also hit like this.

616
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:36,180
Okay.

617
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:37,180
Hit in other places.

618
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:41,180
The young woman is fighting.

619
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:42,180
She's playing the ball.

620
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:43,180
She can't get out.

621
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:46,180
She can't even get her ribs or arms and legs.

622
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:48,180
She can still have facial muscles.

623
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:51,180
Our bird hasn't learned her family yet.

624
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:53,180
If her face can't get better, I'll lose her.

625
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:56,180
Shaoshan.

626
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,180
Let me ask you.

627
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:01,180
Do you know what's wrong with you today?

628
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:02,180
You're all hit like this.

629
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:03,180
You even ask her what's wrong with you.

630
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:04,180
I know what's wrong with you.

631
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:05,180
I know.

632
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:08,180
Okay.

633
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:09,180
Tell me.

634
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:10,180
What's wrong?

635
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:14,180
From now on,

636
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:18,180
no matter who's the one who's angry with Tang Zi,

637
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:21,180
or who can humiliate a daughter,

638
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:23,180
or destroy the Chen family,

639
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:26,180
the daughter will never hit anyone.

640
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,180
Mother.

641
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,180
Even if someone wants to kill the daughter,

642
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:38,180
the daughter will never hurt anyone.

643
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:41,180
Miss Wu.

644
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:42,180
Miss Wu.

645
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:44,180
Don't be angry with me.

646
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:46,180
Don't you have elders at home?

647
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:48,180
If you have a reason,

648
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:51,180
why don't you ask elders to come and fight?

649
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:54,180
I don't care if you really admit your mistake.

650
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:57,180
Tomorrow, you must go to General Wang's manor

651
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:59,180
and apologize to Wang Lin.

652
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:00,180
I...

653
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:04,180
I can't go.

654
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:06,180
Wang Lin...

655
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:08,180
Wang Lin is a man of love.

656
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:12,180
How dare you!

657
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:21,180
I want to see if you know what's wrong with you today.

658
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:24,180
Come on!

659
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:27,180
Mother!

660
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,180
Mother, don't be angry!

661
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,180
Mother, don't be angry!

662
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,180
Mother, what are you doing?

663
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:32,180
Mother, you've already beaten the child.

664
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,180
You can't fight anymore.

665
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:34,180
Yes, you can't.

666
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:36,180
What's the matter with you?

667
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:37,180
Poor girl.

668
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:39,180
What are you doing?

669
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:40,180
Get out of here!

670
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:41,180
Get out of here!

671
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:43,180
Get out of here!

672
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:48,180
Look at her.

673
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:50,180
What's she doing to you?

674
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:51,180
Get out of here!

675
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:53,180
Wait for our commander!

676
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,180
Get out!

677
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:56,180
Get out!

678
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:57,180
Get out!

679
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:59,180
Get out!

680
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,180
Get out!

681
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:01,180
Who told her to get out?

682
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,180
Who told her to get out?

683
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:06,180
Didn't you say that they would get me out?

684
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:08,180
I told them to get out of here.

685
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:12,180
Then why didn't you get out?

686
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:14,180
I didn't dare to.

687
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:17,180
I was afraid that if I got out, they would get me back.

688
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:26,180
Enough.

689
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:27,180
I'll be right there.

690
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:28,180
I'll be right there.

691
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:29,180
No one's around.

692
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:30,180
It's really okay.

693
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:31,180
I'm here.

694
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:32,180
I'm here.

695
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,180
Don't worry, brother.

696
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:39,180
Is your mother doing well?

697
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:40,180
Did you get hurt?

698
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:41,180
How is she doing?

699
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:44,180
If I'm with Young Master,

700
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:46,180
I don't think that I'll be in such a big trouble.

701
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:48,180
Where are you talking about?

702
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:50,180
If it wasn't for the time coming,

703
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:53,180
I'd be in trouble again.

704
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:55,180
As long as you're still in the house,

705
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:57,180
you can't escape this fight.

706
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:58,180
If you want to punish me,

707
00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:00,180
why do you have to be so empty-handed?

708
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:04,180
Your Highness, what are you going to do now?

709
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:07,180
I'll use my habit of using my habit.

710
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:09,180
Run?

711
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:10,180
That's a good idea.

712
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:12,180
Every time Young Master runs out,

713
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:13,180
he comes back.

714
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:15,180
If your mother gets angry,

715
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:16,180
she'll be angry.

716
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,180
Not every time.

717
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:21,180
If you can catch up with her

718
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:22,180
in ten or so times,

719
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:24,180
you'll be fine.

720
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:26,180
You'll have no other choice.

721
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:27,180
Or else,

722
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:29,180
you'll be in trouble.

723
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:31,180
You want me to go back and fight?

724
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:34,180
I can't do such a stupid thing in my life.

725
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:39,180
Your Highness.

726
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:45,180
It's all my fault.

727
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:47,180
If I hadn't been careful,

728
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:49,180
how could I have found them?

729
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:51,180
I wouldn't have caused such a big trouble.

730
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:53,180
I wouldn't have to.

731
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:55,180
Even if I didn't do it for myself,

732
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:57,180
I would find time to clean them up.

733
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:59,180
Moreover,

734
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:01,180
Tang Siyan is a good man.

735
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:03,180
He was a good man.

736
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,180
Even if he was a trouble maker,

737
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:06,180
he would be in trouble.

738
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:08,180
And I'm different.

739
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:11,180
Even if I'm a trouble maker,

740
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:13,180
I'm still a trouble maker.

741
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:15,180
I've decided on my own.

742
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:18,180
I'll run away

743
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,180
if I can do it.

744
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:20,180
I'll run away now.

745
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:23,180
I won't be with you for a long time.

746
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:25,180
You're leaving with me?

747
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:26,180
Yes.

748
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:27,180
I'll leave with you.

749
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:28,180
Don't be so mean.

750
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:31,180
If you're with me,

751
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:32,180
then...

752
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:35,180
Then why do you have to leave?

753
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:38,180
I'll leave by myself.

754
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,180
I'll leave.

755
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:45,180
Tang Siyan.

756
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,180
I'll leave.

757
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:48,180
I'll leave.

758
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:50,180
Then why don't you go with me?

759
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:53,180
Well...

760
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:12,180
Young Master,

761
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:13,180
you're so bold.

762
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:16,180
I'll go apologize to the female army.

763
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:18,180
You're not good at fighting.

764
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,180
I'm also...

765
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:22,180
I'm the first one to leave the house.

766
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,180
I'm so...

767
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,180
I'm so bad at fighting.

768
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:27,180
I'm not good at experience.

769
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:29,180
I should have done it sooner.

770
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:31,180
No. I'll do it next time.

771
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:33,180
I'll prepare something else for him next time.

772
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:35,180
I'll do it next time.

773
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:49,180
Madam.

774
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:50,180
Madam.

775
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:51,180
Come here.

776
00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:59,180
You're so stubborn.

777
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:01,180
You know how to be a good girl.

778
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:03,180
You're so stubborn.

779
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:05,180
I can eat him up.

780
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:07,180
Now you're here to sell me.

781
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:10,180
A girl is a girl.

782
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:13,180
How can she fight like a kid?

783
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:15,180
I'm not a girl.

784
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:17,180
How can she fight like a kid?

785
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:21,180
You said that a girl is different.

786
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:23,180
A son is a big deal.

787
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:25,180
A girl is a good girl.

788
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:27,180
In that case,

789
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:29,180
you can't be the same.

790
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:32,180
You mean

791
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:35,180
you want to help the birds for the rest of your life?

792
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:37,180
I think

793
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:39,180
the birds are right.

794
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:42,180
It's the daughter of the Wang family.

795
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:43,180
She has to be the one to die.

796
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:44,180
How can I not know?

797
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:46,180
I'm just angry with the birds.

798
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,180
Why doesn't she

799
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:49,180
let us live in harmony?

800
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:51,180
That's the royal family of Ruyang.

801
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:53,180
The royal family of Ruyang is the emperor's uncle.

802
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:56,180
The royal family of Ruyang is a special household.

803
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:58,180
When the emperor sees their husband,

804
00:37:58,180 --> 00:37:59,180
he'll be angry with them.

805
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:00,180
He'll be in a daze.

806
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:02,180
He can't be so angry.

807
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:04,180
He'll be in a daze.

808
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:05,180
How can you bear it?

809
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:07,180
The birds are all in the water.

810
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:10,180
You only see the birds are happy.

811
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:11,180
The police officer

812
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:13,180
is willing to protect his own son

813
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:14,180
and his family.

814
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:16,180
He won't let others bully him.

815
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:18,180
If the birds can't see the sheep,

816
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:20,180
it'll be a disaster.

817
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:22,180
The Cheng family always

818
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:24,180
misses the chief.

819
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:25,180
That bastard

820
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:26,180
didn't leave the palace

821
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:27,180
even though he was here.

822
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:28,180
But he...

823
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:30,180
But he shouldn't have touched the hand

824
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:31,180
and fell down.

825
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:32,180
Okay, okay.

826
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:34,180
The birds have promised me

827
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:36,180
that they won't fight with anyone again.

828
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:39,180
I really didn't know

829
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:41,180
that I, Xiao Yuan,

830
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:42,180
was born

831
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:43,180
and was worried about

832
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:45,180
my own daughter's marriage.

833
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:46,180
Luckily, General Lin

834
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:48,180
was able to support me.

835
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:49,180
Even if I had to take the witness,

836
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:50,180
I could do it.

837
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:51,180
Otherwise, I wouldn't know

838
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:52,180
what would happen

839
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:53,180
to me.

840
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:54,180
General Lin?

841
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:57,180
Lin Guiyi?

842
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:58,180
He's here, too?

843
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:07,180
Where did Her Highness hide?

844
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:08,180
Why is there no sound

845
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:09,180
in the room next door?

846
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:11,180
I heard that she hid

847
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:12,180
in the house next door.

848
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:15,180
How could she do that?

849
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:17,180
It's so cold outside.

850
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:19,180
She's moving out of the house.

851
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:23,180
Madam, you're quite anxious.

852
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:27,180
Who said I was anxious for her?

853
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:28,180
I should have let her move.

854
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:29,180
If she moved,

855
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:31,180
she wouldn't dare to hit anyone.

856
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:36,180
What are you thinking about?

857
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:37,180
Why are you wearing so little?

858
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:39,180
Don't you want to wear

859
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:41,180
a white dress?

860
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:42,180
If you want to live,

861
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:44,180
get in the car.

862
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:45,180
Sir,

863
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:47,180
we can't just get on the carriage.

864
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:49,180
Jiang Fen is here, too.

865
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:50,180
I'm afraid she's not feeling well.

866
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:52,180
She's not feeling well.

867
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:54,180
She's sick and unconscious.

868
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:57,180
Let's go.

869
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:58,180
Hurry up.

870
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:59,180
Sir, please.

871
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:10,180
You're so bitter.

872
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:12,180
You're making me feel so bad.

873
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:15,180
What's that?

874
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,180
Sir,

875
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:19,180
I'm just trying to get rid of you.

876
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:21,180
You're pretending to be me?

877
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:26,180
I heard that

878
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:28,180
Wang Lin hasn't even been in the wedding

879
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:29,180
for the birthday banquet of Princess Yuchang.

880
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:30,180
She's not feeling well.

881
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:31,180
Help!

882
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:32,180
Help!

883
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:33,180
Help!

884
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,180
Help!

885
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:35,180
Help!

886
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:36,180
Help!

887
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:37,180
Help!

888
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:38,180
Help!

889
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:39,180
Help!

890
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:40,180
Help!

891
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:42,180
But

892
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:44,180
even if you want to deal with her,

893
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:46,180
you don't have to be so cruel.

894
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:49,180
What do you want?

895
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:51,180
I'm not afraid of her.

896
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:53,180
I'll ask her to come to my house

897
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:54,180
in the future.

898
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:55,180
I won't go.

899
00:40:58,180 --> 00:40:59,180
I want to have a baby

900
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:01,180
in my mother's house.

901
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:06,180
I want to have a baby in my own house.

902
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:09,180
Baby?

903
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:14,180
Are you trying to look at me?

904
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:25,180
You're in a marriage.

905
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:27,180
Can't you be a little girl

906
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:28,180
and pretend to be shy?

907
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:29,180
I don't want to marry you.

908
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:30,180
Why should I marry you?

909
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:31,180
If you want to marry me,

910
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:32,180
I have to marry you.

911
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:34,180
The Wujia family

912
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:35,180
will be the family of the Eastern Courtyard.

913
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:37,180
Of course, you have to pretend to be a virtuous man

914
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:38,180
and be a good man.

915
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:40,180
You can't be a coward

916
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:41,180
and be a coward.

917
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:43,180
You can't be like you.

918
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:45,180
You can't be a coward.

919
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:46,180
You can't be a coward.

920
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:53,180
Thank you for saving me.

921
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:55,180
You're so lucky.

922
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:56,180
You can dance.

923
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,180
You can dance.

924
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:58,180
We're leaving.

925
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:00,180
Wait.

926
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:02,180
I'm sorry.

927
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:10,180
Constantly speaking,

928
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:11,180
that值 respect,

929
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:21,180
after all,

930
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:23,180
you're a症 case

931
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:25,180
and she Baldy doc Iガ어�ren.

932
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:27,180
What?

933
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:28,180
It's a fact.

934
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:29,180
What?

935
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:32,480
andocked YuanHD with his phone.

936
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:33,580
Let them go.

937
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:35,180
Don't cause trouble...

938
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:36,680
as﹑t such a trick.

939
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:39,680
Leader Yu might want to doen які.

940
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:00,300
What's wrong?

941
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:13,860
Brother!

942
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:15,020
You're not far away.

943
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:17,540
Who did you come down from the carriage?

944
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:18,940
I asked you to go back.

945
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:21,180
I said that you were punished by your sister-in-law.

946
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:22,180
The rest is not for you.

947
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:23,180
Sister-in-law?

948
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:24,580
Then why not?

949
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:26,780
I've thought it over.

950
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:28,340
I'll go to the house to meet my sister-in-law.

951
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:29,340
Go to the room.

952
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:30,340
Brother!

953
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:31,340
It's been two days.

954
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:32,340
I'm not angry.

955
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:33,340
You come to meet me again.

956
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:35,340
Li Li, come.

957
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:36,340
You and brother go back.

958
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:37,340
Okay.

959
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:38,340
I'm leaving.

960
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:40,340
Brother!

961
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:53,340
General Ling, you came here this time.

962
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:55,340
I don't know what's the matter.

963
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:57,340
General Wan, do you really not know

964
00:43:57,340 --> 00:44:00,340
why I came here today?

965
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:04,340
Da Yue.

966
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:07,340
Da Yue is General Ling who knows

967
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:10,340
Wan Mou likes to collect real goods.

968
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:12,340
Come and see him.

969
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:14,340
This is a good saying.

970
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:15,340
My dear Wan family,

971
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:16,340
General Ling,

972
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:18,340
as long as you see any objects,

973
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:19,340
just pick them up.

974
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:21,340
The land is a land of the wild.

975
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:24,340
Can General Wan love you?

976
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:27,340
What land?

977
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:30,340
A land of the wild?

978
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:32,340
So General Ling is your...

979
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:34,340
The land of the wild.

980
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:40,340
The land of the wild.

981
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:44,340
If General Ling comes here for this land,

982
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:46,340
then you don't have to say it.

983
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:48,340
Wan Mou is a land of the wild.

984
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:50,340
If he can get this treasure,

985
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:52,340
he will be the emperor long ago.

986
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:55,340
And he will come to investigate it.

987
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:56,340
Really?

988
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:57,340
Yes.

989
00:44:57,340 --> 00:44:58,340
Really?

990
00:44:58,340 --> 00:44:59,340
I don't know.

991
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:01,340
General Ling,

992
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:04,340
how can I know?

993
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:26,340
I won't stay here for long.

994
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:28,340
I'm okay.

995
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:31,340
And here is..

996
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:34,340
a good ordeal in this world.

997
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:39,340
I won't sleep until my death.

998
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:45,340
Let's die from fear and hatred.

999
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:47,340
It's more important that them.

1000
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:56,140
One two be

1001
00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:01,640
Brush

1002
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:06,360
To be

1003
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:10,880
Sick

1004
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:13,840
This

1005
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:17,860
Throne

1006
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:27,620
SharpIFA
