1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Oh boy...

2
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:09,240
Ad……

3
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,360
Amazing race!!

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:38,300
!

5
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Why did you become a robber?

6
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I did give you a book.

7
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It was the one that was given to me by my elder brother.

8
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I've seen it before.

9
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
A Qilin hand?

10
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I should have died.

11
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I was confused and didn't look carefully.

12
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
If I had a Qilin hand, I would have been a prince's Wuyi.

13
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
But why did you come to us?

14
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'm a prince.

15
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'm a prince.

16
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You came to us.

17
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Could it be...

18
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Could it be that you deliberately carried the book

19
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
and went to the place where our young master was taking the medicine?

20
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
No, no. I'm a robber.

21
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I can fight with the general.

22
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
If the general went to the place, he wouldn't have woken up.

23
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
He used a water pump, a fire extinguisher,

24
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
and two straight knives.

25
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
What are you shouting at?

26
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You can't even use a gun in the house.

27
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Key!

28
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Lady.

29
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
けど.

30
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
No need to wake up if you still can't.

31
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Get up.

32
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Madam!ises look at me...

33
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,880
Go away!

34
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,760
Please, please!

35
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,320
My darling braucht my husband's life.

36
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:35,600
You'll ask the CrashTCS

37
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,160
I know for sure.

38
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,720
Just you wait.

39
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,640
Agile!

40
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,560
Whenever you're sad,

41
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,960
he's still waiting for us.

42
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,840
Right.

43
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,200
If he didn't tell you he'dとか

44
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,560
on a novel in his new article,

45
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,840
he would never give it to him.

46
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,960
He deserves it,

47
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,160
How can you talk nonsense?

48
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,080
Miss Jing, don't be so serious.

49
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,120
It's my fault.

50
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,960
How could you be so stupid?

51
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,240
Take that old woman away!

52
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,080
What?

53
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:11,080
Didn't Miss Niu go to the shop with her mother-in-law?

54
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,840
I forgot about it.

55
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,200
But it's okay.

56
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,720
It's the same when you bring Miss Niu back.

57
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,720
She's waiting for the book.

58
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,800
If you...

59
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,080
When did I say that I was talking nonsense?

60
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,360
Cheng Pu, why did you make a decision?

61
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,560
Besides, you're right.

62
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,080
Since Miss Niu is not here,

63
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,440
I'll go back first.

64
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,440
When will you think of coming to our shop?

65
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,240
No need.

66
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,440
Why don't you go back first?

67
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,160
I'll leave the book in the room.

68
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,120
I'll bring my daughter back after I finish reading.

69
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,320
How is it?

70
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,740
MissRenzi moves in this way

71
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,660
and I must know what I'm going to do.

72
00:04:59,300 --> 00:04:59,940
OK.

73
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,200
All right.

74
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,980
in no time,

75
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:23,760
You live for what you do,

76
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,380
for what you want.

77
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,500
I will keep...)

78
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:29,680
killing you and Sidi ц latentier for this matter.

79
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,000
Yang Yang,

80
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,640
when Sunset Marry me

81
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,100
take me there,

82
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,200
and be with you for the rest of my life.

83
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:46,300
So you have been relying on Tengley Zi

84
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,640
from now on,

85
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:48,520
what you decide?

86
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:54,660
What metedarmole?

87
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,220
We'll attend his funeral.

88
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:01,020
Today, I'll combine you and Xiaogen.

89
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,740
Understand each other well.

90
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,260
Yet how?

91
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,740
None of you supported Xiaogen.

92
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:15,140
Who received her home,

93
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,580
which is now a good old age rather than me?

94
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:22,580
You're right. I'm sorry for the trouble.

95
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:25,580
I'll go back and teach you a lesson.

96
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:29,580
I'm sorry, aunt. I didn't teach you well.

97
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:32,580
I'll be punished for it.

98
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,580
It has nothing to do with you.

99
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,580
I know you're busy.

100
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,580
It's normal to lose control.

101
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,580
You don't have to worry about it.

102
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,580
What are you laughing at?

103
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,580
I'm not laughing.

104
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,580
Yuanfang, did you make a mistake?

105
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:00,580
It's... it's the head of the company.

106
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:03,580
I like your head.

107
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:07,580
What's the head of the company?

108
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:10,580
For example, I want you to go to the US.

109
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,580
I'll go to the US.

110
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,580
I'll go to the US.

111
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:16,580
I'll go to the US.

112
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:18,580
I'll ask you to buy soy sauce in the East.

113
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:21,580
Which things can be made by yourself?

114
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,580
Which street do you go to?

115
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,580
Choose the best soy sauce you think is the best.

116
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:28,580
Which things can't be made by yourself?

117
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:31,580
You can't share the soy sauce I bought with others.

118
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:35,580
You can't decide if I need soy sauce.

119
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:39,580
Do you understand?

120
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:42,580
I've never punished you.

121
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:44,580
I don't know how to punish you.

122
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,580
I don't want to punish you.

123
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,580
Go to the US.

124
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,580
I'll go to the US.

125
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,580
Come on.

126
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,580
Yes.

127
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,580
Uncle Zhang,

128
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:25,580
Lianfang is not a person who moves the study.

129
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:28,580
She is with some girls.

130
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,580
You can't stop her.

131
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:35,580
So you call your little sister to be with you.

132
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:38,580
What do you want to say to these girls?

133
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:39,580
Say it.

134
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:41,580
Stop them.

135
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:44,580
Don't take the study of the third prince to the fourth wife.

136
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:45,580
Or...

137
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,580
This is the study of our young master.

138
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,580
You can't take it away.

139
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:50,580
I just...

140
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,580
You can pretend.

141
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:56,580
But Lianfang didn't pretend to be the girl in the study.

142
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,580
You can pretend to ask her a question.

143
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:02,580
I want to see if these people are really not worth the money.

144
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:03,580
Are you lying?

145
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,580
Or do you mean that you know the fault of your father?

146
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,580
You want to get rid of your father by a study?

147
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,580
Don't force people.

148
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,580
You sent Lianfang, a girl,

149
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,580
to let her send her off.

150
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:25,580
Okay.

151
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,580
Listen to me.

152
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,580
Until then,

153
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:34,580
the fault of the girl doesn't involve the girl.

154
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:36,580
It's just a small matter.

155
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:37,580
It's okay for anyone.

156
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:40,580
You need to keep your mother in the family.

157
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,580
Don't be so idle.

158
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:45,580
Thank you for speaking for the girl.

159
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:49,580
The fourth wife has three brothers and sisters.

160
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:52,580
Unfortunately, the girl is weak.

161
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:53,580
We are servants.

162
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:56,580
We are worried that the girl is bullied.

163
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,580
So, we feel that

164
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:02,580
we should give the girl a favor.

165
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:05,580
That's the fault of the criminal.

166
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:08,580
How can you be bullied?

167
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,580
What are you talking about?

168
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:13,580
The family has been living together for decades.

169
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:16,580
They never separate.

170
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:20,580
Do you think that you should be the one to blame?

171
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,580
Who taught you that?

172
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,580
Is it the Ghe family?

173
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:25,580
I dare not.

174
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:27,580
I don't have any intention.

175
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,580
How dare you talk about the Ghe family?

176
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,580
Come on.

177
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:31,580
Enough.

178
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,580
That's all.

179
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:38,580
View from the side of the network.

180
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,580
Mom пер Arts Center

181
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:44,580
I'm so glad that we can arrange

182
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:47,580
this אานามใ άτο 집에.

183
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:50,860
I can only rely on myself.

184
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,940
Do you really think that's right?

185
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,060
If that's right,

186
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:00,380
I'll be punished for bullying Tang Zi.

187
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,580
Think about it.

188
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,260
If that's not right,

189
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,940
I'll send him off immediately.

190
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,180
You're a traitor!

191
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:13,500
Mother,

192
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,260
you're a big sin.

193
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:16,300
Mother,

194
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:19,260
you're so cruel and ungrateful.

195
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:21,580
Why did you say so much to him?

196
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,260
If you don't get out of this,

197
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:29,980
you'll be suppressed forever.

198
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,300
You'll never be able to do anything.

199
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:36,100
Do you know why Am I not a criminal?

200
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:38,740
You really thought that

201
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,100
you were a smart bastard for your own sake.

202
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,740
But you did it for Tang Zi's sake.

203
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,500
You said that you were a liar.

204
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:48,220
That's because you're a liar.

205
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:49,580
Mother.

206
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:50,700
Am I wrong?

207
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:53,420
You shouldn't have done that to your son.

208
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,500
That's the truth.

209
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,900
But why did you do that?

210
00:11:58,580 --> 00:11:59,860
You didn't even ask me.

211
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,460
You just sent me here.

212
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:03,020
I was the one who was wrong.

213
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,620
But what if I'm wrong?

214
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,540
You're not wrong at all.

215
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:12,140
Tell me.

216
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:13,700
Why?

217
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,420
Because you know it.

218
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:16,980
I like Tang Zi.

219
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:19,420
So you don't have to worry about your son.

220
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,300
As long as I'm here,

221
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,780
no one in the Cheng family

222
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,580
will dare to bully him.

223
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,820
Are you blaming me?

224
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,300
If you think I'm being honest,

225
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,740
you can say some nonsense.

226
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,420
You bastard.

227
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:37,300
Come here.

228
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,100
Come here.

229
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:39,860
Mother.

230
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,300
Mother, I'm sorry.

231
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,740
It's all my fault.

232
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:44,340
It's all my fault

233
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,500
that you made a big mistake.

234
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:46,780
You're still young.

235
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:47,900
You're a child.

236
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:48,980
Don't blame him.

237
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,300
Mother, punish me.

238
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,340
You think I don't deserve to punish you?

239
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:53,980
You're the one who did that.

240
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,780
If you give me two books at the same time,

241
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:56,780
I'll be in trouble.

242
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:00,940
Why is it brother's fault again?

243
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,540
He didn't do anything wrong.

244
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,860
Why did he give me one book?

245
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,580
It's because I'm so weak.

246
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:08,740
The book I'm using now

247
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,260
is just a few-year-old child's book.

248
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,900
He loves me, he's so pitiful.

249
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,700
He sent me his favorite book.

250
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,740
I didn't even go out to play a new book.

251
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:16,740
I lost my child.

252
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:18,700
What did I do wrong?

253
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,180
Mother.

254
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:24,140
Now I've read my books.

255
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:26,380
I can read all the books I know.

256
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,740
And it's just some kind of a dream.

257
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,820
I've learned everything that a child can learn.

258
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,940
I'm teaching you what you can't learn.

259
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:35,540
I've never lost my child.

260
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:36,900
Okay.

261
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,220
I'll ask you.

262
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,660
If you have a

263
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,220
unbreakable pulse in your stomach,

264
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,100
you'll have two people standing in front of you.

265
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,540
One will die of hunger.

266
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,180
The other will have seven or eight of your wealth.

267
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,540
Who will you give it to?

268
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,540
Will you tell that unbreakable person

269
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,500
that you'll have one more person

270
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,140
after I've sold two books?

271
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,340
Mother, it seems fair.

272
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:02,900
Is it fair?

273
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,700
It's fair to say so.

274
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:07,340
It's a matter of the heart.

275
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:15,840
And we're not practicing GRANT Ar against you.

276
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,780
Mother wants to shake off the different kind.

277
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,300
ick me to do it.

278
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,620
How about me?

279
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,380
I'm willing to

280
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:36,060
What about me?

281
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:44,100
In the end

282
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,500
மüre

283
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:54,600
스� reiterate

284
00:14:56,780 --> 00:15:06,640
은

285
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:10,720
Why did you change your choice all of a sudden?

286
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,760
I should just leave earlier.

287
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:20,780
Why didn't you say you were talking about Didn't you give up this year?

288
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:23,560
I didn't dare.

289
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,900
What about now?

290
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:30,160
You're hotels, hotels?

291
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,140
...

292
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,580
Where do you plan on staying in South Africa?

293
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:38,580
I'm a wifeng.

294
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:39,580
You...

295
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:41,580
Look at that bastard.

296
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,580
He forced me to say that he's a wifeng.

297
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,580
I should have.

298
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,580
I was wrong.

299
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:50,580
It's obvious that he didn't give any justice to the concubines.

300
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:53,580
You can't make sense of how to make mother's wifeng.

301
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:56,580
I should have been forced to do this.

302
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:59,580
Just look at those stupid wifens.

303
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,580
What's wrong with you?

304
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:03,580
You're a wifeng.

305
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:07,580
I can't tell the old man and the little maid's skills?

306
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,580
I'll be exposed in secret.

307
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:11,580
You must be exposed in public.

308
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:14,580
Where else can I put the face of Yangyang?

309
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:17,580
Don't talk about Yangyang.

310
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:19,580
I'm listening to you.

311
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:22,580
The character is not so good.

312
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:25,580
But you're too good.

313
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,580
I can't even read the book.

314
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:31,580
I was just talking about the crime of wifeng.

315
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:33,580
I was so angry with her.

316
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:36,580
I didn't know how to explain it to her.

317
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,580
She's been talking about me all the time.

318
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:42,580
She's been trying to make me angry all the time.

319
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:44,580
I was so angry.

320
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:48,580
I didn't know that she was so bold.

321
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:50,580
You wanted to make her wifeng.

322
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,580
But she didn't have the guts.

323
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:54,580
I thought about it.

324
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:58,580
How can I explain it to her?

325
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:01,580
I'll explain it to her.

326
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,580
I did it wrong.

327
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:05,580
I can't tell her.

328
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:10,580
But what should I say about today?

329
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:12,580
Don't go out.

330
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:14,580
I'll go.

331
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:17,580
Tell the little maid that you're not allowed to see her.

332
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:20,580
I'll ask the kids to accompany you.

333
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:22,580
You're so stupid.

334
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:24,580
It's not the court's policy.

335
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:28,580
It's not as clear as the black and white.

336
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:31,580
I just want to ask for justice.

337
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:35,580
I know that the crime is not for justice.

338
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:39,580
But some people have no idea to show their justice.

339
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:44,580
Sometimes they're too old to show their own flesh.

340
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:47,580
You said that you're not a good person.

341
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,580
My daughter.

342
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:53,580
I am sorry for all things that happened because of you.

343
00:17:55,580 --> 00:18:01,580
Mom, I remember how you fired Yusha and killed Yuchou.

344
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:14,580
All those characters for me have no way to say that they have their own deathсь

345
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:16,580
I'm sorry, mother.

346
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:18,580
I'm really sorry for you.

347
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,580
I'm sorry for making you suffer.

348
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:24,580
I'm sorry for the brotherhood.

349
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:30,580
Tang Zi, you don't know this.

350
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:32,580
I didn't care about you.

351
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,580
But in this world,

352
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:38,580
it's not fair.

353
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:41,580
Tang Zi is a mother.

354
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:44,580
I'm a mother.

355
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,580
I'm really a mother.

356
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:50,580
I'm really a mother.

357
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:55,580
Don't kneel. Get up.

358
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,580
Your Highness,

359
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,580
what do you need?

360
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:02,580
I'll tell you 35.

361
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,580
I'll find a way to make you a mother.

362
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:11,580
I'll go with her.

363
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:19,580
I don't want to go to the light meeting.

364
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:21,580
I don't want to go.

365
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:24,580
Fine, I'll take the initiative for you.

366
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:29,580
Really?

367
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:32,580
Tang Zi, go with her.

368
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:33,580
Yes, yes.

369
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:34,580
I'll go with her.

370
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,580

Young master, I don't regret this

405
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:11,380
If there's someone as good as Xu Jin

406
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:12,900
We can go into action

407
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:18,020
It's his work

408
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:20,140
He took part in this Skating Club with the family

409
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:24,040
She's made effort to attend you

410
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,160
How did he get so far away?

411
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:28,540
The day before starts with looking at her

412
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:29,940
Master.

00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:34,220
Such a cruel secret!

415
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:36,420
It must be her� hardship.

416
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:31,180
Do you like it?

417
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:33,180
If you like it, I'll buy it for you.

418
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:37,180
No need to buy it. You can do it.

419
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:40,180
My daughter is smart.

420
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:43,180
Look at this.

421
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:46,180
This is the latest one.

422
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,180
It's not good.

423
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:49,180
Son.

424
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:54,180
What's wrong, mom?

425
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:03,180
Let me see.

426
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,180
Is it good?

427
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:12,180
Yes.

428
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:14,180
Mom, that one is good.

429
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:15,180
Really?

430
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:17,180
Yes.

431
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,180
Good?

432
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:23,180
These two are the best for the pig's eye.

433
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:25,180
Aunt, you should choose.

434
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:32,180
This one is lighter and suitable for the sheep.

435
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:33,180
Good.

436
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:35,180
This one.

437
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:48,180
Be careful.

438
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:50,180
Let's go.

439
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:02,180
Why does the housekeeper sell lanterns?

440
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:04,180
How much is it?

441
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:07,180
I think it's the first time she's been to the Lantern Festival.

442
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:09,180
She doesn't sell lanterns.

443
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:13,180
If she wants to, she should go to the top of the list.

444
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:14,180
Thank you.

445
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:32,180
What's the meaning of guessing the lanterns?

446
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:34,180
It's easy to guess.

447
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:36,180
You can guess it by yourself.

448
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:39,180
People who know the lanterns can guess it.

449
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:41,180
You can guess it by yourself.

450
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:43,180
Get out of the way.

451
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:49,180
Why do you push others away?

452
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:51,180
Tell me what you want.

453
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:53,180
I'll go get it.

454
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:57,180
I want to use the lantern.

455
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:59,180
I'll go get it.

456
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:06,180
I don't know how to use the lantern.

457
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:07,180
You can change it.

458
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:09,180
You're not going to use the lantern for me.

459
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:11,180
I'll go get someone else.

460
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:15,180
Mr. Yuan, you can use all the lanterns.

461
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:17,180
Mr. Yuan.

462
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:18,180
Mr. Yuan.

463
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:20,180
Mr. Yuan is the best in the world.

464
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:23,180
Mr. Yuan can do anything.

465
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:25,180
You can go get the lanterns.

466
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:27,180
It's a good idea.

467
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:31,180
I think I can get the lanterns.

468
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:32,180
Yes.

469
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:34,180
I want to get the lanterns.

470
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,180
Zuo Yi.

471
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:36,180
Zuo Yi.

472
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:37,180
Stop.

473
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:38,180
Wait for me.

474
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:39,180
You can't guess the lanterns.

475
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:41,180
You can't guess the lanterns.

476
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:43,180
You can't guess the lanterns.

477
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:45,180
You can guess it by yourself.

478
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:48,180
You can guess it by yourself.

479
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:55,180
Wu Ju.

480
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:58,180
Are these real lanterns?

481
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:01,180
Is he cold?

482
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:03,180
Yes.

483
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:06,180
Zuo Yi.

484
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:09,180
St strangers came to me from the Eastern Region this winter.

485
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:12,180
Our troupe strodie the cryptocurrency in our city.

486
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:14,180
They scream for killing us.

487
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:23,140
Our heads are

488
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:26,180
What's the matter with Zou San?

489
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:30,180
Zou San, the thousand will take the money.

490
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:31,180
The month is thirty.

491
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:33,180
The nine days will be the same.

492
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:35,180
Please answer.

493
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:40,180
Six thousand seven hundred and five cents.

494
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:43,180
Six thousand seven hundred and five cents.

495
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:44,180
Correct.

496
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:51,180
One, Yu Zhirou Xu Zhijing.

497
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:53,180
Xu Zhijing, the moon is like a moon.

498
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:54,180
The moon is like a moon.

499
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,180
Two stars are like a moon.

500
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:56,180
Two stars are like a moon.

501
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:57,180
Two stars are like a moon.

502
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:58,180
Two stars are like a moon.

503
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:01,180
The two brothers are sitting opposite each other.

504
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:03,180
They look alike.

505
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:06,180
But they are one person speaking and one person speaking.

506
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,180
Why?

507
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:10,180
It's just that I'm looking at the mirror.

508
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:15,180
That's right.

509
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,180
Second, on the lantern,

510
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,180
a picture of a spring.

511
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:20,180
A picture of a grassland.

512
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:21,180
That's my picture.

513
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:22,180
Mr. Yuan, answer yourself.

514
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:24,180
Hurry up and think of a way.

515
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:26,180
A picture of a grassland.

516
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:28,180
A picture of a good fortune.

517
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:30,180
A headless, fearless,

518
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:32,180
a few-headed fish.

519
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:34,180
The answer is this.

520
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:35,180
It's the sun.

521
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:38,180
Mr. Yuan, wear it.

522
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:39,180
It's all your fault.

523
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:41,180
If you didn't know the lantern,

524
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:42,180
I would have been taken away.

525
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:45,180
What's wrong with Mr. Yuan?

526
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:46,180
He's so good.

527
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,180
Of course he's good.

528
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:49,180
He's from the White Mountain Academy,

529
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,180
Mr. Huangfu.

530
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:51,180
Three years ago,

531
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:53,180
he was appointed to the world's largest lantern festival.

532
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:55,180
The 18th Yuan of the year,

533
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:57,180
he was famous for his lantern festival.

534
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,180
You...

535
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:00,180
You've never heard of his name, right?

536
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:02,180
It's my first time to attend a lantern festival.

537
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:03,180
Of course I've never heard of it.

538
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:05,180
It's a rare sight.

539
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:06,180
That's right.

540
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:07,180
No wonder he didn't know

541
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:08,180
the annual birthday festival.

542
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:11,180
There's no mention of Mr. Yuan's sister.

543
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:13,180
If the annual birthday festival is all about the name,

544
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:15,180
it's possible to get it every year.

545
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:17,180
But it's not possible.

546
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:20,180
Nongyang,

547
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:22,180
you've been to the White Mountain Academy

548
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,180
for a few days.

549
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:25,180
Why are you so close to Mr. Shan?

550
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:30,180
What are you looking at?

551
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:36,180
Mr. Yuan is a genius.

552
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:38,180
I can't win the contest.

553
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:39,180
Don't talk about me.

554
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:40,180
How many people in the world

555
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:42,180
can win the contest?

556
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:43,180
Do you know

557
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:44,180
I hate you the most

558
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:45,180
for being so arrogant

559
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:47,180
and being so arrogant?

560
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:52,180
Yuan is so nice.

561
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:54,180
He loves to be a fan.

562
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:00,180
Do you want to send these lanterns

563
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:02,180
to your mansion?

564
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:04,180
No need.

565
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:07,180
Just find a place to hang them.

566
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:08,180
It's a good idea.

567
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:10,180
Yuan Shan,

568
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:12,180
you've been to the White Mountain Academy.

569
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,180
It's hard to get these secrets

570
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:16,180
because of the people in the academy.

571
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:17,180
You're so nice.

572
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:19,180
You've solved all the problems.

573
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:21,180
Do you think it's not enough

574
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:22,180
to get them here?

575
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:24,180
Is there any problem?

576
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:26,180
At least,

577
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:27,180
I've got a few lanterns

578
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,180
for the guests downstairs.

579
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,180
Now,

580
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,180
they're all gone.

581
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:31,180
What else can I do?

582
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:32,180
Yes.

583
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:34,180
If so,

584
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:37,180
I'll give them a secret.

585
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:40,180
Excuse me,

586
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:43,180
what's the matter with the downstairs?

587
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:47,180
The lanterns are all gone.

588
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:49,180
The lanterns are all gone.

589
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:50,180
You're so rude.

590
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:51,180
Everyone,

591
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:52,180
everyone,

592
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:55,180
the owner of the Tian family's restaurant

593
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:57,180
told Yuan

594
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:59,180
that the lanterns were all gone

595
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:01,180
because of the crowd.

596
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:02,180
So,

597
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,180
he sent a new lantern

598
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:05,180
to give them a special thanks.

599
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:06,180
In this way,

600
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:07,180
the restaurant

601
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:09,180
will also be able to get the lanterns.

602
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:11,180
If anyone can answer the question,

603
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:14,180
the restaurant will be given a thousand-dollar penalty

604
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:15,180
and will be rewarded.

605
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:18,180
Good!

606
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:19,180
I don't know

607
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,180
what will happen

608
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:22,180
to Yuan Shangjian.

609
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:25,180
Is it a scam or a scam?

610
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:26,180
Yuan is a bad guy.

611
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:28,180
He must be a bad guy.

612
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:30,180
How can we guess?

613
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:32,180
Do you have any men's attitude?

614
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:34,180
No.

615
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:35,180
There's a water well

616
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,180
next to the restaurant.

617
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:38,180
It's just a second-hand.

618
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:39,180
I don't know what to do.

619
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:41,180
If you ask me,

620
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:45,180
how deep is the water well?

621
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:47,180
How deep is it?

622
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:49,180
You'll know when you get there.

623
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:50,180
That's right.

624
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:52,180
There's a three-story tomb

625
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:54,180
in the hands of the person.

626
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:57,180
Can you get there?

627
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:59,180
It's short.

628
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:01,180
How can I get there?

629
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:03,180
Who can get there?

630
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:07,180
Me?

631
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:10,180
I can't answer.

632
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:12,180
The person who knows the answer

633
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:13,180
can answer the question

634
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:14,180
if there's a person

635
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:15,180
who knows the answer.

636
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:17,180
Get out of the way.

637
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:20,180
You!

638
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:40,180
What's wrong?

639
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:11,180
My egg is totally blown away.

640
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:21,180
I even know I could live a good life.

641
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:24,180
Everything will go back in space in a blink of the eye.

642
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:28,180
Can anything happen to my egg?

643
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:29,180
What's the problem?

644
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:31,180
Besides,

645
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:33,180
I can compare myself highly with my mom,

646
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:35,180
but it's soybean risotto.

647
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:37,180
No, you can just take a favorite dish,

648
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:39,980
Tonight, it's another day.

649
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,980
Just scallops?

650
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:49,140
How much?

651
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,220
Two and a half kilos.

652
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,780
A yokn staged cán.

653
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:57,180
Two and a half kilos three time.

654
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:58,460
Hello.

655
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:01,540
How is that possible?

656
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:02,300
Three and a pliers.

657
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:03,300
So,

658
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:09,300
What you said is a good deal.

659
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:12,300
I admire you.

660
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:18,300
You are really good.

661
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:21,300
If so, I can't take the penalty.

662
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:25,300
Since you have a penalty, you can take the penalty.

663
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:27,300
Wait a minute. I'll get it for you.

664
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,300
Thank you.

665
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,300
I'll get it for you.

666
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,300
I've found it.

667
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:08,300
Who is the young master who is the same as Xu Jin Zhong?

668
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,300
The Young Master.

669
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:14,300
How did you guess it? It's him.

670
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:17,300
That Xu Jin Zhong is just a spy.

671
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:19,300
He is a very famous spy.

672
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:22,300
Even we can't find out how he was born.

673
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:26,300
It must be because someone covered his past experience.

674
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:28,300
His family was in Feng Yi Army.

675
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:31,300
He could erase his experience so cleanly.

676
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:35,300
He must have the ability to cover up the people in Feng Yi Army.

677
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:39,300
And he was born in the police palace of Feng Yi Army.

678
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,300
Only Prince Yong was born.

679
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:44,300
But Prince Yong is not in the capital.

680
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:51,300
Only his son, Xiao Shi Zi, is in the capital.

681
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:58,300
You have to be careful.

682
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:02,300
If I'm in trouble, I'll be in trouble.

683
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:08,300
Thank you.

684
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:30,300
These are my guesses.

685
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:34,300
But now I see someone, I'll be in trouble.

686
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:37,300
Young Master, you guessed it right.

687
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:39,300
We've got the information about Xu Jin Zhong.

688
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:41,300
The person behind it can't contact him.

689
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:43,300
And he's in a hurry to take the military line.

690
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:45,300
He'll contact the buyer himself.

691
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:48,300
So we just need to keep an eye on Xiao Shi Zi.

692
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:51,300
Then we'll know who the person behind it is.

693
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:54,300
Then Xiao Shi Zi has gone to Tianjia Jiu Lou.

694
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,300
Let's go.

695
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:58,300
Let's go.

696
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:00,300
Yes.

697
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,300
General Lin!

698
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:26,300
General Lin, please save our princess.

699
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:28,300
Our princess is in a coma.

700
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,300
Move aside.

701
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:32,300
Do you want to save her?

702
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:35,300
Even if you want to get close to her,

703
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:38,300
she's always the only daughter of Prince Ruyang.

704
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:39,300
If you don't save her,

705
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:41,300
you'll be in trouble.

706
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:44,300
You'll be blamed for your loss.

707
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:45,300
Go away!

708
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:15,300
GO!

709
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,300
Put it down!

710
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:31,300
Put it down!

711
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:39,900
A female groom?

712
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:41,300
Yes.

713
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:45,300
I'm sorry.

714
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:46,900
This ball...

715
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:48,300
Stop it!

716
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:49,300
Don't touch me!

717
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:50,300
Stop it!

718
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:54,300
Give it back to me!

719
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:07,300
Who would have thought that the ball

720
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:08,300
that Yuan Shan Jian threw out for the first time

721
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:09,300
was actually returned?

722
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:11,300
It seems that

723
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:12,300
he has been punished

724
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:16,300
and that this little girl is not ordinary.

725
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:30,300
Hurry up!

726
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:31,300
Stop it!

727
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:32,300
Stop it!

728
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:33,300
Don't touch me!

729
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:34,300
Stop it!

730
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:36,300
Stop it!

731
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:37,300
Stop it!

732
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:38,300
Don't touch me!

733
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,300
Hurry up!

734
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:40,300
Stop it!

735
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:41,300
Stop it!

736
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:42,300
Stop it!

737
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:43,300
Don't touch me!

738
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:45,300
Hold it!

739
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:46,300
Stop it!

740
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:47,300
Don't touch me!

741
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:48,300
General Lin,

742
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:49,300
please help our princess

743
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:51,300
as soon as possible.

744
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:56,300
Hold it!

745
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:57,300
Stop it!

746
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:58,300
Hold it!

747
00:41:58,300 --> 00:41:59,300
Stop it!
