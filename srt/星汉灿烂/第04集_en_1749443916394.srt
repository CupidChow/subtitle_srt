End of Episode Six

2
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You're a little girl.

3
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You're going to be a burden to me.

4
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You're trying to help me?

5
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Are you trying to force me to stay in the house?

6
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
You even don't want to ruin your mother.

7
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
That's why I'm blaming you.

8
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Uncle and aunt are doing this for the sake of the Chen family.

9
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
They don't want to move the house.

10
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
And I'm doing this for the sake of my mother.

11
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
You go upstairs and I'll ask.

12
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Why do you blame me for being alone?

13
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I know you're so stubborn.

14
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You're trying to make us understand each other.

15
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Uncle and aunt are moving to the new house.

16
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
But I'm alone here.

17
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
You're going to be a burden to me.

18
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Uncle and aunt are not good at playing.

19
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I'm thinking that the new house is big.

20
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
The house can be empty.

21
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I'm afraid that Uncle and aunt will be in trouble.

22
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
That's a good idea.

23
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Stop it.

24
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I'm a good girl.

25
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I won't move out of the house.

26
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
But now you're moving the house.

27
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You're alone?

28
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Who do you want me to marry?

29
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I'm a mother, a father, a son.

30
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I want a man to be my child.

31
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Who are you talking about?

32
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
A man and...

33
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I can't tell you clearly.

34
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Don't be so proud.

35
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You and your mother are good friends.

36
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You have a great merit in the world.

37
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
What's so great about that?

38
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
If I were a good friend,

39
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I wouldn't stay in the house.

40
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I wouldn't have a boyfriend since I was a child.

41
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
If I were a good friend,

42
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I wouldn't be left in the house

43
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
with my parents.

44
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I wouldn't know the person.

45
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I wouldn't be in trouble.

46
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
你们不能维 main.

47
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
popularity

48
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,520
Sorry, doctor.

49
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,520
Uncle has a lot of problems.

50
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,520
But these years,

51
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,520
Uncle has been a good son to Uncle.

52
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,520
He is a good son to you.

53
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,520
How can you not know his son?

54
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,520
A good son to me?

55
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,520
He is not capable of that.

56
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,520
He is a bastard.

57
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,520
If he is a bastard,

58
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,520
he can't afford to be a family member.

59
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,520
I am not here to take you and your father's life.

60
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,520
You are a bastard.

61
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,520
You are a bastard.

62
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,520
You are just a member of the family.

63
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,520
Mrs. Zhong is so familiar with you

64
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,520
when she sees you.

65
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,520
Didn't you see that?

66
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,520
She is being criticized by the birds.

67
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,520
You mean,

68
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,520
Prince is on purpose?

69
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,520
Bring some people to the house.

70
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,520
Yes.

71
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,520
Chengcheng.

72
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,520
You are a man.

73
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,520
You are a man.

74
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,520
You are so rude.

75
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,520
How about

76
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,520
I give you this dress?

77
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,520
You can wear it

78
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,520
and see what you can do.

79
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,520
You can't be a good son.

80
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,520
You can't be a good son.

81
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,520
What can you do?

82
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,520
What can you do?

83
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,520
I am so rude.

84
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,520
I am so mad.

85
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,520
You are so mean.

86
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,520
Enough.

87
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,520
If you are not well,

88
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,520
you can go back to the house.

89
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,520
I will do my best for you.

90
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,520
Don't think.

91
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:45,520
My family is in a difficult situation.

92
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:49,520
Now the murderer is in the capital.

93
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,520
You are mad at me?

94
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,520
Don't think.

95
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,520
If you want to go back to the house,

96
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,520
I will do my best.

97
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,520
What?

98
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,520
You have been a coward for a lifetime.

99
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,520
You are so mean.

100
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,520
How dare you to talk to me?

101
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,520
I am telling you.

102
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,520
Don't think.

103
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,520
You are a coward.

104
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,520
Do you know what to do?

105
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,520
Stop.

106
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,520
Put it down.

107
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,520
Put it down.

108
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,520
Master.

109
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,520
Qing Cong.

110
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,520
General has been looking for a good wine.

111
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,520
He wants to drink with you.

112
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,520
Go with him.

113
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,520
Yes.

114
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,520
Miss Qing Cong.

115
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,520
You don't have to help me.

116
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,520
I can do it myself.

117
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,520
I don't dare to fight with you.

118
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,520
Please don't make trouble for me.

119
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,520
Let me go.

120
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,520
Let me go.

121
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,520
Xiao Yuan Yi.

122
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,520
How dare you to hit me?

123
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,520
I don't just want to hit you today.

124
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,520
I also want to humiliate you.

125
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,520
Don't think.

126
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,520
The Cheng family is poor.

127
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,520
They all depend on our family.

128
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,520
So what?

129
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,520
Now the Cheng family is weak.

130
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:58,520
I want to hit you, but I want to humiliate you.

131
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,520
How can you do that?

132
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,520
Look.

133
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:06,520
My father is kind to the Cheng family.

134
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,520
What kind?

135
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,520
He gives us food and water?

136
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,520
We have never seen a family of rich people.

137
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,520
We protect the Zhou power.

138
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,520
We want to make sure that

139
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,520
we don't lose the life of the people

140
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,520
and save the lives of many people.

141
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,520
Isn't it just some food and water?

142
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,520
It's a good thing.

143
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,520
You bastard.

144
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,520
Stop it.

145
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33,520
You stupid woman.

146
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,520
You are the second emperor.

147
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,520
Do you think it's your work?

148
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,520
Is he afraid of you?

149
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,520
We moved out after three days.

150
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:48,520
You just wait for the Gou family to pick you up.

151
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,520
What do you mean?

152
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,520
What do you mean?

153
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:55,520
You want to inform my mother that I am a bad person?

154
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:00,520
Don't you want to change the marriage several times?

155
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,520
You can't marry her.

156
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,520
I just want to help you with one thing.

157
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,520
I know you are so nice to me.

158
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,520
You want to revenge for your daughter.

159
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,520
But I have never been a bad person.

160
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,520
She is the one who didn't fight for herself.

161
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,520
You hate the wrong person.

162
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,520
I, Xiao Yuan Yi, never hate the wrong person.

163
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,520
I will never hate the wrong person.

164
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,520
You hate the heart of the people.

165
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,520
I will never give up on you.

166
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:30,520
I will do everything you do.

167
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:41,520
I know everything you have done to her for the past ten years.

168
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,520
What can you do with me?

169
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,520
I can't let you go back to your mother.

170
00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:00,520
You are so beautiful.

171
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,520
Yang Yang is a member of the Cheng family.

172
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,520
Of course, he is a member of the Cheng family.

173
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,520
But you have to go.

174
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:15,520
I need you to know that you were the one who left me in the dark.

175
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,520
I can smell the scent of your heart.

176
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:25,520
Can you tell me what are your thoughts on my aunt's trip?

177
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,520
Why do you do that?

178
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,520
I have an offer for my uncle.

179
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:34,520
A goodMLI!

180
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,520
Your uncle!

181
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,520
You are so clever.

182
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,520
He doesn't have mine,

183
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,520
and a kong with jing Hong.

184
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,520
Why are you asking me something about him?

185
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,520
Don't mention him.

186
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,520
You dare to go to the mother's face?

187
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,520
What's your intention?

188
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,520
Uncle Xu is a good man.

189
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,520
He doesn't want to have children.

190
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:57,520
It's good that you are so weak.

191
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:01,520
Why don't you stay with the young master?

192
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,520
You can take care of the child.

193
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,520
You can do the same to the old god.

194
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:08,520
You can make the aunt live a peaceful life.

195
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,520
Isn't it beautiful?

196
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,520
I don't want to disband my mother.

197
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,520
No one will stay.

198
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,520
We will die together.

199
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,520
What about the mother?

200
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:22,520
Isn't she your family?

201
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,520
Do you want to kill her?

202
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:30,520
The old god said that I will be killed by the snow.

203
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:33,520
I must stay and be killed.

204
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,520
You are not a child.

205
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,520
Do you want my life?

206
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,520
I have a white sheep.

207
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,520
How many do you have?

208
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:44,520
I can't live anymore.

209
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:48,520
Mother, it's a lie.

210
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,520
It's nonsense.

211
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,520
The old god is so naive.

212
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:55,520
He said that the father will be killed by the snow.

213
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,520
Is it true?

214
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,520
Yes.

215
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,520
It's true.

216
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,520
Okay, I will kill him now.

217
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,520
Let's see if he can figure out his own plan.

218
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,520
General.

219
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,520
General, the commander of the army just left.

220
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,520
The army is in danger.

221
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,520
General should go to rescue the people.

222
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,520
What?

223
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,520
The commander of the army just left.

224
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,520
The whole army left in an hour.

225
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,520
The army left the city and was in a hurry.

226
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,520
You can leave.

227
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,520
You must leave this child.

228
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,520
Otherwise, you will be killed by me.

229
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,520
My lord.

230
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,520
Yuanyi.

231
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,520
What did you say?

232
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:51,520
Only the child can be saved for my life.

233
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,520
Yes.

234
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:55,520
You must leave this child.

235
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,520
Yes.

236
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,520
This child.

237
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,520
If so,

238
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,520
which child will be left?

239
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,520
The child.

240
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,520
It's a dragon and a phoenix.

241
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:15,520
There is a female child left.

242
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,520
Who is she?

243
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,520
The female child left to the army.

244
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,520
She is my husband.

245
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,520
She is my wife.

246
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,520
I will take my son away.

247
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,520
Yes.

248
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,520
General.

249
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:40,520
You must not be in a hurry.

250
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,520
Go to the city immediately.

251
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,520
Go to the city immediately.

252
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,520
I have no order.

253
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,520
You must not step out of this house.

254
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,520
Yes.

255
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,520
Where is the second uncle?

256
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,520
My lord.

257
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,520
Don't worry.

258
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,520
Some people are watching the situation.

259
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,520
Now they are going to be in the front.

260
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,520
Don't let them ruin our royal policy.

261
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,520
Don't worry, my lord.

262
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,520
I can't see Mrs. Zhong.

263
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,520
She is now giving him a knife.

264
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,520
She can't bear to see it.

265
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:46,520
It's not a good thing to be in a family.

266
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:50,520
It's not a good thing to be in a family.

267
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,520
Don't be so impulsive.

268
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,520
What you said is true.

269
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,520
If she is a little bit more safe,

270
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:09,520
I will stay in this old house with her.

271
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:14,520
Now it seems that I can't use it.

272
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,520
I just have to wait a bit longer and the demon will leave.

273
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,520
You go, don't rush.

274
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,520
A woman is used to prison home withoutamerica.

275
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,520
She said.

276
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,520
I'm sick now.

277
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,520
Director.

278
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,520
Those worth a lot of fortune.

279
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,520
Where have you been?

280
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,520
The secret behind Ah Shaрать University.

281
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,520
Let's go.

282
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,520
Search.

283
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,520
Yes.

284
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,520
Go.

285
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,520
Master.

286
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,520
The world is a blacksmith.

287
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,520
It's most important to respect the people.

288
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,520
It's impossible to recognize the people of God.

289
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:54,520
What's wrong?

290
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,520
What's wrong?

291
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,520
I can find it here.

292
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,520
It's a good thing.

293
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,520
But you want to know, I can't tell you anything.

294
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,520
I have no children, no children.

295
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,520
I can't tell you anything.

296
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,520
You can't tell me anything.

297
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,520
I know you have many children.

298
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:19,520
If you have them, you will be in trouble.

299
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,520
So...

300
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,520
He's going to help.

301
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,520
Get up.

302
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,520
It's a poison.

303
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,520
He can't live.

304
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,520
He's going to help.

305
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,520
These weapons are too much.

306
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,520
We have no time.

307
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,520
Let's go.

308
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,520
Hurry.

309
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,520
Go.

310
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:18,520
Ancestria

311
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,640
Scared.

312
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,320
All

313
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:45,800
all thepic специitis

314
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:49,380
You can put all of the girls in your house and catch them all.

315
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,060
Another one of the girls...

316
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,340
I had to see it myself.

317
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,180
How Many Slings Can We而已!

318
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:00,940
Principal Shao, did you put the girl there on purpose?

319
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:03,140
If he did,

320
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,640
I will not forget about it.

321
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:14,840
That time, those которая was a knémer!

322
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,800
It's him.

323
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,800
I can't believe he died so easily.

324
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,800
Take this gun away.

325
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,800
Search the third floor!

326
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,800
Yes, sir.

327
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,800
Wait.

328
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,800
Don't make too much noise.

329
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,800
Don't let anyone know about Xu Jin Chu's death.

330
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:57,800
Investigate his arrival and news.

331
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,800
Don't let anyone know.

332
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,800
Yes, sir.

333
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,800
Hello, sir.

334
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:52,800
Mr. Yue Fu, I'm sorry.

335
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,800
It's our fault.

336
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,800
We're sorry.

337
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:05,800
Yang Yang, I'm sorry.

338
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,800
Get up.

339
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:13,800
Yang Yang, you look good.

340
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,800
You look good, sir.

341
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,800
You look good.

342
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,800
You look good in the wedding dress.

343
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:26,800
Yang Yang, I brought you a lot of things.

344
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,800
You're weak.

345
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,800
Your legs are not comfortable.

346
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,800
You're old.

347
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,800
Don't stand here.

348
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,800
Hurry up.

349
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,800
Yes, sir.

350
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,800
Please.

351
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,800
Bring him back.

352
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,800
Let's go.

353
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:11,800
I'm sorry for his loss of mother.

354
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,800
I'm too proud.

355
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,800
I know he has many things to do.

356
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:21,800
But he's still a good boy.

357
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,800
Thank you for your hard work.

358
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:29,800
You've been so kind these years.

359
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:34,800
Today, I'm here to...

360
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,800
Sir.

361
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,800
I'm here to...

362
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,800
Sir, please.

363
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:45,800
Fu, he's been so kind to me.

364
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,800
Bastard!

365
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,800
You're a loser.

366
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,800
Since you were born,

367
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,800
Jun Qiu has been so kind to you.

368
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,800
You've been so filial.

369
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,800
You've been so mean to me.

370
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,800
Jun Qiu is old.

371
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,800
You're so brave to marry Feng Xue.

372
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:12,800
You're so generous.

373
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:18,800
You're so heartless.

374
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:23,800
You're so kind to me.

375
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:27,800
If you didn't help me...

376
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,800
Sir, please.

377
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,800
Only my daughter and wife

378
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:36,800
can keep the food in their mouths all day.

379
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:40,800
It's a big mess.

380
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,800
I have many assets.

381
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,800
But I have no one to support me.

382
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:50,800
I'm just a fool.

383
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,800
I'm so proud of you.

384
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,800
I'm so proud of you.

385
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,800
How can I thank you?

386
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,800
I'm so proud of you.

387
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,800
I'm sorry, sir.

388
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:06,800
I've been so kind to you for over ten years.

389
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:13,800
I thought you'd get better with your age.

390
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:20,800
But I didn't expect you to be so kind to me.

391
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,800
I'm sorry.

392
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,800
I didn't raise my daughter well.

393
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,800
I've been so kind to you.

394
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,800
Sir, don't say that.

395
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,800
I'm not like that.

396
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,800
She's...

397
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,800
No, sir.

398
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,800
I've always been a grown-up.

399
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:41,800
How could I not know your personality?

400
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:45,800
You were the best daughter in the world.

401
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:49,800
You were so kind to me.

402
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:54,800
I'm so proud of you.

403
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:59,800
Today, you'll be the best daughter in the world.

404
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,800
I'll take the enemy back.

405
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,800
You said your family is here.

406
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,800
My wife has been working for the family.

407
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,800
Why did you come back?

408
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,800
You made me a family.

409
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,800
Who am I going to be?

410
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,800
I used to think that Tang Zi was unlucky.

411
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,800
He was so ungrateful.

412
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,800
Now I know that his life is really good.

413
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,800
He's the one who saved my mother.

414
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,800
He's not my wife.

415
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,800
He's just a kid.

416
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,800
What's the secret?

417
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,800
The family is a good family.

418
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,800
If Tang Zi grew up like me,

419
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,800
he would be like my mother.

420
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,800
He's a good man.

421
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,800
Now he's a father.

422
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:16,800
But he's not my family.

423
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,800
He's a good man.

424
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,800
He's a good man.

425
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,800
I'm not good enough.

426
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:29,800
You don't like your husband.

427
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,800
How can you leave?

428
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,800
You haven't given him a good life.

429
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,800
You're so rude.

430
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,800
He's not here to be a relative.

431
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,800
He's here to do something big.

432
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,800
I'm not a kid.

433
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,800
Do you think I'm a bad man?

434
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,800
I've been a bad man for a long time.

435
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:53,800
I should be the one who's sorry for my son.

436
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,800
But today,

437
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:00,800
I'm not a good man.

438
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:04,800
I'll change my mind.

439
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,800
You should go to see your mother and Gatai Palace.

440
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,800
So that you can wait for a long time.

441
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:13,800
I'll go home.

442
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,800
I want to go home.

443
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,800
Sha Yangyang,

444
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,800
Cheng's family is your family.

445
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,800
Your parents and your family are in this family.

446
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,800
You're only in Cheng's family.

447
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,800
You have a family.

448
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,800
I don't want a family.

449
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:33,800
I want to save my father and my mother.

450
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,800
Zi.

451
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,800
Come in.

452
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,800
Sister.

453
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,800
Greetings, aunt.

454
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,800
This is your mother, right?

455
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,800
She looks so good.

456
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,800
Come, sit down.

457
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,800
Hello.

458
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,800
This is Mrs. Jiang.

459
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:15,800
This aunt is turning the table so quickly.

460
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,800
She has a father and a mother.

461
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,800
She can't put her hand in her hands.

462
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:23,580
Look at her smiling face

463
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,800
because there're threeimmons.

464
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,800
This is sister, right?

465
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,800
But later he married into your family.

466
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,800
You suffered a lot.

467
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,800
Now he is taken back by the imperial court.

468
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,800
And you have to be punished.

469
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:47,800
Speaking of which, I am sorry for you.

470
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:55,800
Yang Yang, don't listen to others' words.

471
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,800
Just think about it.

472
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,800
We are not only your parents.

473
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,800
We are not only your parents.

474
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,800
We are also your family.

475
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,800
If you are proud of your parents,

476
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,800
you should learn to follow them.

477
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:12,800
If you are not good enough for your parents,

478
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,800
you should take them as your concubines.

479
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:20,800
Remember, your behavior is the best match for you.

480
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,800
Now raise your head.

481
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:29,800
My wife is a genius.

482
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,800
As shapeless as a premade.

483
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,800
I hope that your family doesn't suffer the same...

484
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,800
with that arenas as you like.

485
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,800
Thank you.

486
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:54,800
But my mom only takes care of mine.

487
00:32:54,800 --> 00:33:00,800
You should learn the three-fourth grade of Uncle.

488
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,800
It's boring.

489
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,800
Why don't you drink the old ginger?

490
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:09,800
Uncle, it's our old ginger.

491
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,800
It's delicious.

492
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,800
You are so sensible.

493
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,800
I am still like the old man,

494
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,800
my heart is wide open.

495
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:30,800
The ginger is so soft and firm.

496
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,800
It's so soft and firm.

497
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,800
It's like my bird.

498
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:35,800
It's so...

499
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,800
I don't know if everything is still in order.

500
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,800
It's not too late to give birth.

501
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,800
It's always the children's time.

502
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,800
As long as mother's child is alive,

503
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,800
they will have the responsibility to teach them.

504
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:02,800
Although Yangyang is a little bit stubborn,

505
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,800
he is always obedient.

506
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,800
I hope that after sister's death,

507
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,800
you won't dislike her.

508
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,800
I used to like Ah Zi.

509
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,800
I like Yangyang that Ah Zi gave birth to.

510
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,800
I like him more.

511
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,800
How can I dislike him?

512
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,800
From today on,

513
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:24,800
Yangyang will be like my own daughter.

514
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,800
He will never be wronged.

515
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,800
The千ets we met

516
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,800
and we have known each other for so long,

517
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,800
is the last thing I thought about juicyada.

518
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,800
I was having heartache with Du hebbenen.

519
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:16,800
The things are passing by me and I bow to you in my face.

520
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,800
Stop.

521
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,040
What else do you want?

522
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,720
Didn't you say you'd go to see your husband?

523
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,040
Why did you still go back?

524
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,840
I don't think he's going to rest.

525
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,640
If I go now,

526
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,920
I'm afraid my mother will be upset.

527
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:42,480
Do you mean I want to go to Tingqiangen?

528
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,080
If so,

529
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,840
I can accompany you.

530
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,240
Tell me,

531
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:50,040
why did you steal the gun from Ge Jiumu?

532
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,040
He's still here.

533
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,240
You're so crazy.

534
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:55,240
Why did you kill him?

535
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,640
I just think Ge Jiumu is a good listener.

536
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:04,440
I like people with this personality.

537
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,440
That's why I did it.

538
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,840
Why did mother think of me like this?

539
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,840
She just looked at me.

540
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:15,240
She wanted to take me out of the worst.

541
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,040
I didn't like her.

542
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,640
After she died,

543
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,440
I never gave up.

544
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,200
So I did everything

545
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,640
to make up for it.

546
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:26,240
If you didn't do it on your own,

547
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,640
I wouldn't have misunderstood you.

548
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,640
If you were like her,

549
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,440
you would be so gentle and gentle.

550
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,040
People would think you.

551
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:36,840
That's why you're so good.

552
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,640
I'm stupid.

553
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,640
I can't learn to be nice.

554
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,640
I'm so jealous of her.

555
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:48,040
I've never taught her since I was a child.

556
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,240
I've never taught her since I was a child.

557
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,040
I can't compare to her.

558
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:56,040
Mother doesn't have to be angry.

559
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,040
She has a way.

560
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,440
To make up for her,

561
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:03,440
she doesn't have to keep staring at me.

562
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,840
She needs to see the beauty of the world.

563
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,240
If that's the case,

564
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:09,240
you'll be fine.

565
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,840
Mother.

566
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:14,240
I can't believe

567
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,240
that you're so good at fighting.

568
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:19,240
You're just a perfect woman.

569
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:25,240
I'll find a way

570
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:28,240
to teach you slowly.

571
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,240
Chen Shaoshan.

572
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:34,240
I'm not sure

573
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,240
if you're interested in

574
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,640
or if you've been a bit worried about me,

575
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:42,640
start to respect me.

576
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:45,240
You don't have to share the burden,

577
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:54,240
I'm pulling you through a lot compared to you.

578
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,240
It's better to mean things to others

579
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:00,240
than to be nice to others.

580
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,240
Then you can be more beautiful.

581
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,680
Shoot the ass

582
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,900
For thetest man!

583
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:18,960
The Truth

584
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,540
Father, how are you?

585
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:37,520
Nice to see you

586
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:41,520
I have no face to see you off.

587
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:48,520
Xianzhi, you've been studying at home since you were a child.

588
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,520
You've been studying hard.

589
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:54,520
You must have studied in Bailushan.

590
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:57,520
It's wrong. I'm sorry.

591
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,520
You shouldn't be ashamed of your own knowledge.

592
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,520
You shouldn't be ashamed of your own age.

593
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:06,520
You've been a great scholar for a long time.

594
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,520
We can't compare with the rest of the world.

595
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:11,520
But we can always be close to each other.

596
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,520
From now on, you'll learn to do something.

597
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,520
You'll return to your hometown.

598
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,520
You must do something.

599
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:22,520
No matter what, as long as he's willing to study, we'll teach him.

600
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:27,520
I won't forget that.

601
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,520
As you wish.

602
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,520
I'll do my best.

603
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,520
Okay.

604
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,520
Father.

605
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:38,520
Father, you can go to study.

606
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:42,520
You'll learn to do something at home.

607
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,520
You'll return to your hometown.

608
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,520
You must do something.

609
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:50,520
You can't take care of me from now on.

610
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:58,520
Zhang Sifu, I'm sorry.

611
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:01,520
Although I'm a woman, I'm used to it.

612
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,520
But I can't be at ease.

613
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:07,520
So I hope you can take care of me.

614
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:11,520
So I can take care of you and you.

615
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:23,520
Don't worry, I'll be like my own daughter.

616
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,520
I'll take care of you.

617
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:29,520
I won't let Yangyang suffer.

618
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,520
Yangyang.

619
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:34,520
When you meet, you should discuss it with your aunt.

620
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:38,520
You must remember that the Cheng family is your home.

621
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,520
Please don't worry.

622
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,520
I will.

623
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:48,520
Dear, you must listen to your aunt and aunt.

624
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,520
Okay.

625
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:56,520
I'll make a big deal out of it.

626
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,520
Please stay.

627
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,520
I'll take my leave.

628
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:04,520
Take care of yourself.

629
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,520
Please take care of me.

630
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:17,520
Thank you, Chengcheng.

631
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,520
Thank you, brother.

632
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,520
Take care.

633
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,520
Take care.

634
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,520
Take care.

635
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,520
Don't be sad.

636
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:03,520
Your father and mother have sent you to the White Mountain.

637
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:08,520
But you'll be well-off if your father comes to the Academy.

638
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:31,520
The White Mountain is a beautiful place.

639
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,520
It's a beautiful place.

640
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,520
It's a beautiful place.

641
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,520
It's a beautiful place.

642
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,520
It's a beautiful place.

643
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,520
It's a beautiful place.

644
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,520
It's a beautiful place.

645
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,520
It's a beautiful place.

646
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,520
It's a beautiful place.

647
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,520
It's a beautiful place.

648
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,520
It's a beautiful place.

649
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,520
It's a beautiful place.

650
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,520
It's a beautiful place.

651
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,520
It's a beautiful place.
