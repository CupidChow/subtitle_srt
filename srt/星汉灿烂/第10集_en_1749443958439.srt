1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,920
A public holiday

2
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:41,760
Star Media

3
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:47,840
Episode One

4
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,960
A Shah.

5
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:15,660
General Ling,

6
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,100
what is the purpose of being shot so late at night?

7
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,920
I heard that the Hei tatsächlich committed a trouble in the Precinct.

8
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,300
Since I was cartridgeing me to take myрал for him,

9
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,740
betrayed our emperor.

10
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:28,940
General Ling,

11
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:29,740
What's the matter?

12
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:32,700
The former general of the General's Manor also lost his life.

13
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,060
This criminal is too much.

14
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,540
If he doesn't help us soon,

15
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:39,740
the capital will be in trouble.

16
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:42,540
Please, Your Highness, please help us.

17
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:46,460
Search.

18
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:47,420
Yes!

19
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:48,660
You!

20
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,460
Ling Buyi!

21
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,900
I am the Prince of the Dragon King!

22
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,220
I am living in the capital!

23
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:57,140
I am waiting for the Prince of the Dragon King!

24
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:58,460
You are the Prince of the Dragon King!

25
00:02:58,460 --> 00:02:59,620
You are the Prince of the Dragon King!

26
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,860
Prince of Xiao,

27
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:05,220
even if you are the Prince of the Dragon King,

28
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:08,820
I will still be the Prince of the Dragon King.

29
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:11,260
Ling Buyi, what are you saying?

30
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,620
Young Master, I have searched it.

31
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,380
I haven't found the criminal.

32
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,500
General Ling,

33
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,020
even if you don't have anything,

34
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,820
you should hurry and bring the black armor.

35
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,100
Go back first.

36
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,660
The Palace of the Central Plains.

37
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:51,500
This is the imperial letter from His Majesty.

38
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,100
Naturally,

39
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,380
my father was born in the Dragon King.

40
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:58,700
He helped His Majesty to conquer the whole of the country

41
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,700
and seal the capital.

42
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:03,140
This letter is a gift from His Majesty

43
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:05,780
to the family of Xiao.

44
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,460
The Prince of the Dragon King

45
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:10,620
is a man of the world.

46
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:14,140
He is a man of the world.

47
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:16,340
I believe that Prince Xiao

48
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:19,300
will not disappoint His Majesty.

49
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,620
Right?

50
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:24,260
How should I assume that Prince Xiao

51
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,380
is not one of those arrow hands?

52
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,620
But whom he Uncle Mu.

53
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,540
Captain,

54
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:36,220
Ling Buyi has one established very well in the whole of the country.

55
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:37,220
I'll go.

56
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:53,220
Is Ling Bu Yi suspicious of us?

57
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,220
What about General Fan?

58
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:00,220
Ling Bu Yi is not a good man.

59
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:04,220
If I were a man, I would be in trouble.

60
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:09,220
I'll wait for him.

61
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:18,220
Father, who are you?

62
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,220
Uncle Guan.

63
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:24,220
Brother, brother.

64
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:26,220
Congratulations, Brother Wan.

65
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:29,220
I heard that His Majesty thinks Lady Se Feng as a wife.

66
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,220
Today, she is really a good daughter.

67
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,220
She is a good daughter.

68
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:35,220
She is only for the sake of the glory.

69
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,220
Now, Mother is being conferred by His Majesty.

70
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:40,220
I feel that she is more important than her own daughter-in-law.

71
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,220
Brother Wan is a good girl.

72
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,220
Brother, please come in.

73
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,220
Brother Wan, are you...

74
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,220
I'm fine. I'm fine.

75
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,220
I'm just a little injured.

76
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,220
Let's go.

77
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:59,220
What happened to Uncle Guan's butt?

78
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,220
Do you remember the day you passed by

79
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:03,220
and you saw the pig's face?

80
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:05,220
What did you do?

81
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:09,220
It turns out that it was my aunt who beat my dad to death.

82
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:11,220
She didn't die.

83
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:14,220
But it's strange.

84
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:16,220
How could she beat her dad to death?

85
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:27,220
Don't make me suffer.

86
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:35,220
Dad, let's go.

87
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,220
What happened?

88
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,780
I'll go to the bathroom.

89
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:05,820
I'll go with you.

90
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:06,580
Don't go with me.

91
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,380
You're the master. You have to take care of the guests.

92
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:11,420
I've been here for a few days. My dad will be here soon.

93
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:12,580
Go, go.

94
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:13,580
Okay, take care.

95
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:14,260
Okay.

96
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:14,980
Okay.

97
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,780
I'm going to the bathroom.

98
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:24,380
Okay.

99
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,380
I'll go with you.

100
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,380
I'll go with you.

101
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:27,380
Okay.

102
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,380
I'll go with you.

103
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:29,380
Okay.

104
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,380
I'll go with you.

105
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,380
Okay.

106
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,380
I'll go with you.

107
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:33,380
Okay.

108
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,380
I'll go with you.

109
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:04,980
Did I win?

110
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,100
I won.

111
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,220
Yeah, the ring went in there.

112
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,740
They only have to prepare two bottles of soap.

113
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:18,740
Wow.

114
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,220
Wow.

115
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,740
Why are you carrying everything?

116
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,740
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

117
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,740
Give me.

118
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,740
Give me.

119
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,740
I'm sorry.

120
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,740
Let's go.

121
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:44,740
Wan Qiqi, this is your house's guest house.

122
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:46,740
We'll stay here for a while.

123
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,740
I'll take care of it.

124
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:51,740
Okay, I'll feed you.

125
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,740
I'll stay with you.

126
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,740
Wait, wait.

127
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:59,740
Han Shijianbo doesn't deserve your hospitality.

128
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,740
I sent you a love letter.

129
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,740
You're just a guest house.

130
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,740
Who knows that you're really a man?

131
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:08,740
You've invited many young wolves.

132
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:11,740
I'm not here for you.

133
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:15,740
You're not here to visit wolves, are you?

134
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,740
You're so lucky.

135
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,740
Today is my birthday.

136
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,740
Can you take it?

137
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:28,740
General Wan said he'll take you to the zoo.

138
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,740
I just want to see the zoo.

139
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:31,740
This is your house.

140
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,740
We're not good friends.

141
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,740
I'm not here to visit wolves.

142
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:39,740
I'm here to visit wolves.

143
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:40,740
This is your house.

144
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,740
We're not good friends.

145
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,740
I've been here for a while.

146
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:47,740
I'm not here to visit wolves.

147
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:50,740
Where?

148
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,740
Where?

149
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:55,740
Where?

150
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:59,740
Qi Jiazi.

151
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,740
Here you are.

152
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:02,740
You're better.

153
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:03,740
Let's go.

154
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,740
Han Shijianbo.

155
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:09,740
Are you going to visit wolves?

156
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,740
Yes.

157
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,740
You were a good boy.

158
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,740
You're a good man.

159
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,740
Li.

160
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,740
What are you doing here?

161
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,740
I'm not going.

162
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:28,740
Sit down.

163
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,740
My mother told me to take care of you.

164
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:32,740
You're following me.

165
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,740
Don't be a stranger here.

166
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:35,740
Luo Yao.

167
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,740
You have the time to take care of Li.

168
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:41,740
I heard that you and your family

169
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,740
are going to leave the zoo.

170
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,740
How can you be so ungrateful?

171
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,740
How can you be so cruel?

172
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:50,740
You're the one who can't wait to be with you.

173
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:52,740
You're going to be my wife.

174
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,740
You're not going to see anyone.

175
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:55,740
Qi Jiazi.

176
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:59,740
It's a long story for a man to leave the zoo.

177
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,740
My mother told me so.

178
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,740
She said that He Zhaojun

179
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:06,740
was kicked out of the zoo because of his marriage.

180
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,740
It's not a big deal.

181
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,740
I'm not saying that.

182
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:13,740
Thank you for your words.

183
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,740
You're so good.

184
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:17,740
You're a good girl.

185
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,740
No wonder she's going to cancel the engagement.

186
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,740
I think the girl with the wrong name

187
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,740
is going to be with you.

188
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:25,740
Stop arguing.

189
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,740
My wife is a beast.

190
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:30,740
We can't be a stranger.

191
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,740
My sister is so kind.

192
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:35,740
Don't be so hard on her.

193
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,740
You're right.

194
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,740
You're a man of your word.

195
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:42,740
You're not like someone.

196
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,740
My wife.

197
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,740
Why don't you learn from her?

198
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,740
Don't stay with her all day.

199
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:49,740
You're not good enough.

200
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:52,740
You're not good enough to be with a rude and rude person like me.

201
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,740
You're a liar.

202
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:57,740
My wife.

203
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,740
She said you're a liar.

204
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,740
I'm not a liar.

205
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:04,740
I'm not a liar.

206
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,740
I'm not a liar.

207
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,740
General Ling is here.

208
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,740
General Ling.

209
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,740
So you're General Ling.

210
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:38,740
I heard you're here at the battlefield.

211
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:41,740
I'm glad to see you here.

212
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:44,740
Do you want to meet me?

213
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,740
I'm here to meet you.

214
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,740
I must marry you.

215
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,740
I'm so happy.

216
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:54,740
I'm so happy.

217
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,740
I'm so happy.

218
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:01,740
General Ling.

219
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,740
I'm so happy.

220
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,740
I'm so happy.

221
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,740
I'm so happy.

222
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,740
The scenery is better over there.

223
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:13,740
Do you want to be with me?

224
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,740
Let's enjoy the flowers together.

225
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,740
Hello, everyone.

226
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,740
Good evening, sir.

227
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,740
Good evening, sir.

228
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,740
Enjoy your meal.

229
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,740
Enjoy your meal.

230
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:36,740
Mr. Li.

231
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,740
Enjoy your meal.

232
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,740
Enjoy your meal.

233
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,740
Good evening, sir.

234
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,740
Enjoy your meal.

235
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,740
Thank you.

236
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:46,740
Brother.

237
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:49,740
Enjoy your meal.

238
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,740
Come on.

239
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,740
General Ling has been out for too long.

240
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,740
He's used to the wind and sand.

241
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:07,740
I think there's no flower in the garden.

242
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,740
Li, listen to me.

243
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,740
I'm not going back.

244
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:14,740
The aunt told me to take you back.

245
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,740
I don't want to go back with you.

246
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,740
Why not?

247
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,740
As you ordered for me,

248
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:25,740
you can go out with me on that road.

249
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,740
I'm really happy.

250
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:32,740

I'm going to the hospital!

256
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,740
I'm going to the hospital!

257
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,740
This is Mr. Yunshan from the Shiyi House.

258
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,740
Look at him!

259
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:04,740
Mr. Yun, do you know how to smile?

260
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,740
Where does General Ling speak?

261
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:10,740
Who do you think I am?

262
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,740
Yes.

263
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:16,740
May I ask Mr. Yun to smile with me?

264
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:31,740
Look at him!

265
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,740
Look at him!

266
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:46,740
Mr. Yun, you're not good enough.

267
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,740
Look at these flowers.

268
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,740
Smile.

269
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,740
Look at him!

270
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:04,740
Shiyi is looking at you.

271
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,740
Really?

272
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,740
I've never seen a real one.

273
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,740
I've never seen a real one.

274
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,740
There's a bridge. Let's go there.

275
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,740
It's clear.

276
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:20,740
There's a bridge!

277
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:22,740
Let's go!

278
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,740
Let's go!

279
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:28,740
What's going on?

280
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,740
Let me see.

281
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,740

282
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,740
Sorry, I'm not feeling well.

283
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,740
Stay here and have a rest.

284
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,740
A.Li.

285
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:50,740
They're women. You're men.

286
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,740
You should go to Shiyi House and Yunshan House.

287
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,740
Stay here.

288
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:04,740
They're going to do business!

Wanxiu,

291
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:10,740
isn't General Yun and Mr. Shanjian here?

292
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,740
What happened to me?

293
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:16,740
I was going to see the groom.

294
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,740

307
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:46,740
General Yun,

308
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,740
you brought us here

309
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:50,740
just to see the groom.

310
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,740
Have you seen it?

311
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,740
The groom.

312
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,740
The groom.

313
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,740
You're welcome.

00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,440
Come on!

341
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,440

It's impossible!

348
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,440
It's impossible!

349
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,440
Mu, when you're in a fight,

350
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,440
you're with your wife,

351
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,440
and you're with your wife.

352
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,440
How is that possible?

353
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,440
If the bird is a man like you,

354
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,440
it's impossible.

355
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,440
Maybe it's just a coincidence.

356
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,440
How would the bird know

357
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,440
when Mu would know?

358
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,440
It was when the Emperor

359
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,440
and the Great Treasures

360
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,440
helped the Chu army.

361
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,440
The name of the school is Die Gu Bridge.

362
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,440
In fact, it was just a few pieces of wood

363
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,440
that was being cut off

364
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:29,440
when someone stepped on it.

365
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,440
It was just a few pieces.

366
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,440
What I mean is,

367
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,440
did the bird see the bird

368
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:39,440
and then put it in the little girl?

369
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,440
Since then,

370
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,440
she's been using this technique

371
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,440
since she was a child.

372
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,440
The Royal Mother

373
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,440
has been looking for birds

374
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,440
to be quick.

375
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,440
It's a good thing that the bird

376
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,440
is so well-behaved.

377
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,440
If I were a young man,

378
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,440
I would be even better.

379
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,440
Right, right.

380
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,440
It's not my fault

381
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,440
that the bird

382
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,440
set this situation up in our Wanfu.

383
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,440
What's so strange about that?

384
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,440
She asked Wanfu to cut off

385
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,440
the wood from the wood

386
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,440
and then put it in Wan's house.

387
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,440
Yes.

388
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,440
But I've already made a mistake.

389
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,440
I've already made a mistake.

390
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,440
I've already told Yuan Yi and Fu Fu about this.

391
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,440
I must let Yuan Yi know

392
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,440
that what kind of person

393
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,440
her daughter is.

394
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,440
Mother,

395
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,440
since then,

396
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,440
you've been avoiding the birds.

397
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,440
In the world of people,

398
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,440
if you don't dare to do it,

399
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,440
you'd better take the time

400
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,440
to take a bath and bathe in the sun.

401
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,440
It's a good thing that you live a good life.

402
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,440
Mother is right.

403
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,440
This person

404
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,440
should know

405
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,440
what he's doing and what he's doing.

406
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,440
Would you like to come again?

407
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,440
No, no, no.

408
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,440
Mother, please stop.

409
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,440
Stop.

410
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,440
What's wrong?

411
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,440
Actually,

412
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,440
there's nothing wrong with this.

413
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,440
What is wrong with it?

414
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,440
How is that possible?

415
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,440
I, I...

416
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,440
I was just looking for reason.

417
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,440
Then I noticed

418
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,560
that your daughter worried Communication

419
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,440
did not apply to her at all.

420
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,440
Because she was on the right track,

421
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,020
she

422
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:37,600
was regarded for her

423
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,160
and won't variable like before.

424
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,440
This means that

425
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,000
they won't be

426
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,440
welcome to the world with

427
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,440
their children.

428
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,640
But角 stroke

429
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,640
was not so smart and smart

430
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,040
that Martyr didn't do all those things.

431
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,840
She's still here?

432
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,280
Why do you still think he's here?

433
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,640
What are you分cing?

434
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,440
Don't get me wrong!

435
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,320
What's happened...

436
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,320
if you don't meddle in your own business?

437
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,760
Leave theчgo Сan I go,

438
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,760
too young for another child,

439
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,280
an ordinary champion.

440
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,480
ThesePadre are herictor,

441
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,040
which made you her son.

442
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,720
This is a joyous moment!

443
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,860
σηs, it could not be possible to defy.

444
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,180
Such a mess!

445
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:20,860
He's going to break into a big trouble!

446
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:29,060
Today, I'm going to kill him.

447
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,460
I'm going to kill him!

448
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:31,660
General.

449
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,660
What do you want?

450
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:35,460
I...

451
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:36,660
I...

452
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,060
I'll do my best

453
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:39,260
to make a successful marriage.

454
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:41,060
Please go!

455
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:43,060
Get ready!

456
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:44,860
Guards!

457
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:46,860
Are you going to punish me?

458
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:48,860
I'm afraid that the birds will be scared.

459
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,260
If the brother goes down,

460
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:51,460
the birds will be fainted.

461
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:52,460
And there will be a fight.

462
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:54,660
General, what's going on?

463
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:56,060
You don't know.

464
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,660
The birds are afraid of the big news.

465
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:59,460
The normal townspeople can't scare them.

466
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:00,060
Then...

467
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:00,860
This time,

468
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:02,660
we must make them eat some bitter food

469
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:03,660
and get some blood

470
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:04,860
to make them grow up.

471
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:07,260
General.

472
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:09,660
Aren't you afraid that the birds

473
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:11,460
will hate you?

474
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:14,260
The madam is right.

475
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:15,460
So...

476
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:18,860
Don't fight with me.

477
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:20,060
Fight with the madam.

478
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:22,460
I'm a kind of person.

479
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:23,460
What kind of person

480
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:25,860
can be so good at fighting?

481
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,460
We must be careful.

482
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:29,260
After you fight,

483
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:30,460
you'll be burned.

484
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:32,060
Our family

485
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:33,660
must be strong.

486
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:37,860
You're so thoughtful.

487
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:40,060
Thank you, madam.

488
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:45,260
Xiaosu.

489
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:47,060
Take the madam here.

490
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:48,660
Yes.

491
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:56,660
I remember Xia.

492
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:58,260
Later,

493
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:01,860
I'll hide outside

494
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:03,860
and face my heart.

495
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,660
When the birds come,

496
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:07,060
the madam will be scared.

497
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:08,060
She'll be scared.

498
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,460
Then,

499
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:10,660
the madam will be in a hurry

500
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:11,860
and will be shot.

501
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:13,060
The three brothers and the father

502
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:15,060
will come here in a hurry.

503
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:15,860
You two

504
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:17,060
must be careful.

505
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:18,260
The madam

506
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:21,060
is so patient.

507
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:22,460
She must be strong.

508
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:24,460
She must be very patient

509
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:26,460
to stay in the shape of a life.

510
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:29,860
The drama is good.

511
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:30,660
Yes.

512
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:31,660
Why do we have to

513
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:33,060
play the role of the brother?

514
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:34,660
You really don't understand

515
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:36,060
my intentions.

516
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:37,860
Today,

517
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:39,260
you must know

518
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:41,260
that there are people out there.

519
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,860
Don't think that

520
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:44,060
there are people.

521
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:46,460
That's it.

522
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:50,660
Madam, don't forget.

523
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:52,660
You are a good man.

524
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:03,060
You should ask Mr. Niu

525
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:04,260
to go to the wine cellar.

526
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:05,260
Mr. Niu,

527
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:06,860
who do you want me to go to?

528
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:10,860
This time,

529
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,860
no one can help me.

530
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:05,260
Kneel down!

531
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:16,260
The Wan family is looking at him today.

532
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,260
But you did it.

533
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:23,260
Why didn't you change your mind?

534
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:24,260
No, why?

535
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:28,260
I didn't change my mind.

536
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:31,260
I didn't change my mind.

537
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,260
Why?

538
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:35,860
I just want to vent my anger.

539
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:37,860
I've watched you before you left.

540
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:39,860
If you do anything,

541
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:41,260
you won't be forgiven.

542
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:43,260
Why do you still want to do it?

543
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,260
Do it.

544
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:45,860
I'll do it.

545
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:48,260
The King of Wei will let me go.

546
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:49,860
I'll do it.

547
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:53,260
Do it.

548
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:54,260
Okay.

549
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:57,260
You dare to do it.

550
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:59,860
I don't need to be angry.

551
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:02,260
Please.

552
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:05,260
The King of Wei will let me go.

553
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:08,260
Mr. Niu,

554
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:09,260
please do it.

555
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:11,860
I'm right.

556
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:14,860
Mr. Niu.

557
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:15,860
You're right.

558
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:18,860
If you want to punish me,

559
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:21,260
just punish me.

560
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:32,260
Mr. Niu,

561
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:33,260
please do it.

562
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:34,260
I'll do it.

563
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,260
Please.

564
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:37,260
Mr. Niu,

565
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:38,260
please.

566
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:39,260
Please.

567
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:40,260
Please.

568
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:41,260
Please.

569
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:42,260
Please.

570
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:43,260
Please.

571
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:44,260
Please.

572
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:45,260
Please.

573
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,260
Please.

574
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:47,260
Please.

575
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:48,260
Please.

576
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:51,260
Why is there nothing?

577
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:54,260
Did he hit or not?

578
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:58,260
He's a gentleman.

579
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,260
Even if he's really hurt,

580
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:00,260
he won't be so angry.

581
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:03,260
He's a gentleman.

582
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:05,260
Even a gentleman can't stand it.

583
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,260
I see.

584
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:10,260
I'm confused.

585
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:11,260
I'm confused.

586
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:12,260
What's the situation

587
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:15,260
that the Prince of Azeb is in the army?

588
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:17,260
What's the situation?

589
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:20,260
Who will be the next?

590
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:22,260
As long as my family is in order,

591
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:25,260
we'll have to go to the gate.

592
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:28,260
We'll split up and go to the gate.

593
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:30,260
No one in the army

594
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:31,260
can talk.

595
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:32,260
Only the soldiers

596
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:35,260
can talk in pain.

597
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:44,260
You're so cruel.

598
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:46,260
Even if you're a meat-saving man,

599
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:48,260
you can't stop it.

600
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:54,260
I'll take care of it.

601
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:01,260
This is not a good time for me.

602
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:04,260
I won't let this bother my family.

603
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:07,260
Get out of here!

604
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:08,260
Get out of here!

605
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,260
Go!

606
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,260
Get out!

607
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:11,260
Go!

608
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,260
Go!

609
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,260
Go!

610
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:14,260
Go!

611
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,260
Go!

612
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:19,260
Go!

613
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:20,260
Go!

614
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:21,260
Go!

615
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:22,260
Go!

616
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,260
Go!

617
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:27,260
Go!

618
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:28,880
Chicken?

619
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:31,520
No way!

620
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:33,720
Sure!

621
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,260
Go!

622
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,200
Yep!

623
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:54,200
He's gone!

624
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,420
enabling more.

625
00:32:56,420 --> 00:33:06,680
I myself slayed wait and see, dough metres for the height of theOkay Water Street

626
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:13,940
Troubles

627
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,760
Smily Mudigbumps

628
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,920
Aren't we supposed to use ruby first, then toлом the dough again?

629
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,840
Do you think we could let the dough break if we do like that?

630
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:28,420
Why are you still looking at me? Go and have a look.

631
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:32,420
Go to the police station!

632
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:33,420
I'll see who can stop me!

633
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:37,420
Stop!

634
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:39,420
Who dares to hit her?

635
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:43,420
Nya Nya.

636
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:45,420
Nya Nya.

637
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:46,420
Nya Nya.

638
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:50,420
Dad, I'm sorry.

639
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:51,420
Nya Nya.

640
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:53,420
Nya Nya.

641
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:55,420
Nya Nya.

642
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:57,420
Even if Nya Nya makes a big mistake,

643
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:59,420
you won't stop her next time.

644
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:02,420
She's your biological mother!

645
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:04,420
Why did you hit her so hard?

646
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:06,420
Hurry up!

647
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:07,420
Hurry up and get the medicine!

648
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:09,420
Nya Nya.

649
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:12,420
I've never been so kind to you.

650
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:16,420
I've never let you be so cruel to your own daughter!

651
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:18,420
Even if you're wrong,

652
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:20,420
you can't be so strict with your own daughter!

653
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:22,420
Why do you have to do this?

654
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:24,420
The motive is to make a big mistake.

655
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:25,420
You can't be so cruel to your own daughter!

656
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:27,420
How can you punish her?

657
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:30,420
Good!

658
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:33,420
You didn't even come out of the hospital.

659
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:35,420
You came to question me.

660
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:36,420
Your family is a small family.

661
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:37,420
You're a big family.

662
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:40,420
You've become me in the first place.

663
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:43,420
I'm the only evil person.

664
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:44,420
Nya Nya.

665
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:47,420
Nya Nya.

666
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:51,420
You're going to the county to take her away?

667
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:58,420
I won't let this child go.

668
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:15,420
I'll be with you.

669
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:19,420
I'll be with you.

670
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:45,420
I'll be with you.

671
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:15,420
Nya Nya, go to sleep.

672
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:18,420
I'm here to see you.

673
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:23,420
Nya Nya.

674
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:26,420
In this house,

675
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:28,420
you're the best Nya Nya.

676
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:30,420
From now on,

677
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:33,420
you won't be bothered by me.

678
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:38,420
You won't let me take all the pills.

679
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:45,420
Good boy.

680
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:50,420
Nya Nya has always been a burden to me.

681
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:57,420
You're asleep.

682
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:58,420
Don't move.

683
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:45,420
I'll go to see Nya Nya.

684
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:49,420
She even had a nightmare.

685
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:52,420
I didn't see her.

686
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:56,420
The doctor took her to the hospital.

687
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:59,420
She's not sick anymore.

688
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:01,420
She's fine.

689
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:03,420
She's fine.

690
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:05,420
She's fine.

691
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:08,420
She's fine.

692
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:10,420
She's fine.

693
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:11,420
She's fine.

694
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:13,420
She's fine.

695
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:14,420
She's fine.

696
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:17,420
She's fine.

697
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:19,420
She's fine.

698
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:23,420
I've been waiting for you.

699
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:26,420
Don't worry.

700
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:29,420
It's not over yet.

701
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:32,420
I'll go to see Nya Nya.

702
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:36,420
You go.

703
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:38,420
Bye.

704
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:43,000
Try it, smoke.

705
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:51,380
One, two, three!

706
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,080
Cheers!

707
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,460
I like coffee very much?

708
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,320
How did you even break it?

709
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,440
Hold on to that.

710
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,080
The two of them fell down one of their bodies

711
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,680
Do you know? I'm standing on the lake.

712
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:17,400
I don't know who I should laugh at first.

713
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,280
It hurts.

714
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,080
Let me see.

715
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,280
Son, can you be a little bit closer?

716
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,760
I'm hurting.

717
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:38,480
I'm wrong.

718
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,440
I'm wrong.

719
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,200
Look.

720
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,280
What is it?

721
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:48,240
Look, it looks horrible.

722
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,000
Look.

723
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,680
I've got a smallcut eye.

724
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:53,680
Look at it.

725
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,880
I saved you from pain.

726
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,300
No, thank you.

727
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:02,760
Well, thank you for all that.

728
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,160
It's no use.

729
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,040
You think he's a lunatic?

730
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:12,080
I'm afraid it's even more painful.

731
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,080
I'm so sad.

732
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:20,080
But it's strange.

733
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:22,080
How could your mother know?

734
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,080
You did it.

735
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:25,080
You're so kind.

736
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,080
I don't know it.

737
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:38,080
It's her doing.

738
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,080
I did it for her.

739
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:42,080
She betrayed me.

740
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:44,080
I have no words for it.

741
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:46,080
Who did you say it was?

742
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:50,080
The God of Sins.

743
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,080
The God of Sins?

744
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,080
General Lin sent a medicine to the patient.

745
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,080
He said it was for the military.

746
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:02,080
He said it was for the military.

747
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:04,080
He said it was for the military.

748
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:06,080
He said it was for the military.

749
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,080
What happened?

750
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:12,080
Maybe...

751
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:14,080
he's in my house.

752
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:18,080
Young master,

753
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,080
she's so ungrateful.

754
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,080
She threw the medicine out.

755
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:26,080
You didn't have to watch it because of the missing child.

756
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:28,080
So you're so mad.

757
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:30,080
You're hiding in the girl's house.

758
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:38,080
I'm curious.

759
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:40,080
She's a little bit more than a little boy.

760
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:44,080
Young master,

761
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:46,080
the missing child was scared by us.

762
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:48,080
She didn't dare to go out.

763
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:50,080
She went to the patrol to have fun.

764
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:54,080
As long as she doesn't move,

765
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:56,080
the person behind the scene won't be able to get the military.

766
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:58,080
The news about the patrol has been spread.

767
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:00,080
I don't believe the person behind the scene

768
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:02,080
can still do it.

769
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:08,080
The patrol won't be too safe.

770
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:10,080
There are many people in the secret.

771
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:12,080
We must use the smallest casualties

772
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:14,080
to catch them.

773
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:16,080
Yes.

774
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:18,080
Then the medicine...

775
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:22,080
You can keep it.

776
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:32,080
Son,

777
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:34,080
you have to eat more on the way.

778
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:36,080
Don't be tired of yourself.

779
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:38,080
You

780
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:40,080
have to take care of my three wolves carefully.

781
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:44,080
Yes, sir.

782
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:46,080
Niao Niao,

783
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:48,080
eat more on the way.

784
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:50,080
Don't be tired of yourself.

785
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:52,080
You

786
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:54,080
have to take care of my Niao Niao.

787
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:56,080
Don't worry, big brother.

788
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:58,080
What are you laughing at?

789
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:00,080
Niao Niao, don't worry.

790
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:02,080
I've already caught the hang of it.

791
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,080
I'm sure there's a risk of being caught.

792
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:06,080
Don't worry about anything.

793
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:08,080
The road is dangerous.

794
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:10,080
I'm willing to

795
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:12,080
see the world outside.

796
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:14,080
Brother,

797
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:16,080
don't worry.

798
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:18,080
If the world outside is really good,

799
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:20,080
Niao Niao will come to see you.

800
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:22,080
We'll be together

801
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:24,080
and never do anything dangerous.

802
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:26,080
It's not good.

803
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:28,080
We'll wait for that day.

804
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:30,080
Niao Niao,

805
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:32,080
don't worry.

806
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:34,080
Don't be a mother to me.

807
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:36,080
I...

808
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:38,080
Don't worry.

809
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:40,080
I'll take care of

810
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:42,080
my three uncles and three mothers.

811
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:44,080
I'll take care of them.

812
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:46,080
Tongzi, take care of your mother.

813
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:50,080
Okay.

814
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:52,080
Get in the car.

815
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:54,080
Get in the car.

816
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:58,080
Take care.

817
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:00,080
Take care.

818
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:02,080
Take care.

819
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:04,080
Tongzi,

820
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:06,080
my three mothers are here.

821
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:08,080
My three mothers are here.

822
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:26,080
Tongzi.

823
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,080
Tongzi.

824
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:30,080
Tongzi.

825
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:32,080
Tongzi.

826
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:34,080
Tongzi.

827
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:58,080
Why you don't get to see Tongzi?

828
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:00,080
I can't get there.

829
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:02,080
I don't want to see Tongzi.

830
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:04,080
I can never get there.

831
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:08,080
I'm afraid you'll be hurt.

832
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:10,080
I know you'll be hurt.

833
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:12,080
I'll take care.

834
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:14,080
I'll take care.

835
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:16,080
I'll take care.

836
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:18,080
I'll take care.

837
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:20,080
I'll take care.

838
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:22,080
I'll take care.

839
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:24,080
I'll take care.

840
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:26,080
Who said I came to visit him?

841
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:29,080
I just want to go to the house of the Cheng family

842
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:32,080
and find some old things and meet Luoguo.

843
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:35,080
Yes, Li Jun is still not here.

844
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:38,080
He will give all the money he has earned

845
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:40,080
to the wife and son-in-law

846
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:42,080
with his own money.

847
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:44,080
He will protect you again.

848
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:47,080
No, wait for a man.

849
00:45:54,080 --> 00:46:10,080
Toji

850
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:20,080
This girl doesn't seem to beées

851
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:22,080
highly scrupulous.

852
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:50,840
