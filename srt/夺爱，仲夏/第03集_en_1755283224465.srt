1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The next day

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Tai-chan

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
What's wrong? You look so surprised

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
No, it's just that suddenly

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
There was a woman's picture

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
What? It's not that surprising

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Maybe

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
That woman was so beautiful that she was surprised

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
She's beautiful, isn't she?

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
She's a model that Teru introduced to her acquaintance

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Her name is Manatsu

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Oh, I see

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Teru said that she was in love with this person

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I don't understand

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Don't underestimate the painter

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I understand

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
That you're drawing

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Anything

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I understand

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Beautiful

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Very beautiful

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:46,000
But when I saw this picture, I was surprised

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Why?

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Why?

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I don't understand

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Hey, Tai-chan

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
What do you think of this lip color?

28
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I think it's impressive

29
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It's like a liar's picture

30
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I wonder

31
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Don't you feel like a liar's lips?

32
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
The lips that are different from what you think

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I wonder

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
For me

35
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Tai-chan's lips are not lying, are they?

36
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Of course

37
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Right

38
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Take care today

39
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
See you

40
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
That day

41
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
The miracle of returning to before kissing happened

42
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I was able to do it again

43
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Now

44
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
There is a person who I definitely think I like

45
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Oh, no

46
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
It's no good

47
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
The miracle of returning to before kissing

48
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Sugabu-chan

49
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I heard from my sister yesterday that I was a little curious

50
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
What happened?

51
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It looks fun

52
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
My sister came to deliver lunch last night

53
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I passed by the library and heard a strange sound

54
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I heard a strange sound

55
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
There is a camera in the hospital, right?

56
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Can I check it?

57
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It looks happy

58
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
There is no one

59
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Please send more

60
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Hurry up and stop

61
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
The door opened

62
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
President

63
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Numino-chan

64
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I wonder why

65
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I wonder why

66
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It's good to be friends

67
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Oh, the electricity is gone

68
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
It goes out quickly

69
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
What are you doing? Hurry up and fix it

70
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Stop

71
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Why?

72
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It was a good place

73
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
From here on, it's personal information

74
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Don't be a joke

75
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Face close

76
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It's common

77
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Is that so?

78
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
To two people who love

79
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I wonder

80
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Good morning

81
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Good morning Manatsu-san

82
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Good morning

83
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Manatsu-san was shooting the Saki-Kawagi scoop when he was in the justice scoop

84
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Yeah

85
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I was looking at that because that person was stuck in his nose

86
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I thought I'd look at the Zama

87
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
That's right

88
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
What are you doing now?

89
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I don't know

90
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Good morning

91
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Good morning

92
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Good morning

93
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
If you weren't there

94
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I would have been dead

95
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I fixed what was said

96
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Thank you

97
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Read it later

98
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Please

99
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Please

100
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Don't you feel like a liar?

101
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Good morning, Umiro-san

102
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Good morning

103
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
By the way

104
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You were a model for a painting, weren't you?

105
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Yes

106
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Why do you know?

107
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Actually

108
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:46,000
The man who drew that picture, Teru, is my wife

109
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Is that so?

110
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Yeah

111
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I'm sorry I didn't know

112
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
No, it's nothing to apologize for

113
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It's nothing to apologize for

114
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Did you talk to your wife?

115
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I think I saw this picture too

116
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I'm sure someone has it

117
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
No

118
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I was very proud of you

119
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I see

120
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
But

121
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
That picture, Umiro-san

122
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
It was very nice

123
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Thank you

124
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
What was nice?

125
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
What?

126
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
What?

127
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Another secret between you two?

128
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
What do you mean?

129
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
No

130
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Please take this

131
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I see

132
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Anatsu-san, the head of the department is calling

133
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
You went to the office last night

134
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
With the president

135
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I have some documents to look for

136
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
The president helped me

137
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I'm going to ask you clearly

138
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Did the president invite you?

139
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
No

140
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I didn't invite you

141
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Two people in the bedroom

142
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
After the lights went out

143
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
At such a close distance

144
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Why?

145
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
There's a surveillance camera

146
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
The guard showed it to me

147
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
With Hanabi-chan

148
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
That's bad

149
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
No

150
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I didn't do anything

151
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
This kind of rumor is spreading

152
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I won't tell you

153
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
That moment was taken by the surveillance camera

154
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
If this rumor spreads

155
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I want to go back to yesterday

156
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
How can I go back again?

157
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I can start over again in my life

158
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Please

159
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Go back

160
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Go back

161
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Please

162
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
What was the secretary doing?

163
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
It's okay

164
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
That's a compliance problem

165
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
No

166
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I'm not back

167
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
What should I do?

168
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I just colored my lips

169
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I'm sorry

170
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
No

171
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Thank you

172
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
It's very impressive

173
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
But

174
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
What's wrong?

175
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
The way you color your lips is different from your usual future

176
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Really?

177
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I feel like I'm angry

178
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
You'll find out everything

179
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Did something happen?

180
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
It's very beautiful

181
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
But it's too beautiful

182
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I'm angry

183
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
My lips

184
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
They seem to be lying

185
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
She's a cheating woman

186
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
My father used to sing in karaoke

187
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Bye bye, thank you, goodbye

188
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
My dear lover

189
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Mirai

190
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Are you okay?

191
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Yes

192
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Can I give this painting to the person who asked?

193
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Of course

194
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
This is the color you put on your lips

195
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
How is it?

196
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
It's beautiful

197
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
When you look at it like this

198
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Your eyes get scared

199
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Why?

200
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Your lips are lying

201
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
You're a cheating woman

202
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
That's not true

203
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
You're not like that

204
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I'm sorry

205
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Sorry

206
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
But

207
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Thank you for drawing

208
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I can be with my senior

209
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Genya

210
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Good job

211
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Good job too

212
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Cheers

213
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Delicious

214
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I'm tired

215
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I miss you

216
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I'm tired

217
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Did you say that?

218
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
When I come back from the interview

219
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I always sit at the desk and say I'm tired

220
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
That's right

221
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I'm sorry

222
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I'm a bad person

223
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
You're good

224
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
You're a baseball player

225
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I'm a catcher

226
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
What's that?

227
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I'll do it

228
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Delicious

229
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Let's eat

230
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Cucumber

231
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I didn't tell you

232
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
What?

233
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
When you said that

234
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I was happy

235
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Why?

236
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
It's okay

237
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Here?

238
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
It's very hard

239
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
What's wrong?

240
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I can understand you

241
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Really?

242
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Yes

243
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
You're in love

244
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
You said that

245
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Did you find out?

246
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I was excited while watching you

247
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
That's not true

248
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
It's true

249
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Because

250
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I like you

251
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
You said that again

252
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I'm still excited

253
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I feel the same

254
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I'm done eating

255
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Let's drink

256
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Cheers

257
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Delicious

258
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I'll eat the egg

259
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I'm full

260
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
This is the shortcut

261
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Good

262
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
How is the company?

263
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
It's still hard

264
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Scoop

265
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Scoop

266
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Really?

267
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
The manager of Aikawa Raza

268
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
He was talking

269
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I didn't buy it

270
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I miss it

271
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Hey

272
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I knew it

273
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
It's been a long time

274
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
The sea

275
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
No

276
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
The damn sea

277
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
He was the secretary of Sakikawa Ginn

278
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
He looks energetic

279
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Are you dating?

280
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Sakikawa quit Ginn

281
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
And lost his job

282
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Now

283
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
He's a friend

284
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Thank you

285
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Thank you for destroying my life

286
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Thank you

287
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Thank you

288
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Thank you

289
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Thank you

290
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Come to my store

291
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I'll make a beer

292
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
You have money

293
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Don't come close

294
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
You came close to people's lives

295
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I took a picture and made an article

296
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Please don't come close

297
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
How did you feel about destroying your life with one picture?

298
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Tell me

299
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
That's us

300
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
That's my job

301
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Then

302
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
If that's your job

303
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
If you say that's justice

304
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Because of your justice

305
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I can't face my parents

306
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I'm sorry

307
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Don't apologize

308
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Manatsu Senpai shouldn't apologize

309
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I'm sorry

310
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Manatsu Senpai

311
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I quit my job

312
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I wrote that article

313
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
It's my company

314
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
So

315
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I'm sorry

316
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I'll pay you

317
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
No matter how much

318
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
So

319
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Please forgive me

320
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Please

321
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Please

322
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Please

323
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Damn it

324
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Manatsu Senpai

325
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Are you okay?

326
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I'm sorry

327
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
It's not your fault

328
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
It's painful enough

329
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
No

330
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I

331
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I want you to live a happy life

332
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
So

333
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Please let me suffer

334
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I'm sorry

335
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
It's okay

336
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Are you having sex recently?

337
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
No

338
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I heard that

339
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
It's more delicate

340
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Recently

341
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
You look different

342
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I think

343
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
You look different

344
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I think

345
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
You look sexy

346
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Really?

347
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I think

348
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
It's because you're hot

349
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
What about the fireworks?

350
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
What do you think?

351
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I

352
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I'm a man

353
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I like it

354
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I'm cheating

355
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
So

356
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I got information

357
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Information?

358
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I tried to understand

359
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
His place

360
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
His place?

361
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I can't do that

362
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I can't do that

363
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
But

364
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Is it okay?

365
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
No

366
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I have to do that

367
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I'm home

368
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I'm here

369
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
It's late

370
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I'm going home

371
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I'll send you the way

372
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I'll send you the way

373
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Bye

374
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Be careful

375
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
What?

376
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Be careful

377
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Be careful

378
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Okay

379
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Taichi

380
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Taichi

381
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Yes?

382
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Today

383
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Will you do it?

384
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Today

385
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Is it the timing?

386
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
No

387
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
It's different

388
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I see

389
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I'm a little tired today

390
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I'll do it again

391
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Sorry

392
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Maybe

393
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
9641?

394
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
What?

395
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Is it painful?

396
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
I'm not saying stupid

397
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I'm not saying stupid

398
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
It's not like that

399
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Right

400
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I

401
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
How many people

402
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
I've made crazy

403
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I've made crazy

404
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
But

405
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Even in this time

406
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
I think of my boss

407
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I am

408
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I am the worst

409
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Manatsu, shake it more

410
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
More!

411
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Mom, I'm scared!

412
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
The first thing to be scared is the fun.

413
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
The fun is only on the other side of the fear.

414
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Come on, bend over.

415
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Bend over.

416
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Come on, more!

417
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I'm scared!

418
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
With that level of fear, you can't do anything.

419
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Jump over the fear.

420
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Come on, Mom's here.

421
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
If you want to jump, you have to jump.

422
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
It's impossible.

423
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Then stay there for the rest of your life.

424
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Wait for someone to push you.

425
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
But no one will come.

426
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
You have to jump yourself.

427
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Natsu!

428
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Come on, Manatsu.

429
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
You have to jump now.

430
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Your time will stop.

431
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Come on, Manatsu.

432
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Believe in me.

433
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Jump!

434
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Don't say anything selfish.

435
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
The End

436
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
I'd like to suggest something I'd like to do as a company.

437
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
What is it?

438
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,000
It was closed last year, but it's a school in Chiba Prefecture called Hazuki Higashi Elementary School.

439
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Do you remember, Tsugawa-san?

440
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
I don't remember.

441
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,000
My father donated a large watch to the school during his time.

442
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:34,000
The previous president was great.

443
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
It seems that the watch has stopped.

444
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,000
I want to repair it and return it to its original state.

445
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
But it's closed now, right?

446
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,000
That's right, but the local people use the ground there as a park.

447
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,000
It's an old watch and there may be no parts.

448
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
What about the cost?

449
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I'll keep it at home.

450
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
For what?

451
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,000
I don't want my watch to stop being watched by many people.

452
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Even if you say a lot, you fixed it in a place where acceleration is progressing.

453
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
The cost-resistant effect is bad.

454
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
You can't talk about the company's value just by looking at the profit, right?

455
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
That's right, but...

456
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
It seems that someone's time has stopped.

457
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
I want to fix it somehow.

458
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
That's why I'm asking you.

459
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Why do you have to pay for it?

460
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Can you do it a little different?

461
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Excuse me.

462
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
I agree.

463
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
The watch is...

464
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:54,000
It's something that makes me remember the important memories.

465
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
You again!

466
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
If you decide with the opinion of only two people,

467
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,000
you can talk to each other in the office.

468
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,000
What is the office?

469
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Hey, Mr. Suga, the atmosphere...

470
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,000
The company will be destroyed by romance.

471
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Suga is the opposite.

472
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
I'm sorry.

473
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
That's right.

474
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
I have to do it.

475
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Dad.

476
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
From where...

477
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,000
I'm late today.

478
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,160
I was going to do a shabu-shabu of the

479
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,000
foundation this evening.

480
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
I bought it.

481
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
I understand.

482
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I'll eat it when I get home.

483
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I'm waiting.

484
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Why did you write it?

485
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
I feel like someone's time has stopped.

486
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
I want to fix it somehow.

487
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
I'm sorry.

488
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
It's embarrassing.

489
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
You went too far.

490
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Tai-chan.

491
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
It's still the same as before.

492
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
But it's still the same.

493
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
This is it.

494
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Boss?

495
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Alright.

496
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
I see.

497
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
I'm sure you'll fix it.

498
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Fumino?

499
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Boss.

500
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
You were angry, weren't you?

501
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I can't give up.

502
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
I'm sorry.

503
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
I'm sorry.

504
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I can't give up.

505
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
That watch.

506
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
What about you?

507
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
I...

508
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
I wanted to check my own eyes

509
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
when the boss was talking so hot.

510
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Thank you.

511
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
I just wanted to see myself.

512
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
How was it?

513
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
I'll fix it.

514
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
I'll fix it.

515
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
I have parts.

516
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
I'll return it to that time.

517
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
It's dirty.

518
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Where?

519
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Here.

520
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Thank you.

521
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Around here.

522
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
I'm sorry.

523
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
I was too into it.

524
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
When it comes to watches,

525
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
you're like a boy.

526
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
I was a boy.

527
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
When my dad set up this watch,

528
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
I was in the 3rd grade.

529
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
I was bullied.

530
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
I couldn't buy it.

531
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
I see.

532
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
My dad noticed that

533
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
and told me not to push myself.

534
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
He let me rest.

535
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
One day, he told me

536
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
to get a new watch.

537
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
I was always with Koji

538
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
when he set up the watch.

539
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
I was always helping him.

540
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
There was nothing

541
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
I could do.

542
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000
But that watch...

543
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
It was the first watch I ever used.

544
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
It was an important watch

545
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
for you.

546
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Yes.

547
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
When the watch was completed,

548
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
all the cars gathered here.

549
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Everyone was happy when I showed it to them.

550
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
I'm so happy.

551
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
My dad told me

552
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
to stop.

553
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
It's important

554
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
to know that you have the power

555
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
to move again.

556
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
And then,

557
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
I started moving again.

558
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
I hope

559
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
this watch moves again.

560
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
I miss it.

561
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Back then,

562
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
I used to wear this

563
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
when I was working.

564
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
I'm not good at playing the piano.

565
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I'm not good at anything

566
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
because I'm scared.

567
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
You can try to overcome

568
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
your weakness.

569
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Time will pass.

570
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Sit down.

571
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Here we go.

572
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
How is it?

573
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
It's shaking.

574
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,000
I'm scared.

575
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
It's okay.

576
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Look at me.

577
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
You can feel the wind.

578
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
How is it?

579
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
I can feel the wind.

580
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Shake more.

581
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Let's jump.

582
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
No, I can't.

583
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000
It's okay.

584
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
I'm here.

585
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
I'm here.

586
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Here we go.

587
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
1, 2, 3.

588
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Go!

589
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Amazing.

590
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
We made it.

591
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Thanks to you,

592
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
the memories

593
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
are gone.

594
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
I see.

595
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
I'm glad.

596
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,000
I want it.

597
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
I want it.

598
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,000
I want it.

599
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Hello?

600
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
What's wrong?

601
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
I borrowed a video from the control room.

602
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
I'm sorry.

603
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,000
I'll send it to you.

604
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Don't watch it.

605
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Okay.

606
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,000
I'll send it to you.

607
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,000
I'll send it to you.

608
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
I'll send it to you.

609
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
I'll send it to you.

610
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
I'll send it to you.

611
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
I'll send it to you.

612
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,000
I'll send it to you.

613
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,000
I'll send it to you.

614
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
I'll send it to you.

615
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
I'll send it to you.

616
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
I'll send it to you.

617
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
I'll send it to you.

618
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Here we go.

619
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Hahaha!

620
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
I'm worried about her.

621
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,000
I'll go and welcome her with a surprise.

622
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Ueno-san, are you okay?

623
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Yes.

624
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
It's really windy.

625
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
But I want to see the mountains in a little while.

626
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Really?

627
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
That's it.

628
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
It's a midsummer rain.

629
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Are you okay?

630
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
I'll go with you.

631
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Ueno-san, I'm sorry.

632
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
You can't do it, can you?

633
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
You have to believe in yourself.

634
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
I hate myself the most.

635
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
I'll stop going.

636
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
I believe in myself.

637
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
I'm sorry.

638
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
It stopped raining.

639
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
I'm glad.

640
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Ueno-san, thank you for today.

641
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
I was happy.

642
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
I felt the same way.

643
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
I'm glad you're okay.

644
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
I'm glad you're okay.

645
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
I'm glad you're okay.

646
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
I'm glad you're okay.

647
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
I'm glad you're okay.

648
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
I'm glad you're okay.

649
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
I'm glad you're okay.

650
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
I'm glad you're okay.

651
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:13,000
I'm glad you're okay.

652
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
It's a little rainy.

653
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
I agree.

654
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Ueno-san,

655
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
think about it.

656
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Over here.

657
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Boss?

658
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
What are you doing?

659
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
It went in.

660
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
It feels good.

661
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:05,000
I used to swim in a pool where no one was there.

662
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
I feel bad,

663
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:16,000
but I feel like I've made the pool where everyone is.

664
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
It feels good.

665
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Go home.

666
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
I don't care.

667
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Come on!

668
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Yuuki!

669
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Right?

670
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Right?

671
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:05,000
It's been a while since I laughed like this.

672
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
I laughed, but I kept laughing.

673
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
I can laugh like this.

674
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
I want to cry.

675
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
I want to cry even though I can laugh.

676
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
It's strange.

677
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Me too.

678
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
When I talk to you,

679
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:45,000
I feel like the time I spent there is moving.

680
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,000
I can laugh now.

681
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,000
What are you doing?

682
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,000
I want you to laugh like that.

683
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,000
If you say that, I'll laugh.

684
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Ueno-san,

685
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
let's go to the middle and swim.

686
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
You're fast.

687
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
I'll give you a hand.

688
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Why?

689
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
I'll do it.

690
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Ready?

691
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Yes.

692
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Ready, go!

693
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
I'm sorry.

694
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Are you okay?

695
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Are you okay?

696
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
I'm hurt too.

697
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
I'm sorry.

698
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
I was too serious.

699
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
I like that.

700
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
I'm sorry.

701
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
I'm sorry.

702
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
I'm sorry.

703
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
I like you too.

704
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
I can't stop laughing.

705
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
I'm sorry.

706
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:28,000
I've been watching you all this time.

707
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
I'm sorry.

708
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
I'll do anything.

709
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Give me a kiss.

710
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
I'll give you a kiss.

711
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
I'll give you a kiss.

712
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
It's time to leave.

713
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
My time has stopped.

714
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
I'll do it again.

715
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
I'll do it again next time.

716
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
If you can see the tears of Jiumi, it's okay.

717
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Love is a dirty thing.

718
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
It's dirty.

719
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
What are you doing?

720
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
What's good about a woman like this?

721
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,000
I've ruined someone else's life by driving someone else's time.
