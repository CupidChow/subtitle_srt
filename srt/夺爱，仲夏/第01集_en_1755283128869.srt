Episode 1

00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Manatsu...

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I will live my life from now on.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Please let me be free.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
What do you mean?

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I have someone I love with all my heart.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I will live with him.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
What about me?

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
You have a house and money.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Go and be free.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Free?

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm not free.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Free?

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Freedom...

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
You can start over.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You can start over.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Mom!

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
When I was in high school,

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
my mother chose a life where I could live freely.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Ten years later,

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
in a box sent from overseas,

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
there was a message that my mother had passed away.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
And a clock with my mother's name on it.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
The clock stopped working.

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The clock stopped working.

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I lived and died freely.

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I loved my mother.

28
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,000
But I couldn't hate her.

29
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I love you.

30
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Time only goes by with you.

31
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Congratulations on your new start.

32
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Genya, what's wrong?

33
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I came to cheer for you.

34
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'm not going to school.

35
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You're the one who's worried.

36
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
That's true.

37
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Don't worry.

38
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You're lucky today.

39
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
It's not about fortune telling.

40
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'm lucky.

41
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
When you meet a new man at work,

42
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
you must not fall in love.

43
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I don't need love right now.

44
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
That's my feeling.

45
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
What? It's not fortune telling.

46
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Even if I change jobs,

47
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I like you.

48
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Thank you.

49
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
It's about time you return to your love.

50
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
If you want to return and fall in love, don't fall in love.

51
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Okay.

52
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Let's go.

53
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm Manatsu from the sea.

54
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm Hanabi from PR.

55
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I'll go first.

56
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I'm the sister of the president's wife.

57
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
In other words, I'm a super-young girl.

58
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You're a good girl.

59
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
You're so clear.

60
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I'm Matsuri Otomo.

61
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
It's our second year together.

62
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Thank you.

63
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
You came from the Justice Scoop, right?

64
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Were you a reporter?

65
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Something like that.

66
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Good morning.

67
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Umino.

68
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I'm listening to you.

69
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I'm Suga.

70
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Umino, please dig out this scoop and sell it.

71
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Of course. Thank you.

72
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Thank you.

73
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I'm sorry, Manatsu.

74
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
In this era, we use power and power.

75
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
We use the term, Sugahara.

76
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Sugahara was loved by the president of Sendai.

77
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It's a past tense.

78
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And the president's son, the second president,

79
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I don't think he has a good heart.

80
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
The president is coming.

81
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Good morning.

82
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Good morning.

83
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
From today...

84
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm sorry.

85
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Manatsu Umino.

86
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Nice to meet you.

87
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Why?

88
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Well...

89
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Look.

90
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'm confident in making watches.

91
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
But I'm not good at it.

92
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'm looking forward to it.

93
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
This is the watch from our company.

94
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Yes.

95
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I bought it the other day.

96
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Why did you buy that watch?

97
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Well...

98
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I just...

99
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Just because.

100
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
That watch was calling you.

101
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
What?

102
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I'm sorry, but I don't think you're right.

103
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
People don't choose watches.

104
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
The watch chooses people.

105
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I'm not...

106
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Not good enough for you?

107
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I bought it because I could work with you.

108
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
It was expensive.

109
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
But you have to say that?

110
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
That's...

111
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Watch harassment.

112
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It's a watch.

113
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
The Watch

114
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I said something I don't understand.

115
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
People don't choose watches.

116
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
The watch chooses people.

117
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
You're like Hayato.

118
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Manatsu, what's wrong?

119
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
My heart hurts.

120
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I'm doing this while I'm filming a film.

121
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I'm sorry.

122
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I'm sorry for making you suffer.

123
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I...

124
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I got sick.

125
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Stage 4.

126
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Half a year left.

127
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I think...

128
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I'm a godfather.

129
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I loved you like I was married.

130
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I abandoned my family.

131
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
So...

132
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I know what's most important.

133
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Hayato...

134
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I want to be with you.

135
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
You have to be happy.

136
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Goodbye.

137
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Furin makes people unhappy.

138
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
She will be punished.

139
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I'm home.

140
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Welcome home.

141
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
It looks delicious.

142
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Thank you.

143
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I think the roast beef is delicious.

144
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Hold this.

145
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Let's take a picture.

146
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Cheese.

147
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Mirai.

148
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
You don't have to post on social media every day.

149
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Why?

150
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
It's to make you feel like a president.

151
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
That's right.

152
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
It's important for the company to have a good family.

153
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
That's right.

154
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
My father started this company.

155
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I have to help.

156
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Sit down.

157
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
When the company went bankrupt,

158
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
her father saved her.

159
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Instead,

160
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I made that choice.

161
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Bon appÃ©tit.

162
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I may have stopped time.

163
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Let's go in together.

164
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
How was the hospital?

165
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
The test results were bad.

166
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I see.

167
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
It's my fault.

168
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I'm sorry.

169
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,000
The doctor said I should take a break.

170
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
How about you, Tai?

171
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
If the doctor said so,

172
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I'll take a break.

173
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
You didn't eat salad.

174
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I looked it up on the Internet.

175
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I put in a salad that said it could make a strong spirit.

176
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I'm going to eat.

177
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I'm going to eat.

178
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Tai,

179
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
if you're with me,

180
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
you'll be in a hurry.

181
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
What do you mean?

182
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
You'll be in a hurry.

183
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
You'll be in a hurry.

184
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
That's not true.

185
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I won't hide anything.

186
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I'm sorry.

187
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Good morning.

188
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Good morning.

189
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Good morning.

190
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Good morning.

191
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Good morning.

192
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It's time to meet.

193
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
It's an important meeting.

194
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I know.

195
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I know it'll be a big topic if we collaborate with the fan address.

196
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Umino, please come with me.

197
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Yes.

198
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I just need to sit down and smile.

199
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I'm very excited to collaborate with the fan address.

200
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I know.

201
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I want to do it with you.

202
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Thank you.

203
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I haven't decided yet.

204
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
You're fast.

205
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I'm sorry.

206
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I have one thing to say.

207
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I'm loyal.

208
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I think I'm 12% of the total.

209
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
But you said you were 8% the other day.

210
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
You saw my calculation report.

211
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
It's going up again.

212
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
My value is going up.

213
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I think I'm 12%.

214
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,000
But I think I'm at my limit.

215
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
You're at your limit.

216
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Tell me.

217
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I know.

218
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I'm 12%.

219
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Right?

220
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Yes.

221
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I've been saying that since the beginning.

222
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I'll do it myself.

223
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I'm sorry.

224
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I'm sorry.

225
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Good work.

226
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Good work.

227
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I think that's a tough situation.

228
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I can get a target with a collaboration with a fan address.

229
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I'm sorry.

230
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
You joined the company at a good time.

231
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Yes.

232
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I'm sorry.

233
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
You said something.

234
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Umino.

235
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Did you really want to do this?

236
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Yes.

237
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I joined this company because I admired it.

238
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,000
But the president of that company was different from what I imagined.

239
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
He couldn't even say his own opinion at the meeting.

240
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Yesterday, he said that the clock would choose people.

241
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I didn't feel that faith at all.

242
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I feel sorry for the clock.

243
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I'm sorry.

244
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I'm sorry.

245
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I feel sorry for the clock.

246
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I did it again.

247
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I'm getting a good feeling.

248
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I'm moving.

249
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Time is ticking.

250
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I'm sorry.

251
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
The door is closing.

252
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
The door is closing.

253
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
It's the first time.

254
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Good morning.

255
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Good morning.

256
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Umino.

257
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
The president is calling you.

258
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Yes.

259
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Excuse me.

260
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I'm sorry.

261
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Umino.

262
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I quit the collaboration.

263
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I decided.

264
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I woke up because of you.

265
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Thank you.

266
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
What?

267
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
What?

268
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Excuse me.

269
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
This is my company.

270
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I don't have a craftsman who can make this.

271
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
How did you get this?

272
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
It's my mother's work.

273
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I wanted to wear this clock that was locked in the drawer when I came home yesterday.

274
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
You're right.

275
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
You're right.

276
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I felt like I was chosen by the clock that the president was talking about.

277
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I'm sure.

278
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Why did you quit the collaboration with Fan Art Russia?

279
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
It's what Suga decided.

280
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
What's wrong with him?

281
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I think I can get along with Banatsu.

282
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I'm sorry.

283
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I'm sorry again.

284
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Is this your fourth time in the art world?

285
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
You should take a break.

286
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
But I'm already 37 years old.

287
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I think my husband is more pressured than my mother.

288
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Mirai.

289
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
You can go home today.

290
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Can I take a look at it a little more?

291
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
But it's a class from afternoon.

292
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
You'll learn more if you look at your drawing.

293
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Thank you.

294
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Mirai.

295
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Did you cry earlier?

296
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
No.

297
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I see.

298
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I'm mistaken.

299
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Yes.

300
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Thank you.

301
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
President.

302
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
What happened?

303
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I forgot the materials I was going to bring home.

304
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
You're late.

305
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I want to get a job soon.

306
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
You're really hard-working.

307
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Is this a new candidate for the collaboration?

308
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Yes.

309
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Thank you.

310
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
You're against the collaboration with Panatruss.

311
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I'm sorry I didn't know.

312
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I was so nervous.

313
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I'm sorry I didn't know.

314
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I'm sorry.

315
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Hey, Umiro.

316
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Why are you so hard-working?

317
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I was saved by Toa.

318
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
What do you mean?

319
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:20,000
My mother always told me to do the right thing.

320
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:27,000
But she chose the wrong thing and left the house.

321
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
What?

322
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
She wanted to correct the mistake.

323
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
But she left the house.

324
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
What?

325
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:42,000
The job of a reporter who corrects mistakes was a revenge for my mother.

326
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:50,000
But as time goes on, people get paralyzed.

327
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I don't know if it's right or wrong.

328
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I'm going to live for the scoop of people's misfortune.

329
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Let's go.

330
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Giri Sakata.

331
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
You're the same student, Yoshida Ginn, right?

332
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Are you a pudding?

333
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Can I bring my husband into the mansion?

334
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Please answer.

335
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
You're Ginn, right?

336
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Saki Kawa.

337
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
It's a boring life.

338
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
It's not fun.

339
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I...

340
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
I ate Ginn in your article.

341
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
I was the daughter of my family.

342
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I didn't know you were there.

343
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
What are you doing?

344
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Let go of me.

345
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
What are you doing?

346
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
You're a new girl.

347
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Go to hell.

348
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:33,000
I thought I would be a scoop in that situation.

349
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I'm broken as a person.

350
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,000
I realized that and got scared.

351
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
At the same time, I was in a private life.

352
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,000
I thought I was going to die.

353
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
But at that time,

354
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:08,000
there was an advertisement for Tawani in the back of an old magazine.

355
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Time only moves forward with you.

356
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,000
I was saved by this word.

357
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,000
So I want to work at this company.

358
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,000
I'm glad you think so.

359
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,000
I said something rude from the first day.

360
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
You really like watches.

361
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
I realized that.

362
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
The clock was always close to me.

363
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
I'm sorry.

364
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:10,000
I will do my best to be a power to Tawani.

365
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I'm looking forward to it.

366
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Tomorrow night,

367
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
you're going to the art studio, right?

368
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Can I go with you to study?

369
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
I'm sorry.

370
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
It's a new work.

371
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,000
I brought it from the studio because I wanted you to see it.

372
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,000
The future of the art is bright and forward.

373
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
It gives people power.

374
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
It will be a good thing.

375
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Do you really think so?

376
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
If you like, tell me 100 things about this painting.

377
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
100?

378
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
You're lying.

379
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Tai-chan.

380
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Today is the timing of the day.

381
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
I see.

382
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
I understand.

383
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
I'll try not to be late.

384
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Don't blame yourself for being a man.

385
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
You don't have a teacher.

386
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
You're a great artist.

387
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
What's going to happen?

388
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
You can't lose that skill.

389
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
I'm trying to do something.

390
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
You're a real tourist.

391
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,000
You're honest.

392
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
I'm grateful for that person.

393
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:10,000
The feeling when I was embraced was the same as that person.

394
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
I'm okay.

395
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:19,000
I feel like my heart beat faster with the second hand.

396
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Here.

397
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Fire?

398
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Let's get out of here.

399
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Let's go to the first-aid station.

400
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
No, boss. It's dangerous.

401
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
It's okay.

402
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
First-aid station.

403
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Boss!

404
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Oro-san!

405
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Oro-san!

406
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Oro-san, are you there?

407
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Oro-san!

408
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Oro-san!

409
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Oro-san, are you there?

410
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Please.

411
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Oro-san!

412
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Boss!

413
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
What's wrong?

414
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
What are you doing? Hurry up and get out!

415
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
I'll help you.

416
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Oro-san, hang in there!

417
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Yes!

418
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
We're almost there.

419
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Yes!

420
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Oro-san!

421
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
We've finished the treatment.

422
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
But...

423
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,000
I think there's a burn mark on your arm.

424
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Damn it!

425
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Oro-san, are you there?

426
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Tai-chan...

427
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Tai-chan...

428
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:25,000
I'm sorry to have hurt someone who's more important than me.

429
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,000
I'll do my best.

430
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,000
I jumped into the water myself.

431
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
It's not your fault.

432
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,000
With my life from now on,

433
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,000
this wound will be the right one.

434
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
So, from now on,

435
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
can I work for you forever?

436
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Thank you.

437
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Thank you.

438
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Are you the president of Tohari?

439
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
And you are?

440
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,000
I'm Manatsu-senpai's former subordinate.

441
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:44,000
I won't forgive you for making that person suffer.

442
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:52,000
I really like you.

443
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:59,000
You know the rabbit that appears in Alice in Wonderland, right?

444
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:05,000
The rabbit invites Alice to Wonderland.

445
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:17,000
You're the devil's rabbit that invites Manatsu-senpai to the land of misfortune, aren't you?

446
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
The Devil's Rabbit

447
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Here's your paper.

448
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Thank you.

449
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
It's been five days since the fire.

450
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
The staff is upset.

451
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
We can't collaborate.

452
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
He's the president's...

453
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Everyone!

454
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Ms. Eihara, the captain is back.

455
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
I'm so glad.

456
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
I have to go to your house.

457
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Can I come with you?

458
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Of course.

459
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
How about Sunday?

460
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Yes.

461
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
The captain is here.

462
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
What's going on?

463
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:30,000
I finally got the French that you wanted.

464
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Really?

465
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,000
I waited a year and finally got it.

466
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Sunday.

467
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
I see.

468
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,000
It's about Ms. Eihara.

469
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
I see.

470
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Are you alone?

471
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,000
No, I'm with my staff.

472
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Sorry.

473
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
It's work.

474
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
It's okay.

475
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
The Devil's Rabbit

476
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Excuse me.

477
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Excuse me.

478
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Yes.

479
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Buy some souvenirs before you go to Ms. Eihara's house.

480
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Okay.

481
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Ms. Eihara, I think you like the mitarashi dango.

482
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
I'll buy it.

483
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Excuse me.

484
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
I'm sorry I'm late.

485
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
This is the mitarashi dango you like.

486
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Thank you.

487
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Let's go.

488
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Hello.

489
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I want this.

490
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:17,000
This is my favorite.

491
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Thank you.

492
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,000
I'm glad you're okay.

493
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,000
I'm sorry I burnt the kiln.

494
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,000
But I'm alive because of you.

495
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Come on.

496
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Thank you so much for saving my husband's life.

497
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Please eat.

498
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Excuse me.

499
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
I'm glad you came to this restaurant.

500
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Thank you.

501
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:58,000
I heard you're with your staff today.

502
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Yes.

503
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Two new girls from PR.

504
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
I see.

505
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,000
They seem to be eating and drinking.

506
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
I like this one better.

507
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
I'm sorry.

508
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
It looks delicious.

509
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Please come and help.

510
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,000
You're in a good company.

511
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,000
You're a good boss.

512
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:56,000
I can get hot for the watch.

513
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,000
I'm getting angry at you.

514
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
You have a good heart.

515
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
And you're kind.

516
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
This is a very fragrant.

517
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
He's a good guy.

518
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:20,000
He worked in Switzerland for a watchmaker.

519
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:38,000
But he came back to Japan to be the president.

520
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:48,000
His watch stopped working.

521
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:59,000
When I was advertising for Torani,

522
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:08,000
he said a lot of things he thought about.

523
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,000
What kind of words?

524
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Sometimes he said he only wanted to be with you.

525
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Did he think about that?

526
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:39,000
He's always been living alone.

527
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:45,000
I lost my workshop because of the fire.

528
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:49,000
I thought I'd quit.

529
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:56,000
I remembered that word.

530
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:04,000
He's a wonderful man.

531
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,000
I'm glad you're fine.

532
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Why didn't you tell me?

533
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,000
You thought about the advertisement.

534
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:33,000
I can only be with you.

535
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:41,000
You didn't tell me you thought about it.

536
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,000
It's embarrassing.

537
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Thank you for thinking about the words that saved my life.

538
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
I'll quit.

539
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:12,000
I thought I'd walk again.

540
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Thank you.

541
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,000
I'm still nothing.

542
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,000
When I'm with you,

543
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:38,000
I feel like I can take back the heart of the watchmaker.

544
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:47,000
I might be able to move forward with my time.

545
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:03,000
I was saved by Torani.

546
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,000
I'm sorry.

547
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,000
It's okay.

548
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Don't touch me.

549
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
I'm sorry.

550
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
I was tricked by the magic of the night.

551
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Please forget about it.

552
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Good night.

553
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:16,000
I said I liked you at four o'clock.

554
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:22,000
I took you into my dreams.

555
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:28,000
I can't forget the fight.

556
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,000
I'm sorry.

557
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,000
I'm sorry.

558
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
I'm sorry.

559
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:43,000
I can't forget the fight.

560
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:49,000
I can't forget the fight.

561
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,000
This is the picture I want to draw.

562
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
I can't forget it.

563
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:09,000
I was absolutely useless yesterday.

564
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Why?

565
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Because I looked like Hayato?

566
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Because the president saved me?

567
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,000
It's definitely not good for you.

568
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
I'm sorry.

569
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,000
I'm sorry.

570
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,000
I'm sorry.

571
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Who?

572
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,000
I'm sorry.

573
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:31,000
I can do it again and again.

574
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,000
I'm sorry.

575
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,000
It's open.

576
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,000
I'm sorry.

577
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,000
I'm sorry.

578
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Please buy souvenirs before you go to Ehara's place today.

579
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
I think you like mitarashi dango.

580
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Ehara?

581
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
I went there yesterday.

582
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
What?

583
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
It's coming soon, right?

584
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Thank you.

585
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Hello.

586
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Please buy a balloon.

587
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Thank you.

588
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Bye.

589
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Look at the balloons.

590
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
That's great.

591
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Ehara, you're back as the captain.

592
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
You have to get ready.

593
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
What about Sunday?

594
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
I'm back.

595
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,000
I can't believe it.

596
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:34,000
I went back on Sunday by time leap.

597
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,000
The balloon is coming.

598
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Balloons.

599
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,000
I won't let you kiss me.

600
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
I won't let you go.

601
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
That moment will come.

602
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Love is falling.

603
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
I can't forget the scene from that moment.

604
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:55,000
I felt like my heart was moving faster.

605
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:59,000
I want to keep it in my memory.

606
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
I think I love you.

607
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
The season of love is a shining name.

608
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
I don't think so.

609
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
If the captain wasn't there, I wouldn't be here.
