00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
The End

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,500
Before you go to Eihara's place today, please buy some souvenirs.

3
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,500
It looks like you love the mitarashi dango.

4
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,500
Eihara-san?

5
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,500
Um, I went yesterday.

6
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,500
What? What are you talking about?

7
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,500
It's about to start, right?

8
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,000
Well, I'll be counting on you.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,500
I have to go to the store.

10
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:40,500
It's Sunday.

11
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,500
I'm back.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I took a time leap and...

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,500
...I'm back.

14
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,000
But I can't believe it.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I can't believe I'm back yesterday.

16
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,000
If I'm really back...

17
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:21,000
Will I be able to start over again yesterday?

18
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:26,500
The End

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,500
When I came here late, the president...

20
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,500
...said.

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,500
I'm sorry I'm late.

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,500
Here, Eihara-san's favorite mitarashi dango.

23
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,500
Thank you for the trouble.

24
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,500
Yushiko.

25
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,500
She said the same thing.

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,500
If she really is repeating yesterday...

27
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,000
Wait a minute.

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Um...

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Can I go and call her?

30
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,000
Okay.

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
What's wrong?

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,500
I have a break.

33
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,500
Can you go to Eihara-san's place instead?

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,500
I'm sorry.

35
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I can't leave right now.

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,500
I hope she doesn't kiss me.

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Anyway, I have to go to Eihara-san's place.

38
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,500
Hello, Matsuri-san.

39
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,500
It's Umina.

40
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
What's wrong?

41
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,000
I have a break.

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Can you go to Eihara-san's place instead?

43
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Okay.

44
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,000
I don't have any plans.

45
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm fine.

46
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,500
Thank you.

47
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I'm sorry, boss.

48
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
The water pipe in my apartment has burst.

49
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I just got a message that the room is flooded.

50
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
What?

51
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Matsuri-san said he could come and help me.

52
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Can you go to my place instead?

53
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
No problem.

54
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Go to the back.

55
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Thank you.

56
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm fine now.

57
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
If I don't go to Eihara-san's place,

58
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,500
I won't do that again.

59
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,000
Sorry for the sudden visit.

60
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I wanted to say hello to Eihara-san.

61
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Thank you.

62
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Let's go.

63
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Matsuri-san, you're amazing.

64
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,500
I'm not good at dogs.

65
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,000
I'm sorry.

66
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,500
I'm sorry.

67
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,500
I'm sorry.

68
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,500
I'm scared.

69
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,500
I can't stop.

70
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,000
Matsuri, I'm sorry.

71
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,500
I'll stop here today.

72
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,500
I'm sorry.

73
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,500
I'm sorry.

74
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,500
Oh, right.

75
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,500
I have a souvenir.

76
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,500
A souvenir?

77
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,500
What's wrong?

78
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Manatsu-san, a souvenir for Eihara-san.

79
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Oh no.

80
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I can't go home anymore, so I'm going home.

81
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Why?

82
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Here you go.

83
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Thank you.

84
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Eihara-san, congratulations on your retirement.

85
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,500
If you like this...

86
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,500
This is my favorite.

87
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,500
Thank you.

88
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,500
Thank you.

89
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,500
Bye.

90
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,500
Wait, wait.

91
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,500
I have something to do.

92
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,500
Eat and drink.

93
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,500
No, no, no.

94
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,500
I'll drink this.

95
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,500
No, no.

96
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,500
You're a lifesaver.

97
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,500
Please.

98
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,500
Here you go.

99
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,500
Please.

100
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,500
Please.

101
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,500
One more.

102
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,500
Just one?

103
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Sorry to keep you busy.

104
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
In the end, she didn't say no.

105
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Ms. Umiro, you got a good job.

106
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Time became a good president.

107
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
And then Eihara-san said that.

108
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
What about me?

109
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
You said that.

110
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I said that.

111
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I said that.

112
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I said that.

113
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I said that.

114
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:40,500
When you published your ad,

115
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:47,500
you said that you liked the words you thought of.

116
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,500
What kind of words?

117
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,500
Sometimes,

118
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,500
I said, I'm sorry.

119
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
But every time I hear them,

120
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
these words echo in my heart.

121
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Is your house okay, Ms. Umiro?

122
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
My house is totally fine.

123
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It's safe.

124
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I see.

125
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Then, I'll go home.

126
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,500
I'll go home.

127
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,500
Actually,

128
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,500
I heard

129
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:41,500
that you thought of a catch-up.

130
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,500
Sometimes,

131
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:49,500
I said I'm sorry.

132
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
The next day

133
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Why didn't you tell me before?

134
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Well,

135
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I'm a little embarrassed.

136
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Once again,

137
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
thank you for thinking of that catch-up.

138
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Thank you from me too.

139
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
When I'm with you,

140
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I might be able to

141
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
move forward

142
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
in my time.

143
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
That time

144
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
is coming.

145
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
The wind is playing a prank on me.

146
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,500
The wind is strong.

147
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,500
I agree.

148
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,500
I can do it again.

149
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,500
Well,

150
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,500
I'll go now.

151
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,500
Thank you for your time.

152
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,500
I was able to do it again.

153
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:21,500
I can do it again and again in my life.

154
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:26,500
Maybe my mom gave me this chance.

155
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,500
This is the picture I want to draw.

156
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,500
I didn't kiss you,

157
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:01,500
so I don't have any photos of you.

158
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,500
Manatsu-senpai.

159
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,500
Genya, what's wrong?

160
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,500
Sorry for coming back from work.

161
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,500
Welcome.

162
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,500
Please have an ice-cream.

163
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,500
I thought you couldn't sleep well

164
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,500
after meeting me at the fire.

165
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,500
I heard you can sleep.

166
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,500
Genya.

167
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,500
When you couldn't sleep,

168
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,500
I put a blanket under your eyes.

169
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,500
I'm sorry.

170
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,000
I know you can't sleep.

171
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I'll be in trouble if I try.

172
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
So, have this.

173
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Thank you.

174
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I want to see your sleeping face

175
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
next to me.

176
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I don't know.

177
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I'm kidding.

178
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
If you laugh,

179
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I'll be rewarded for it.

180
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Here you are.

181
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Thank you.

182
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,500
Thank you.

183
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,500
Sorry.

184
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Thank you.

185
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
How is the new company?

186
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Is the president there okay?

187
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
What do you mean?

188
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I didn't want to make you angry.

189
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
It's not the president's fault.

190
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
You don't have to be so angry.

191
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I have a question.

192
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
My friend's brother is in the beauty college.

193
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
He said he was looking for a model

194
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
for a female designer in college.

195
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
A model?

196
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Yes, a beautiful woman.

197
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I only think of Manatsu.

198
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
No, no, no.

199
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
It's impossible to be a model.

200
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I'm not like him.

201
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I've been doing a lot

202
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
since he quit his job.

203
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I see.

204
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
If you say so.

205
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
This is Teru, a beauty student

206
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
who is an assistant to a painter named Mirai.

207
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I'm Teru.

208
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Thank you for accepting my model.

209
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Am I really okay?

210
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
You have a deep eye.

211
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
You're strong, but you're also sad.

212
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I want to be your painting.

213
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I've never been told that.

214
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
That's what Genya said.

215
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I think I saw the light.

216
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
There it is.

217
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I'm sorry.

218
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Mirai.

219
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
What's wrong?

220
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Can you go shopping with me today?

221
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
The art shop.

222
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Sure.

223
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Yay.

224
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I'm going to the art shop.

225
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Okay.

226
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Manatsu,

227
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I don't think you're a model.

228
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
You know I'm not into you.

229
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
People in love

230
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
have a soft line.

231
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,500
You have someone

232
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,500
you like, right?

233
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,500
What?

234
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,500
I knew it.

235
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:35,500
I think you've become more beautiful than before.

236
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I don't have a crush on anyone.

237
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Even if you try to hide it,

238
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
it's not going to come out.

239
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I have something to ask you.

240
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
There's someone I want you to draw.

241
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Who?

242
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
The person who came to my company.

243
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
It's okay.

244
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:04,500
I have to draw for a university class.

245
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,500
Why?

246
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,500
I like that person.

247
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,500
But I've always been single.

248
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:17,500
I want to leave at least that in my drawing.

249
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,500
But I'm happy.

250
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,500
I like you, Manatsu.

251
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,500
I like you, too.

252
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,500
I like you, too.

253
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,500
It's rare to draw so much black.

254
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,500
Did you notice?

255
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,500
The future picture has a vivid color.

256
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,500
I thought so, too.

257
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,500
Red is passion and excitement.

258
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,500
Blue is freedom and trust.

259
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,500
Yellow is hope and curiosity.

260
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,500
What is the image of black?

261
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,500
Is it dark or lonely?

262
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,500
It has a negative image,

263
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,500
but it also has the meaning of self-reliance and self-reliance.

264
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,500
I see.

265
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,500
And I realized that black is convenient.

266
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,500
It's good to see something.

267
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,500
Right?

268
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,500
By the way,

269
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,500
my friend's husband

270
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,500
was diagnosed with ED.

271
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,500
But he cheated on him and had a baby.

272
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,500
What do you mean?

273
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,500
His wife had an ED.

274
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,500
But his wife didn't accept him.

275
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Isn't it terrible?

276
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I wonder if it's the same in the world.

277
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
It's a terrible story.

278
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Hey,

279
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
are you okay?

280
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
What?

281
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
You're kind to everyone.

282
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I'm okay.

283
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I know.

284
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Are you okay?

285
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I'm okay.

286
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
By the way,

287
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
can you play the music I put in the atelier?

288
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Of course.

289
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Yay!

290
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I said I liked you during the day

291
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I took you into my dreams

292
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
It sounds fun.

293
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
You like it, don't you?

294
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
The fruit of midsummer.

295
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
This time of the year is so good.

296
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
The word midsummer.

297
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Only you can move forward in this time.

298
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
When I'm with you,

299
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I can move forward

300
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
in my time that I've been waiting for.

301
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Good.

302
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Good.

303
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Senpai,

304
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
your face is so good.

305
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Your face now is like someone else.

306
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Hello.

307
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Taichi, be careful with your head.

308
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Oh, Tere.

309
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,500
Mirai-san.

310
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,500
I borrowed the atelier.

311
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,500
This is my husband.

312
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,500
I'm Tere, the assistant.

313
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,500
Mirai is always on my side.

314
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,500
Someone was here?

315
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,500
Yes, a model.

316
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,500
A designer.

317
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,500
Show me.

318
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,500
It's nice.

319
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,500
Thank you.

320
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,500
Show me too.

321
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,500
Tere.

322
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,500
When it's done, please take a look.

323
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,500
Now I feel embarrassed.

324
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,500
I will check it one more time.

325
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,500
Boss...

326
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,500
Do you have any meaning in hitting the brand ads

327
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,500
with this much budget?

328
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:01,500
They quit their collaboration with Fan Art Russia and are struggling to sell.

329
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,500
What do you think?

330
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:09,500
Well, I think the budget is more expensive than I thought.

331
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,500
I'll do it.

332
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:19,500
I want to tell the world what I want to tell the world as a watchmaker.

333
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,500
I'm sorry.

334
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,500
But...

335
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,500
What's wrong?

336
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:34,500
This visual is great, but I can't tell you what I'm trying to tell you.

337
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:39,500
If you're still stuck, I think you should stick to it.

338
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:42,500
Then give me some ideas.

339
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:47,500
Because you thought about a lot of things every week when you were a watchmaker.

340
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,500
You're the one who ruins people's lives.

341
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,500
I'll stick to it to the end, so it's okay.

342
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,500
What's the weather like on the day of the shoot?

343
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:59,500
I just got a call and it looks like it's going to rain, so it's confirmed.

344
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,500
Boss, the weather is going to be nice today.

345
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,500
This location is a win-win.

346
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:18,500
It's true. It's going to be a good thing.

347
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,500
The rain is getting heavier.

348
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,500
I'm going to take a break.

349
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,500
Everyone, please hurry up.

350
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,500
It's a nice place.

351
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,500
It's the best.

352
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,500
Didn't you say you were going to pay so much?

353
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,500
I didn't say that.

354
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,500
I said it.

355
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,500
I'm sorry.

356
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,500
Are you okay?

357
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,500
Are you okay?

358
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,500
Come on, come on, come on.

359
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,500
Come on, come on.

360
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,500
It's okay.

361
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,500
Are you okay?

362
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,500
What?

363
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,500
What if I were you?

364
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,500
Are you okay?

365
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,500
I can't breathe.

366
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,500
I can't breathe.

367
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,500
Kiyoko, Kiyoko, hurry up.

368
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,500
Move, move.

369
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,500
Everyone, can you hear me?

370
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,500
Boss?

371
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,500
Boss?

372
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,500
Mom?

373
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:58,500
I feel like time is going to stop if I'm doing this.

374
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:08,500
Manatsu, love is not something you can choose.

375
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,500
Love is...

376
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,500
...something that falls.

377
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,500
You like someone?

378
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,500
Maybe I'm wrong.

379
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,500
The person who gave me that watch?

380
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,500
I...

381
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,500
...could start over with that watch.

382
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,500
Don't touch it!

383
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,500
Don't touch my love!

384
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:58,500
You might understand it too.

385
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:03,500
There are feelings that can't be stopped just by being right.

386
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,500
I'm sorry.

387
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,500
I'm sorry.

388
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,500
I'm sorry.

389
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:12,500
There are feelings that can't be stopped just by being right.

390
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,500
So, until that day comes...

391
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,500
...live.

392
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,500
Live!

393
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,500
Live!

394
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,500
Umiya-san.

395
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,500
Umiya-san.

396
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,500
Boss?

397
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,500
Boss.

398
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,500
Manatsu-san, you did it!

399
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,500
This is bad, this is bad.

400
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,500
There was an accident yesterday.

401
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:05,500
But, with the president's help, Umiya-san managed to...

402
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,500
That's not what I mean.

403
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:09,500
If the result is good, there's no way to fix it.

404
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,500
That's right.

405
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:14,500
Since Umiya-chan came to our house, there's been a lot of problems.

406
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,500
I don't think so.

407
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,500
I think so too.

408
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:22,500
He's really a troublemaker.

409
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:23,500
I'm so sorry.

410
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:35,500
I thought I could avoid kissing the president with a time leap,

411
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,500
but I can't breathe.

412
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,500
Yes?

413
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,500
Manatsu-san, is the captain okay?

414
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,500
Yes.

415
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,500
I'm sorry for not being able to sleep.

416
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,500
The captain is fine now.

417
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,500
He can be discharged from Monday.

418
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,500
That's good.

419
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,500
I'll send you a business report later.

420
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,500
If possible, please keep an eye on him.

421
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,500
Thank you.

422
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,500
Manatsu-san's call

423
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,500
Knock knock.

424
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,500
Excuse me, president.

425
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:32,500
What's wrong?

426
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:36,500
I talked to Manatsu-san on the phone earlier, and it seems that the captain has returned.

427
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,500
I see.

428
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,500
I'm glad.

429
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,500
So, how was it?

430
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:49,500
How did you feel when you kissed Manatsu-san?

431
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,500
What are you talking about?

432
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,500
That's a sudden kiss.

433
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:59,500
Please don't get so serious.

434
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,500
The hallway?

435
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,500
Manatsu-san's call

436
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,500
Welcome back.

437
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,500
I'm home.

438
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,500
Huh?

439
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,500
Something's not right?

440
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,500
Huh?

441
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,500
Did something happen?

442
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,500
No.

443
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,500
Huh?

444
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,500
Nothing.

445
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,500
Huh?

446
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,500
Nothing.

447
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:49,500
That was just a sudden death.

448
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,500
But...

449
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:58,500
I can't forget the scene from that time.

450
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:02,500
The President was trying so hard to save me.

451
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,500
I'm sorry I'm so busy.

452
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,500
No.

453
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,500
I wanted to write a little more.

454
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,500
If you don't mind...

455
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,500
I'm sorry I'm so busy.

456
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,500
No.

457
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,500
I wanted to write a little more.

458
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,500
If you don't mind...

459
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,500
Oh, teacher.

460
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,500
Oh, Teru.

461
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,500
Oh.

462
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,500
I'm Manatsu, a model.

463
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:38,500
Nice to meet you. I'm Manatsu from the sea.

464
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,500
Nice to meet you. I'm Mirai.

465
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,500
You're Manatsu, aren't you?

466
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,500
What a lovely name.

467
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,500
I'm grateful to my parents.

468
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:50,500
It's a brilliant name for this season.

469
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,500
Can I have your name?

470
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,500
Sure.

471
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,500
Please.

472
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:59,500
I like the song, Manatsu no Kajitsu.

473
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,500
Oh, really?

474
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,500
Yes.

475
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:05,500
My husband sang that song before we got married.

476
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:09,500
He was so bad at it, but he worked so hard.

477
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:12,500
That's how I fell in love with him.

478
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,500
That's a good thing.

479
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:17,500
I met my husband for the first time the other day.

480
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,500
He was a wonderful person.

481
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,500
I'm jealous.

482
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,500
I'll rub it in for you.

483
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,500
Go ahead.

484
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,500
He's really kind.

485
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:36,500
When I'm sick, he's by my side in the morning,

486
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:39,500
even in the middle of the night.

487
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:41,500
He says,

488
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:44,500
If you don't laugh, my time will stop.

489
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,500
Does anyone say that?

490
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,500
I'm embarrassed to hear that.

491
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:55,500
He's a man of destiny.

492
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:59,500
It's amazing that you love him so much.

493
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,500
Can I love him?

494
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,500
Not love each other?

495
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,500
I'm sorry.

496
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,500
No.

497
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:13,500
I'm trying my best to have a child.

498
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,500
We're together every day.

499
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:19,500
He's a man of the hour.

500
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,500
He's like a clock.

501
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,500
I'm jealous.

502
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,500
I'm sorry I'm the only one who's talking.

503
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:32,500
No, no.

504
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,500
I'm sorry. I have a video.

505
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,500
No.

506
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:45,500
I think women with scars are beautiful.

507
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:50,500
I want to write something like this.

508
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:02,500
Can I write it if you like?

509
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,500
Yes.

510
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,500
He's the same as me now.

511
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:24,500
Wounds can be beautiful at times.

512
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:38,500
I think you're in love with Manasu.

513
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,500
No.

514
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,500
That's not true.

515
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:46,500
I'm honest.

516
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,500
I think so too.

517
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:53,500
I'm sure someone else is thinking the same.

518
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,500
Captain, are you okay?

519
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,500
Yes, I'm fine.

520
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,500
Please don't tell anyone.

521
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,500
I won't.

522
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,500
I'm sorry.

523
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,500
Good work.

524
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,500
We're going home.

525
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:32,500
Thank you.

526
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:38,500
You're not going home yet?

527
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:40,500
I have something to do.

528
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,500
Don't push yourself too hard.

529
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,500
Thank you.

530
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,500
Good work.

531
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,500
Hey, brother.

532
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,500
Oh, Aya.

533
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,500
I have work to do.

534
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,500
You work hard.

535
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,500
Good work.

536
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,500
Good work.

537
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:15,500
The last time you took a break was when you were in a bad mood.

538
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,500
You were in a bad mood.

539
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,500
I'm sorry.

540
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,500
I'm sorry.

541
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,500
You're not supposed to be angry.

542
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,500
How could I be angry?

543
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:31,500
I'm sorry.

544
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:32,500
I'm sorry.

545
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:33,500
I'm sorry.

546
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,500
I'm sorry.

547
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,500
I'm sorry.

548
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,500
I'm sorry.

549
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:37,500
I'm sorry.

550
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,500
I'm sorry.

551
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,500
I'm sorry.

552
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:42,500
Thank you for the other day.

553
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,500
I'm so glad you're safe.

554
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:49,500
If you weren't there, I wouldn't be here.

555
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:54,500
I was working part-time at a life-saving company.

556
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,500
I guess that helped.

557
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,500
Oh, right.

558
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:05,500
The visuals we shot the other day are up.

559
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,500
Let's watch them together.

560
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:12,500
I think you can see what I'm trying to convey.

561
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,500
In this photo,

562
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:18,500
there's not only a smiling child,

563
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:21,500
but also a crying child.

564
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:26,500
If you're alive, if something good happens,

565
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,500
sad things happen, too.

566
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:32,500
But no matter what,

567
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,500
when time passes,

568
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:37,500
it'll become a memory.

569
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:42,500
I want to tell you how important time is.

570
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:47,500
I feel like my heart's second hand

571
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:50,500
started moving faster.

572
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,500
I'm sure it'll reach

573
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:56,500
many people's hearts.

574
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:02,500
You're so sweet, Umiro.

575
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:12,500
I want to see the pamphlets

576
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,500
of the revue model.

577
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:17,500
Do you have them somewhere?

578
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,500
This is old, so...

579
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:22,500
Maybe the basement's study room.

580
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,500
Can I borrow your keys?

581
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,500
I'll go with you.

582
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,500
No, no, it's fine.

583
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,500
I'll go faster.

584
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,500
Here, eat this.

585
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,500
This tomato is sweet and delicious.

586
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,500
Thank you.

587
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:49,500
It tastes like a kiss.

588
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,500
Stop making excuses.

589
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,500
By the way,

590
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,500
it was a big problem the other day.

591
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,500
What's wrong?

592
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,500
Didn't your brother tell you?

593
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,500
No, he didn't.

594
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,500
There was a photo shoot in the river.

595
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:10,500
My employee fell into the river.

596
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,500
You were okay?

597
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,500
It was dangerous,

598
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,500
but my brother jumped in and saved him.

599
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:19,500
Tai?

600
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:22,500
I happened to be shooting that video.

601
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,500
Can I see it?

602
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,500
It's a social emergency,

603
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:30,500
so it's a secret.

604
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,500
Mr. Kyokyu!

605
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,500
Hurry!

606
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,500
The photo shoot was a success!

607
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,500
It was amazing.

608
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:18,500
My brother was saved by a desperate artificial respiration.

609
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:24,500
What's the name of this female employee?

610
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:29,500
Umi no Monatsu.

611
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:33,500
Nice to meet you. I'm Umi no Monatsu.

612
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,500
I'm glad you're safe.

613
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,500
I'm glad you're safe.

614
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,500
I'm glad I was saved.

615
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:51,500
But my brother is still working overtime.

616
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,500
He works hard.

617
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:59,500
Monatsu was still at my place when I left.

618
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:02,500
He's alone at work now.

619
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,500
I'm going home.

620
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,500
Eat some tomatoes.

621
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,500
I'm so jealous.

622
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,500
I'm sorry.

623
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,500
It's still old.

624
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,500
Wow.

625
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:38,500
It's summer,

626
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,500
but the air is cool.

627
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,500
Yeah.

628
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:46,500
This is what summer is like.

629
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,500
The next day

630
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,500
Madam.

631
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,500
What's wrong?

632
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:25,500
My husband is still working overtime.

633
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,500
He's getting lunch.

634
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:31,500
But he's not here.

635
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:34,500
He's in the office.

636
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,500
Alone?

637
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,500
No, with two.

638
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:45,500
The End

639
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:50,500
Here.

640
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:54,500
This is the material for the early limited edition.

641
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,500
Thank you.

642
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,500
What?

643
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,500
It's closed?

644
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:06,500
Yeah, I have to go to the office.

645
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,500
My phone is back.

646
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:11,500
I'm back too.

647
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,500
Where is the boss?

648
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:20,500
He's probably right next door.

649
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,500
Sorry.

650
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:26,500
It's okay.

651
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:32,500
I felt my heart beat faster

652
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:35,500
when I was in silence.

653
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:38,500
I'll open the door now.

654
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:42,500
Boss!

655
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:00,500
The End

656
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,500
Boss.

657
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,500
I'm sorry.

658
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:33,500
It doesn't hurt.

659
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:39,500
It doesn't hurt now.

660
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:44,500
It doesn't hurt now.

661
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:13,500
I'm sorry.

662
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:21,500
No matter what,

663
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:24,500
it will be a memory.

664
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:28,500
I'm sure of it.

665
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:42,500
I'm sorry.

666
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:45,500
I'm sorry.

667
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:48,500
I'm sorry.

668
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:51,500
I'm sorry.

669
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:54,500
I'm sorry.

670
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:57,500
I'm sorry.

671
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:00,500
I'm sorry.

672
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:03,500
I'm sorry.

673
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:06,500
I'm sorry.

674
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:09,500
No.

675
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:18,500
No.

676
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:23,500
No.

677
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:29,500
No.

678
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:39,500
No.

679
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:42,500
No.

680
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:45,500
No.

681
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:10,500
The unforgettable heart song

682
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:16,500
The fruit of tears

683
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:30,500
I've been laughing for four years

684
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:33,500
I've been broken with hope and despair

685
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:36,500
If this is fate, I won't hold it

686
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:39,500
Don't cry, broken glass

687
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:42,500
I'm sorry.

688
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:01,500
I'm sorry.

689
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:05,500
I have to go back.

690
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:12,500
The loop of love that sinks

691
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:19,500
I drown and run away

692
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:21,500
I tried to close my eyes

693
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:24,500
I tried to wish a lot

694
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:26,500
The clock hands keep on ticking

695
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:27,500
Keep on ticking

696
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:28,500
Where are you going?

697
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:30,500
Even this thrill

698
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:32,500
I love you more and more

699
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:35,500
I'm back to that day

700
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:37,500
I'm broken and you are broken glass

701
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:40,500
I'm sorry.

702
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:43,500
I'm sorry.

703
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:46,500
I'm sorry.

704
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:48,500
I tried to close my eyes

705
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:50,500
I tried to wish a lot

706
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:52,500
The clock hands keep on ticking

707
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:54,500
Keep on ticking

708
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:56,500
Where are you going?

709
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:58,500
Even this thrill

710
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:00,500
I love you more and more

711
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:02,500
I'm back to that day

712
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:04,500
I'm broken and you are broken glass

713
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:09,500
Please come back

714
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:11,500
Anna-Eno's Luna was very beautiful

715
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:13,500
This lip seems to be lying

716
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:16,500
Thank you for breaking me

717
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,500
Please let me bear the pain

718
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:20,500
What did you talk to your wife about?

719
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:22,500
I'm sorry.

720
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:24,500
It's too beautiful to be irritated

721
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:26,500
It's a cheating woman

722
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:28,500
I can be with Manatsu Senpai now

723
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:31,500
Recently, my brother has become sexy

724
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:34,500
Luna was a model for Enno

725
