1
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:51,259
A long time ago,

2
00:00:51,342 --> 00:00:54,512
it looked like we, humans,
had two overlapping bodies.

3
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:57,599
We were created with four arms, four legs,

4
00:00:58,183 --> 00:01:00,351
and two heads.

5
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:05,398
As humans were arrogant,
they challenged the gods.

6
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:10,528
And in the end, Zeus split
our bodies into two.

7
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:15,992
And to find happiness once again
as we had felt before the split,

8
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:19,454
we ended up roaming around
to find our other half.

9
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:29,964
And we call that fate love.

10
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:35,804
I've missed you, Su.

11
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:39,057
It's been a long time. Come on in.

12
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:45,647
If that's what love is all about,

13
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:48,274
love would be so easy.

14
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,200
Over here.

15
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:10,421
What brings you all the way here?

16
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:13,341
It's about the meeting
between our parents.

17
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:15,009
But will your family be available?

18
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:16,845
I heard your mom is sick.

19
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,264
"Meeting"?

20
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:21,516
You said you wanted
to have a small wedding.

21
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:24,185
We have a lot of guests to invite.

22
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:28,481
But it wouldn't look nice
when the size of our crowd and yours

23
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:29,691
differs a lot.

24
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:35,238
I'm sorry, but I don't follow you.

25
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,284
Hyeon-jae told us yesterday
that you guys will get married.

26
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,120
What do you mean?

27
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,458
It was just Hyeon-jae's idea, then.

28
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:51,713
Are you two even going to get married?

29
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:03,725
I'll be honest with you.

30
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:06,644
If you don't want to marry him,

31
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:10,189
let Hyeon-jae go.

32
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:15,069
We know about your family.

33
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:18,156
I know that it's not something
you can afford.

34
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:22,160
Your brother is young.
And your mother is sick.

35
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:24,037
And you're the breadwinner.

36
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,039
I hope you won't take it personally.

37
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:30,168
If you guys get married without a plan,
it will be bad for both of you.

38
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,840
I hope you know I'm saying all this
because I care about you.

39
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,259
I know.

40
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:47,894
-But…
-Yes?

41
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:51,272
No matter how hard
you try to make it sound nice,

42
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:55,151
it still hurts.

43
00:03:57,987 --> 00:03:59,322
You just

44
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:03,368
hurt my pride.

45
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:08,122
I'll get going now.

46
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:09,958
Hey.

47
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:25,014
Love is never easy.

48
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:32,313
Countless problems occur
after you find your other half.

49
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:35,316
And I haven't

50
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:38,111
solved them yet.

51
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:02,260
What do you want?

52
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:04,971
Why are you standing
in front of someone else's house?

53
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,850
Do you think I want to do this?

54
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:11,185
Ma'am, are you a weirdo?

55
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:12,729
No.

56
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:15,815
I'm not a weirdo.

57
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:18,109
And I'm not old enough
for you to call me ma'am.

58
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:20,069
I see.

59
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:26,743
I won't look.

60
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:32,623
Mom! There's a weird old lady outside!

61
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,168
I'm not a weirdo!

62
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:41,382
He's right.

63
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,343
I am acting weird.

64
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:49,515
A woman entered my boyfriend's house,
but I can't ring the bell.

65
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:56,606
Woo-yeon.

66
00:05:57,482 --> 00:06:01,194
When I heard your voice, I thought I was
just hearing things. But it's really you.

67
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:02,445
Is someone here?

68
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:06,949
Hands off. My girlfriend is super strong.

69
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:17,752
You didn't say you were coming.

70
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:19,253
What?

71
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:21,589
Well,

72
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:24,217
I was in the neighborhood.

73
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:31,432
I'm sorry.
I didn't know he had a girlfriend.

74
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:32,809
I see.

75
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:36,187
It's okay.

76
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:40,316
Who is she?

77
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:44,195
I'm Kwon Yu-ra.

78
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:46,489
I see.

79
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:50,201
Don't stand there. Come inside.

80
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:52,662
No. It's okay.

81
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:56,124
Well, you have a guest over.

82
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:58,960
I'll just go.

83
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,255
Wait here. I'll drive you home.

84
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:06,759
No. That's okay. You have a friend over.

85
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:10,179
Please don't mind me.

86
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,433
Don't just stand there. Drive her home.

87
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:15,935
No, that won't be necessary.
I can go home by myself.

88
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:17,895
I need to stop by somewhere, too.

89
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:25,695
Bye.

90
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:31,492
Bye.

91
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:34,829
I'll call you.

92
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:37,790
Sure.

93
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:42,128
Woo-yeon. Can I have your number?

94
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:45,673
Why do you want my girlfriend's number?

95
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:48,926
I don't have any friends in Korea.
He's the only friend I have.

96
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:57,768
If you get bored, call me.

97
00:07:58,895 --> 00:07:59,937
Sure.

98
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,164
Thanks.

99
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:19,457
You're not asking me why.

100
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,626
Why do you want to be
a commercial photographer?

101
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:24,795
I came here to ask you that,

102
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:27,924
but I just saw the answer.

103
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:30,384
It's because of Woo-yeon.

104
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:34,055
I want to be with her.

105
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,182
Is that so?

106
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,519
I'll hook you up with a Korean agency.

107
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:41,771
They have a lot of famous models.

108
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:44,690
It's a big agency, so it's good
for a commercial photographer.

109
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:51,113
This is it for work.
Now, let's talk as friends.

110
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:54,784
Have you been well?

111
00:08:58,996 --> 00:08:59,872
Seriously?

112
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:01,541
What?

113
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,711
I heard an airline wants to sponsor you

114
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:09,131
and use your photos in their ads.

115
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:13,678
Will you really be fine passing up
an opportunity like that?

116
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:17,056
How did you know?

117
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:19,850
I know someone in their marketing team.

118
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:23,980
I answered your question.
Now, it's your turn.

119
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:34,865
I'll be fine.

120
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:40,913
Will you make her feel bad with that face?

121
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:46,002
When you try to hide
how you feel from her,

122
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:47,712
she'll know.

123
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:52,383
Don't torture yourself.
You should talk to Woo-yeon about it.

124
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,053
It's not just about you.
It's about both of you.

125
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:07,857
The receiver cannot be reached.
Please leave a message…

126
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:09,275
CULTURED PEARL

127
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:11,736
Is she busy?

128
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:18,868
-Hey.
-Hey.

129
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:23,039
I closed the door when I came in.

130
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:27,335
You won't be wasting your air conditioner.

131
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:28,502
It's not that.

132
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:30,838
Are you here alone?

133
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,423
Yes.

134
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:34,842
-I want a beer.
-Sure.

135
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:42,350
Why the long face?

136
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:45,728
Can a man and a woman

137
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:48,898
be friends?

138
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,570
MEN AND WOMEN CAN'T BE FRIENDS
AS LONG AS BOOZE AND NIGHTS EXIST

139
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,450
Why not? Why can't they be friends?

140
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:01,494
Why not? Friendships can be so strong.

141
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:04,246
Do you think booze and nights
can ruin such friendships?

142
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,501
When a man and a woman are just friends,

143
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:12,505
they're both ugly
or they both have lovers,

144
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:14,673
or one of them is holding back
their feelings.

145
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:18,761
But you and Jin-ju are friends.
And you and I are friends, too.

146
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:24,392
Didn't Jin-ju

147
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:27,186
tell you about me?

148
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:28,979
About what?

149
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:35,277
My gosh. No. Jin-ju doesn't
badmouth people behind their backs.

150
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:38,114
Forget it.

151
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:50,000
Hey, let's say
a girl doesn't tell her friends

152
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:53,337
when she has a fling
or when a guy likes her.

153
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:54,797
Why is that?

154
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:58,801
Either she has absolutely
no interest in the guy

155
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,594
or is embarrassed.

156
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:02,763
It's one or the other.

157
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:22,032
Perfect timing.

158
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:25,161
I finished cooking the stew.
Wash your hands and sit.

159
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:51,437
Why did you cook?
This must have been a lot of work.

160
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:53,063
Just because.

161
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:57,693
I was just resting at home.
I didn't have much to do at home anyway.

162
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,364
Don't forget you have chemo tomorrow.

163
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,241
I'll be there in the afternoon.

164
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:09,038
Will chemo save my life?

165
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,542
It must.

166
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:15,961
That's why we're doing it.

167
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:20,090
Do you want me to live a long life?

168
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:28,390
I didn't want to live a long life.

169
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,017
So you won't be a burden to us?

170
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:37,900
But this is way too early.

171
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:42,821
More than anything, I wanted

172
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:48,160
to be there for you

173
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:51,413
when you have a baby.

174
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:57,253
My mother passed away when I was young.

175
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:00,047
Most of the time,

176
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:04,760
I'd think, "I've never had a mom

177
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:08,514
since I was young anyway."
I used to think like that.

178
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,560
But strangely, when I had you,

179
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,354
I missed her so much.

180
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:20,651
After giving birth to you,

181
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,404
I couldn't stop crying

182
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:25,739
because I missed her.

183
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:32,580
But I don't want you

184
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,667
to cry like me.

185
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:42,715
Mom,

186
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:50,264
that won't be the only time
I would need you in my life.

187
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:56,645
So can you not die?

188
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:06,447
I do want to live. Of course, I do.

189
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,117
Alright.

190
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,287
Then live.

191
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:32,014
Ms. Han, how about pho for lunch?

192
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:36,226
There's a good pho restaurant in front of
our building. It's called Tendon Pho.

193
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,020
Sure. Sounds good.

194
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:41,106
But what's "tendon"?

195
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:44,360
Oh, that. It's the sinew.

196
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:46,195
I see. The sinew.

197
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:56,914
She startled me.

198
00:15:58,457 --> 00:15:59,708
What's wrong?

199
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,380
I don't like tendons.
I'm allergic to them.

200
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:06,173
I see.

201
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:08,300
I didn't know
people could be allergic to it.

202
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:13,806
SANG-HYEOK

203
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:21,355
Jin-ju, even if you're busy,
don't skip your lunch. Make sure to eat.

204
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:22,481
Have a great day!

205
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:30,739
Merciful Buddha, grant me your wisdom.

206
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,324
Take my suffering.

207
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:35,577
What are you doing here?

208
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:37,287
Waiting for you.

209
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:39,415
You should've called.

210
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:43,252
The light was off in your room,
so I thought you'd be coming home.

211
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:45,713
Why are you here?

212
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:47,756
Because I missed you.

213
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,094
Yu-ra is a model.

214
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:55,514
She's quite famous abroad
and knows a lot of people in Korea.

215
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:58,809
I see.

216
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,729
I met her to talk about work.

217
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,481
I'll be a commercial
photographer in Korea.

218
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:08,068
Then you won't have to travel?

219
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:10,070
You'll be in Korea?

220
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:12,656
Are you happy?

221
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,158
Of course.

222
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:17,703
Yes. I'm not leaving.

223
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,171
Is that you, Woo-yeon?

224
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:33,552
Mom. Dad.

225
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:36,722
Hello.

226
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:57,826
Don't kneel. Just sit on the chair.

227
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:02,831
What did he do so wrong?

228
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:05,459
You're defending a man
who broke your heart?

229
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:13,717
Mom, I've been meaning to ask you this.

230
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,261
How did you know about that?

231
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:27,481
You…

232
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:30,400
How could you?

233
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:37,658
I guess this is becoming
our usual meeting.

234
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:40,661
Having a crush is
definitely hitting her hard.

235
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,164
Don't leave.

236
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,292
Don't leave me.

237
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:50,337
Don't go.

238
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:55,092
Please like me back.

239
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:03,892
Wake up. I'm your mother.

240
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:05,644
Park Mi-suk.

241
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:08,355
Mom.

242
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:11,483
Mom.

243
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:14,903
Mom, I got rejected again.

244
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:19,032
How can he do this to me?

245
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:22,911
He keeps rejecting me over and over.

246
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,169
Let's put her in her room.

247
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:31,086
-Okay.
-Okay.

248
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:34,965
-Hey, Woo-yeon. Are you okay?
-Hold her.

249
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:37,676
One, two, three.

250
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:55,944
I won't let a guy come near my daughter
when he made her cry

251
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,613
in the past.

252
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:03,744
I am so sorry for making her cry.

253
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:08,665
I regret my actions a lot.
I'm trying my best to treat her right.

254
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:12,336
Will an apology from you heal
all the scars you left in my girl's heart?

255
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:17,299
Dad.

256
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:20,302
It's not something you should say.

257
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:22,930
What?

258
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:25,933
I mean, he was mean to me
before we started dating.

259
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:28,977
But you're not nice to Mom
even when you're married.

260
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,062
That brat.

261
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:32,606
You mistook Mom's birthday
for another date.

262
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:35,317
So she asked you if you were
thinking about another woman.

263
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,445
And when you went to that meeting
with other couples,

264
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:42,407
you helped the lady
Mom hates the most. So you pissed Mom off.

265
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:44,826
And… Oh, right.

266
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,037
Five years ago,
when we went to Grandma's--

267
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,288
Stop it, Woo-yeon.

268
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,917
Why? I still have a lot more left.

269
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:56,255
That's not what's important right now.

270
00:20:57,547 --> 00:21:01,510
He hasn't done anything wrong
ever since we started dating.

271
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,179
When we weren't dating, he was mean.

272
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:07,975
But isn't getting complacent
in a relationship

273
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:09,768
worse?

274
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:13,855
Woo-yeon.

275
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:16,316
Why are you scolding him?

276
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,360
Why are you scolding my man?

277
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:20,904
I will be the one who scolds him
or curses him out.

278
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:23,532
I have the right to do that, not you.

279
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:30,247
Let's go.

280
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,919
-I'm sorry.
-Don't apologize.

281
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:37,504
Bye.

282
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:44,886
That brat. She has lost all of
her respect for her father over a boy.

283
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,015
Raising kids is a useless thing to do.

284
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:51,685
-Right, honey?
-You're useless, too.

285
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:55,772
Honey. Mi-suk.

286
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:58,275
Mi-suk.

287
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:06,366
She's so strong.

288
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:10,329
Darn it.

289
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:25,093
I'm sorry for making you cry.

290
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:30,557
Then be nice.

291
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,060
Always stay right next to me. Okay?

292
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:35,103
Take good care of me every day.

293
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:37,064
I will be good to you

294
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:41,318
every day.

295
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:49,117
Gosh.

296
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:51,995
Sir.

297
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,121
Why are you out again?

298
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,790
Let's go.

299
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:57,876
I won't go. No, I'm not going.
I'm staying with Su.

300
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:02,464
It's getting late.
You should go back inside.

301
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:04,341
Not you.

302
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:11,139
Do you drink?

303
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:12,140
Pardon?

304
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:14,351
Me?

305
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:23,902
Wait.

306
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:38,416
What are you doing?

307
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:42,087
Stopping a jinx.

308
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:44,881
I'm sorry.

309
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:57,394
-Sit down.
-Yes, sir.

310
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:04,568
I don't like you.

311
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:08,697
I hate you because Woo-yeon spent
ten years crying over you.

312
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:13,577
I hate you because you rejected
my daughter who's the apple of my eye.

313
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:17,247
I'm sorry. I realized
my feelings for her late.

314
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:21,001
Now, I like Woo-yeon. I like her a lot.

315
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:23,420
Will you make her cry again?

316
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:26,923
I don't make promises I cannot keep.

317
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:29,593
I can't fully understand my feelings,

318
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:31,511
so I can't promise on behalf of hers.

319
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:35,182
Some days, she might cry,

320
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:39,352
but I will do my best
to take good care of her.

321
00:24:52,115 --> 00:24:55,911
Why are you smiling?
I told you I hate you.

322
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:56,828
I'm sorry.

323
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,211
I'm sure all parents feel the same way.

324
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:07,839
But Woo-yeon is my everything.

325
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:10,383
Don't do anything to hurt her.

326
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:13,470
No, I won't. If I do, you can hurt me.

327
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:25,440
Goodness. You are a smooth talker.

328
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:28,568
I'm quite smart.

329
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:34,032
-Pour me a drink.
-Yes, sir.

330
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:40,121
Cheers.

331
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:53,343
Woo-yeon, I think I passed.

332
00:25:53,426 --> 00:25:54,511
Yes, it seems that way.

333
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:57,222
What did you do to win him over?

334
00:25:57,931 --> 00:25:59,474
Well, I didn't do much.

335
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:02,560
I answered his questions truthfully.

336
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:04,271
And I made a few dad jokes.

337
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:07,857
That must be it.
My dad loves that kind of stuff.

338
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:09,609
I see.

339
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:13,947
What else? What did you tell him?

340
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:18,201
I told him that I like you very much.

341
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:22,664
I like you a lot, Woo-yeon.

342
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:26,334
I love you so much.

343
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:38,221
I love you, too.

344
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:40,557
What?

345
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:43,310
I love you.

346
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:56,197
Jin-ju.

347
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:03,747
Why are you here again?

348
00:27:05,248 --> 00:27:07,625
I came here to see you.
Let me see your face.

349
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,383
Did you not get enough sleep?

350
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:18,178
No. The customers
went home late last night.

351
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:21,389
I came to deliver your lunch,
Ms. Prosecutor.

352
00:27:22,932 --> 00:27:24,893
I told you not to do that.

353
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:26,811
I like doing it. Don't stop me.

354
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:29,606
Make sure to eat everything.

355
00:27:29,689 --> 00:27:31,816
The chicory is there just for decoration.

356
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:35,570
You really are like my mom.

357
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:38,114
-Jin-ju.
-Hey.

358
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:40,909
-Are you going out for lunch?
-Yes.

359
00:27:41,534 --> 00:27:43,995
-Who is he? Your boyfriend?
-No.

360
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:45,830
Oh. A lunch delivery guy?

361
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:48,708
-I'm her friend…
-Yes, he is.

362
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:58,343
Thank you.

363
00:27:58,426 --> 00:28:01,012
I see. The meal box?
Can I get your business card?

364
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:02,722
I saw it before. It looked tasty.

365
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:06,184
I only had a soft opening.

366
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:09,270
I'll give you my card once I open.

367
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:10,855
Okay. Sure.

368
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,484
Then, have a good day.

369
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:17,570
-See you later.
-Okay.

370
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:38,383
He could have just said he was my friend.

371
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:41,136
Why did he go along with what I said?

372
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:44,723
Why did I say that he was a delivery guy?

373
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:48,351
He has pride, too.

374
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:07,245
Either she has absolutely
no interest in the guy

375
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:09,164
or is embarrassed.

376
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:11,541
It's one or the other.

377
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:04,052
-I'm good.
-Let's go.

378
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:08,723
Mother, I'm here.

379
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,517
Why did you come? You must be busy.

380
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,726
It's vacation now.

381
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:14,354
Why are you here?

382
00:30:14,437 --> 00:30:17,273
Her treatment is hard as it is.
It'll be tough riding a cab.

383
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:22,862
Let me help you, Mother.

384
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,407
-Be careful.
-Gosh.

385
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:34,332
Wait.

386
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:05,780
CEO KIM HAN-SU

387
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:17,041
WE'D LIKE TO MAKE AN OFFER FOR OUR PROJECT

388
00:31:38,938 --> 00:31:41,274
Our love which I never thought
would end was over.

389
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:44,527
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM

390
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:51,117
Gosh. You're good at everything.

391
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,869
And you're good at your job, too?

392
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:53,828
Come on.

393
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:56,789
Did you rush here to show me this?

394
00:31:56,873 --> 00:31:59,167
Yes. I wanted to watch it with you.

395
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,419
It's the first drama title I worked on.

396
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:03,796
Gosh. You're so cute.

397
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:05,506
Stop it.

398
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:08,259
What a cutie pie.

399
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:09,886
I told you to stop.

400
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:13,222
You don't like it?

401
00:32:15,224 --> 00:32:16,893
I'm thirsty.

402
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:19,228
-What do you want?
-Orange juice.

403
00:32:32,992 --> 00:32:34,953
WE'D LIKE TO MAKE AN OFFER FOR OUR PROJECT

404
00:32:42,835 --> 00:32:46,464
YOUR PHOTOS WILL BE USED IN OUR ADS
AND BE EXHIBITED AT OUR GALLERY

405
00:32:57,642 --> 00:33:00,186
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

406
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:07,193
Slow down.

407
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:10,321
You might choke on it.

408
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:12,281
Okay.

409
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:19,914
I wanted to help your mother.

410
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:24,585
I don't want you to see how I live.

411
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:31,509
You still don't trust me.

412
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:40,893
How can we get married now?

413
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:46,816
Your sister came by.

414
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:52,447
What did she say to you?

415
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:56,034
That I can't afford to get married.

416
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:59,871
And if I don't want to marry you,
I should let you go.

417
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:01,414
I'm sorry.

418
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:04,250
I'll talk to my sister.

419
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:06,502
-I--
-She's not wrong. She has a point.

420
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:09,255
How can I marry you when my mom's sick?

421
00:34:09,338 --> 00:34:10,631
That's precisely why.

422
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:14,427
I want to be with you
as your husband and guardian.

423
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:18,681
I'll talk to my family.

424
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:21,184
-I will--
-How will you talk to them?

425
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:23,978
Will you yell at your parents?

426
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,563
Will you curse at your sister?

427
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:27,940
If you turn your back on your family,

428
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:30,026
will that make you happy?

429
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,528
Fine. Let's not talk about that now.

430
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:34,947
Everything your family did for you

431
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:37,784
and the money they'll give you later.
Can you give it all up?

432
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:41,746
I hate the idea of you giving something up
because of me.

433
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:43,122
And even if you want to,

434
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:45,416
I don't want a man who has nothing.

435
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:49,045
-Yeong-hui.
-So

436
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:52,924
because of who I am

437
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:55,301
and because I have nothing,

438
00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:57,720
I will never marry a man who has no money.

439
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:00,681
You're too worked up.

440
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:05,353
I apologize for what my sister did.
I'll handle it.

441
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:09,524
So don't think about breaking up.

442
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:11,526
I'm not saying this because I'm worked up.

443
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:14,195
This is who I am.

444
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:17,949
The naive girl who smiled with you

445
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:19,992
in the rain without an umbrella is gone.

446
00:35:22,411 --> 00:35:23,830
Bye.

447
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:49,230
BIG SISTER

448
00:35:57,446 --> 00:35:58,948
Where are you right now?

449
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:15,423
I'm going to

450
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:18,759
marry Yeong-hui.

451
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:24,473
Even without your blessing.

452
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:27,935
Even if you disapprove of it,

453
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,147
I will marry her.

454
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:34,358
Do you think love
will be enough to keep a marriage?

455
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:37,570
After getting married,
love becomes the lowest priority.

456
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:40,698
Sometimes, love can be a burden.

457
00:36:40,781 --> 00:36:42,158
You…

458
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:47,914
Apologize to Yeong-hui.

459
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:50,124
-You brat.
-Without her,

460
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:54,128
I wouldn't have been able to be a teacher

461
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:57,590
or have a decent job, for that matter.

462
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:00,718
I was a troublemaker,
but she helped me study,

463
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:02,386
have a dream, and be a decent man.

464
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:06,766
You know it was all her.

465
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:12,146
Even if it weren't for her,

466
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:15,233
you would've gotten your act together
because you have a kind soul.

467
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:17,193
I'm not kind at all.

468
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:20,988
I pretended to be kind
to make a good impression on her.

469
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,200
And because I did that,

470
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:27,161
I didn't turn into a total failure.

471
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:29,789
Hey. Do you think
we're saying this for our benefit?

472
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:31,582
It's for your own good.

473
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:36,754
I'll pay back the house deposit
you gave me.

474
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:40,216
If you think I'm being an ungrateful son,

475
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:44,595
I'll be a chauffeur
or get a part-time job.

476
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:47,765
And I'll pay you back.

477
00:37:47,848 --> 00:37:51,435
What if you hurt yourself?
Why would you do something like that?

478
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:54,689
I don't care if that becomes my life.

479
00:37:58,484 --> 00:37:59,819
I'm sorry,

480
00:38:02,488 --> 00:38:05,700
but I can still live without you guys.

481
00:38:11,747 --> 00:38:13,249
But without her,

482
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:18,045
I might as well be dead.

483
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:44,280
-You're here.
-Yes.

484
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:48,743
The lunch was delicious.

485
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:52,788
I'm glad.

486
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:56,208
I ate everything. I didn't leave anything.

487
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:58,502
I even ate the chicory
which was for decoration.

488
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:01,714
Good.

489
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:07,970
I'm sorry about earlier.

490
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:10,306
It threw me off when he asked me that.

491
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:11,640
It's okay.

492
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:20,191
What will you cook tomorrow?

493
00:39:25,404 --> 00:39:26,572
I won't go there again.

494
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:28,741
What?

495
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:33,621
I'm sorry for bothering you.

496
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:38,292
I thought I could be
your transfer station,

497
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:43,130
but you already drive an expensive car,
so you probably don't need me.

498
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:48,094
Is this it?

499
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:53,516
Yes.

500
00:39:56,018 --> 00:39:58,187
You said you'd do your best
to win me over.

501
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:01,607
Is this all you're going to do?

502
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:05,152
Isn't this the way it should be?

503
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:10,199
Fine. That's good. Bye.

504
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:24,463
TONIGHT

505
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:56,412
That's not the right glass.

506
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:02,460
-What? What are you doing?
-I don't have an expensive car now.

507
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:05,754
Whether it's a transfer or final station,
I need it.

508
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:10,426
Keep liking me.

509
00:41:13,387 --> 00:41:14,889
I want you to keep liking me.

510
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:17,975
I like you, too.

511
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:22,605
Will you say something?

512
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:50,799
Oxaline is used
in your mother's chemotherapy.

513
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:53,886
As one of its side effects,
she may struggle to touch cold things.

514
00:41:55,262 --> 00:41:58,599
It's more than a struggle.
It may be pretty painful.

515
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:01,101
So patients are
afraid of this side effect.

516
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:04,396
Touching metal or glass at room
temperature is painful for some people.

517
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:15,824
Dryness in her body will cause nosebleeds.
So adjust the humidity level.

518
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:45,896
HYEON-JAE'S SISTER

519
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:59,743
Hello. What is this about?

520
00:43:00,452 --> 00:43:01,870
I wanted to apologize.

521
00:43:03,497 --> 00:43:04,873
I'm sorry.

522
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:09,211
I was just frustrated, too.

523
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:14,174
I must have hurt you a lot.

524
00:43:17,052 --> 00:43:18,679
It's okay.

525
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:20,723
The funny thing about people

526
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:25,936
is that when it concerns our families,
we infinitely became mean and selfish.

527
00:43:26,812 --> 00:43:28,272
I'm sorry, Yeong-hui.

528
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:33,152
But you had a point.

529
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:36,155
Thank you for your understanding.

530
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:11,148
YOUR PHOTOS WILL BE USED IN OUR ADS
AND BE EXHIBITED AT OUR GALLERY

531
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:15,277
He promised that he wouldn't leave.

532
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:20,240
And he didn't ask me if he could leave.

533
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:22,242
So

534
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:25,871
I don't have to ask him first.

535
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:39,677
This is Kwon Yu-ra. Let's hang out.

536
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:51,271
Is there a hairstyle you want?

537
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:54,817
I'm going to meet someone today.

538
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,568
It must be someone important.

539
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:58,570
Who are you meeting?

540
00:44:59,405 --> 00:45:00,781
My boyfriend's

541
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:02,950
woman?

542
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:09,915
Please wait.

543
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:12,126
Director.

544
00:45:48,036 --> 00:45:49,913
You look so pretty today.

545
00:45:51,665 --> 00:45:53,500
I look underdressed compared to you.

546
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:56,420
Well…

547
00:45:56,503 --> 00:45:59,381
But you're not embarrassed, right?
I have a pretty face.

548
00:46:02,801 --> 00:46:04,052
What is it?

549
00:46:04,678 --> 00:46:06,930
Oh, right. Was that too blunt?

550
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:13,687
Why did you want to meet today?

551
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:15,939
To hang out.

552
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:19,193
I want us to be friends.

553
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:23,530
What do girls do for fun in Korea?

554
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:54,895
These look great. You should put them on.

555
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:57,231
-It's okay.
-Then I will.

556
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:01,318
That's so cute.

557
00:47:03,403 --> 00:47:07,115
I think a photo here will look great.

558
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:08,325
Come here.

559
00:47:08,408 --> 00:47:11,286
-I'm good.
-Come on.

560
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:13,163
Three, two, one.

561
00:47:14,748 --> 00:47:16,500
Three, two, one.

562
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:19,253
Three, two, one.

563
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:23,423
You're way in the back. Three, two, one.

564
00:47:26,593 --> 00:47:28,220
We look great, right?

565
00:47:31,848 --> 00:47:34,601
Three, two, one. Last one.

566
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:40,232
Cheers.

567
00:47:49,908 --> 00:47:51,410
This is so good.

568
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:54,663
What is it?

569
00:47:55,747 --> 00:47:58,500
I thought you needed to talk to me.

570
00:47:58,584 --> 00:48:00,711
Me? No.

571
00:48:01,795 --> 00:48:03,297
Am I supposed to say something?

572
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:05,215
Well,

573
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:08,510
I thought you wanted to talk about Su.

574
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:12,180
What is it? Did he do something wrong?

575
00:48:12,264 --> 00:48:14,766
My gosh.
Why does he always mess things up?

576
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:16,143
No, it's not that.

577
00:48:18,478 --> 00:48:20,647
How long have you been friends with Su?

578
00:48:23,025 --> 00:48:24,234
Before we were born?

579
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:28,030
Actually, no.
Ever since our dads were friends?

580
00:48:30,616 --> 00:48:32,034
I see.

581
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:36,747
Do you

582
00:48:39,374 --> 00:48:40,792
like Su by any chance?

583
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:49,009
I told you that I'm honest, right?

584
00:48:51,553 --> 00:48:54,473
If you're asking
if I have feelings for him,

585
00:48:55,515 --> 00:48:56,850
my answer is yes.

586
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:03,690
I'm just saying.

587
00:49:04,483 --> 00:49:06,693
It's not like I'm head over heels for him.

588
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:10,572
From time to time, I'm just confused
if I like him as a friend

589
00:49:11,156 --> 00:49:12,407
or a guy.

590
00:49:15,744 --> 00:49:17,329
Don't worry.

591
00:49:17,412 --> 00:49:19,956
I don't plan to hit on a man
who's already taken.

592
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:22,209
It wouldn't even work on him
even if I tried.

593
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:28,507
Was I rude?

594
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:30,801
No.

595
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:33,679
Right.

596
00:49:34,262 --> 00:49:38,684
What you said is rude,
but strangely, I'm not offended.

597
00:49:44,314 --> 00:49:45,273
What?

598
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:48,485
I'm just fascinated.

599
00:49:49,945 --> 00:49:52,864
It's fascinating to see Su
like someone so dearly.

600
00:49:53,448 --> 00:49:57,119
But I can understand why
because it's you. That's all.

601
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:03,417
You were the only girl
he ever talked about.

602
00:50:04,918 --> 00:50:07,546
I see. Okay.

603
00:50:10,048 --> 00:50:13,802
And photography is everything to him.

604
00:50:13,885 --> 00:50:16,221
But right now,
you're the most important to him.

605
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:19,099
Su will never leave you

606
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:22,394
even if he gets a great offer.

607
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:42,706
I'm back.

608
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:46,084
Mom.

609
00:50:46,168 --> 00:50:48,420
-Gosh.
-Mom, are you okay?

610
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:52,382
Oh, no. Are you okay?

611
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:56,470
Well, I felt so nauseous.

612
00:50:57,220 --> 00:51:00,474
I wanted to have some dongchimi.

613
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:03,894
Goodness, my hand…

614
00:51:04,811 --> 00:51:06,730
Why does my hand hurt so much?

615
00:51:08,356 --> 00:51:09,775
Goodness.

616
00:51:09,858 --> 00:51:12,611
You'll hurt yourself. Move back.

617
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:27,459
I don't have to distance myself.

618
00:51:29,711 --> 00:51:31,838
The only thing I can do now is
cause trouble.

619
00:51:34,174 --> 00:51:35,258
Please.

620
00:51:35,884 --> 00:51:37,219
As your mother,

621
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:41,389
I never did anything for you.

622
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:45,602
Now, I'm really useless.

623
00:51:46,186 --> 00:51:48,021
Mom, please.

624
00:51:51,066 --> 00:51:52,359
You will be

625
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:55,904
better off without me.

626
00:51:57,405 --> 00:51:59,407
I only make you cry.

627
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:09,167
I'm not crying.

628
00:53:01,469 --> 00:53:03,972
Why are you here? I told you not to come.

629
00:53:04,556 --> 00:53:05,807
I missed you.

630
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:08,226
I'll go home after buying these.

631
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:10,645
I can look at you while you're shopping.

632
00:53:28,413 --> 00:53:31,041
What about dinner? Did you eat?

633
00:53:32,292 --> 00:53:34,044
I don't have an appetite.

634
00:53:34,127 --> 00:53:36,087
No. You can't skip your meals.

635
00:53:37,255 --> 00:53:38,548
Let's go eat.

636
00:53:39,257 --> 00:53:40,842
I don't have an appetite.

637
00:53:40,926 --> 00:53:43,845
-Even so, you still need to eat.
-I don't want to. Why…

638
00:53:50,018 --> 00:53:51,102
Sorry.

639
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:01,529
Are you still mad at me?

640
00:54:02,447 --> 00:54:04,032
Or is it because you're exhausted?

641
00:54:06,284 --> 00:54:07,327
What's the difference?

642
00:54:08,161 --> 00:54:09,913
If it's the former, I'll apologize.

643
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:14,751
If it's the latter, I'll make you smile.

644
00:54:16,294 --> 00:54:17,921
Are you that dumb?

645
00:54:18,004 --> 00:54:20,966
If I'm dumb, how can I teach kids?
You dummy.

646
00:54:21,883 --> 00:54:25,428
-What?
-You smiled. You did, right?

647
00:54:25,512 --> 00:54:28,640
-No, I didn't.
-Come on. You did.

648
00:54:28,723 --> 00:54:31,434
-I didn't.
-You're smiling now. Look.

649
00:54:35,897 --> 00:54:37,983
I smiled for a bit that day.

650
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:40,944
So I decided to break up with him.

651
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:46,241
I realized that
Hyeon-jae has been loving me

652
00:54:46,324 --> 00:54:48,702
like a caregiver nursing his patient.

653
00:54:53,331 --> 00:54:57,085
Tomorrow is Saturday.
Do you want to go on a date?

654
00:54:57,168 --> 00:55:00,171
Sounds good.
Is there a place you want to go?

655
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:04,592
A place we don't usually go to.

656
00:55:05,593 --> 00:55:07,429
A place we'd go on a special occasion.

657
00:55:08,888 --> 00:55:11,516
Okay. I'll look up where we could go.

658
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:12,767
Okay.

659
00:55:34,247 --> 00:55:35,540
Hey, Yeong-hui.

660
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:40,962
I thought I was building blocks
with Hyeon-jae.

661
00:55:41,046 --> 00:55:42,547
But we were building dominoes.

662
00:55:43,923 --> 00:55:46,301
You play that game
to make them all collapse.

663
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:50,138
He and I have been playing it

664
00:55:51,139 --> 00:55:53,224
for too long when the results are obvious.

665
00:55:53,308 --> 00:55:55,143
Did something happen with Hyeon-jae?

666
00:55:57,562 --> 00:55:59,564
No, I'm the one with the problem.

667
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:01,900
I'm always the problem.

668
00:56:02,817 --> 00:56:05,320
Don't say stuff like that.
What's wrong with you?

669
00:56:08,656 --> 00:56:09,741
Me?

670
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:12,535
I'm a mess.

671
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:14,913
-Yeong-hui.
-Hyeon-jae

672
00:56:16,331 --> 00:56:18,500
wants to get married,

673
00:56:18,583 --> 00:56:21,503
but he is holding himself back
because of me.

674
00:56:23,463 --> 00:56:26,758
I made him wait way too long.

675
00:56:29,177 --> 00:56:33,431
What Hyeon-jae wants is to marry you.

676
00:56:34,307 --> 00:56:35,475
Because it's with you.

677
00:56:35,558 --> 00:56:37,727
Right. You're right.

678
00:56:38,978 --> 00:56:41,147
I made him that way.

679
00:56:41,731 --> 00:56:43,483
I made him only love me.

680
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:47,028
I made him fall in love with me,

681
00:56:47,112 --> 00:56:49,030
but I can't take responsibility for it.

682
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:53,201
I hate myself for it.

683
00:56:56,121 --> 00:56:59,165
The start of an unhappy relationship is
when only one side

684
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:01,334
makes sacrifices for the other.

685
00:57:02,919 --> 00:57:05,713
One side is unhappy
because they had to give up something,

686
00:57:06,297 --> 00:57:09,300
and the other is unhappy
because they feel sorry.

687
00:57:10,927 --> 00:57:12,762
How strange.

688
00:57:12,846 --> 00:57:15,431
He gave it up so we could be happy,

689
00:57:16,015 --> 00:57:18,351
but no one can be happy.

690
00:57:20,145 --> 00:57:21,855
And there's nothing left now.

691
00:57:23,982 --> 00:57:25,400
Only unhappiness remains.

692
00:57:57,348 --> 00:58:00,101
Is there a specific pair of shoes
you're looking for?

693
00:58:01,436 --> 00:58:04,272
It's for a guy in his late 20s.

694
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:08,067
He has to walk a long distance
for a long time.

695
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:10,195
Please show me
a comfortable pair of shoes.

696
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:22,123
Why did we get a divorce?

697
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:27,420
I'm not sure.

698
00:58:29,464 --> 00:58:30,465
When is the movie?

699
00:58:31,633 --> 00:58:32,717
At five.

700
00:58:33,885 --> 00:58:36,513
If you're done, should we get going?

701
00:58:37,555 --> 00:58:39,432
-Sure.
-Okay.

702
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:41,893
HAN THEATER

703
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:53,404
Do you want popcorn?

704
00:58:59,911 --> 00:59:01,204
What's wrong?

705
00:59:02,455 --> 00:59:04,791
It's this theater out of all theaters.

706
00:59:04,874 --> 00:59:06,751
We came here often when we were dating.

707
00:59:06,834 --> 00:59:08,878
You asked me why we got a divorce.

708
00:59:09,462 --> 00:59:10,380
What?

709
00:59:13,925 --> 00:59:15,134
Yes.

710
00:59:18,763 --> 00:59:20,807
I decided to divorce you here.

711
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:27,605
Are you okay?

712
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:30,567
Old lady, watch where you're going.

713
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:33,152
What did you say? It was her--

714
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:34,487
I'm sorry.

715
00:59:40,034 --> 00:59:41,202
Let's go.

716
00:59:43,162 --> 00:59:44,455
Why did you apologize?

717
00:59:45,331 --> 00:59:47,375
Why cause trouble? It's crowded here.

718
00:59:47,458 --> 00:59:49,919
If you don't want that,
why come here on a weekend?

719
00:59:50,003 --> 00:59:52,255
Can't you just let this go
on a day like today?

720
00:59:52,338 --> 00:59:53,840
It was hard getting out of work.

721
00:59:53,923 --> 00:59:56,509
I wanted to show you a movie
since you were looking down.

722
00:59:56,593 --> 00:59:58,845
Must I control my emotions
based on your schedule?

723
00:59:59,637 --> 01:00:01,431
Then let me know your schedule.

724
01:00:01,514 --> 01:00:03,850
When can I feel whatever I want?

725
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:07,729
But I doubt our schedules will sync.

726
01:00:07,812 --> 01:00:10,315
Do you think
I like burying myself in work?

727
01:00:11,357 --> 01:00:12,817
Did I ask you to do that?

728
01:00:13,484 --> 01:00:15,653
No one asked you to do that.

729
01:00:17,363 --> 01:00:18,823
Forget it.

730
01:00:18,906 --> 01:00:20,742
-Forget what?
-Let's just forget it.

731
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:27,165
Fine. Let's forget about everything.

732
01:00:29,792 --> 01:00:32,378
You promised me the world.

733
01:00:33,004 --> 01:00:35,048
But when you put me on the back burner,

734
01:00:35,715 --> 01:00:37,884
I was lonely and hurt.

735
01:00:38,718 --> 01:00:41,929
I couldn't handle the feeling
of our love fading away.

736
01:00:43,723 --> 01:00:45,558
That's why we got a divorce.

737
01:00:47,435 --> 01:00:49,228
It never faded away.

738
01:00:50,438 --> 01:00:52,940
It may be different for you,
but that's how I felt.

739
01:00:53,024 --> 01:00:55,693
Feelings are evaluated subjectively
based on the receiver.

740
01:00:57,695 --> 01:00:58,821
Won-jeong.

741
01:00:59,739 --> 01:01:03,785
It's been so long
since I heard you call my name like that.

742
01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:08,581
And I don't like Korean food or movies.

743
01:01:09,457 --> 01:01:11,417
But you used to like them.

744
01:01:12,794 --> 01:01:14,837
You definitely liked them.

745
01:01:14,921 --> 01:01:16,381
I liked you.

746
01:01:17,215 --> 01:01:19,967
I did things that you liked to do.

747
01:01:21,969 --> 01:01:25,181
When something breaks,
it can't be pieced together.

748
01:01:25,848 --> 01:01:27,558
I must have forgotten that again.

749
01:01:31,604 --> 01:01:33,272
I can't stay for the movie.

750
01:01:34,273 --> 01:01:36,943
Let's stay as friends like before.

751
01:01:38,611 --> 01:01:39,445
Bye.

752
01:02:03,803 --> 01:02:07,473
And photography is everything to him.

753
01:02:07,557 --> 01:02:10,143
But right now,
you're the most important to him.

754
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:12,812
Su will never leave you

755
01:02:13,771 --> 01:02:15,857
even if he gets a great offer.

756
01:02:17,316 --> 01:02:20,069
The start of an unhappy relationship is
when only one side

757
01:02:20,153 --> 01:02:22,238
makes sacrifices for the other.

758
01:02:23,865 --> 01:02:26,534
One side is unhappy
because they had to give up something,

759
01:02:27,285 --> 01:02:30,246
and the other is unhappy
because they feel sorry.

760
01:03:14,665 --> 01:03:17,919
Did you know that the Chinese
characters for turtle and burst

761
01:03:18,002 --> 01:03:19,921
are the same?

762
01:03:20,004 --> 01:03:22,632
Really? I didn't know.

763
01:03:23,966 --> 01:03:25,593
People only look at the scars.

764
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:29,514
They don't care about
how long turtles live

765
01:03:30,223 --> 01:03:32,308
or how fast they can swim in the water.

766
01:03:33,226 --> 01:03:35,436
They don't care about things like that.

767
01:03:36,270 --> 01:03:39,398
People only looked at the scars
on their shells.

768
01:03:55,081 --> 01:03:56,207
Yeong-hui.

769
01:04:00,503 --> 01:04:04,465
I was always poor and unfortunate.

770
01:04:04,549 --> 01:04:06,300
It'll be the same in the future.

771
01:04:08,427 --> 01:04:09,929
So

772
01:04:13,808 --> 01:04:15,685
get away from my unhappy life.

773
01:04:18,896 --> 01:04:19,939
What?

774
01:04:23,276 --> 01:04:24,569
Let's

775
01:04:29,198 --> 01:04:31,075
break up.

776
01:04:34,161 --> 01:04:36,622
There are all kinds of people
in the world.

777
01:04:37,665 --> 01:04:39,876
And they have their own method of love.

778
01:04:41,794 --> 01:04:43,462
Some people's love

779
01:04:44,463 --> 01:04:47,341
is so big that
they let go of their loved ones.

780
01:04:54,348 --> 01:04:55,808
Why didn't you tell me?

781
01:04:56,601 --> 01:04:57,435
Tell you what?

782
01:04:57,518 --> 01:04:59,478
An airline offered to sponsor you.

783
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:04,025
That's a good opportunity.

784
01:05:04,609 --> 01:05:05,776
How did you know?

785
01:05:07,445 --> 01:05:10,740
I saw the email
when I was here the other day.

786
01:05:10,823 --> 01:05:12,074
I see.

787
01:05:15,995 --> 01:05:18,247
I was going to ask you about that.

788
01:05:20,833 --> 01:05:22,168
You want to go?

789
01:05:23,669 --> 01:05:24,795
Yes.

790
01:05:28,591 --> 01:05:30,134
How long will it take?

791
01:05:30,217 --> 01:05:32,803
A year and a half to two years.

792
01:05:32,887 --> 01:05:34,513
As long as the military service.

793
01:05:37,725 --> 01:05:39,393
But do you still want to go?

794
01:05:42,647 --> 01:05:44,565
Yes. I do.

795
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:50,488
I tried to forget about the offer,
but I couldn't.

796
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:57,578
I know that I sound
very selfish right now.

797
01:06:01,165 --> 01:06:04,126
If you're okay, can you come with me?

798
01:06:06,754 --> 01:06:09,173
I want you to come with me, Woo-yeon.

799
01:06:32,697 --> 01:06:33,906
Yes.

800
01:06:36,826 --> 01:06:38,285
I want to go with you.

801
01:06:43,958 --> 01:06:45,918
And some people say that

802
01:06:47,378 --> 01:06:51,257
because they love each other so much,
they must hold onto each other.

803
01:06:53,092 --> 01:06:55,594
There are numerous methods of love
in this world.

804
01:06:56,971 --> 01:06:58,514
And none of them are wrong.

805
01:07:00,099 --> 01:07:01,767
Why did you change your mind?

806
01:07:02,643 --> 01:07:03,769
What do you mean?

807
01:07:04,895 --> 01:07:06,605
About Woo-yeon's boyfriend.

808
01:07:07,189 --> 01:07:09,358
I thought you would be
dead set against them.

809
01:07:09,442 --> 01:07:11,027
What made you change your mind?

810
01:07:11,819 --> 01:07:12,903
Just because.

811
01:07:14,572 --> 01:07:16,157
That's not a real answer.

812
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:19,744
What is it? Did he grow on you
when you had a drink with him?

813
01:07:20,828 --> 01:07:21,829
Just because.

814
01:07:22,913 --> 01:07:24,623
Woo-yeon likes him.

815
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:29,045
What else can I do? She likes him.
I'll let her have her way.

816
01:07:31,130 --> 01:07:33,257
That's all. That's what parents do.

817
01:07:36,844 --> 01:07:39,180
Even if there are all kinds of people
in the world

818
01:07:40,264 --> 01:07:42,516
and they all have
different methods of love,

819
01:07:43,601 --> 01:07:45,519
one thing never changes.

820
01:07:47,271 --> 01:07:49,148
Anyone who lets the other one

821
01:07:51,025 --> 01:07:53,277
have their way loves the other more.

822
01:08:15,925 --> 01:08:18,052
I'm planning to go on a trip.

823
01:08:18,135 --> 01:08:21,305
-Did he ask you to join him?
-It's not just because he asked me.

824
01:08:21,388 --> 01:08:24,225
I'm thinking of writing a travel essay
once I come back.

825
01:08:24,308 --> 01:08:26,602
-Let's meet them this weekend.
-Sure.

826
01:08:26,685 --> 01:08:28,229
I broke up with Hyeon-jae.

827
01:08:28,312 --> 01:08:30,397
Why did she break up with you?

828
01:08:30,481 --> 01:08:32,399
I don't know why we have to break up.

829
01:08:32,483 --> 01:08:35,236
I'll ask for the last time.
Do you still want to break up?

830
01:08:35,319 --> 01:08:37,196
Yes. I do.

831
01:08:38,197 --> 01:08:40,324
We don't have to be apart anymore.

832
01:08:40,407 --> 01:08:43,369
That's right. My mom told you
to come by 6 p.m. tomorrow.

833
01:08:43,452 --> 01:08:45,621
-Okay. I won't be late.
-What is this about?

834
01:08:45,704 --> 01:08:48,290
The main character
of the drama we're producing is…

835
01:08:48,374 --> 01:08:49,500
I'm not going.

836
01:08:50,376 --> 01:08:52,419
I can't go on the trip.

837
01:08:55,714 --> 01:09:00,719
