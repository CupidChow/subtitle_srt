1
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:49,716
Woo-yeon.

2
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:59,684
Say it, whether it's an excuse
or an explanation.

3
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:02,145
I'll believe what you say,
even if it's a lie.

4
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:04,481
You should've believed me
when you had the chance.

5
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:06,024
So I came out right away.

6
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:07,233
Can that

7
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:09,152
erase what you said?

8
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:11,196
And will that wipe away my feelings?

9
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:14,157
So let's talk.

10
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:17,285
-Let go of her.
-Stay out of it.

11
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:18,828
You have no right to stop me.

12
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:21,039
It's not about me. Woo-yeon said no.

13
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,545
You said that missed chances
turn into regret.

14
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:34,469
You can keep regretting.

15
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:48,900
What's your problem?
What do you want from me?

16
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:52,112
Confessing your feelings
carelessly can hurt people.

17
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:57,135
How long are you going to
keep following me?

18
00:02:57,927 --> 00:02:59,304
It's bothering me.

19
00:03:05,184 --> 00:03:06,644
That's what I want.

20
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:10,982
You won't be thinking about what he said,
at least while I'm on your mind.

21
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:16,321
Can't I take the chance he missed out on?

22
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:19,115
What do you want to do
with someone else's regret?

23
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:21,075
It was a chance when he had it.

24
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,744
But for you,

25
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:25,538
it's not.

26
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,251
I got excited for nothing.

27
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:33,630
I thought it was.

28
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:37,884
You should stop, too.

29
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:42,305
Stop coming to see me.

30
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,891
I don't know how to do that.

31
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:49,062
Our relationship started suddenly
and ended suddenly, too.

32
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:52,440
My feelings couldn't keep up
with the situation,

33
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,776
so give me some time.

34
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:02,158
The only thing I can do

35
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:06,871
is stand in front of you
like I'm being punished. Nothing else.

36
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:08,915
How could I ever punish you?

37
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:13,294
Is this like a punishment to you?

38
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:18,341
Kind of.

39
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:23,429
I'm the one being punished.

40
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:27,850
You should go inside now.

41
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:29,560
Bye.

42
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,003
-Why are you here?
-Hey.

43
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:59,549
How can that be the first thing
you ask your dad?

44
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:00,800
I don't want to see you.

45
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:04,137
That's heartbreaking.

46
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:07,640
Do you have some liquor?

47
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:13,730
This isn't a bar.

48
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:30,330
What happened with that girl?

49
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,377
I guess it didn't work out.

50
00:05:39,338 --> 00:05:41,966
What about you? What happened with Mom?

51
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,395
That guy wasn't her boyfriend.

52
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,564
They weren't on a date.

53
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:57,899
Are you talking to me?

54
00:05:57,982 --> 00:05:59,275
Who else, then?

55
00:05:59,358 --> 00:06:01,486
It sounded like
you were talking to yourself.

56
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:05,740
It sounds like
that's what you want to believe.

57
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:11,537
Believe her if that pleases you.

58
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:13,873
Do it if that's what you want.

59
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:16,793
Don't cause a misunderstanding
and torture yourself.

60
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:20,713
If you like her, listen to everything
she says to you.

61
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:22,465
Believe her, no matter what.

62
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:25,343
That way, you won't regret it later.

63
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:28,596
Do you regret it, Dad?

64
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:29,597
Well,

65
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,476
that's my thing.

66
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:36,896
Is that in my DNA?

67
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:49,617
Why are you here, kid?

68
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:52,662
-Shouldn't you be studying?
-Mind your business.

69
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:53,830
Are you my mom?

70
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:58,626
-Mom.
-You brat.

71
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:01,629
If I'm not here, she's your mom.

72
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:05,341
She's my sister. She's not my mom.

73
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:08,052
Besides, you're right here.

74
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:11,681
Goodness. Do you think
I'm immortal or something?

75
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:15,101
You guys might be growing,
but I'm getting old.

76
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:17,687
Right. You should get old, Mom.

77
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:20,356
I'd love to see you
turn into an old granny.

78
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:25,486
Cheol-su. Aren't your academy fees
due soon?

79
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,155
They haven't withdrawn the money.

80
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:29,157
They will.

81
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:31,284
Bye.

82
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:33,744
Okay. Study hard, my baby.

83
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:36,080
-Don't creep me out.
-Gosh.

84
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:37,874
-Brother.
-Brother. It's been a while.

85
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,668
-Where are you going?
-To study.

86
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:42,003
Okay. Wait.

87
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:47,800
I'm not a kid anymore. Bye.

88
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:49,427
That brat. Gosh.

89
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:51,429
He's all grown up now.

90
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:55,057
Have you been well, Mother?

91
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:57,894
Yes. It's nice to see my son-in-law.

92
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:01,647
We're not married yet, but you're
already treating him like we are.

93
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:03,191
I like it. Why?

94
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:06,986
Can you go and get something
to drink for Hyeon-jae?

95
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:08,196
It's all right.

96
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,658
I want iced Americano.

97
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,285
Sure. Okay.

98
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:18,414
Sit here.

99
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,714
Hyeon-jae.

100
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:28,925
Yes. I'm listening.

101
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:35,848
Isn't it hard?

102
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:40,394
They don't need me here
because they have caregivers.

103
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:43,189
I'm doing better than I expected.

104
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,829
I'm sorry for not being able to
take the burden off you.

105
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:01,666
I'm sorry that
my life is always so difficult.

106
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:03,626
Say something else than "sorry."

107
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:07,880
I love you.

108
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,261
I love you more.

109
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:23,354
I'm sorry that you're sick, my baby.
Poor thing.

110
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:27,608
I wish I could be sick in your place.

111
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:31,612
Gosh. Please get well soon, my princess.

112
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:35,116
-My heart is breaking.
-My mom

113
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,995
passed away when I was really young.

114
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:43,708
So I can only vaguely remember
how my mom looked.

115
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:47,128
But lately,

116
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:49,964
I've been missing my mom
when I can't even remember her face.

117
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:55,803
Come to think of it,

118
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:57,972
there are only a few moments

119
00:09:58,055 --> 00:09:59,890
when people miss their moms.

120
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,185
But at those moments,

121
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:06,230
they are so desperate to see their moms.

122
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:08,274
You're right.

123
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:11,819
Then I think about my kids.

124
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:15,031
I miss my mom so dearly when I can't even

125
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:17,700
remember her that well.

126
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:23,998
What about my daughter?

127
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,668
If she gets sick,

128
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:31,339
who will be there for her?

129
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:45,811
Gosh. No.

130
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:55,905
Woo-yeon, your replacement
will start tomorrow.

131
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:57,698
Train your replacement well.

132
00:10:57,782 --> 00:10:59,825
I hate myself for even thinking about it.

133
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:09,585
GYEONG WOO-YEON

134
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,512
Why is it so hard?

135
00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:40,908
Can we meet?

136
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:46,539
Why did you want to meet me
at a place like this?

137
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:49,041
If you didn't want to come, why did you?

138
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,003
To discuss something else.

139
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,928
I want Woo-yeon to be happy
more than anyone.

140
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:03,848
She can be with anyone for all I care,
as long as she's happy.

141
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:05,099
But

142
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:07,476
it can't be you.

143
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:10,729
You don't get to decide that.

144
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:13,691
You've already hurt her once.
You'll keep hurting her.

145
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,944
She will continue
to put up with the pain because

146
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:19,238
she'd get used to it.

147
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:24,034
What do you know about us?

148
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,204
I know the faces she makes
when you're involved.

149
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:29,665
I've seen
how sad she looked behind your back.

150
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,710
I've seen her in pain
when she turned away from you.

151
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:34,295
And I've seen

152
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:38,257
her hurt expression
when she waited for you despite all that.

153
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:42,720
So you can't be with her.

154
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:05,409
Where's Hyeon-jae? Did he leave?

155
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:07,244
Yes.

156
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:10,498
Hold onto him.

157
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:12,833
Don't let go of him.

158
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:14,585
He's a good guy.

159
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:16,629
I know that, too.

160
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:18,839
You should marry him, too.

161
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:23,135
I'll take care of things on my own.

162
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,056
You were

163
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:30,768
always good at taking care of yourself.

164
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:33,896
I haven't done anything for you.

165
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:38,943
I'll cut you some slack

166
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:41,529
for saying stuff like that
because you're sick.

167
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,991
I'm not being sarcastic.

168
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:48,994
I'm sorry

169
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:52,248
for making you fend for yourself…

170
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:55,084
and for leaving you alone.

171
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:01,924
Then get better soon.

172
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:05,135
Don't leave me alone anymore.

173
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:09,557
I'm going to sleep.

174
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:11,934
Go home.

175
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,126
It doesn't seem like

176
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,796
this misfortune will end anytime soon.

177
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:53,851
What's going on?
Why is everyone drinking alone today?

178
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:20,461
-Why are you sitting there?
-I sat at a different table on purpose.

179
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:21,795
Why? Will you kick me out?

180
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:24,548
Don't leave. Join me.

181
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:37,561
Whenever Woo-yeon and Jin-ju see me,
they tell me to get lost.

182
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:38,854
Why didn't you?

183
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,398
Do you think I let you join me
because I like you?

184
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:43,567
Objectively speaking,

185
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:46,445
I haven't done anything wrong
to you or Jin-ju.

186
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:48,155
We all saw

187
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:50,699
how she spent ten years of her life.

188
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:54,453
When you see someone in pain
for that long, it rubs off on you.

189
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:03,045
Then why did you ask me to sit here?
You already hate me.

190
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:06,465
Just because. I was happy to see you.

191
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:10,302
I don't feel welcomed,

192
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:11,637
but what do I know, right?

193
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:21,397
Gosh. You look like
your life is going to end.

194
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,233
Spit it out. When you keep sighing
like that, it's scarier.

195
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:28,487
You know Rapunzel, right?

196
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:30,990
Yes. The girl with long hair.

197
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:32,783
Guess where she lives.

198
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:35,369
A spire?

199
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:46,714
She doesn't have a rope or a staircase,

200
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:50,759
but she lives at the top of the spire
that has a window.

201
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:54,722
She can look out the window,
but she can't go down the spire.

202
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:56,890
She lives at the top of the spire.

203
00:16:57,933 --> 00:16:59,852
I feel just like her.

204
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:02,479
Why are you telling me this?

205
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:06,442
Because you'll leave.

206
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:10,029
I can be honest
with people who will leave.

207
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:12,573
You can't live there.

208
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:15,701
High-floor places are expensive.

209
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:17,411
You should live

210
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:19,955
somewhere around the 15th floor.

211
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:22,249
You punk. You're cute.

212
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:26,086
Don't like me. I'm Woo-yeon's.

213
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,922
Why would you say something
like that to me?

214
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:30,466
I'm telling everyone.

215
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:32,843
I say that to people when I can.

216
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:35,679
But I make time to say it to Woo-yeon.

217
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:40,601
Wait.

218
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:52,780
Give me your hand.

219
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:55,324
-No, it's fine.
-Take it.

220
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:58,160
-Come on, you don't have to.
-Take it with you.

221
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:07,628
Gosh, Yeong-hui.

222
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:13,175
What do you want to eat? More booze?

223
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:15,928
Put a box of soju under his tab.

224
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,516
-A box?
-Yes.

225
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:22,851
Here.

226
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:37,950
What is it?

227
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,996
I brought lunch.
Don't eat stuff like jjajangmyeon.

228
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,292
Why are you giving that to me?

229
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:49,211
Well, because…

230
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:55,759
I did say that
in a fit of temper that day,

231
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,428
but my feelings are real.

232
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:02,141
I like you.

233
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:05,310
You pity me, don't you?

234
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:08,438
You must feel bad for me
because of what happened

235
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:10,274
-with--
-No. I care about you.

236
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:12,484
I don't pity you. I like you.

237
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:18,198
I'm confessing my feelings to you.

238
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:20,409
I want you to date me.

239
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:25,622
Why would I do that?

240
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:27,166
I know.

241
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:31,461
I know that you didn't work this hard
to date someone like me.

242
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,882
You know,

243
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:39,636
I don't have to be who you end up with.

244
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:43,724
You can just pass through me.
Like a transfer station.

245
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:49,354
If you meet a nice guy, you can go to him.

246
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:53,859
I will let you go
and I won't hold you back.

247
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,739
What are you saying? You sound serious.

248
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:01,283
I am serious.

249
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:07,331
If you don't want to date me,

250
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:10,876
let me be your toy.

251
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:13,337
I will let you.

252
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:19,509
Don't answer that now. Think about
what I said seriously and answer me later.

253
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,430
Why would I take it seriously?

254
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:25,807
Look at my arms. I already got goosebumps.

255
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:28,143
-It's because you're cold.
-Can you see them?

256
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:30,854
Go inside and eat.

257
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:32,898
Bye.

258
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:36,568
Bring back the container later. Bye.

259
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:46,578
What was that?

260
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:03,428
PROSECUTOR HAN JIN-JU

261
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:15,899
If this was from another guy,
it would've melted my heart.

262
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:22,698
Coffee is on the right.

263
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:24,116
-Milk tea, on the left.
-Okay.

264
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:26,201
-Check the date for the receipt.
-Okay.

265
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:27,619
Hello.

266
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:37,087
Hi.

267
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:40,590
Eun-jo, fill the boxes
with tissue and straws.

268
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:41,800
Okay.

269
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:45,178
Okay.

270
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:51,643
Here's the coupon.
I had a justifiable excuse to come here.

271
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:52,853
I didn't say anything.

272
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:54,187
Iced Americano.

273
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:56,106
Please wait.

274
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:05,324
I came to apologize.

275
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:09,953
That's fine. I can understand
how it might have seemed that day.

276
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:12,247
I came here to apologize

277
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:16,168
for that day, the day before,
and all the days so far.

278
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:21,715
I didn't know that confessing my feelings
so carelessly would hurt your feelings.

279
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:25,635
I was angry when you were with him.

280
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:28,847
And I was hurt
when you said you didn't like me.

281
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:33,685
I apologize for only thinking
about my feelings and acting like a kid.

282
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:37,147
Did you get food poisoning?

283
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,566
I didn't eat anything.
Have a meal with me.

284
00:22:40,984 --> 00:22:43,111
-I'm working.
-I'll wait until you're done.

285
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:45,572
See you later, Woo-yeon.

286
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:55,499
Mr. On.

287
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:58,001
Sorry. No.

288
00:22:58,085 --> 00:22:59,753
I didn't even ask anything.

289
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:01,171
I can't drink with you.

290
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:03,423
Are you a psychic?

291
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:05,467
Stop being so predictive.

292
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,927
That's what I should say.

293
00:23:07,844 --> 00:23:09,930
I bet you're going
to Ms. Gyeong right now.

294
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:12,140
How long will you keep that up?

295
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:16,478
I don't know how long this will last
or what I should do.

296
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:19,481
So I'm trying to find a way.

297
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:21,233
There aren't any.

298
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:25,237
You're holding onto an ungrammatical
sentence. You ought to discard it.

299
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:29,366
Wrong grammar can be found in poems.

300
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:32,577
She hurt you. So be hurt.

301
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:35,372
If you keep pretending you're okay,

302
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:37,707
she's going to hurt you even more.

303
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:39,668
I'll still pretend that I'm okay.

304
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:40,919
It'll just destroy you.

305
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:45,006
Seriously. Why go this far for her?

306
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,592
I want to win her over,
but she won't let me.

307
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:49,052
It's better that you don't.

308
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,763
I don't want to see her get hurt.

309
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:54,224
Then don't look at her.

310
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:56,393
You're just a spectator.

311
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:10,282
Your hot Americano is ready.

312
00:24:29,342 --> 00:24:30,260
Darn it.

313
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:34,681
Are you okay?

314
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:43,565
Hey. Are you okay?

315
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:55,535
Hello.

316
00:24:57,245 --> 00:24:58,496
Is Ms. Gyeong out today?

317
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,790
She went to a hospital.

318
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:02,250
Hospital?

319
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:03,376
Is she sick? Or hurt?

320
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:06,796
She didn't get hurt. Her friend got hurt.

321
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:09,633
He was really handsome.

322
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:17,140
Will it leave a scar?

323
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:19,809
Take responsibility.

324
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:22,270
I'll pay your medical bills.

325
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:24,689
You're looking at me now that I'm hurt.

326
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:30,570
If it leaves a scar,
will you keep looking after me?

327
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,367
I'll get the IV out.

328
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,967
Try to keep it dry for now.

329
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:55,136
-Apply the ointment regularly.
-Okay.

330
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,763
You can go now.

331
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:01,059
Let's go.

332
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:09,276
-What are you doing?
-Hold my hand. I'm hurt.

333
00:26:29,462 --> 00:26:31,506
Are you crazy?
Why would put others before you like that?

334
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:34,301
What if something happens to you?
What if you get hurt?

335
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,725
Are you okay?

336
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:01,328
I couldn't find you at the cafe.

337
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:03,163
Stop going there.

338
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:06,458
I'm quitting soon.

339
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:09,419
Did you make up with him?

340
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:13,715
I heard what happened at the cafe.

341
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,760
I guess so.

342
00:27:18,636 --> 00:27:20,889
I guess he keeps getting new chances

343
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:22,515
even if he misses his chances.

344
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:25,268
I'm jealous of him.

345
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:28,104
I guess he does.

346
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:33,610
If there's nothing I can do,

347
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:36,154
should I really make you stand here?

348
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:41,951
I'm not the only one getting punished
if you do that.

349
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:44,329
You'll feel like
you're being punished, too.

350
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:46,915
Getting punished
sounds better than the alternative.

351
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:53,797
Why are you doing this to me?

352
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:58,426
Even if I combine all the wrong things
I've done to other men,

353
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:02,222
that doesn't measure up
to what I did to you.

354
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:04,349
But

355
00:28:05,308 --> 00:28:07,769
no matter how sorry I am,

356
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:11,272
that can't beat affection.

357
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:16,111
Even if he keeps throwing away
his chances or trampling on my heart,

358
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:21,032
I keep finding myself wanting
to give him more chances.

359
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:26,830
So please let me stop feeling sorry.

360
00:29:49,704 --> 00:29:50,789
You're here.

361
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:55,585
-The security cam girl?
-"Security cam"? Oh, yes.

362
00:29:56,252 --> 00:29:59,422
-I'll get going, then.
-Okay. Get home safely.

363
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:01,674
He's a rare species in this day and age.

364
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:03,551
He installed the security cam because

365
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:05,595
someone is scared
of going to the restroom.

366
00:30:05,678 --> 00:30:08,139
-Pardon?
-I was talking to myself.

367
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:13,144
-What was that about?
-Did you eat dinner?

368
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:16,689
-Is that the only thing you want to know?
-No.

369
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:18,817
Then, can I ask

370
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,777
-something I really want to know?
-No.

371
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:22,362
You got scared.

372
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:30,245
Hey. I'll be straight with you.

373
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:31,621
I don't want to date…

374
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:35,750
I'll be nothing but friends with you.

375
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:38,503
I'll go on blind dates.

376
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:40,672
I'll meet a really nice guy

377
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:42,966
and get my happily-ever-after.

378
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:46,553
Sure.

379
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:49,722
How can you accept that so quickly?

380
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:51,140
You said no. What can I do?

381
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:54,519
I'll do my best to win you over.

382
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:56,020
"Win me over"? What?

383
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:58,273
I'll win you over. Sit down.
Eat before you go.

384
00:30:58,356 --> 00:30:59,774
Stop telling me to eat!

385
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:01,276
Do you want tteokbokki?

386
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:13,746
LEE SU

387
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:16,332
Hello?

388
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:17,750
Woo-yeon.

389
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:20,295
What?

390
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:22,547
Are you sick?

391
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:32,181
I got worried and rushed here
because you sounded like you were dying.

392
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:33,641
How can you eat right now?

393
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:36,102
It's so good. You should eat some, too.

394
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:39,272
I'll shut my mouth since it was my fault.

395
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:43,318
Don't shut your mouth.
Have some of the meat.

396
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:51,951
You will only have a meal with me
when I'm injured.

397
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:56,539
It's our first private meal together
in Seoul.

398
00:31:58,541 --> 00:32:00,835
-Is it?
-It's good to be hurt.

399
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,587
I even get to eat with you.

400
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:10,720
-What?
-You suddenly feel unfamiliar.

401
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:12,680
What? Did I do something wrong?

402
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:14,432
That, too.

403
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:17,268
Call me if you need my help.

404
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:20,104
Don't fake being sick like earlier.

405
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:22,190
It scared me.

406
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:25,068
Really?

407
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:27,654
Yes. Really.

408
00:32:27,737 --> 00:32:28,780
You'll regret it.

409
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:37,956
LEE SU

410
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:39,916
Hello?

411
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:41,918
-Woo-yeon.
-Yes.

412
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:48,216
This has nothing to do
with your injured back.

413
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:52,679
I'm kind of shaken up right now.
So I'm scared of the dark.

414
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:05,483
LEE SU

415
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:10,822
-Hello?
-Woo-yeon.

416
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:16,285
Woo-yeon.

417
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:18,705
LEE SU

418
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:27,130
Woo-yeon.

419
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:32,301
Please! Stop calling me.

420
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:34,804
My goodness. Stop calling me, will you?

421
00:33:34,887 --> 00:33:36,723
You said to call you when I needed help.

422
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:38,891
In moderation. Okay?

423
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:41,185
Is torturing me your idea of fun?

424
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:44,355
If you date me, I won't.
I'm a perfect gentleman.

425
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:48,651
Let's go.

426
00:33:51,612 --> 00:33:53,197
What? It's not working.

427
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:55,992
Let's go.

428
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:07,211
Yes.

429
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:09,922
The fees for Kim Cheol-su
weren't withdrawn.

430
00:34:14,343 --> 00:34:15,511
He quit?

431
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:21,851
Is he out of his mind?

432
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:26,064
How can he be 20 minutes late
on a blind date?

433
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:32,528
Are you Han Jin-ju?

434
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:38,534
Yes.

435
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:48,336
I want water over here.

436
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,632
Why did you snap your fingers at her?

437
00:34:52,715 --> 00:34:55,468
Why not? I'm the customer.
"The customer is king," right?

438
00:34:59,847 --> 00:35:00,890
Please enjoy.

439
00:35:00,973 --> 00:35:04,060
Jin-ju, I guess
you enjoy being extravagant.

440
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:05,686
Pardon?

441
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:08,606
You drive an imported car.

442
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:11,692
-Yes.
-Imported cars are nice.

443
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:13,111
I like sports cars, too.

444
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:16,197
But given the initial purchase cost
and fuel efficiency,

445
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,949
it's actually a waste of money.

446
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,661
I have a lot of money.
Wasting money is my thing.

447
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:26,541
Well, you don't own the buildings.
Your parents do.

448
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:29,669
Prosecutors don't make that much money.

449
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:34,549
I'm sure I'm better off
than normal office workers.

450
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:42,140
I didn't expect you to be the type
to trample on men's pride.

451
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:48,104
You're not eating much.

452
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:50,523
Are you acting coy?

453
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:59,240
I like women who can eat well.

454
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:03,119
I can't eat. I have anorexia.

455
00:36:03,953 --> 00:36:06,205
Then have some lassi.

456
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:09,417
The lassi here is really good.

457
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:15,464
Darned lassi.

458
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:19,844
Lassi.

459
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:28,769
You're not well. Why are you cooking?

460
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:30,813
Settling my regrets.

461
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:37,236
Go sit down. It won't take long.

462
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:39,322
Okay.

463
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:47,371
Spare some time for me tomorrow.
Let's go somewhere.

464
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:48,623
Okay.

465
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:53,836
You take photos of people now.

466
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:58,382
Yes. I think I'll take
more photos of people from now on.

467
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:01,761
Are you going on another trip?

468
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:05,765
I should. Traveling is my job.

469
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:17,109
Right. That's your job.

470
00:37:28,287 --> 00:37:30,998
Ta-da. Lots of seafood
and lots of chili peppers.

471
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:33,209
And the noodles are al dente.

472
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:38,589
You don't know how upset I was
when you left like that the other day.

473
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:45,388
What is it again? What did I do wrong?

474
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,642
Nothing.

475
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:56,274
Whenever you look at me like that,
my heart pounds from anxiety

476
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:58,276
because you might leave again.

477
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:02,321
I hope it doesn't leave a scar.

478
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:06,075
Why? Are you scared
I'll use that to keep you with me?

479
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:09,412
If it does, I would feel really bad
for your future girlfriends.

480
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:11,497
Hey, Woo-yeon.

481
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:17,878
No woman would love a man who will leave.

482
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,424
Your dream is so far away.

483
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:24,385
If you want a woman
who will wait for you like a lighthouse,

484
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:26,512
it won't be me.

485
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:31,475
The 18-year-old who said yes to the long
distance and the 12-hour time difference

486
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:34,270
and who could wait
for the rest of her life

487
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:37,106
is not here anymore.

488
00:38:49,785 --> 00:38:52,788
Why did you insist on getting in my car?

489
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:54,749
You paid for the meal.

490
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:58,210
So I wanted to keep you company.
I'm trying to be considerate.

491
00:38:58,919 --> 00:39:00,296
You're way too considerate.

492
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:04,216
By the way, this is a nice car.
It must be because it's imported.

493
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,593
And it's automatic, too.

494
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:08,637
Should I kill him?

495
00:39:14,935 --> 00:39:16,354
I'll wash the dishes.

496
00:39:18,397 --> 00:39:19,482
I'll do it.

497
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:21,692
No. I'll do it.

498
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:23,944
I didn't invite you here
to make you do that.

499
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:29,617
Can you do something else for me?
Buy me milk tea.

500
00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:32,119
Okay.

501
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:41,462
Jin-ju.

502
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:42,797
What?

503
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:46,884
I need to use the toilet.

504
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:49,220
Now?

505
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:51,597
We're in a traffic jam.

506
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,974
I don't think I can stop it.

507
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:55,893
Stop it! Stop it no matter what!

508
00:39:55,976 --> 00:39:59,522
I think I'm going to die right now.

509
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:01,524
You drank every drop of that darned lassi.

510
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:04,443
-You have to hold it.
-Gosh, no. I can't.

511
00:40:45,484 --> 00:40:47,820
Hello. What would you like?

512
00:40:47,903 --> 00:40:50,030
Two cups of black sugar bubble milk tea.

513
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:51,407
-Please wait.
-Okay.

514
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:55,661
Please shake it 15 times
before putting the straws in.

515
00:40:55,744 --> 00:40:56,954
Thank you.

516
00:40:57,663 --> 00:40:59,248
Enjoy your drinks.

517
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:31,906
-What took you so long?
-It's nothing.

518
00:41:49,715 --> 00:41:51,592
What? What is it?

519
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:54,220
-Take it off.
-What?

520
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:56,722
-Take it off.
-What? What are you doing?

521
00:41:58,098 --> 00:41:59,099
Come to your senses.

522
00:42:10,152 --> 00:42:13,906
If it hurt, you should have asked me
to leave or apply the ointment on it.

523
00:42:13,989 --> 00:42:15,366
Why didn't you say anything?

524
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:18,452
I didn't want you to leave.

525
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:21,288
But you'd feel bad if you saw my back.

526
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:24,750
Are you dumb?

527
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:29,672
I feel like my IQ level is dropping
whenever I see you these days.

528
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:34,218
You keep saying stuff like that.

529
00:42:34,843 --> 00:42:38,514
But no matter how hard I try,
you always shut me out.

530
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:44,478
Hey, you smiled. You did, didn't you?

531
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:46,647
Don't move.

532
00:42:48,315 --> 00:42:49,441
Hey, be careful.

533
00:42:59,201 --> 00:43:01,620
I know. The back of my head
is handsome, too.

534
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:11,380
-The person you have reached…
-That jerk ran away!

535
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:41,619
What is it?

536
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:46,332
What are you doing?

537
00:43:49,501 --> 00:43:51,754
You quit the academy
to get a part-time job?

538
00:43:51,837 --> 00:43:54,673
Yes. I want to make money.
I'll make a lot of money.

539
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:56,592
I didn't ask you to make money.

540
00:43:56,675 --> 00:43:59,219
I'll give you more money if you want.
You must study.

541
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:02,222
Are you my mom?

542
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:04,850
Why are you giving me an allowance?

543
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:07,102
You act more like my mom than my real mom.

544
00:44:07,186 --> 00:44:10,064
Come on. Stop trying to do everything.
Just get married.

545
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:11,315
I'll take care of Mom.

546
00:44:11,398 --> 00:44:13,525
You think you can do that
by flipping burgers?

547
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:16,195
I'm not getting married, so--

548
00:44:16,278 --> 00:44:19,531
Go get married. Why wouldn't you?
I know you want to.

549
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:26,163
If you grow old alone because of us,

550
00:44:26,246 --> 00:44:28,040
would that make us happy?

551
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:30,501
Darn it.

552
00:44:33,462 --> 00:44:34,672
Hey, Cheol-su.

553
00:44:37,716 --> 00:44:40,928
Not you, too. Why are you…

554
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:05,327
What is it?

555
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:07,329
-What?
-What?

556
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:10,499
I came out because I was feeling down.
You two seem sad, too.

557
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:13,293
-Why are you down?
-It's probably because of Su.

558
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:15,671
I'm so sick of him.

559
00:45:17,673 --> 00:45:19,007
Not as much as I am.

560
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:23,762
What about you?

561
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,473
Cheol-su is all grown up now.

562
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:27,850
What's wrong with that?

563
00:45:27,933 --> 00:45:29,852
It just is.

564
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:36,275
-What about your blind date?
-What? You went on a blind date?

565
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:40,028
The blind date.

566
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:42,698
What a lunatic.

567
00:45:42,781 --> 00:45:45,284
How could he poop in your car?

568
00:45:45,367 --> 00:45:49,788
How can he poop in your car and run away?

569
00:45:49,872 --> 00:45:51,290
It's unbelievable, right?

570
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:53,667
I can't believe it happened, either.

571
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:57,171
You should go see a shaman.
You really must be cursed with something.

572
00:45:57,254 --> 00:45:58,672
That's beyond crazy.

573
00:45:59,298 --> 00:46:01,508
You're okay, right?

574
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:05,387
Is it okay for me to whine today?

575
00:46:05,471 --> 00:46:07,431
Why worry about me?

576
00:46:07,514 --> 00:46:11,435
You have the right to complain
even if the sky crumbles down today.

577
00:46:11,518 --> 00:46:12,728
Yes.

578
00:46:12,811 --> 00:46:14,688
I'm not thrilled to have that right.

579
00:46:16,064 --> 00:46:19,234
People say that
our lives are like stories.

580
00:46:19,776 --> 00:46:21,278
But if this were a story,

581
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:24,072
I'd love to kill the writer.

582
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:27,993
Right. Does the writer have some kind
of grudge against one-sided love?

583
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:32,372
Gosh. Why is dating so hard?

584
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:36,460
The writer must be a pervert. How can
I go on a date with a runaway pooper?

585
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,004
Gosh.

586
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:41,673
I didn't want to have the worst sob story.

587
00:46:46,053 --> 00:46:47,304
What about your car?

588
00:46:47,387 --> 00:46:49,515
Right. Did you clean that up by yourself?

589
00:46:51,099 --> 00:46:53,268
I left my car at an auto shop.

590
00:46:55,437 --> 00:46:56,730
What did Su say to you?

591
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:02,945
He didn't tell me anything.

592
00:47:05,405 --> 00:47:06,698
It's not the full story.

593
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:09,493
-Yes, it is.
-Yes, it is.

594
00:47:11,537 --> 00:47:12,621
I was right.

595
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:32,099
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

596
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:35,227
Do you have six-packs? I heard
I need to drink a pack a day.

597
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:36,645
Okay. Hold on.

598
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:48,240
Jin-ju!

599
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:55,372
Are you okay?

600
00:47:56,957 --> 00:48:00,544
My goodness. It's all right. It's okay.

601
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:03,964
I wiped the car seat the best I could,

602
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:06,633
but it seemed impossible,
so I sent it to an auto shop.

603
00:48:07,884 --> 00:48:10,387
Ms. Prosecutor, you can pick it up
in about two days.

604
00:48:11,471 --> 00:48:14,725
You look even uglier after crying.

605
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:19,563
Why are you so nice to me?

606
00:48:20,439 --> 00:48:21,732
Nonsense.

607
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:25,193
I haven't even been that nice yet.

608
00:48:25,277 --> 00:48:28,864
You'll be so impressed
once I start being really nice to you.

609
00:48:30,824 --> 00:48:31,825
I'll buy you a meal.

610
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:35,287
I don't want a meal.

611
00:48:38,832 --> 00:48:39,916
Let's watch a movie.

612
00:48:41,043 --> 00:48:42,377
A movie?

613
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:45,756
Watching movies is more like a date.

614
00:48:57,267 --> 00:48:58,602
Did you drink a lot?

615
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:01,021
Yes. A bit.

616
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:04,816
Come on.

617
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:08,820
Stop trying to do everything.
Just get married. I'll take care of Mom.

618
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:11,990
I thought he wouldn't trouble me
once he grew up.

619
00:49:14,743 --> 00:49:16,453
But he's breaking my heart.

620
00:49:32,552 --> 00:49:35,138
Woo-yeon, what if I don't leave?

621
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:39,393
-What?
-If I don't have to travel,

622
00:49:40,268 --> 00:49:41,353
will you love me?

623
00:49:47,693 --> 00:49:49,611
You'll give up your dream for me?

624
00:49:56,618 --> 00:49:57,994
Answer me.

625
00:49:58,912 --> 00:50:01,873
Then I'll start considering that option
with all my heart.

626
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:20,434
Your back was injured, not your hands.

627
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:21,685
Why am I driving?

628
00:50:22,602 --> 00:50:24,104
I hurt my hand a long time ago.

629
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:26,857
Gosh. I always get hurt
whenever I'm with you.

630
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:29,151
Why aren't you hurting your mouth?

631
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:32,070
If my lips bleed,

632
00:50:32,154 --> 00:50:33,947
you'll be so surprised because

633
00:50:34,614 --> 00:50:36,324
they will look ridiculously kissable.

634
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:40,912
Seriously. Where do you learn those lines?

635
00:50:40,996 --> 00:50:42,497
I was born with this skill.

636
00:50:42,581 --> 00:50:43,832
So where are we going?

637
00:50:44,416 --> 00:50:46,501
Turn left 300m ahead.

638
00:50:46,585 --> 00:50:47,961
Follow the GPS instructions.

639
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:12,778
Where am I?

640
00:51:12,861 --> 00:51:13,987
In my heart.

641
00:51:14,946 --> 00:51:16,615
But I'm in Jumunjin now.

642
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:18,241
Hey.

643
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:24,706
My gosh. I'm so pissed right now.
You're infuriating!

644
00:51:25,707 --> 00:51:28,210
Drink this. Water will help.

645
00:51:33,882 --> 00:51:36,092
Welcome to my day, Woo-yeon.

646
00:51:39,304 --> 00:51:40,388
Ma'am.

647
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:45,185
-You really came.
-Have you been well?

648
00:51:46,478 --> 00:51:48,688
-Hello.
-Is that your wife?

649
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:51,399
No. Not yet, at least.

650
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:53,527
Let's go in.

651
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:06,331
You came all the way here to give me this?

652
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:08,792
Thank you.

653
00:52:08,875 --> 00:52:10,126
I promised.

654
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:17,092
But where is your husband?

655
00:52:17,592 --> 00:52:19,761
Oh, him. He's not here.

656
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:27,477
I see.

657
00:52:44,077 --> 00:52:45,871
You're back from the community center?

658
00:52:45,954 --> 00:52:47,622
It's time for my meal, so I'm here.

659
00:52:47,706 --> 00:52:49,708
Hey. Nice to see you again.

660
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:09,978
That was unexpected.

661
00:53:11,146 --> 00:53:13,523
You came all the way here
just to give her a photo.

662
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:16,735
I always keep my promises.

663
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:21,156
By the way, how did you get to know them?

664
00:53:23,491 --> 00:53:24,993
I told you I went on a trip.

665
00:53:26,661 --> 00:53:28,079
I came here.

666
00:53:29,998 --> 00:53:34,044
And I saw an old couple,
holding each other's hands.

667
00:53:36,171 --> 00:53:37,714
I took a photo of them.

668
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:39,841
That's how.

669
00:53:42,135 --> 00:53:43,553
Why did you take their photo?

670
00:53:44,846 --> 00:53:47,223
If there's a happy ending,
they would be it.

671
00:53:49,517 --> 00:53:52,604
At the end of a fairytale,
it says, "the end" on the last page.

672
00:53:54,439 --> 00:53:56,191
I had a feeling the page after that

673
00:53:57,275 --> 00:53:58,652
would look like that.

674
00:54:04,491 --> 00:54:07,953
What a surprise.
I thought you were a cynic.

675
00:54:09,871 --> 00:54:13,291
People often assume that because
I have a cold and handsome face.

676
00:54:52,706 --> 00:54:53,623
Woo-yeon.

677
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:03,049
Can I keep surprising you
and keep being unfamiliar to you?

678
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:06,469
I will make you forget all the pain
I gave you

679
00:55:06,553 --> 00:55:09,097
by acting unexpectedly
and being unfamiliar to you.

680
00:55:13,059 --> 00:55:15,353
I was going to decide
once you gave me your answer,

681
00:55:15,895 --> 00:55:18,982
but I kept thinking about you,
so I didn't have to think anymore.

682
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,653
If you don't want me to go, I won't.
I won't go anywhere.

683
00:55:26,906 --> 00:55:28,950
I've made my decision.

684
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:44,758
-I--
-Wait. Don't say it.

685
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:48,053
Think about it first.

686
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:57,062
I'm not ready yet.

687
00:55:57,937 --> 00:55:59,189
I can't take another hit.

688
00:56:00,815 --> 00:56:02,984
Let's go. I'll drive.

689
00:56:04,903 --> 00:56:06,071
What?

690
00:56:07,155 --> 00:56:09,532
If he's deciding everything himself,
why am I here?

691
00:56:11,117 --> 00:56:14,204
Hey, we need to stop by a gas station.
We're running low on gas.

692
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:26,758
The surgery went well.

693
00:56:28,134 --> 00:56:29,511
Thank you.

694
00:56:39,354 --> 00:56:40,647
Are you okay?

695
00:56:41,272 --> 00:56:42,857
Yes, I'm okay.

696
00:56:46,653 --> 00:56:49,447
Mom, are you awake?

697
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:53,660
Mother. Can you recognize me?

698
00:56:54,786 --> 00:56:58,164
The anesthesia hasn't worn off completely.
She might not recognize you yet.

699
00:57:31,239 --> 00:57:32,323
What are you doing?

700
00:57:33,575 --> 00:57:35,285
-We ran out of gas.
-What?

701
00:57:36,828 --> 00:57:38,413
What should we do?

702
00:57:38,496 --> 00:57:39,998
I can call my insurance company.

703
00:57:40,081 --> 00:57:42,292
I told you to fill the gas tank earlier.

704
00:57:43,209 --> 00:57:44,043
I forgot.

705
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:01,019
Incidents seem to follow us
whenever I'm with you.

706
00:58:04,397 --> 00:58:05,857
-What?
-Come out.

707
00:58:30,215 --> 00:58:31,424
What are you doing?

708
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:33,593
You should sit, too.

709
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:35,803
Why would I?

710
00:58:37,055 --> 00:58:39,098
Look at the stars.
There are so many of them.

711
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:42,268
I don't have time to stargaze.

712
00:58:44,854 --> 00:58:46,022
What's wrong with you?

713
00:58:56,783 --> 00:58:58,868
Gosh. That's so beautiful.

714
00:59:00,954 --> 00:59:02,747
Seriously. You're so simple.

715
00:59:08,586 --> 00:59:09,796
All right.

716
00:59:23,601 --> 00:59:24,978
What? Did you set this up?

717
00:59:25,061 --> 00:59:27,021
I did. I prepared lots of stuff.

718
00:59:39,117 --> 00:59:40,410
This is nice.

719
00:59:54,841 --> 00:59:56,593
Why are you staring at me?

720
00:59:57,802 --> 01:00:01,222
Come to think of it, you and I
have known each other for so long.

721
01:00:01,889 --> 01:00:03,433
But I don't know much about you.

722
01:00:05,852 --> 01:00:09,355
Technically speaking, we haven't known
each other for a long time.

723
01:00:09,439 --> 01:00:11,524
We just met each other a long time ago.

724
01:00:12,233 --> 01:00:15,903
The time we were away from each other
was longer than the time we were together.

725
01:00:19,907 --> 01:00:23,661
Tell me about you.
I want to know your story.

726
01:00:26,414 --> 01:00:28,291
When did you start doing calligraphy?

727
01:00:29,292 --> 01:00:32,295
I remember you working at a company
the last time we met.

728
01:00:33,921 --> 01:00:35,089
Three years ago.

729
01:00:35,673 --> 01:00:37,258
I quit the company two years ago.

730
01:00:38,259 --> 01:00:39,552
Why did you quit?

731
01:00:41,346 --> 01:00:44,474
Among those things, the only things
that you can choose for yourself

732
01:00:44,557 --> 01:00:46,851
are your occupation and your spouse.

733
01:00:46,934 --> 01:00:49,771
Isn't it too sad to not be able to
choose those two?

734
01:00:52,148 --> 01:00:53,608
So I wouldn't be too sad.

735
01:00:55,068 --> 01:00:56,486
What do you like to eat?

736
01:00:59,739 --> 01:01:02,408
I like everything. I eat everything.

737
01:01:03,868 --> 01:01:04,994
Your favorite singer?

738
01:01:24,138 --> 01:01:25,473
Urban Zakapa.

739
01:01:25,556 --> 01:01:27,850
What? Me, too.

740
01:01:34,857 --> 01:01:36,818
Your favorite movie.

741
01:01:39,946 --> 01:01:41,239
A Moment to Remember.

742
01:01:42,448 --> 01:01:47,286
In life, farewells don't come
at the right time in the right place.

743
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:50,540
-Your favorite indie band?
-We are bound to face an end.

744
01:01:51,124 --> 01:01:54,794
And all we can do is
to just stand in front of it.

745
01:01:56,546 --> 01:01:57,672
Hyeon-jae.

746
01:02:00,133 --> 01:02:01,300
Yes?

747
01:02:01,884 --> 01:02:03,469
You want to get married, right?

748
01:02:10,852 --> 01:02:12,353
Should we break up?

749
01:02:21,696 --> 01:02:22,905
Either in pain

750
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:28,369
or in happiness.

751
01:02:32,331 --> 01:02:33,708
Come to think of it,

752
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:37,503
thanks to you,
I learned what I liked, what I hated,

753
01:02:38,588 --> 01:02:41,174
when to muster up my courage,
and when to stop.

754
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,636
I must have liked you a lot.

755
01:02:53,227 --> 01:02:54,437
Or do I still like you?

756
01:03:23,257 --> 01:03:24,383
Me, too.

757
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:27,637
I like you a lot.

758
01:03:30,139 --> 01:03:31,182
Woo-yeon.

759
01:03:41,776 --> 01:03:43,653
Please tell me my one-sided love is over.

760
01:03:48,783 --> 01:03:51,911
I don't have to wait anymore, right?

761
01:03:56,290 --> 01:03:59,293
I don't need your answer.
I'm done waiting.

762
01:04:38,624 --> 01:04:41,127
Finally, my curse…

763
01:04:41,210 --> 01:04:42,962
Finally, my one-sided love…

764
01:04:48,968 --> 01:04:50,136
-…is over.
-…is over.

765
01:05:51,113 --> 01:05:52,448
I'm Woo-yeon's boyfriend now.

766
01:05:53,032 --> 01:05:54,367
We're dating now.

767
01:05:54,450 --> 01:05:55,952
Woo-yeon.

768
01:05:56,035 --> 01:05:57,244
What was that?

769
01:05:57,328 --> 01:05:58,704
What should we do tomorrow?

770
01:05:58,788 --> 01:06:00,373
I'll be with you the whole day.

771
01:06:00,456 --> 01:06:02,750
-You're weird.
-Why?

772
01:06:02,833 --> 01:06:05,044
You're not the Su I know.

773
01:06:05,127 --> 01:06:07,296
Forget about him. He's dead.

774
01:06:08,506 --> 01:06:10,800
I want you to know
what it means to be loved.

775
01:06:10,883 --> 01:06:12,635
I don't want you to get hurt.

776
01:06:13,302 --> 01:06:16,389
See? I don't want you to get hurt.

777
01:06:16,472 --> 01:06:17,682
Gosh.

778
01:06:17,765 --> 01:06:19,016
I don't know why.

779
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:20,267
Did she get sick of you?

780
01:06:20,351 --> 01:06:22,228
-Did she say she loves you?
-I love you.

781
01:06:22,728 --> 01:06:25,481
She says she can't say "I love you"
when she doesn't mean it.

782
01:06:26,273 --> 01:06:29,860
Woo-yeon, why won't you say
that you love me?

783
01:06:32,613 --> 01:06:37,618
