1
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:52,218
Once upon a time in a far away kingdom,

2
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:55,305
a princess was born
and a witch put a curse on her.

3
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:59,976
She was to prick her finger on a spinning
wheel and die on her 16th birthday.

4
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:03,021
With the help of a good fairy,

5
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:06,566
she was able to avoid death
and sleep for a long time instead.

6
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:10,278
And a prince's kiss broke the curse.

7
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:13,698
-They lived…
-"They lived happily ever after. The end."

8
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:17,202
-Woo-yeon, let's go to sleep now. Okay?
-What about the witch?

9
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:19,287
What happened to the witch?

10
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:23,333
I'm not sure. I guess she was punished.

11
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:24,542
She was a nasty witch.

12
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:27,462
Let's go to sleep.

13
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:37,347
If the witch was punished
like my mom said, maybe that curse

14
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:40,141
made its way back to the witch.

15
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:50,527
If so, now that the curse is broken,

16
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:53,530
where did

17
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:56,074
my old curse go?

18
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:41,870
Gyeong Woo-yeon. You're not
still waiting for me, are you?

19
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:44,956
I told you. I have plans.

20
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:49,210
I'm sorry. I'm with Mr. On now.

21
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:59,846
I like you. I like you very much

22
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:01,139
and I've

23
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,350
liked you for a long time.

24
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:07,103
I'm sorry. I just see you as my friend.

25
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:09,647
So… Don't say things

26
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:11,274
like that.

27
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:12,984
You rejected me. Twice.

28
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:16,487
I don't even like you. Am I supposed
to say okay and start dating you?

29
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,418
Hey, stop that.

30
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:32,670
Did you hurt your head or something?

31
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:34,672
My gosh. I'm the crazy one.

32
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:36,841
I shouldn't have

33
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:38,718
let you drink. You were in an accident.

34
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:41,429
-Give it back.
-Let's go back to the hospital.

35
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:44,307
The doctor scolded me
when you left the hospital.

36
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,017
Give it back. Come on.

37
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:49,812
No. I do respect people's choices,

38
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,981
but your judgment is clouded now.

39
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,483
Come on. Let's go back.

40
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:56,527
Hey, are you okay?

41
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:03,117
Just leave me alone.

42
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:04,452
Okay, dude.

43
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:11,167
By the way, did you cry?

44
00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:15,213
Fine. Okay.
I'll pretend I didn't see that.

45
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:17,924
You're a man. Don't cry.

46
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:23,930
I'm about to lose it,

47
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:26,975
so just let me be.

48
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:32,355
I'm sorry about today.

49
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,942
I don't want your thanks or apologies.

50
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:37,151
I want your affection.

51
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:39,404
Can you do that for me?

52
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:48,955
Happy birthday.

53
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:52,709
You're not even mad,
and you got me a present.

54
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:55,962
You really are strange.

55
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:58,673
I will keep giving you presents

56
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:00,216
like a total weirdo.

57
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:04,679
Go home. It's getting late.

58
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:06,764
Okay.

59
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:50,058
Wear them when you come to me.

60
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:53,853
P.S. For your information, these shoes
are only good for a one-way trip.

61
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:06,365
Woo-yeon, what happened?

62
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:08,826
Hey, I told you to leave her alone.

63
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,328
But I'm dying to find out.

64
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:12,622
BUT I'M DYING TO FIND OUT

65
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:16,125
I'm dating Mr. On.

66
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:17,960
GROUP CALL: YEONG-HUI, JIN-JU

67
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:22,298
What? That was fast.

68
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:24,383
Hey, have you finally come to your senses?

69
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:26,844
-What? Don't say it like--
-Yes, she has.

70
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:29,222
Looks like she got herself a keeper.

71
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:30,598
What are you talking about?

72
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:33,893
Enough about that. I need you
to tell us exactly what happened.

73
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:36,395
My deduction was wrong
despite my superb intelligence.

74
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,315
I'm humiliated and happy at the same time.
Spill the beans now.

75
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:44,487
He asked you out, but he stood you up?

76
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:46,322
And on your birthday?

77
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:50,076
-That asshole.
-He stood you up over "nothing"?

78
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:53,079
I held onto him
when it was never going to happen.

79
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:57,041
-Seriously.
-By the way, you went to see Su.

80
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:59,669
But how did you end up with Mr. On?

81
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:02,004
I said no to Mr. On and went to see Su.

82
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:04,924
I went even when he asked me to stay.

83
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,927
But he was waiting for me at my house.

84
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,304
Gosh.

85
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:14,600
-Goodness.
-At that moment, this crossed my mind.

86
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:19,605
"Right. Dating him is the right decision.

87
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:21,941
That's the right thing to do."

88
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:25,403
My gosh. It's like a scene from a drama.

89
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:28,865
Relationships are like that.

90
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:32,368
It only takes a second
for the relationships to blossom and end.

91
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,828
It's like an umbrella.

92
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:36,038
My gosh. It sounds like a famous line.

93
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,165
-Right?
-Yes.

94
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:40,626
My gosh. I'm the only one
feeling lonely right now.

95
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,212
What was that?

96
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:46,234
I miss her like crazy.

97
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,590
You pulled the ligament
in your left wrist.

98
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:11,968
Try not to use your left hand for now.

99
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,719
Stay away from drinking and smoking.

100
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:17,932
If you don't treat this properly,
you'll experience sequelae.

101
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:20,101
You should take good care of
your wrist now.

102
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:40,079
I hope you guys all remember

103
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:43,374
that today is
the first anniversary of Tonight.

104
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:46,627
You guys better rush to Tonight
after work.

105
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:48,254
I should go. Of course.

106
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:50,673
It's against the law
to skip drinking nights.

107
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:53,009
I'm not going.

108
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:57,847
Okay.

109
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,891
I won't go.

110
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:08,566
TONIGHT

111
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,126
Why won't you let me win?

112
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:29,378
It's not about winning or losing.

113
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:36,302
I do anything you want me to do
and listen to everything you say.

114
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:38,095
So I was happy when I let you win.

115
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:40,806
I'm not going to ask you a thing
as long as you're happy.

116
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:42,850
I'll play dumb

117
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:45,227
and keep smiling like a fool
in front of you.

118
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:49,273
But you're unhappy.

119
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:52,318
So I can't let you win.

120
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:55,946
I'm not asking you to tell me
about every minute of your life,

121
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,157
and I won't tell you what to do, either.

122
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:01,369
I just want you

123
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:04,580
to rely on me.

124
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:08,834
Please let me do that for you.

125
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:13,547
My burden will be heavier

126
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:17,176
than you think.

127
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,597
I will be stronger than you think.

128
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:36,654
I love you.

129
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:39,698
I love you, too.

130
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:43,452
Oh, my. Looking good.

131
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:49,250
I thought you had a fight.
What's up with this lovey-dovey scene?

132
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:52,420
Want to see something better?

133
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:57,383
Do you want an encore?

134
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:02,513
Come on.

135
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,807
I want every couple to disappear.

136
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:13,357
Why are you here?

137
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:22,491
Hi. I thought you weren't coming.

138
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:25,911
I didn't have anything else to do.

139
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,956
By the way, where's Woo-yeon?

140
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:03,073
I'm Woo-yeon's boyfriend.

141
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:08,787
-My gosh. Hello.
-Take a seat.

142
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:21,383
Why did he come tonight?
How dare he show up here today?

143
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,761
Bring me a hammer.
I can't let this slide tonight.

144
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:25,930
There's no need.

145
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:28,182
To be honest, he didn't do anything wrong.

146
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:29,558
Are you still on his side?

147
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:31,519
I'm not even mad.

148
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:34,855
I guess I'm really over him.

149
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:40,152
Woo-yeon,
you've finally come to your senses!

150
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:44,156
-I'm going to use the toilet.
-Okay.

151
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,789
"CEO On Jun-su."

152
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:54,333
My gosh. I didn't know you were a CEO.

153
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:56,710
Sorry to be so blunt.
Can I call you Jun-su?

154
00:13:57,461 --> 00:13:58,837
Sure.

155
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:00,923
Jun-su, let me pour you a drink.

156
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:02,341
Sorry. I drove here.

157
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:05,678
I see. Jun-su, do you want
some soda instead?

158
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:06,845
Hey.

159
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,306
You just met him. He's not your friend.

160
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:12,810
Don't you know that anyone
who's handsome and rich is my friend?

161
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:14,228
So you can just butt out.

162
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:18,148
How did you end up seeing Gyeong Woo-yeon?

163
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:20,484
It's not too late.
Make a run for it when you can.

164
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:21,777
What's so awful about her?

165
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,697
Why are you getting worked up
about Woo-yeon?

166
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:29,451
I wasn't.

167
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:32,246
I like Woo-yeon a lot.

168
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:35,624
She deserves to be loved.

169
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:38,168
It's like a line from a drama.

170
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:42,673
My gosh. I just got the chills.

171
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:44,717
Can I get napkins?

172
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:49,847
What happened to your hand?

173
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:52,766
-It's nothing.
-Did you hurt your hand that day?

174
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:53,893
When?

175
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,644
He got hit by a car at Namsan Tower.

176
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:58,314
He passed out
and was hospitalized for an hour.

177
00:14:58,397 --> 00:14:59,815
But as soon as he woke up,

178
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,443
he pulled out the IV needle
and rushed out.

179
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:04,612
He looked like the main actor
in some drama.

180
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:08,198
Can't you stay?

181
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:09,575
I'm really sorry.

182
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:33,682
Okay. I'll buy it.

183
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:34,850
-Really?
-Yes.

184
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,611
How did you know, by the way?

185
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:48,072
How did you talk to him?

186
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:50,824
By the way, why do women
go to the restroom together?

187
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:54,328
Well, it gets scary and lonely.

188
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:57,039
Anyway, there's a world

189
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:59,625
-of women men don't know about.
-This is good. Try it.

190
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:02,044
-Thank you.
-Oh, my. Prosecutor Han, you're 28.

191
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:05,714
Are you scared of going
to the restroom alone? Oh, dear.

192
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:09,635
Sang-hyeok, what did I say?

193
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:13,847
I advised you to only use
your mouth for eating, didn't I?

194
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:17,017
Chew it well for a long time,
so you never open your mouth again.

195
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:22,231
You guys are all very close.

196
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:24,566
It's nice.

197
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,443
We've been friends since high school.

198
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:28,904
How should I put it? High school friends

199
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,656
are special, you know.

200
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:33,450
Time isn't something you can ignore.

201
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:37,287
Right.

202
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:41,041
But it's really useless
when one does nothing with it.

203
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:01,478
Thank you.

204
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,403
One more, please.

205
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:15,075
-Jjae-jae, when you didn't call me.
-Woo-yeon.

206
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:17,077
-I was upset.
-I want you to be happy now.

207
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:19,830
Okay. Thank you.

208
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:23,834
Me too. When I couldn't see you, Yeong,

209
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:25,461
there were tears in my eyes.

210
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:29,256
-Will you do that again?
-No way.

211
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:31,008
-You bad boy.
-Bad boy!

212
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:39,391
They are Jjae-jae and Yeong.

213
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:42,561
They take over when they start drinking.

214
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,900
I don't know them.

215
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:53,655
Is that so? Someone I know turns into
a different person when she drinks.

216
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:58,202
I guess she won't be here tonight.
I kind of miss her.

217
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:01,330
She'll be history to you now.

218
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:05,584
She died. I let her go a while ago.

219
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:07,628
Gosh, no.

220
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:10,756
She's the woman I fell for.

221
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:17,054
MOMMY

222
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:18,555
Excuse me.

223
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:28,524
Mom.

224
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:32,528
I didn't drink a lot.

225
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:37,366
You'll kill me if I crawl home,
totally wasted like last time?

226
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:40,410
Okay. Of course.
You raised me to walk on my two feet.

227
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:45,082
Okay. I'll be home soon.

228
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:47,793
Okay.

229
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:01,098
-You're still here.
-I couldn't go

230
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:04,518
-because of this.
-What's that?

231
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,942
Happy birthday, Woo-yeon.

232
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:16,822
I'm sorry it's too late.

233
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:18,824
It's been only two days.

234
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:20,576
Those two days were really long.

235
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:24,371
You seem different today.

236
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:26,790
Is it because of your new haircut?

237
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,084
So you did notice.

238
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:33,255
What happened to your hand?

239
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:39,344
-It's nothing.
-You always say that.

240
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:42,806
That's what you say about everything.

241
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:46,894
We can't even be friends now.

242
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:48,562
What?

243
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:51,064
You said staying friends
with someone you liked

244
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:52,733
is rude when you're dating someone.

245
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:56,778
Right.

246
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:59,281
If it's uncomfortable for you,
we can work separately.

247
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:00,657
We're almost done anyway.

248
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,455
I want to do well with this project.

249
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:08,749
And I have to.

250
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,710
Because your boyfriend is publishing it?

251
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:14,171
Yes.

252
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:19,593
That kind of misunderstanding
will always follow me.

253
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:22,638
I want to show people, not make excuses.

254
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:25,807
I don't want to be humiliated.

255
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:29,978
So we should keep working together.

256
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:33,649
You stopped me.

257
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:34,983
What?

258
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:38,487
Yes, I stopped you.

259
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:42,699
And I let you stop me.

260
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:44,117
Okay.

261
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:48,538
But can you still take photos?
You hurt your hand.

262
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:50,666
I'll rest for a while.

263
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:53,710
Call me when your hand heals.

264
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:57,631
I'll get going.

265
00:20:57,714 --> 00:20:58,799
Okay.

266
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:19,444
Are you done?

267
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:21,571
Yes.

268
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:25,575
Let's go back in.

269
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:47,222
My friends are a handful, right?

270
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:51,893
But they are perfectly normal at work.

271
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,228
Since we're old friends,

272
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,647
we're all close to each other.

273
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:59,026
Does that apply to Mr. Lee as well?

274
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:04,364
You've been friends for long, too.

275
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:08,660
You know…

276
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:17,127
They say love is all about timing.

277
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:21,965
Do you know why people say that?

278
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,305
I'm sorry.

279
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:40,942
Bye.

280
00:22:41,943 --> 00:22:42,944
Okay.

281
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:46,823
Hye-won.

282
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:51,036
Yes?

283
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:55,123
-I…
-I like you.

284
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:00,420
I like you very much

285
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:06,426
and I've liked you for a long time.

286
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,970
I'm sorry. I just see you as my friend.

287
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:12,974
Jun-su.

288
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:14,518
Yes?

289
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:16,645
Do you want to say something?

290
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:22,275
Stay safe.

291
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:25,654
Is that all?

292
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:28,698
Stay healthy.

293
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:31,159
Bye.

294
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:39,626
Only those who are brave
can get the timing right.

295
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:44,464
If one misses all the chances they had,

296
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:47,592
and didn't fix things,

297
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:49,970
it means

298
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:53,515
your feelings for her
weren't strong enough.

299
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:56,143
Why did you suddenly say that?

300
00:23:59,187 --> 00:24:00,188
No reason.

301
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:03,024
I just felt like saying it.

302
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:18,498
How could you stay the same
for over ten years? My love. Good boy.

303
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:20,041
I improved.

304
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:24,546
But how did Su hurt his wrist?

305
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:28,008
Oh, that. He was in a car accident
last Saturday at Namsan Tower.

306
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:29,593
What?

307
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,096
What's wrong?

308
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:35,640
It's nothing.

309
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:38,143
Gosh, what is it?

310
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:40,228
Did something happen?

311
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:42,022
No. It's nothing.

312
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:47,861
Yeong-hui, tell me.

313
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:50,697
-Please tell me.
-It's not about me.

314
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,199
It's not?

315
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:54,910
Then, what is it about?

316
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:00,373
The thing is…

317
00:25:00,957 --> 00:25:01,917
What?

318
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:05,754
How come they never catch a break?

319
00:25:08,506 --> 00:25:10,717
Then, should we tell her?

320
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,552
Why? Don't tell her.

321
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:14,221
Didn't you see Su?

322
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:16,014
He's gotten so haggard.

323
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:20,685
Whether he looks haggard
or ruins his life,

324
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:22,395
don't interfere.

325
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:26,066
You sound harsh again.

326
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:27,943
Su isn't just some stranger.

327
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:30,237
Yes, he is.

328
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:32,447
Woo-yeon is my friend.

329
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:37,869
I want Woo-yeon to stop
falling for the wrong guy.

330
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:42,624
That CEO seemed like a nice guy.

331
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:46,127
And Woo-yeon finally moved on.
I don't want to confuse her.

332
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:49,798
I don't know.

333
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,469
To me, Woo-yeon is more important

334
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:56,179
than Su.

335
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:03,895
He should've given me this sooner
if he had it.

336
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:07,482
He made me wait for a long time.

337
00:26:14,197 --> 00:26:16,950
LEE SU

338
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:19,369
Hello?

339
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:22,330
Gyeong Woo-yeon. You're not
still waiting for me, are you?

340
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:26,209
-What?
-Something came up, so I couldn't make it.

341
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:29,337
-So I was wondering if you…
-I told you.

342
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,549
I have plans.

343
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:34,050
You didn't come?

344
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:35,635
No.

345
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:39,055
But why?

346
00:26:40,598 --> 00:26:42,350
Why did you not come?

347
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:43,685
It's nothing.

348
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:49,524
Hello?

349
00:26:50,525 --> 00:26:51,568
Woo-yeon.

350
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:57,032
So it's nothing.

351
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:02,162
I'm sorry. I'm with Mr. On now.

352
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:28,313
CALLIGRAPHY CONTEST
A CHANGE OF SEASONS THAT YEAR

353
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:56,257
A CHANGE OF SEASONS THAT YEAR

354
00:28:24,702 --> 00:28:25,787
You look pretty.

355
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:30,291
Yes.

356
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:06,161
I'm working right now.

357
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:07,245
Aren't you tired?

358
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:10,540
I'm all right. I can't fall asleep anyway.

359
00:29:10,623 --> 00:29:13,251
Should I come over if you can't sleep?

360
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:15,670
No. You'll be tired.

361
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:17,922
I guess you don't want to see me.

362
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,049
But I do.

363
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:24,596
I want to see you, too.

364
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:28,224
I'll be there in a jiffy.
I have my car keys.

365
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,269
No. It's all right.

366
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:33,480
Come on. I'm a good driver.
It won't take long.

367
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:34,647
Really?

368
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:37,442
Okay.

369
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:45,909
-It's nice.
-Which one do you like? Me or this?

370
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:47,410
I like you more.

371
00:29:48,411 --> 00:29:50,121
We should eat this.

372
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:51,122
Hold on.

373
00:29:56,669 --> 00:29:59,130
CONGRATULATIONS ON WINNING
THE CALLIGRAPHY CONTEST

374
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:01,174
Look at this.

375
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:03,676
Congratulations.

376
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:07,388
Gosh, well done.

377
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:46,219
Hello.

378
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:48,680
Doors are closing.

379
00:30:48,763 --> 00:30:50,723
You still got your head up your ass.

380
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:54,018
If you violate parole,
you'll face time in prison.

381
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:55,895
You know that, right?

382
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:58,857
Is he the suspect in the car robbery?

383
00:30:59,732 --> 00:31:01,276
Yes.

384
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:03,319
Did you not even read the Bible?

385
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:05,530
"Thou shalt not covet."
Don't you know that?

386
00:31:13,454 --> 00:31:14,581
Jin-ju.

387
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:18,793
THE HOLY BIBLE

388
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:37,812
How could my secret first love

389
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:39,647
be a criminal?

390
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:42,233
Come on.

391
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:03,421
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

392
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,591
I'm sorry. I didn't see the light.

393
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:08,551
My gosh. Oh, no.

394
00:32:13,556 --> 00:32:14,933
Here.

395
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:24,734
Why did you jump in front of my car?

396
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:28,529
Thank you. And I'm sorry.

397
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:30,782
What?

398
00:32:32,408 --> 00:32:33,326
I know you.

399
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:36,079
Pardon?

400
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:39,582
You don't recognize me.

401
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:42,168
Well,

402
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:49,258
I don't have my name cards.
Can you give me your cell phone?

403
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:58,559
This is my number. Call me after
you get a full checkup at the hospital.

404
00:33:00,603 --> 00:33:02,271
I'll make sure to call you.

405
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:04,691
I'm in a hurry. Bye, then.

406
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:30,758
Why is he smiling from ear to ear?
How much does he want?

407
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:39,142
It's Tuesday. Can we take photos there?
It might take long.

408
00:33:39,225 --> 00:33:41,269
It's the school's anniversary.
It's closed.

409
00:33:42,228 --> 00:33:43,187
Nice.

410
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:47,775
How's your hand? Is it better?

411
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:49,527
Oh, this? It's nothing.

412
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:52,155
That again. You always say that.

413
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:58,327
Actually, you're right. It's something.
Our schedule was delayed because of it.

414
00:33:58,953 --> 00:34:00,955
Seriously.
You should've been more careful.

415
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:04,459
I'm glad, though.

416
00:34:08,963 --> 00:34:11,591
I'm glad I got to stay longer
since I rarely come to Seoul.

417
00:34:20,808 --> 00:34:22,852
What? It's raining.

418
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:24,353
Yes, it is.

419
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:38,451
Oh, no. We can't take photos in the rain.

420
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:46,000
Let's wait it out in a cafe.
It might stop.

421
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:47,919
Okay.

422
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:53,466
Hold this for me.

423
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:24,789
I don't think it'll stop anytime soon.

424
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:26,541
Let's wait a bit more.

425
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:29,502
Okay.

426
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:48,604
I don't think we can take photos today.
Let's go.

427
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:52,400
-Woo-yeon.
-Yes?

428
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:57,947
Can you teach me calligraphy?

429
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,493
All right.

430
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:06,539
So rude guys like you

431
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:10,793
should make the letters
look sharp and pointed like this.

432
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:13,504
SU

433
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:16,382
Ta-da. Doesn't this look like you?

434
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:18,301
You'll never get it, will you?

435
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,553
I'm not rude.

436
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:23,139
I'm just a cold-looking handsome guy.

437
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:27,268
By the way,

438
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:31,272
aren't you embarrassed
saying that about yourself?

439
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:35,109
-That's why I ask first.
-Ask who?

440
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:40,448
Mirror, mirror, on the wall, who's the
most beautiful person in the world?

441
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:43,201
Then, the mirror answers. It's me.

442
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:47,622
Look. Do you see this line?

443
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:51,334
-Are you ignoring me?
-It was a waste of my time.

444
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:53,794
All right. Focus.

445
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:59,008
Write along this line. Like this.

446
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,887
Press down on the parts
you want to emphasize. Watch.

447
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:09,310
What do you think?

448
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:13,689
-Beautiful.
-Right? Isn't it beautiful?

449
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:15,024
Here. You can try.

450
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:35,253
-Watch me.
-Okay.

451
00:37:37,129 --> 00:37:38,089
All done.

452
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:39,924
Ta-da.

453
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:41,384
IN MULLAE-DONG WITH WOO-YEON

454
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:43,678
"In Mullae-dong with Woo-yeon"?

455
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:44,845
What is this?

456
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:48,099
I just wanted to make a souvenir.

457
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:52,061
-For what?
-I'm on a trip here.

458
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:55,439
I need a souvenir from my trip.

459
00:37:57,149 --> 00:37:58,401
Are you leaving again?

460
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:01,529
Our project is almost done.

461
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:05,408
I should go back.

462
00:38:05,491 --> 00:38:07,660
Leaving places is my job.

463
00:38:09,328 --> 00:38:11,664
-To where?
-Anywhere.

464
00:38:11,747 --> 00:38:14,000
I don't have a reason
to stay here anymore.

465
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,670
I see.

466
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:28,264
Who is it?

467
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:31,309
Hello?

468
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:33,060
Is this Ms. Gyeong Woo-yeon?

469
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:36,522
Yes. This is she. Who is this?

470
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:39,317
Hi. This is Choi Jeong-hyeon
from the film studio, Wind.

471
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:41,694
The film studio?

472
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:50,494
-I'm Choi Jeong-hyeon.
-I'm Gyeong Woo-yeon.

473
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:57,251
I loved your calligraphy
from that competition.

474
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:59,879
-Congratulations on the award.
-Thank you.

475
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:01,756
As you briefly heard on the phone,

476
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:06,052
I would like you to do calligraphy
for a movie we're producing now.

477
00:39:07,386 --> 00:39:08,971
What kind of movie is it?

478
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:10,514
It's called The Dollhouse.

479
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:13,309
A doll, possessed by an evil spirit,
curses people.

480
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:16,771
It's a horror movie?

481
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:19,732
Yes. Here, this is the scenario.

482
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,652
THE DOLLHOUSE

483
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:28,866
I hope you don't have a problem
watching horror movies.

484
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:30,451
Oh, no. Never.

485
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:32,495
I'm a fan of horror movies.

486
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:37,375
I like that.
I look forward to working with you.

487
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:39,335
Likewise.

488
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:55,893
Gyeong Woo-yeon.

489
00:40:00,272 --> 00:40:01,232
You're still here?

490
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:03,901
I thought it wouldn't take long.
Where are you going?

491
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:05,736
I'm going to see Mr. On.

492
00:40:06,695 --> 00:40:08,656
I see. Get in. I'll drive you.

493
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,492
-It's okay.
-It's raining.

494
00:40:33,305 --> 00:40:35,558
METAPHOR PUBLISHING HOUSE

495
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:49,697
Let's go.

496
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:52,450
Okay.

497
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:03,002
Thank you.

498
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:42,583
I come bearing tteokbokki.

499
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:47,421
You didn't call. What's up?

500
00:41:59,725 --> 00:42:00,809
Why aren't you eating?

501
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:05,523
Actually, I can't eat spicy food.

502
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:07,107
Oh, no. You should've told me.

503
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:11,111
It's okay.
I feel full just by watching you eat.

504
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:18,702
My girlfriend is so cool. She'll do
calligraphy for a movie title.

505
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,957
How should we celebrate this?
What do you want?

506
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:27,253
I don't need a present.
You recently bought me a pair of shoes.

507
00:42:27,336 --> 00:42:29,672
I get the feeling
you don't like the shoes.

508
00:42:30,422 --> 00:42:32,967
-You've never worn them.
-It's not that.

509
00:42:34,176 --> 00:42:36,762
They are too pretty.
I want to save them for later.

510
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:39,181
There's no need to do that.

511
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:42,851
If you need anything, I'll give it to you.

512
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:47,064
I'm not the frugal type, you know.

513
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:52,069
But you're not generous
with your feelings.

514
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,115
Visit me often like today.

515
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,846
I have a day off in two days.
What about you?

516
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:20,472
I have a photoshoot.

517
00:43:22,516 --> 00:43:24,643
Let's go and see a movie after that.

518
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:26,687
I won movie tickets from the contest.

519
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:32,192
I can't believe this. How can
a cool girl like you be my girlfriend?

520
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:38,032
You're not shy with your punch.

521
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:41,201
I wasn't joking.

522
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:45,998
-I'm sorry.
-I was kidding.

523
00:43:46,081 --> 00:43:48,292
-Eat up.
-Okay.

524
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:01,764
Gosh. Come on, are you kidding me?
It stopped raining now.

525
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:18,572
-Gosh, I said I want backbone stew.
-I'm holding a knife, you know.

526
00:44:22,242 --> 00:44:24,995
By the way, why do you always
bring me to these restaurants?

527
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:27,081
I don't want you to feel flustered later.

528
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:29,667
When you're with your college friends

529
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:31,877
or on a date with your girlfriend,

530
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,837
you shouldn't look confused.

531
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:37,341
I don't want you
to be nervous or intimidated.

532
00:44:39,968 --> 00:44:42,346
So be thankful and eat up
when I'm treating you.

533
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:45,265
You always show off
about paying for things.

534
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:47,601
How dare you?

535
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,729
I'm not a kid anymore.

536
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:54,108
Don't act all tough. You're still a baby.

537
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:55,401
I'm all grown up now.

538
00:44:56,068 --> 00:44:57,903
You did enough for me. You can stop.

539
00:45:01,407 --> 00:45:02,950
You can just live your life.

540
00:45:09,081 --> 00:45:11,708
I'm 12 years older than you, brat.

541
00:45:12,292 --> 00:45:13,127
Eat up.

542
00:46:02,885 --> 00:46:04,219
THE DOLLHOUSE

543
00:46:07,389 --> 00:46:10,350
Gosh, it's so hard
to make money these days.

544
00:46:37,544 --> 00:46:38,879
Damn it.

545
00:46:40,172 --> 00:46:44,968
Make me peaceful like the river

546
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:46,762
Make me

547
00:46:46,845 --> 00:46:47,679
Oh, no!

548
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:54,186
Even when we have to fight the demons
Brothers whose sins have been cleansed

549
00:46:54,269 --> 00:46:58,732
Will bravely fight the demons

550
00:47:02,694 --> 00:47:04,863
-Who's getting married?
-Ms. Kim.

551
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:08,116
My older sister is getting married soon.

552
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:10,202
With her long-term boyfriend?

553
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:14,414
With another guy.

554
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:17,251
Her ex-boyfriend
didn't want to get married.

555
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:22,339
He wasn't cool. If he didn't believe
in marriage, he should've told her.

556
00:47:23,048 --> 00:47:25,175
My sister cluelessly kept waiting for him.

557
00:47:46,905 --> 00:47:49,199
Sillim. This is Sillim Station.

558
00:47:49,783 --> 00:47:52,035
The doors are on your left.

559
00:48:11,346 --> 00:48:15,851
Hey, I'm really sorry.
I was on time when I left home.

560
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:18,437
But I fell asleep, so I missed my stop.

561
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:21,273
I'm really sorry. Are you mad?

562
00:48:22,107 --> 00:48:23,692
-Why would I be mad?
-What?

563
00:48:24,818 --> 00:48:27,446
I'm 30 minutes late.

564
00:48:27,529 --> 00:48:28,905
It's okay. It happens.

565
00:48:30,365 --> 00:48:34,661
Hey. You should just yell at me.
You're scaring me.

566
00:48:36,121 --> 00:48:38,665
I'm not mad. How can I be mad at you?
Should I fake it?

567
00:48:39,791 --> 00:48:41,752
Won't your feet hurt?
You're wearing heels.

568
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:44,921
They aren't high heels. I'll be okay.
I have a date later.

569
00:48:45,005 --> 00:48:47,382
Mr. On gave them to me.
I want him to see me in them.

570
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:51,386
Did you not think
that I would be waiting for you?

571
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:53,889
Why were you late?
You were 30 minutes late.

572
00:48:54,848 --> 00:48:58,060
Hey. Are you faking your anger now?

573
00:48:58,143 --> 00:48:59,561
Yes. Anger is just flooding in.

574
00:49:01,938 --> 00:49:04,900
That jerk. He really should see a doctor.

575
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:07,653
He's got so much anger inside.

576
00:50:14,177 --> 00:50:16,263
Damn it. That scared the hell out of me.

577
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:20,308
I'm sorry.

578
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:24,354
Why are you so jumpy?

579
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:27,941
See how you feel
after being haunted by a ghost all night.

580
00:50:28,024 --> 00:50:29,609
Did you befriend a ghost?

581
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:30,819
I'm about to.

582
00:50:31,903 --> 00:50:33,739
I'm working on the movie title

583
00:50:33,822 --> 00:50:36,867
of a horror movie about a doll
possessed by an evil spirit.

584
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:39,411
I get scared really easily.

585
00:50:42,038 --> 00:50:44,249
-Is this funny?
-Yes, it is.

586
00:50:44,332 --> 00:50:46,334
Gosh. You're so mean.

587
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:13,695
Once.

588
00:51:19,034 --> 00:51:20,410
What did you say?

589
00:51:21,369 --> 00:51:22,621
Nothing.

590
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:45,352
Sir.

591
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:49,314
Thank you for letting me
install the CCTV camera.

592
00:51:49,397 --> 00:51:53,527
You said you would pay for everything.
I have no reason to stop you.

593
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:55,403
But why all of a sudden?

594
00:51:57,739 --> 00:52:00,617
Someone told me
it's scary to go to the restroom here.

595
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:01,952
Your girlfriend?

596
00:52:02,035 --> 00:52:03,453
No, just a friend.

597
00:52:03,537 --> 00:52:05,455
Is it a girl?

598
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:07,165
-Yes.
-So it is your girlfriend.

599
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:09,543
No. She's just a friend.

600
00:52:15,882 --> 00:52:17,467
Here's your taro milk tea.

601
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:22,180
I guess you like taro milk tea.

602
00:52:22,264 --> 00:52:23,890
Yes. Well…

603
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:27,310
It's you. The car accident.

604
00:52:27,394 --> 00:52:29,062
I guess you can remember me today.

605
00:52:29,145 --> 00:52:31,565
I see. You're a part-timer here.

606
00:52:32,315 --> 00:52:33,650
Did you go to the hospital?

607
00:52:33,733 --> 00:52:36,778
I really didn't get hurt that day.
Your car didn't even hit me.

608
00:52:36,862 --> 00:52:40,365
Even so, go to the hospital
and call me later.

609
00:52:40,448 --> 00:52:41,616
Should I not call you

610
00:52:43,118 --> 00:52:44,369
if I don't get a checkup?

611
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:46,454
Pardon?

612
00:52:46,538 --> 00:52:49,457
I'll call you after the checkup.
I promise.

613
00:52:59,384 --> 00:53:03,013
Cafes these days have to
work so hard to win over customers.

614
00:53:03,096 --> 00:53:05,599
It's so hard to make money these days.

615
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:48,934
Where did you go?

616
00:53:54,814 --> 00:53:56,483
-What are you doing?
-Don't move.

617
00:53:58,735 --> 00:54:00,946
Gosh. You got a blister.

618
00:54:01,029 --> 00:54:01,988
This must hurt.

619
00:54:11,998 --> 00:54:13,541
-I can--
-I'll do it.

620
00:54:18,463 --> 00:54:20,840
You fool. Why didn't you tell me?

621
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:23,927
I didn't want to distract you.

622
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:27,389
It's nice to go on dates
and to wear pretty shoes.

623
00:54:28,139 --> 00:54:29,891
But you should wear comfortable shoes.

624
00:54:37,315 --> 00:54:40,318
I'm sure he wouldn't want you
to be in pain, either.

625
00:55:27,282 --> 00:55:28,616
Why is your heart beating?

626
00:55:29,534 --> 00:55:30,660
My heart?

627
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:33,663
Do you

628
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:39,169
have a cardiovascular disorder?

629
00:55:39,252 --> 00:55:40,712
What?

630
00:55:40,795 --> 00:55:43,590
Yes. It's… You know…

631
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:45,008
It's hereditary.

632
00:55:45,759 --> 00:55:48,386
You have a weak heart and a weak back.

633
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:50,096
You're weak from head to toe.

634
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:51,347
What? Weak?

635
00:55:51,431 --> 00:55:54,350
Hey, I'm totally healthy.

636
00:55:54,434 --> 00:55:57,729
You didn't have to defend yourself.
Don't. It makes me feel sad.

637
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:05,195
Why didn't your heart beat for me
when it can pound like that?

638
00:56:11,618 --> 00:56:14,579
Then, what about yours?
Why is your heart so calm?

639
00:56:17,957 --> 00:56:20,335
Is it good?
Should we go and have ice cream?

640
00:56:44,943 --> 00:56:46,486
-Honey.
-Yes?

641
00:56:47,695 --> 00:56:49,364
I can't get married right now.

642
00:56:50,532 --> 00:56:51,825
Because of money?

643
00:56:51,908 --> 00:56:54,077
Right. I don't have enough money.

644
00:56:56,121 --> 00:56:57,455
Is that the only problem?

645
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:01,084
Money is the only problem,

646
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:04,921
but in marriage, that one problem
can lead to many problems.

647
00:57:09,384 --> 00:57:10,677
You probably

648
00:57:11,594 --> 00:57:13,221
can't understand,

649
00:57:15,723 --> 00:57:18,768
but my family is very poor.

650
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:24,357
It's a single-parent family.
And my brother is a high school sophomore.

651
00:57:25,733 --> 00:57:27,777
I have a lot of responsibilities.

652
00:57:32,574 --> 00:57:33,950
I just told you everything.

653
00:57:34,659 --> 00:57:36,453
You can run away if you want.

654
00:57:45,545 --> 00:57:47,380
Are you the one who wants to run away?

655
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:49,048
What?

656
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:50,925
Unless you want to run away

657
00:57:51,676 --> 00:57:54,345
because you won't be happy
with someone like me,

658
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:56,764
don't say that.

659
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:06,357
But you want to get married.

660
00:58:13,781 --> 00:58:15,241
With you.

661
00:58:16,409 --> 00:58:18,703
Living with someone else
is a punishment for me.

662
00:58:19,204 --> 00:58:22,624
Don't punish me. Don't leave me, either.

663
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:24,667
Okay?

664
00:58:47,732 --> 00:58:49,484
Yes, Mr. On.

665
00:58:50,276 --> 00:58:51,402
I'm sorry.

666
00:58:51,945 --> 00:58:55,573
I'm having a meal with reporters.
But I think we'll go out to drink next.

667
00:58:56,157 --> 00:58:57,116
Mr. On.

668
00:58:58,034 --> 00:59:00,453
-Aren't you coming back in?
-I'm coming.

669
00:59:04,332 --> 00:59:05,500
I'm really sorry.

670
00:59:06,793 --> 00:59:08,920
I'll try to leave as fast as I can.

671
00:59:09,003 --> 00:59:11,464
Can I see you later just for a bit?

672
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:15,969
It's okay. I can watch the movie
by myself. Don't worry.

673
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:18,429
I'm sorry. I'll call you later.

674
00:59:18,513 --> 00:59:19,597
Okay.

675
00:59:39,951 --> 00:59:42,745
Su. I'm going up.

676
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:01,806
How about this for our theme?

677
01:00:01,889 --> 01:00:04,934
"As a phase ends, another phase begins."

678
01:00:05,018 --> 01:00:06,311
What do you think?

679
01:00:07,228 --> 01:00:10,064
This district was famous
for steel shops and closed factories.

680
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:12,066
People visit for a different reason now.

681
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:15,612
The art district of Mullae-dong
and the cafes in Seongsu-dong.

682
01:00:15,695 --> 01:00:17,113
Isn't it nice?

683
01:00:19,073 --> 01:00:20,575
So you don't feel anything now?

684
01:00:22,076 --> 01:00:23,453
What do you mean?

685
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:28,458
So you don't have any feelings
left for me? Not even a tiny bit?

686
01:00:31,085 --> 01:00:32,837
You thought I'd pine over you forever.

687
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:35,548
Now that I like someone else,
I suddenly look desirable?

688
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:36,674
It's not that.

689
01:00:37,425 --> 01:00:38,593
Don't look so mad now.

690
01:00:39,385 --> 01:00:43,598
I know. I know that you would never
have feelings for me.

691
01:00:44,515 --> 01:00:46,392
I know that better than anyone.

692
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:56,235
Was I

693
01:00:58,529 --> 01:00:59,822
that mean to you?

694
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:02,450
It wasn't you.

695
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:05,703
I was mean

696
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:10,958
to myself.

697
01:01:12,418 --> 01:01:15,129
I made myself get used
to seeing your back.

698
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:18,091
I kept hurting my wounds
over and over again.

699
01:01:18,716 --> 01:01:20,718
I let them fester
even when I knew the truth.

700
01:01:22,595 --> 01:01:23,638
I hung onto someone

701
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:27,684
who would never love me back.

702
01:01:36,484 --> 01:01:38,027
I'm glad you didn't

703
01:01:39,654 --> 01:01:40,863
show up that night.

704
01:01:57,588 --> 01:01:58,715
Is he picking you up?

705
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:01,926
Something came up.

706
01:02:03,052 --> 01:02:04,220
You seem disappointed.

707
01:02:05,221 --> 01:02:08,725
I should be understanding.
He's a busy CEO.

708
01:02:11,227 --> 01:02:12,812
You got blisters for nothing.

709
01:02:14,105 --> 01:02:15,481
Right.

710
01:02:17,024 --> 01:02:18,901
Are you going home? I'll drop you off.

711
01:02:18,985 --> 01:02:22,238
No. I booked seats at the theater.
I'll watch it alone.

712
01:02:22,822 --> 01:02:24,365
I'll drop you off there.

713
01:02:28,661 --> 01:02:30,204
-Do you want to join me?
-Yes.

714
01:02:31,247 --> 01:02:34,125
It sounds like
you were waiting for me to ask you.

715
01:02:34,208 --> 01:02:36,544
Right. You like watching movies.

716
01:02:38,337 --> 01:02:40,256
I do. I like movies.

717
01:02:41,591 --> 01:02:44,218
-Let's go, Mr. Substitute.
-What? Mr. Substitute?

718
01:02:45,553 --> 01:02:47,180
How about Mr. Spare, then?

719
01:02:47,263 --> 01:02:48,556
It means the same thing.

720
01:02:49,557 --> 01:02:50,475
Don't come, then.

721
01:02:53,811 --> 01:02:54,812
No, I will come.

722
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:58,191
Let's go.

723
01:02:59,817 --> 01:03:01,194
I hate that I want to go.

724
01:03:09,744 --> 01:03:11,370
Oh, right. My shoes.

725
01:03:11,954 --> 01:03:13,623
-Leave them.
-What?

726
01:03:13,706 --> 01:03:15,541
You'll lose them if you carry them.

727
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:17,335
I'll drop you off later. Leave them.

728
01:03:18,169 --> 01:03:19,170
Okay.

729
01:03:25,301 --> 01:03:27,887
That clumsy girl never forgets
his presents.

730
01:03:33,976 --> 01:03:36,103
We have some time until the movie starts.

731
01:03:36,979 --> 01:03:38,940
-Do you want popcorn?
-Caramel, plus coke.

732
01:03:40,066 --> 01:03:41,567
Were you waiting for me to ask?

733
01:03:42,401 --> 01:03:44,946
It's the right attitude
when watching a movie.

734
01:03:46,113 --> 01:03:47,323
Wait here.

735
01:03:54,580 --> 01:03:57,667
Caramel popcorn and coke, please.
Get me the biggest size for both.

736
01:03:57,750 --> 01:03:59,252
Please wait.

737
01:04:03,130 --> 01:04:04,549
Thank you.

738
01:04:08,886 --> 01:04:10,137
Mr. On.

739
01:04:10,805 --> 01:04:13,224
Why didn't you answer your phone?
I called you.

740
01:04:14,725 --> 01:04:16,644
I had my phone in my bag.

741
01:04:17,270 --> 01:04:20,314
You said you couldn't make it.
How are you here?

742
01:04:20,398 --> 01:04:22,942
I ran away,
so I could go on a date with you.

743
01:04:25,194 --> 01:04:27,572
The movie didn't start yet, right?

744
01:04:28,114 --> 01:04:30,199
No. We have a few minutes until the movie.

745
01:04:31,617 --> 01:04:32,618
Is this the one?

746
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:37,248
I'll go.

747
01:04:53,222 --> 01:04:54,348
Do you want popcorn?

748
01:04:54,974 --> 01:04:56,726
Excuse me. I need to use the toilet.

749
01:04:57,643 --> 01:04:58,686
Woo-yeon…

750
01:05:26,964 --> 01:05:28,674
-Hello.
-Stop.

751
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:31,677
-What?
-Stop walking.

752
01:05:42,355 --> 01:05:44,190
Why did you leave like that?

753
01:05:44,273 --> 01:05:45,399
You can't just leave.

754
01:05:45,483 --> 01:05:47,318
You stared at me so I would leave.

755
01:05:48,361 --> 01:05:50,112
-No, that's not it.
-Then what?

756
01:05:50,196 --> 01:05:52,657
Will you leave him and come with me?

757
01:06:08,381 --> 01:06:11,342
Why did you come after me?
You'll have to abandon me twice.

758
01:06:11,425 --> 01:06:13,469
I doubt that you ever get abandoned.

759
01:06:15,471 --> 01:06:16,722
I think I do.

760
01:06:32,154 --> 01:06:34,615
-What are you doing?
-Letting you go.

761
01:06:35,282 --> 01:06:37,243
-What?
-I saw him.

762
01:06:37,952 --> 01:06:39,495
He won't like seeing us together.

763
01:07:00,266 --> 01:07:01,851
Do you really like him?

764
01:07:07,314 --> 01:07:08,858
Do you really like him?

765
01:07:29,795 --> 01:07:31,088
I like you.

766
01:07:42,183 --> 01:07:45,227
I think that was the day when your curse

767
01:07:46,437 --> 01:07:48,314
came to me.

768
01:07:59,158 --> 01:08:00,201
Gosh.

769
01:08:11,921 --> 01:08:13,047
I like you.

770
01:08:13,631 --> 01:08:16,467
I wanted to tell you that at least once.

771
01:08:22,306 --> 01:08:23,307
What did you say?

772
01:08:25,810 --> 01:08:26,977
Nothing.

773
01:08:49,375 --> 01:08:51,877
Mom, are you just friends with Dad?

774
01:08:51,961 --> 01:08:56,048
Son, do you know what the most
valuable thing is in a long relationship?

775
01:08:56,132 --> 01:08:57,341
It's the memories.

776
01:08:57,424 --> 01:09:00,886
I'm sorry for being so mean to you.

777
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:02,179
All of a sudden?

778
01:09:02,263 --> 01:09:05,015
I should have matured sooner
if it was this simple.

779
01:09:05,099 --> 01:09:06,642
The shoot will be over soon.

780
01:09:07,226 --> 01:09:08,727
-What a relief.
-What do you mean?

781
01:09:08,811 --> 01:09:10,479
It seems the shoot will end smoothly.

782
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:12,731
People are mean.

783
01:09:12,815 --> 01:09:16,152
They abandoned it, saying it was
useless. But they came back for it.

784
01:09:16,235 --> 01:09:18,362
I guess I'm always making mistakes.

785
01:09:18,445 --> 01:09:20,573
Come and get your shoes later
and have dinner with me.

786
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:29,623
You already found out, so I don't
want to hide

787
01:09:29,707 --> 01:09:30,875
the fact that I like you.

788
01:09:32,918 --> 01:09:37,923
