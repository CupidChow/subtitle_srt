1
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:50,467
There once lived a shepherd boy.

2
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:53,553
One day, he got bored and told a lie.

3
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:56,973
"A wolf! There's a wolf!"

4
00:00:57,766 --> 00:01:00,018
Grown-ups in the town fell for his lie

5
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:02,687
and came running with weapons,
but there was no wolf.

6
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:06,149
And after that, the shepherd boy kept

7
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:08,109
telling the same lie repeatedly.

8
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,613
"A wolf! There's a wolf!"

9
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:17,243
And when a wolf really appeared,

10
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:21,498
no one believed the boy.

11
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:28,838
What if I really have feelings for you?

12
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:32,634
Answer my question.

13
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:36,179
What if I'm serious?

14
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:39,390
What will you do?

15
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:44,854
Don't toy with me.

16
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:07,460
Gyeong Woo-yeon, you fool.

17
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:16,010
TOY WITH SOMEONE

18
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:17,595
DICTIONARY: TO TOY WITH SOMEONE

19
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,139
"To meet lightly with someone"?

20
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:21,850
Who does she think I am?

21
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:25,103
I told her to stop misunderstanding me.

22
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:36,823
Are you guys trying to see
who can sigh the most?

23
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:42,787
-Did it end well?
-Yes.

24
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:45,165
Aren't you going to tell me
what it's about?

25
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:46,833
It's nothing.

26
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:49,294
I'm tired today. I should go to bed.

27
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:50,587
Goodnight.

28
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,297
Okay. Goodnight.

29
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:55,049
She's doing it again.

30
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,052
Thank you for understanding.

31
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:00,305
THANK YOU FOR UNDERSTANDING

32
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:16,696

INSTALLMENT SAVINGS ACCOUNT

34

TRANSACTION DETAILS

35
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:39,636
It matures next month.
Are you sure you want to close it now?

36
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,179
Yes, please.

37
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:43,848
Okay, I'll settle it then.

38
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:51,022
TEXT MESSAGE

39
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:53,483
Please wait.

40
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:56,277
We got the money.

41
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:59,239
It's been settled.
We won't see each other again.

42
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:10,458
-Hello--
-Mom, are you crazy?

43
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,669
Gosh, you startled me.

44
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:14,128
Why are you yelling at me?

45
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:16,297
Did you tell Hyeon-jae about Cheol-su?

46
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:18,675
Yes. Well…

47
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:21,886
Hyeon-jae kept asking me.

48
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:25,473
Do you really want to see me kill myself?

49
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:26,683
Why would you die?

50
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:29,686
You fool.

51
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:30,937
He's not just anyone.

52
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:32,772
You'll marry him soon.

53
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:34,190
Exactly.

54
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:37,151
We were going to, but I can't
because you embarrassed me.

55
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:39,988
I'm too ashamed of my family to marry him.

56
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:55,545
So is this going to be the cover design?

57
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:59,340
Did your date
with your drunk destiny go well?

58
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:02,135
Yes.

59
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:04,762
-What did you two do?
-There were three of us.

60
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:08,975
Since when were you so progressive?

61
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,106
What if I really have feelings for you?

62
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:21,112
Answer my question. What if I'm serious?

63
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:23,531
What will you do?

64
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:43,801
How would you feel
if your first love came back?

65
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:47,972
If my first love came back,
I'd be tempted.

66
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:49,932
Your first love is hard to forget.

67
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:53,728
Why? Did your drunk destiny
get her first love back?

68
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:59,192
Hey, why would you even
care about her first love?

69
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:01,069
First love never works out.

70
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:03,654
Who knew yours would
come back as your sister-in-law…

71
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:10,661
Was that supposed to be a consolation?

72
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:13,873
I was being careless. I'm sorry.

73
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:16,793
-Shall we go get some exercise?
-I said I'm sorry.

74
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:19,212
What are you doing? Come on out.

75
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:21,964
Jun-su. On Jun-su! Mr. On!

76
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:25,551
Mr. On, I will…

77
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:51,619
Hey, do you want to kill me?

78
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:55,206
Why are you fighting tooth and nail
like that? Why are you so desperate?

79
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,751
I think I need to try my best this time.

80
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:08,678
Gosh, he's so cute.

81
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:13,975
Here's your taro milk tea
and bubble milk tea.

82
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:15,017
Thank you.

83
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:20,690
PROSECUTOR PARK YOUNG-SIN

84
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:21,816
Come in.

85
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:25,820
Prosecutor Han. Come in.
What brings you here?

86
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:34,495
You brought bubble tea? Thank you.

87
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:36,456
It's nothing.

88
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,916
I could even buy you
a whole cafe if you want.

89
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:40,501
What?

90
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:43,463
-Oh, excuse me.
-Sure.

91
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:46,507
Hey, Honey. All right.

92
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:49,051
I love you too. Bye.

93
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:54,140
Sorry. That was my girlfriend.
Did you have something to say?

94
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,186
Well, the thing is…

95
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:03,483
The hangover helper you got me the other
day was really good. Where did you get it?

96
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:05,443
Oh, that one? Hang on.

97
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:10,490
I have a lot. Just tell me
whenever you need it.

98
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,035
People say I'm a worried well.

99
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:18,581
A worried well?

100
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,251
Thank you.

101
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:24,754
-Do you want more?
-No.

102
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:46,400
There was a reason why I didn't tell you.

103
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,320
I wanted to hide it.

104
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:51,322
But why did you have to dig it up?

105
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:53,699
Why did you have to find out
and embarrass me?

106
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:55,993
What's there to be
embarrassed about between us?

107
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:58,412
-There's no reason--
-Why do I need

108
00:08:58,496 --> 00:08:59,747
a reason to be embarrassed?

109
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:03,209
I'm just embarrassed
when I'm embarrassed, no matter what.

110
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:04,877
You seem too worked up now.

111
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:08,005
-Calm yourself down--
-Why are you making me feel small?

112
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:10,174
And why are you making me look so bad?

113
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:16,013
We've dated for ten years,
but you still don't trust me?

114
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:18,516
You can talk to me.

115
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:21,978
You can just…

116
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:24,772
You can count on me.

117
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:32,446
I don't want the person I love to suffer.

118
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:36,784
This isn't about you. It's for me.

119
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:43,374
Why do I always have to be

120
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:47,670
the one to count on you?

121
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:51,132
Are you the only one in love?

122
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:53,301
I love you too.

123
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:57,221
Don't make me be your burden.

124
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:08,441
I'll pay you back.

125
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:10,818
Take it.

126
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:14,238
I'll pay you back
as soon as my savings mature.

127
00:10:56,530 --> 00:11:00,451
He said he just had one,
but I didn't know he really meant it.

128
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:03,496
Why would he care if I drink or not

129
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:04,955
when he has a girlfriend?

130
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:07,333
Why would he make me misunderstand him?

131
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,212
Cheer up.

132
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:13,589
You said you had a serious problem.

133
00:11:13,672 --> 00:11:15,716
If this isn't serious, what is?

134
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:21,972
Your life must be so peaceful and boring.

135
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:24,225
You're making a fuss over nothing.

136
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:25,851
What? Nothing?

137
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:28,354
Yeong-hui, don't be like that. Jin-ju is…

138
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:30,147
When will you stop whining like that?

139
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:33,984
When will you distinguish
between kindness and romantic feelings

140
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:36,445
and stop complaining about being lonely?

141
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,614
What did you just say?

142
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:41,075
Whining? Complaining?

143
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:42,660
You heard me right.

144
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:44,495
Talk about yourself.

145
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:46,747
Do you think you're a grown-up?

146
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:48,374
You pretend to know everything

147
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:50,709
and act like you're the only one
who's suffering.

148
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:53,295
It's so annoying
how you look down on others.

149
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,005
-What?
-I said it's annoying.

150
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:57,633
Hey, Jin-ju. Why are you
being like this too?

151
00:11:57,716 --> 00:12:00,010
Leave me be. Let me have my say.

152
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:01,804
But you're not a grown-up.

153
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:04,890
You're like a teenage girl
who's wallowing in self-pity.

154
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:09,478
-What do you know?
-Nothing.

155
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,814
You don't even tell us
anything about yourself.

156
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:15,151
One day you're depressed,
and then you seem just fine.

157
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:18,904
You always keep things to yourself,
so how would we know?

158
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:21,449
How long do we have to
walk on eggshells around you?

159
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:23,325
What if I tell you?

160
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,786
Can a daughter from a rich family
even understand?

161
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:28,998
Don't be sarcastic.

162
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:31,333
Fine. It's better off this way.

163
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,627
We'll stop seeing each other.

164
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:36,797
I'm already sick and tired
of indulging a spoiled kid like you.

165
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:38,424
I'm leaving.

166
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:40,259
Yeong-hui.

167
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:52,480
Yeong-hui. You can't leave like this.

168
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:54,482
Do you want me to stay there?

169
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:57,026
Fighting over who's right and who's wrong?

170
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:59,111
Just try to understand her today.

171
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,779
Jin-ju must be really upset.

172
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:08,913
What about me? Do you think I'm okay now?

173
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:12,249
Did something happen to you too?

174
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,252
No. Just go back to Jin-ju.

175
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:17,505
Why? Let's go back inside together.

176
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:20,424
I should go to bed early
for work tomorrow.

177
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:21,675
See you.

178
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:28,724
What is going on?

179
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:36,857
Did Yeong-hui leave?

180
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:38,150
Yes, she did.

181
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:41,111
Gosh, couldn't you hold it back?

182
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:42,488
Right.

183
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:45,699
I also know that I'm pretty well-off.

184
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:48,369
I'm well-educated, rich,
and have a good profession.

185
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:51,705
But where else
can I talk about my concerns?

186
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:54,333
Like she said,
it just sounds like whining.

187
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:58,462
But I'm really upset and distressed.

188
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:00,714
We're friends.

189
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:02,758
So I told you about my concerns.

190
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:05,386
That's good.

191
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:09,139
Keep telling us.
Otherwise, we'd never know.

192
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:18,983
Did I sound mean earlier?

193
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:21,068
You were both mean.

194
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:22,194
Both you and Yeong-hui.

195
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:47,928
Why are you drinking?

196
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:51,849
Who do you think is the one
who should be drinking?

197
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:56,061
Who do you think is the one
who's so upset?

198
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:58,939
What can you do? That's your destiny.

199
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:04,737
My destiny?

200
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:09,950
Why does my destiny
have to be so awful and heavy?

201
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:24,131
Why is everything a burden?

202
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:27,051
Why is everything a burden to me?

203
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:34,642
This is the worst.

204
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:08,092
Was I being too mean?

205
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:21,772
Son, what are you doing here?
You didn't even call.

206
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:24,066
Why would I call you
when I come to Dad's place?

207
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:27,861
What are you doing here?

208
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:30,030
Why are you asking that to my guest?

209
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:34,243
I'm stopping by to pick something up.
Don't mind me.

210
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:35,577
Son.

211
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:38,831
Eat before you leave.

212
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:46,505
The rice looks great.

213
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:50,843
-Try this soup for me.
-Okay.

214
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:56,682
-It's perfect.
-I'm glad.

215
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:03,272
I'm going home.

216
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:05,357
Okay. Good job today, Woo-yeon.

217
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:18,954
I think this place is closed.
Are you sure it's okay to come in?

218
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:22,624
It's fine. It's mine.

219
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:26,879
Do you want to drink something?
Coffee or tea?

220
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:29,339
-Coffee, please.
-Okay.

221
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:43,979
THE LITTLE PRINCE

222
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:52,613
METAPHOR PUBLISHING HOUSE

223
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:56,658
"For instance, if you come
at four in the afternoon,

224
00:17:57,367 --> 00:18:00,621
I will begin to be happy by three."

225
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,502
Will you go to the forest?

226
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:12,216
FOREST

227
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:32,319
"I want to see her more often

228
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:34,404
than I blink my eyes."

229
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:44,498
Next, go on top
of the ladder in the Forest.

230
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:02,724
"If I'm to go through all this again
just to see you,

231
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,434
I will do so."

232
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,106
Now it's the showcase under the stairs.

233
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:19,741
"I thought I wanted to make her happy.

234
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:24,621
I wanted to make someone else
feel happy for the first time,

235
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:28,709
and I thought her happiness
will also make me happy."

236
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:34,548
Now go up the stairs.

237
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:53,150
YOUR BEAUTY MAY BECOME WORDS

238
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:00,365
YOUR BEAUTY MAY BECOME WORDS

239
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:01,909
I like you.

240
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,120
I ruined it.

241
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:21,595
I LIKE YOU. I RUINED IT.

242
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:28,310
I just confessed my feelings.

243
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:42,366
I'm not the impatient type.

244
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:45,702
But I always get impatient
in front of you.

245
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:51,291
It's not like I confessed
my feelings in haste.

246
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,001
You don't have to answer in haste.

247
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:56,255
I want you to think it over seriously

248
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:58,298
before you answer.

249
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,763
Your birthday is this Saturday, right?

250
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:09,685
Let's go on a date on your birthday.

251
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:14,106
You can answer me that day.

252
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:34,501
Why? Is it bad?

253
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:36,795
No. I like it.

254
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:42,134
I don't even remember the last time
we ate together. This is nice.

255
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:45,262
He thinks he's all grown-up,
so he doesn't want to eat with us.

256
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:49,766
Our family wasn't so harmonious
when I was little.

257
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:54,896
You can stop acting now.

258
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:58,775
Stop pretending to be an ordinary couple
and an ordinary family.

259
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:00,152
It's ridiculous.

260
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:10,454
I know that we did you wrong.

261
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:12,122
We regret it a lot.

262
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:17,085
We should've taken better care of you
no matter how hard it was.

263
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:20,672
We shouldn't have fought like that
when you were around.

264
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:24,718
So I want to make it up to you.

265
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:25,886
It's all in the past,

266
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:29,473
but that doesn't mean it didn't happen.

267
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:33,143
Have you thought about
how selfish it would be?

268
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:36,313
You two keep acting
as if nothing happened,

269
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:40,734
and it makes me feel like
I'm the strange one.

270
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:42,194
Then what do you want?

271
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:44,696
What are we supposed to do now?

272
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:48,283
You're all grown up now.
Can't you just understand us?

273
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:52,329
I understand you two.

274
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:56,374
A married couple can break up
if things don't work out.

275
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:59,795
If you're busy dealing with your own
problems, you can neglect your child

276
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:02,422
no matter what he's going through.

277
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:04,341
It can happen.

278
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:08,178
But knowing the cause of your wound
doesn't necessarily heal it.

279
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:10,347
Understanding you two

280
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,475
doesn't make me feel better.

281
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:22,234
I should get going now.

282
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,778
What should we do that day

283
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:09,447
for me to keep seeing you
without an excuse?

284
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:11,992
It was a big decision for you.
I don't want to ruin it.

285
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:15,120
Shall I take you to a musical
to keep you distracted?

286
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:17,247
I'd love that.

287
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:22,002
Good. Then let's watch
a musical this Saturday.

288
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:24,087
Go in.

289
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:26,423
I want to see you leave tonight.

290
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:28,383
I was always the one to leave first.

291
00:24:28,466 --> 00:24:30,135
I just like that.

292
00:24:30,927 --> 00:24:33,305
Watching me from behind
might become a habit.

293
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:37,809
I don't want you to remember me
by my back.

294
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:43,231
If that's what you want,
I'll do as you say.

295
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:47,110
Bye.

296
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:25,398
Hi, Gyeong Woo-yeon.

297
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:27,234
What brings you here?

298
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:28,568
Nothing.

299
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:31,029
I'm not toying with you.

300
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,448
I just thought of you.

301
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:37,118
Did you eat?

302
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:46,670
Eat.

303
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:50,340
You're only nice
when something's happened to me.

304
00:25:50,423 --> 00:25:51,549
What's the problem?

305
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:53,969
-I just came for no reason.
-No.

306
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:56,554
Something's going on.

307
00:25:58,348 --> 00:26:00,433
What if I tell you? Will you comfort me?

308
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:02,936
No. I'll just sit here for you.

309
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:10,193
-Should I get the spoons?
-Take this. I'll get the spoons.

310
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:12,279
The kimchi looks delicious.

311
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:15,782
Son.

312
00:26:15,865 --> 00:26:17,492
You must be hungry. Let's eat.

313
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:19,536
Hey.

314
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:21,579
What is Mom doing here?

315
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:23,498
I thought you got divorced.

316
00:26:23,581 --> 00:26:25,959
Well, the thing is…

317
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:27,752
Your mom and I

318
00:26:31,506 --> 00:26:32,841
have decided to stay friends.

319
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:52,569
Su.

320
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:58,158
What are you doing here?

321
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:04,706
I kept saying that he's handsome,
and now he really thinks he is…

322
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,750
That's true, though.

323
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:10,211
But he's so mean.

324
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:14,466
Hey! You jerk!

325
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:16,593
What? Why?

326
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:21,765
Eat.

327
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:25,143
If it cheers you up, feel better.

328
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:26,603
If not, just forget it.

329
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:29,105
What kind of comfort is that?

330
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:30,523
I think it's too aggressive

331
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:33,860
to tell someone to cheer up
when things are tough.

332
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:38,865
There's nothing else I can do for you,

333
00:27:38,948 --> 00:27:41,201
but I can at least stay here
until you finish it.

334
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:44,287
Being alone when you're depressed
only makes it worse.

335
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:46,956
You will only go deeper into depression.

336
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:49,209
I don't even know

337
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:52,379
whether you're on the first
or the tenth basement floor,

338
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:54,506
but I'm trying to stop you
from going deeper.

339
00:28:11,898 --> 00:28:13,024
You're right.

340
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:15,735
You're just sitting here for me,

341
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:19,280
but I'm not going deeper down.

342
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:22,075
What are you talking about?

343
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:24,994
I mean, you haven't changed at all.

344
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:26,704
I'm a consistent person.

345
00:28:28,331 --> 00:28:29,624
Because I'm silly.

346
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:35,338
It's a lie. You've changed.

347
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:39,759
Why did you break your promise?

348
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:43,555
-What promise?
-You said you'd tell me first

349
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:45,140
if you start seeing the CEO.

350
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:47,392
That wasn't a promise.

351
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:51,312
When did you two start dating?

352
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:52,731
We're not dating yet.

353
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:55,650
-Really?
-But

354
00:28:57,485 --> 00:28:59,112
he asked me out today.

355
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:03,992
If nothing special happens,
I will probably date him.

356
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:07,078
Speaking of which,

357
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:10,540
let's not see each other after work.

358
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:15,795
-What?
-Staying friends with someone I liked

359
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:17,881
is a rude thing to do.

360
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:20,967
I don't want to hurt him.

361
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:36,107
I'm home. I should go.

362
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:41,362
Gyeong Woo-yeon.

363
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:43,031
What?

364
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:48,912
You and I had some time apart.

365
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:51,956
Like you said, I suddenly left
to study abroad,

366
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,833
and we've barely met since then.

367
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:58,588
All the while, I kept thinking of you.

368
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:01,925
I didn't even know why,

369
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:04,052
but I just wondered

370
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:06,513
if you were doing okay

371
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:09,682
and thought I would see you
when I go back.

372
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:12,685
I really liked it.

373
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:16,856
And I realized something today.

374
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,650
Every time I was alone,

375
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:20,902
you were there.

376
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:23,530
You were there for me.

377
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:30,119
So if you really disappear,
I will be all alone.

378
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:33,790
I understand the reason why you don't want

379
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:35,458
to see me anymore.

380
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:39,295
But I still need to see you.

381
00:30:43,466 --> 00:30:44,926
Why are you being so…

382
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:51,140
Forget it.

383
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:55,895
There's no point talking to you.

384
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:00,024
Bye.

385
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:05,196
Don't forget about the shoot tomorrow.
We can finish talking then.

386
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:09,284
She ignores me all the time.

387
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:42,775
Gyeong Woo-yeon.

388
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:10,428
Gyeong Woo…

389
00:32:13,681 --> 00:32:18,394
DAEO BOOKSTORE

390
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:20,688
THESE POEMS

391
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:13,491
I'm done preparing
for the memorial service.

392
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:14,909
Don't buy anything.

393
00:33:17,912 --> 00:33:20,873
You wouldn't let me get my own way
this time, Shin Hyeon-jae.

394
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:34,887
You don't have to help me like this.

395
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:38,266
Yeong-hui also does this for my family.
Of course, I have to.

396
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:41,519
Yeong-hui took it out
on you that day, didn't she?

397
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,022
I'm sorry.

398
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:46,566
She takes after me, so she's got a temper.

399
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:49,277
Please tell me
if you have any other problems.

400
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:53,322
I don't mind if Yeong-hui
yells or swears at me,

401
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:55,825
but I don't want her to suffer alone.

402
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:01,414
I wish I could give her a good scolding,

403
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:04,667
but I have no face to do so
because I didn't do anything for her.

404
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,842
Yeong-hui is a pitiful thing.

405
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:14,927
She was born under bad parents,

406
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:17,305
so she's been through a lot
since her childhood.

407
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:20,475
She's ill-tempered,

408
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:23,603
but I'd like you to understand
and embrace her,

409
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:26,606
knowing she has a lot of wounds

410
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:30,359
and thorns in her heart.

411
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:34,572
I'm sorry to say this,

412
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:38,034
but I'd like you to take good care of her.

413
00:34:43,122 --> 00:34:45,500
I'll be sure to take good care of her.

414
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:55,259
-What?
-I'm the one who should ask that.

415
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:57,345
What's the problem?

416
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:58,888
I have no problem.

417
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:01,140
You barely talked to me all day.

418
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:03,101
And you keep trying to avoid me.

419
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:04,352
If that's not a problem,

420
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:06,687
did you do anything wrong to me?

421
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:09,690
In a situation like this,

422
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:12,360
people usually ask if I'm mad at them.

423
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:15,238
Why would you be mad at me?

424
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:17,406
What did I do wrong?

425
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:20,701
And you can't be mad at this face.

426
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:25,456
Hey, I wasn't going to say this,

427
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,208
but some wouldn't like your face.

428
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:29,585
What?

429
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:31,170
Who wouldn't like my face?

430
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:33,506
-Gyeong Woo-yeon from Hapjeong-dong.
-What?

431
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:35,675
From head to toe, I hate all your features

432
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:38,761
including your hairstyle,
piercing, and outfits.

433
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:44,934
-Hey.
-What?

434
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:51,774
Follow me.

435
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:54,652
VIDEO ARCADE

436
00:35:54,735 --> 00:35:58,114
INSERT BILLS

437
00:36:00,449 --> 00:36:02,076
What are we doing here?

438
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,703
You should be grateful.

439
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:05,413
I'm the perfect partner.

440
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:07,415
I take you to an arcade
when you feel down.

441
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:10,126
Gosh, I'm so thoughtful.

442
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:12,461
What should I do?

443
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:15,006
It was just on our way. Stop bragging.

444
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:17,967
We could've walked past it on our way,

445
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:21,429
but I came in here for you,
so you should be grateful.

446
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:23,723
Don't cry when you lose.

447
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:27,310
Fine.

448
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:50,082
I haven't done this for a long time.

449
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:54,420
-Let's do it again.
-Okay.

450
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:10,019
Darn it.

451
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:21,530
You're so simple.

452
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:25,284
You're feeling better after
playing a few games.

453
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:26,661
Talk about yourself.

454
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:29,372
You got pissed off
after losing a few games.

455
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:31,832
Why did you challenge me
when you weren't good at it?

456
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:34,877
I can't be good at everything.

457
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:38,381
God gave me good looks,
so I already have a huge advantage.

458
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:47,682
I can't be good at everything.

459
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:50,476
God gave me good looks,
so I already have a huge advantage.

460
00:37:56,732 --> 00:37:58,025
Come to think of it,

461
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,279
you've always been the same.

462
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:04,115
It's nothing new.

463
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:06,409
And you will always be the same.

464
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:08,536
What?

465
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:12,123
I thought it was a big deal, but it's not.

466
00:38:19,755 --> 00:38:21,465
I used to come here often.

467
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:24,093
When it was sunny, cloudy,

468
00:38:24,176 --> 00:38:26,095
and snowy. I came here on all such days.

469
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:28,848
But in my memories,
Bukchon is always bright.

470
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:31,809
Is it because this is a beloved town?

471
00:38:31,892 --> 00:38:33,102
A beloved town?

472
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:34,395
It's a preservation area.

473
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:37,106
If people want to protect this place,

474
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:39,900
it means it's being loved.

475
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:45,906
We can go with that.

476
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:48,784
I mean the subtitle.

477
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:51,078
"Wanting to protect something."

478
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:55,166
Oh, sounds good.

479
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:01,589
Now you sound like my partner.

480
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:03,174
I am your partner.

481
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:23,986
Give me some. I'm thirsty.

482
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:26,447
No. I need these six bottles for one day.

483
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:31,619
Then I'll interfere with your day.

484
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:38,959
Stop interfering in my life.

485
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:37,768
So if I take a photo of someone,

486
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:41,564
it means I like her

487
00:40:43,732 --> 00:40:45,067
a lot.

488
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:04,128
WANTING TO PROTECT SOMETHING

489
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:46,504
-Mom and Dad fought all the time.
-Are you looking down on me?

490
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:49,173
Dad would yell at Mom, saying that

491
00:41:49,256 --> 00:41:52,092
a mere housewife was
looking down on the breadwinner.

492
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:55,262
And Mom would yell back at him
saying he shouldn't be bragging

493
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:56,764
about his chicken feed salary.

494
00:41:58,057 --> 00:42:00,017
I remember them saying

495
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:02,186
that they married for love.

496
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:16,033
Mom.

497
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:22,498
Why did he cancel his insurance
contract before he fell sick?

498
00:42:23,999 --> 00:42:26,835
He made me suffer all my life,

499
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:29,880
and this is how he left us. That jerk.

500
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:33,050
How are we going to live now?

501
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:54,655
The chemical compound made from
love and poverty is hatred.

502
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:56,991
That was my common knowledge.

503
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:07,042
How did you cook all this by yourself?

504
00:43:09,503 --> 00:43:11,088
Hyeon-jae was here.

505
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:14,508
Don't get mad. I didn't call him over.

506
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:19,054
You had to work, and he didn't
want me to do all the work myself.

507
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:21,640
He was worried and wanted to help.

508
00:43:22,808 --> 00:43:24,268
I told him not to come.

509
00:43:24,351 --> 00:43:26,312
Gosh, Hyeon-jae is unbelievable.

510
00:43:26,395 --> 00:43:27,771
There's no one like him.

511
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:30,816
So stop dragging it out and get married.

512
00:43:30,899 --> 00:43:32,818
I can't get married without any money.

513
00:43:32,901 --> 00:43:35,821
-I need some money at least.
-Why would you need big money?

514
00:43:35,904 --> 00:43:38,907
You can start in a studio.
If you two work hard together…

515
00:43:38,991 --> 00:43:41,952
What if I marry him and get pregnant
when we're not ready?

516
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:44,955
Do you want me to blame my kid
for ruining my life?

517
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:46,290
Like you and Dad did?

518
00:43:46,373 --> 00:43:48,375
Why are you being like that again?

519
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:51,795
That's the last thing I want to do.
So I can't get married right now.

520
00:43:54,381 --> 00:43:55,549
You mean wench.

521
00:44:04,099 --> 00:44:08,312
Yeong-hui, would you have
some beer with me tonight?

522
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:11,398
YEONG-HUI, WOULD YOU
HAVE SOME BEER WITH ME TONIGHT?

523
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:13,108
I'd love to.

524
00:44:15,277 --> 00:44:17,863
I'll be your Cupid today.

525
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:32,521
What? What are you doing here?

526
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:34,648
I need to check something.

527
00:45:34,731 --> 00:45:36,024
What?

528
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:40,070
I mean, I'm going to check it.

529
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,824
Give me three seconds. Just three.

530
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:52,207
Just three seconds.

531
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:54,793
What is it you want to check?

532
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:19,067
You…

533
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:21,820
Are you crazy?

534
00:46:23,697 --> 00:46:24,907
Are you sick?

535
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:28,494
I think I am.

536
00:46:30,579 --> 00:46:31,830
What?

537
00:46:32,664 --> 00:46:34,041
You seem really sick.

538
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:41,340
You have a fever.

539
00:46:46,178 --> 00:46:47,221
Hang on.

540
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:55,771
MEDICINE

541
00:46:56,355 --> 00:46:57,314
Are you sick?

542
00:46:57,397 --> 00:46:58,899
You have a fever.

543
00:47:01,902 --> 00:47:03,570
MEDICINE

544
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:06,406
Give me your car key. I'll drive you home.

545
00:47:11,578 --> 00:47:14,122
Why are you being nice to me?
Do you like me?

546
00:47:14,915 --> 00:47:17,793
Just be grateful that
I never yell at patients.

547
00:47:19,211 --> 00:47:22,339
Why did you get me this medicine?
Why are you taking me home?

548
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:25,008
Did you get me medicine
because you liked me?

549
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:27,761
Getting you medicine and taking you home
don't mean love.

550
00:47:27,844 --> 00:47:30,305
If so, pharmacists and chauffeurs
are philanthropists.

551
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:37,771
I guess that's when it started.

552
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:40,315
What's that for?

553
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:41,692
What?

554
00:47:43,235 --> 00:47:45,571
But what are you doing here?

555
00:47:48,865 --> 00:47:50,784
I thought you were hurt!

556
00:48:01,795 --> 00:48:04,840
Drive safely.
I'm in a weak state right now.

557
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:30,782
Make sure to take your medicine.

558
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:31,867
Bye.

559
00:48:32,993 --> 00:48:33,827
Gyeong Woo-yeon.

560
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:39,583
Did you give your answer to the CEO?

561
00:48:39,666 --> 00:48:40,917
About what?

562
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:43,086
He asked you out.

563
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:45,339
Why would you ask that?

564
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:46,423
Answer me.

565
00:48:48,133 --> 00:48:50,177
No, not yet.

566
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:53,430
You told me

567
00:48:53,513 --> 00:48:55,432
if nothing happens, you'll date him.

568
00:48:56,683 --> 00:48:57,517
So?

569
00:48:57,601 --> 00:48:59,603
Something has happened now.

570
00:48:59,686 --> 00:49:01,438
Go on a date with me tomorrow.

571
00:49:03,815 --> 00:49:05,692
-Are you kidding me?
-No, I'm not.

572
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:08,236
I'm asking you out.

573
00:49:12,324 --> 00:49:14,910
I'm going to see a musical
with Mr. On tomorrow.

574
00:49:14,993 --> 00:49:16,828
-What time?
-At 7:30 p.m.

575
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:19,706
Okay. Then 7:30 p.m. tomorrow.

576
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:22,459
I'll see you at Namsan Tower.

577
00:49:22,542 --> 00:49:25,671
I was saving it for a special day
with someone special.

578
00:49:26,254 --> 00:49:27,422
But I never went there.

579
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:31,009
See you tomorrow. I'll wait.

580
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:32,552
I have plans tomorrow.

581
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:33,929
I'll wait until you come.

582
00:49:34,012 --> 00:49:36,515
Hey, I'm not going.

583
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:38,058
I said I'm not going.

584
00:49:38,141 --> 00:49:40,227
And I said I'll wait until you come.

585
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:41,561
Hey!

586
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:44,231
I'm not going.

587
00:49:47,734 --> 00:49:49,319
What was that?

588
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:52,864
Has he gone crazy or something?

589
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:11,842
Don't get cute with me.

590
00:50:11,925 --> 00:50:14,136
I thought something happened to you.

591
00:50:15,804 --> 00:50:17,597
Nothing was going on when I texted you.

592
00:50:18,932 --> 00:50:21,435
But I do have a problem now.

593
00:50:22,102 --> 00:50:23,270
-What?
-Why?

594
00:50:27,399 --> 00:50:30,736
So Mr. On asked you out,
and you're going to see him tomorrow.

595
00:50:30,819 --> 00:50:33,655
And Su wants to meet you
at Namsan Tower tomorrow?

596
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:35,741
Namsan Tower of all places?

597
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:40,203
Are you hesitating over the CEO now?

598
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:42,414
He's such a perfect guy.

599
00:50:42,497 --> 00:50:43,665
If only successful people

600
00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:45,917
can love, why are there
stories like Cinderella?

601
00:50:50,922 --> 00:50:52,257
I'm still jealous.

602
00:50:54,259 --> 00:50:57,637
It's a problem to have no guy
or to have too many.

603
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:05,353
So? What are you going to do?

604
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:08,064
Who do you want to meet?

605
00:51:11,943 --> 00:51:14,780
-Oh, dear.
-It's not thrilling at all.

606
00:51:15,363 --> 00:51:16,573
What do you mean?

607
00:51:16,656 --> 00:51:19,075
You already got your answer
when you hesitated.

608
00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:22,954
The answer was there all along
since she sighed in front of us.

609
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:24,414
What do you mean?

610
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:26,124
You're going to choose Su.

611
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:27,459
Right?

612
00:51:29,336 --> 00:51:30,670
No, I'm not.

613
00:51:31,296 --> 00:51:33,799
Do you think I'm a fool?

614
00:51:33,882 --> 00:51:35,008
-Yes.
-Yes.

615
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:39,721
-Do you want to drink?
-Sure.

616
00:52:16,424 --> 00:52:19,678
This is exciting. It always feels new.

617
00:52:20,846 --> 00:52:22,347
Being handsome is the best.

618
00:53:58,777 --> 00:53:59,861
I'm sorry.

619
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:14,584
Can't you stay?

620
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:21,132
I'm really sorry.

621
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:49,786
Hey. Are you all right?

622
00:54:49,869 --> 00:54:52,872
Gosh, I was really startled.

623
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:55,333
How could you get hit by a car
at the Namsan Tower?

624
00:54:56,042 --> 00:54:57,836
So why did you go to Namsan Tower?

625
00:54:59,045 --> 00:55:00,422
-What?
-Where's my phone?

626
00:55:00,505 --> 00:55:03,383
Gosh. You passed out
for an hour with a concussion.

627
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:05,176
And that's the first thing you say?

628
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:06,386
Give me my phone.

629
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:07,637
Okay.

630
00:55:09,723 --> 00:55:11,349
Stay here. I'll bring a doctor.

631
00:55:19,441 --> 00:55:22,360
Gyeong Woo-yeon. You're not
still waiting for me, are you?

632
00:55:22,944 --> 00:55:23,945
What?

633
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:26,990
Something came up, so I couldn't make it.

634
00:55:27,073 --> 00:55:30,035
-So I was wondering if you…
-I told you.

635
00:55:31,661 --> 00:55:33,079
I have plans.

636
00:55:37,208 --> 00:55:38,585
You didn't come?

637
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:39,961
No.

638
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:43,298
But why?

639
00:55:44,924 --> 00:55:46,468
Why did you not come?

640
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:53,600
It's nothing.

641
00:56:01,483 --> 00:56:02,609
Hello?

642
00:56:03,651 --> 00:56:04,778
Woo-yeon?

643
00:56:05,695 --> 00:56:07,113
So it's nothing.

644
00:56:08,823 --> 00:56:12,911
I'm sorry. I'm with Mr. On now,
so I have to go.

645
00:56:24,255 --> 00:56:26,424
Hey, what are you doing? Are you crazy?

646
00:56:26,925 --> 00:56:27,842
Hey!

647
00:57:55,597 --> 00:57:56,764
What are you doing here?

648
00:57:57,348 --> 00:57:58,516
I was waiting for you.

649
00:57:59,267 --> 00:58:00,643
Why did you wait for me?

650
00:58:01,269 --> 00:58:03,271
I thought I might be able to see you.

651
00:58:07,859 --> 00:58:08,860
Are you a fool?

652
00:58:10,153 --> 00:58:12,572
You should be mad at me
if I left you like that.

653
00:58:13,907 --> 00:58:15,200
You should curse at me.

654
00:58:16,201 --> 00:58:18,453
You should at least resent me. Why…

655
00:58:20,955 --> 00:58:22,373
Why did you wait?

656
00:58:23,666 --> 00:58:25,293
I'm not here to resent you.

657
00:58:29,422 --> 00:58:30,632
I didn't get to say this.

658
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:35,803
Happy birthday, Woo-yeon.

659
00:59:06,334 --> 00:59:08,211
I hope I'm not too late.

660
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:11,422
Not at all.

661
01:00:08,938 --> 01:00:12,942
When a wolf appeared,
it was the boy who regretted it the most.

662
01:00:14,736 --> 01:00:16,237
He didn't know

663
01:00:17,363 --> 01:00:19,449
a wolf would really appear.

664
01:00:51,022 --> 01:00:53,733
We constantly interact
with others in life.

665
01:00:56,527 --> 01:00:57,904
Benjamin Button said,

666
01:00:58,696 --> 01:01:02,450
"Whether it's coincidental or intentional,
there's no way we can stop it."

667
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:13,044
I was getting a haircut to meet Woo-yeon.

668
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:16,631
At the same time, a woman left for a date

669
01:01:16,714 --> 01:01:19,050
and came back home
as she got a run in her stocking.

670
01:01:19,884 --> 01:01:23,054
It took her about two minutes
to change her stocking.

671
01:01:23,846 --> 01:01:26,808
A man who was waiting for her
saw some police officers

672
01:01:26,891 --> 01:01:28,768
and decided to drive around the block.

673
01:01:29,852 --> 01:01:33,606
The woman in her new stocking
waited for her boyfriend.

674
01:01:34,649 --> 01:01:37,110
I was just leaving the hair salon.

675
01:01:38,111 --> 01:01:40,571
The man who drove around the block

676
01:01:40,655 --> 01:01:42,907
took his girlfriend in his car.

677
01:01:44,325 --> 01:01:46,994
A boy was crossing the street
on his way to his academy

678
01:01:47,078 --> 01:01:48,454
five minutes later than usual.

679
01:01:49,038 --> 01:01:52,208
He was so engrossed in the game
that he lost track of time.

680
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:55,044
When the boy was crossing the street,

681
01:01:55,628 --> 01:01:58,256
I was buying a gift for Woo-yeon.

682
01:01:59,632 --> 01:02:03,219
While I was buying it,
the woman ordered a drink at a cafe.

683
01:02:03,302 --> 01:02:05,012
-Here.
-But she got the wrong drink.

684
01:02:05,096 --> 01:02:07,432
-I ordered a hot one.
-I'm sorry.

685
01:02:07,515 --> 01:02:10,518
One of the employees called in sick,
so she was too busy.

686
01:02:11,436 --> 01:02:13,730
The woman received a new drink
and got in the car.

687
01:02:13,813 --> 01:02:15,857
Then a delivery truck got in their way.

688
01:02:18,651 --> 01:02:19,610
At that moment,

689
01:02:20,611 --> 01:02:22,530
I was on my way to Namsan Tower.

690
01:02:24,907 --> 01:02:27,201
The truck moved,
so the car started to move again.

691
01:02:27,869 --> 01:02:29,996
JIN SANG-HYEOK

692
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:32,582
-I arrived at the parking lot.
-What?

693
01:02:32,665 --> 01:02:34,834
And I got out with the gift.

694
01:02:36,127 --> 01:02:38,254
When the man arrived,

695
01:02:38,921 --> 01:02:41,424
I was trying to open my umbrella.

696
01:02:54,896 --> 01:02:57,440
You're impossible, Gyeong Woo-yeon.

697
01:03:05,114 --> 01:03:06,866
If only one thing had been different.

698
01:03:09,577 --> 01:03:11,537
Just one of all those things.

699
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,877
If I had opened my umbrella right away…

700
01:03:18,461 --> 01:03:20,421
If the truck hadn't gotten in their way…

701
01:03:21,172 --> 01:03:23,716
If the employee hadn't called in sick…

702
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:25,885
-Here's your drink.
-Thank you.

703
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:29,013
If the boy had left on time…

704
01:03:29,096 --> 01:03:32,266
If the police officers
hadn't been there at the moment…

705
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:34,560
If the woman hadn't gotten
a run in her stocking…

706
01:03:35,436 --> 01:03:36,896
Then I would've gone to you,

707
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:40,525
and the car would've driven past me.

708
01:03:43,069 --> 01:03:45,905
But life is a series
of numerous interactions.

709
01:03:51,452 --> 01:03:53,037
No one can control them.

710
01:03:56,207 --> 01:03:58,209
-That short moment…
-The man who was driving

711
01:03:58,292 --> 01:04:00,044
looked away for a moment

712
01:04:02,672 --> 01:04:03,798
and hit me.

713
01:04:05,466 --> 01:04:07,677
The one thing
that should've been different

714
01:04:10,638 --> 01:04:12,098
isn't what happened today.

715
01:04:15,685 --> 01:04:18,980
It was the feeling
that I realized much too late.

716
01:04:41,919 --> 01:04:43,504
Happy birthday, Woo-yeon.

717
01:04:43,588 --> 01:04:44,964
I'm sorry it's too late.

718
01:04:45,047 --> 01:04:46,382
It's been only two days.

719
01:04:46,465 --> 01:04:47,967
Those two days were really long.

720
01:04:48,593 --> 01:04:49,969
I'm Woo-yeon's boyfriend.

721
01:04:50,469 --> 01:04:52,638
How did you end up
seeting Gyeong Woo-yeon?

722
01:04:52,722 --> 01:04:55,975
I like Woo-yeon a lot.
She deserves to be loved.

723
01:04:56,058 --> 01:04:57,894
-What happened to your hand?
-He got hit by a car

724
01:04:57,977 --> 01:04:59,270
at Namsan Tower.

725
01:04:59,353 --> 01:05:01,355
They say love is all about timing.

726
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:02,940
If you didn't fix things,

727
01:05:03,024 --> 01:05:05,526
it means your feelings for her
weren't strong enough.

728
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:08,529
Only those who are brave
can get the timing right.

729
01:05:08,613 --> 01:05:09,947
What happened to your hand?

730
01:05:10,031 --> 01:05:11,449
It's nothing.

731
01:05:12,366 --> 01:05:14,994
I'm glad you didn't show up that night.

732
01:05:16,412 --> 01:05:18,497
Was I that mean to you?

733
01:05:18,581 --> 01:05:23,586
