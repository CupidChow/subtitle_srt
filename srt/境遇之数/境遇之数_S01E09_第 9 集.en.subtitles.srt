1
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,134
A missed chance will turn into regret.

2
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:55,096
If I have no more chances to miss,

3
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:59,726
I should make one myself.

4
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:04,898
I'll be the one with a crush on you now.

5
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:09,027
Just like you liked me.

6
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:13,239
I'll like you longer,
and I'll like you more.

7
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:18,745
I'll be just like you.

8
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:21,122
And you can be like me.

9
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:26,628
Then just like I came to like you,

10
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:31,424
you should come to like me again.

11
00:01:35,553 --> 00:01:37,305
If that's the cycle we're in,

12
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:42,477
I'll wait.

13
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:51,361
You're still so arrogant.

14
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:56,324
You are always so sure of yourself

15
00:01:57,158 --> 00:01:58,368
and do whatever you want.

16
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,286
I'm doing that for you.

17
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:04,624
I have to be sure of myself

18
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:07,085
to win you back.

19
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:25,395
Don't.

20
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:33,111
Don't try to win me over.

21
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:35,655
I was telling you all this

22
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:39,492
not because I'll be with you,
but because I won't be.

23
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:43,371
It's already in the past.
And it's too late.

24
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:45,540
You're just giving me a headache now.

25
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:55,091
Bye.

26
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,850
What should I do?

27
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:12,525
You were late. You don't deserve me.

28
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,233
It's no big deal.

29
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:58,363
It's nothing.

30
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:10,124
But why am I crying?

31
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:34,232
The phone is turned off.
Please leave a message after the beep.

32
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:36,150
GYEONG WOO-YEON

33
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,241
I couldn't reach you.

34
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:26,951
I turned my phone off.

35
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:31,748
It's okay.

36
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,212
How could you be okay
with something like this?

37
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:39,839
Because it's you.

38
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:45,344
If you're angry, act angry.
If you're upset, tell me about it.

39
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,388
Show me your feelings.

40
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:50,600
If you don't,
it will only make me feel sorry.

41
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:57,315
Everything gets better over time,
even feelings like that.

42
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,901
And once those feelings fade away,

43
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:02,945
other feelings will be clearer for you.

44
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:07,116
I'll try harder.

45
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:11,704
How could you try harder than this?

46
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:23,443
What are you looking for? It's late.

47
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:26,446
I can't sleep.
I want to have a cup of tea.

48
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:28,072
Sit down. I'll make it for you.

49
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:31,909
-I'll--
-Sit down. You'll only make a mess.

50
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:43,838
What's wrong?

51
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:47,508
Can you tell?

52
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:49,302
You said you couldn't sleep.

53
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:53,139
You wanted a cup of tea at this hour.
I just thought something must be wrong.

54
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:59,145
-Mom.
-Yes?

55
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:04,984
Can time make everything okay?

56
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:10,907
Will effort make things better?

57
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:14,118
Is it about work?

58
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,664
It could be about work or feelings.

59
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:21,334
Anything.

60
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,795
Effort won't betray you

61
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,423
except for a few things.

62
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:46,234
What's on your mind?

63
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:49,403
"This is good. I'm jealous.
I wish I was this good."

64
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:52,114
One-dimensional thoughts like that.

65
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:55,576
Someone else will be
standing in your spot soon.

66
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:57,787
In front of your pieces.

67
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:01,624
That's too far in the future for me.

68
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:03,209
I doubt it will be that far.

69
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:08,256
Metaphor Publishing House
publishes good books.

70
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:11,384
And they sell books well.
The top publishing house in the industry.

71
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:15,972
I'm hungry. Let's go eat.

72
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:30,653
I really like today's weather.

73
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:34,740
Then, I'll be the weather.

74
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,841
Sorry.

75
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:58,764
Are you okay?

76
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:10,985
Are you slammed at work nowadays?

77
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:13,738
No. Why do you ask?

78
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:17,700
You look a bit tired.
Your face looks a bit haggard.

79
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,453
Or is it your liver?

80
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:24,415
Is that so?
Should I take some supplements?

81
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:27,543
Actually, my friend works
at a really good pharmaceutical company.

82
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:32,256
This supplement contains Chinese
matrimony vines, oriental raisin trees,

83
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,259
bee-bee trees, gardenias, turmeric,
kudzu, mugwort, and so on.

84
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:38,554
This has all the ingredients
that are good for your liver.

85
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,311
-Never mind.
-What?

86
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:47,980
It looks like I'm trying to sell you
this supplement.

87
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:51,734
It's okay. I'm sure you brought it
because it's good for me.

88
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:54,945
No. Pretend you didn't hear that.

89
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:59,116
I don't want to give the wrong idea
to the woman I like.

90
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:15,674
I'm almost done with the book.

91
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:16,842
Already?

92
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:19,637
I worked on it whenever I could.
I only have one area left.

93
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:24,266
But that doesn't mean I didn't do my best.

94
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:28,270
I worked so hard, my wrist hurts.

95
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,606
Look at this. I can't even hold my fork.

96
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:33,234
You should file a claim.

97
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:36,821
Did you pick a title?

98
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:41,492
Oh, right. Come to think of it,
I didn't pick a title yet.

99
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:43,285
Take your time.

100
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:46,372
I'm not the kind of CEO
who nags a writer who hurt her wrist.

101
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,949
We should pick a title for the book.

102
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:00,654
You're reading a book.
Do you like that book?

103
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:02,031
Let's only talk about work.

104
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:05,701
Okay.

105
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:08,078
It's from the last shoot.

106
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,921
What about the title?
Did you give it some thought?

107
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:18,631
What about you?

108
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:21,926
One Day, Seoul Becomes
a Travel Destination.

109
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:25,471
Seoul can be a travel destination
even if it's familiar to us.

110
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:28,766
Seoul is too pretty of a city
to just overlook.

111
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:32,770
Yes, it is. Very pretty.

112
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:37,358
So people can't leave.

113
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:41,445
What about you?

114
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:43,864
Any ideas for the title?

115
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:48,619
Everyday Life to You, a Trip to Me.

116
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:53,666
To you, Seoul is part of your
everyday life, but to me, it was a trip.

117
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:57,836
I like that title. I should
include this in the foreword, then.

118
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,464
"The moment
our everyday life feels foreign,

119
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:03,425
that foreign feeling becomes
a pleasant feeling in Seoul."

120
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:10,224
Why are you staring at me?

121
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,935
How can you be fine?

122
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:19,233
Do you want to be friends?

123
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,069
-What?
-Or

124
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:24,989
am I supposed to say okay
and start dating you

125
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:27,366
when I don't even like you?

126
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:31,328
Sounds familiar, doesn't it?

127
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:33,372
It sucks to be
on the receiving end, right?

128
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:42,298
That hurt, but I'm okay.

129
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:45,217
What choice do I have?
I know what I told you.

130
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:47,428
Treat me how I treated you.

131
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:55,519
Do you want us to be friends?
Or should I let you toy with me?

132
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:57,313
You're free to do whatever you want.

133
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,857
You can beat me or curse at me.

134
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:01,609
I'll do as you want.

135
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,862
Don't make me deal with your feelings.

136
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:07,823
They're yours. Deal with them.

137
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,493
And look where that got me.

138
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:16,332
Every decision I made about you was wrong.

139
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,460
So I'm asking you this time.

140
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,504
What should I do?

141
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:28,177
What are you doing?

142
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,138
I'm dealing with my one-sided love
as best as I can.

143
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:36,560
I'll reject all of the above.

144
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:40,731
That includes your effort and your promise
that you'll do anything I want.

145
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:45,069
I don't want to do what you did to me.

146
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:50,449
I like your title. Let's go with that.

147
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:53,077
We're done. So I'm leaving.

148
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:56,080
Will you answer my calls?

149
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,041
No.

150
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:02,836
You won't see me if I go see you, right?

151
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:03,754
I'll report you.

152
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:08,634
What about coincidences?
Is it okay if we meet by chance?

153
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:10,552
Coincidences are coincidences.

154
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:13,347
I don't care about you enough
to get mad at coincidences.

155
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:35,536
I guess I won't need coincidences.

156
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:40,582
A HARMLESS PERSON

157
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:13,657
-Are you okay?
-This is uncomfortable.

158
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:16,076
Not that. I was asking
about getting rejected.

159
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:20,330
It's possible for me
to not realize how I feel.

160
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:22,124
I'm such a bad guy.

161
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:27,046
Hey. Ending it like this whenever
you want isn't fair. Don't you think so?

162
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:31,508
From now on, I'll do right by you.
Can you give me one more chance?

163
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:32,718
How…

164
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:36,138
How can your one-sided love
end that quickly?

165
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:40,225
You're crazy.

166
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:43,479
I'm your father. Bye.

167
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:48,192
I knew something was odd.
She answered my call.

168
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:55,157
Did you get rejected?

169
00:17:57,868 --> 00:18:00,662
-I wouldn't want to date you, either.
-Why not?

170
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,873
I thought he had multiple personalities.

171
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:04,500
He yelled, begged,

172
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,377
and suddenly tried
to convince me rationally.

173
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:08,670
Dad.

174
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:11,507
Is that why you're here?

175
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:16,595
No. I want the three of us to have
a meal before you leave Korea.

176
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:18,138
And I wanted to talk to you.

177
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:21,058
-I'm not leaving.
-You're not?

178
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:24,394
Why? Because of that girl?

179
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:25,771
Not you too, Mom.

180
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:27,689
What is it about?

181
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,900
You're mad whenever you see us,
aren't you?

182
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:34,029
Then yell at us whenever you see us.

183
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:38,992
As you said, it's something that happened
in the past, but it still happened.

184
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:42,579
You were deeply hurt
and you're still angry about it.

185
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:44,289
Get it off your chest.

186
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:46,750
It wasn't a big deal.

187
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,169
Right.

188
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:53,757
We're the ones who did wrong,
but you're paying the price.

189
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:59,096
We're sorry

190
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:01,849
for not taking care of you back then.

191
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:05,769
Why are you bringing that up now?

192
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:07,521
I don't want you to use that pain.

193
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:12,151
I'm worried that
you might pretend to be cold and mean

194
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:14,444
and turn into an awful man
to cover up the wound.

195
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:18,949
I want you to be happy.

196
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:40,095
You should also yell

197
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,764
and curse at me whenever you see me.

198
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:44,683
What?

199
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:49,229
You can vent out all your
bottled-up feelings about the past.

200
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,899
What's wrong with you?

201
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:57,738
I'm bothered that
I might turn into an awful man.

202
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,366
I made a lot of mistakes.

203
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:05,454
You can resent me and blame me for them.

204
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:19,051
-Come on, pay more attention.
-Am I stupid?

205
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:22,054
-Must you talk to me like that?
-How else should I do it, then?

206
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:24,514
Do I have to take care of
every little thing here?

207
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:26,475
You said you'd do everything for me.

208
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:29,436
-Why are you pissed at me?
-Because you piss me off!

209
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:37,569
What if you become like him?

210
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:40,447
-What do you mean?
-He used to run to a pharmacy

211
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:42,366
even when she got a small scratch.

212
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:45,118
But he's always irritated after marriage.

213
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:47,704
Is that what you think of me?

214
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:50,499
Relationships and love don't
start off like that.

215
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:54,628
But marriage starts off as a fairytale
and ends up like some gossip story.

216
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:56,129
What's wrong with that?

217
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,217
Someone I know peels shrimps

218
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,427
for his wife even when they're fighting.

219
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:06,098
And the wife badmouths him and says
she hates him, but she buys his underwear.

220
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:07,432
That's how they live.

221
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:12,771
I like that story.
I wish we could live like that, too.

222
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:19,278
I love you, Yeong-hui.

223
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:21,530
How much?

224
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:24,491
As much as the value of a house in Seoul.

225
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:28,870
That's way too much.

226
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:35,585
HE CAME TO THE BAKERY SINCE
HE DIDN'T HAVE ANYONE TO EAT WITH

227
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:38,130
YOU DIDN'T HAVE ANY FEELINGS FOR ME

228
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:49,599
IT'S RARE FOR FEELINGS TO BE MUTUAL

229
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:55,272
HE COULD HURT HER
WITHOUT EVEN LIFTING A FINGER

230
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:57,190
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANT TO LOVE

231
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:59,568
I DIDN'T HAVE THE COURAGE
TO BREAK OUT OF MY SHELL

232
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:05,615
I opened this book
so I could get to know you more,

233
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:07,284
but I ended up finding my faults.

234
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:17,919
WANTING TO PROTECT SOMETHING

235
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:20,839
JUST LIKE HOW THE FEELINGS
YOU DIDN'T NOTICE SUDDENLY APPEAR…

236
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:23,050
EVERYDAY LIFE TO YOU…

237
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:34,061
You are invited to a tasting
of my new dish on Wednesday.

238
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:35,103
I'm busy.

239
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:37,272
Office workers don't make plans
on weekdays.

240
00:22:37,355 --> 00:22:38,940
I'll go if Yeong-hui is coming.

241
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:41,443
Why can't anyone just say yes?

242
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:43,779
I'll see if I can make it.

243
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:48,533
This is a coincidence.

244
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:50,160
She said that was okay.

245
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:06,051
MOM

246
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:14,267
Shouldn't you be working now?

247
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:16,394
I'm taking a break.

248
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:19,439
-When are you coming home?
-I'll be late. Why?

249
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:23,485
I just wanted to know
when you were coming.

250
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:26,279
-Do you have something to say?
-Gosh, no.

251
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:30,867
Okay. Don't be too late.

252
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:32,494
Okay.

253
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:48,051
-Gosh.
-What's that?

254
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:52,848
This supplement contains Chinese
matrimony vines, oriental raisin trees,

255
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:56,601
bee-bee trees, gardenias, turmeric,
kudzu, mugwort, and so on.

256
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:59,563
These are liver supplements
that have all the good stuff.

257
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:01,022
What are you up to?

258
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:02,232
Don't take them, then.

259
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:04,901
-I was thinking about your--
-No. I'll take them.

260
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:06,611
Are they approved by the KFDA?

261
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:07,863
Sweetie, take them.

262
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:10,615
-I'm okay. Give them to your mom.
-No, you take them.

263
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:12,242
-It's okay.
-I can get some more.

264
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:15,912
What? Yes. That would be nice.

265
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:17,581
I'll be back.

266
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:23,170
What's going on with her?

267
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:32,179
-That's cool.
-Yes.

268
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,437
That was pretty cool.

269
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,564
You look pretty good right now.

270
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:50,572
I'm hanging out with my friends.

271
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:54,951
Did you eat?

272
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:02,334
Do you smell something burning?

273
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:04,461
My heart?

274
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:07,130
It's not that.

275
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:09,299
It's something else.

276
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:11,134
Hey. Fire!

277
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:12,761
-Gosh.
-There's a fire.

278
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:14,554
-Fire!
-Oh, no! What do we do?

279
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:16,431
-Open the window.
-What should we do?

280
00:25:16,514 --> 00:25:18,099
-Open the window. Hurry.
-Open it.

281
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:20,060
-I'll call you later. What is it?
-Hurry.

282
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,399
Gosh, we almost died.

283
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:28,193
Exactly. What you did was so silly.

284
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:30,654
I wasn't being silly.
It was a cool technique.

285
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:34,616
You invited out exhausted workers
on a weekday

286
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:36,243
and made them inhale smoke?

287
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:40,372
Cut him some slack.
I'm sure he meant well.

288
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,833
Having good intentions is useless.
Look at what he did.

289
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:45,835
You're so mean.

290
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,754
Don't act so rude!

291
00:25:47,837 --> 00:25:49,506
You startled me.

292
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:53,718
Where did Woo-yeon and Su go?

293
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:57,222
I'm stopping by Tonight.

294
00:25:57,305 --> 00:25:59,766
Sang-hyeok asked us to taste his new dish.

295
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:03,019
-All of your friends?
-Yes.

296
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:07,941
I'm on my way to a book reading.

297
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:12,112
I won't be available during the reading,
so I wanted to listen to your voice.

298
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:16,241
I'll pick you up later. See you soon.

299
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:17,659
Okay.

300
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:34,968
Do you need to talk to me?

301
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:36,594
Yes, I have a lot to tell you.

302
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:39,139
You just won't give me the time for it.

303
00:26:40,598 --> 00:26:43,893
No. I won't have time
for that again today.

304
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:48,440
I thought about why
I always made the wrong choices.

305
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:56,448
And I figured it out.

306
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:59,326
Doing my best is torturing you.

307
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:05,290
It happened in the past,
but it still happened.

308
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:09,502
Bad memories
must still be fresh in your mind.

309
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:12,589
I'm sorry for acting
like nothing happened.

310
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:17,635
I'm sorry I always made
a joke out of everything.

311
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:20,597
And I'm sorry that I'm making an effort

312
00:27:21,639 --> 00:27:22,807
for my own benefit.

313
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:29,064
I just thought I should tell you that.

314
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:32,192
Maybe telling you this
is also being selfish.

315
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:37,155
Can't you just live your life?

316
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:40,784
You said you'd do what I tell you to do.

317
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:43,787
Just live a good life.

318
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:47,874
Don't let the past hold you back.

319
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:50,460
Don't try to piece back together
what's already broken.

320
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:53,713
And don't hang onto a lost cause.

321
00:27:56,132 --> 00:27:58,009
I'm going to be happy from now on.

322
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:02,931
I'll pretend to do that,

323
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:05,308
but I can't promise anything.

324
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:08,478
Missed opportunities bring regrets.

325
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:10,313
And I have so many regrets.

326
00:28:11,147 --> 00:28:12,649
I'm not sure if I can do it.

327
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:19,656
But at least, in front of you,
I'll pretend to be happy and doing okay.

328
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:23,410
So you should just assume that I'm happy

329
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:25,370
and doing okay.

330
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:56,693
TONIGHT

331
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,371
Why didn't you come in?

332
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:10,790
Just because.

333
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:16,588
Want to talk? Or should I go inside
and pretend I don't know anything?

334
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,476
Su likes me.

335
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:32,604
He's the one who likes you,

336
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:34,689
but why are you out here,
looking like that?

337
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:36,858
How do I look?

338
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:38,735
Like you've lost everything.

339
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:46,951
I was so sure
that this would never happen.

340
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:50,455
It was something I only wished for,
for a long time.

341
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:53,708
But not anymore?

342
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:57,003
I like Jun-su now.

343
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:00,173
Right.

344
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:02,967
Then that's great.

345
00:30:03,676 --> 00:30:06,429
But why does it sound like
you're chanting a spell?

346
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:11,476
"Like him. Please learn to like him."

347
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:13,061
That's what it sounds like.

348
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:19,901
Diseases and feelings grow
when you try to cover them up.

349
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:28,076
-I got a discount, too.
-Really?

350
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,666
-What? What about Su?
-He left.

351
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,377
He didn't even say bye.

352
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,712
He's always like that.

353
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:44,342
He doesn't tell us anything.
He just comes and goes whenever he wants.

354
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:46,845
He does whatever he wants to do.

355
00:30:50,723 --> 00:30:51,933
What happened?

356
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:53,393
Later.

357
00:31:19,168 --> 00:31:20,628
Are you awake?

358
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:23,006
We're in front of your house.

359
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:24,757
Why are you here, Jun-su?

360
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:26,217
I said I'd pick you up.

361
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:27,927
Right.

362
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:30,305
Do you not remember that?

363
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:33,474
No.

364
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:34,642
Good.

365
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:36,853
Why?

366
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:39,480
If you do, you'll be embarrassed.

367
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:43,234
-Did I do something?
-You were snoring.

368
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:48,865
I was joking.

369
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:51,492
It's late. Go home and get some sleep.

370
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,036
You can snore all you want.

371
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,871
Come on.

372
00:31:58,207 --> 00:31:59,667
Get home safe, Jun-su.

373
00:32:04,547 --> 00:32:05,673
I love you.

374
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:15,642
I love you, Woo-yeon.

375
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:24,025
Thank you for today.

376
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:58,893
-I'm almost there.
-You're selfish to the end.

377
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:02,438
Even to this day,

378
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:06,734
you've only been thinking about yourself.

379
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:10,446
I don't care if you like me or not.

380
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:14,117
I don't care if you'll wait for me or not.

381
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:18,746
I don't care if you're happy or not.

382
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:28,047
Hey, this is Yeong-hui.
She's very drunk right now.

383
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:30,550
JUN-SU

384
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:33,886
Have you gone mad?

385
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:35,471
Woo-yeon. You…

386
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:40,143
Mr. On.

387
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:46,024
Woo-yeon is quite drunk right now.

388
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:47,984
Hey, wake up now. Wake up.

389
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:14,177
PHOTOGRAPHER LEE SU

390
00:34:19,348 --> 00:34:20,975
I guess you're not confident.

391
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:49,462
When will this exhibition end?

392
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:52,381
The last day is the 17th of this month.

393
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:57,929
The photo book is scheduled
to be released next month, correct?

394
00:34:58,012 --> 00:34:59,222
Yes, that's right.

395
00:34:59,972 --> 00:35:02,600
-The book event hasn't been decided?
-No, sir.

396
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:05,895
Good.

397
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,250
Thank you.

398
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,379
I heard you've been seeing someone.

399
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,090
How did you find out?

400
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:39,178
I'll give you some privacy.

401
00:35:40,012 --> 00:35:41,139
How did she know?

402
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:46,477
Don't be hard on Sang-sik.
I asked him about it.

403
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:50,064
Good. I was dying to brag about her.

404
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,942
-So have you changed?
-What?

405
00:35:53,025 --> 00:35:54,861
You always play it safe.

406
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:59,198
You always take a step back
and wait until you get what you want.

407
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:00,908
Or hold back to protect something.

408
00:36:01,784 --> 00:36:03,035
That's how you were.

409
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:07,415
I'm the same in some ways,
but different in some ways.

410
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:10,334
But I'm not sure which one is right.

411
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:14,505
The more desperate I am,
the harder it gets.

412
00:36:25,057 --> 00:36:28,311
I think the exhibition is closed.
Can we come in here?

413
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:31,230
Guess the name of the building.

414
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:34,775
Metaphor Art Museum.

415
00:36:37,486 --> 00:36:39,197
I'm the CEO, remember?

416
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:43,284
Gosh. You suddenly feel
so far away from me.

417
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:44,952
That's not the reaction I wanted.

418
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:48,372
"Gosh, my boyfriend is rich.
Which handbag should I ask for?"

419
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:50,166
I want you to think like that.

420
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:54,128
Should we meet at a department store
on our next date?

421
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:55,546
When should we meet tomorrow?

422
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,173
I was joking.

423
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:00,176
But why are we here?

424
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:04,764
Before you pick your bag,
you can pick something else first.

425
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:19,737
How long do you think
you'll need to finish the book?

426
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:21,781
Not much.

427
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:24,617
We'll be able to publish the book
next month as scheduled.

428
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:26,494
Good.

429
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:30,498
This is the best spot at this gallery.

430
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:37,630
Which piece do you want to hang
right here next month?

431
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:42,134
Why are you asking me?

432
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:44,136
Start thinking about it.

433
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:47,598
Next month, it will be your piece
that will be hung here.

434
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:55,064
For the book launch, we're going
to hold a calligraphy and photo exhibit.

435
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:59,819
I will pave the path
if your path gets rocky.

436
00:37:59,902 --> 00:38:03,197
And if what you want is too far,
I will bring it to you.

437
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:08,411
I want you to take an easy path.

438
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:12,248
Am I Cinderella?

439
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:15,418
Do you want to be Aladdin? I'm your Genie.

440
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:21,424
Genie is cooler than
the silly prince who can't even recognize

441
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:23,175
the woman he loves.

442
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:46,741
Yeong-hui.

443
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:50,286
Hey. Have you worked on
wedding invitations too?

444
00:38:50,369 --> 00:38:52,913
They need to be mass-produced,
so I haven't done any.

445
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:55,082
I've made a lot of postcards and cards.

446
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:57,543
Why do you ask?
Is someone getting married?

447
00:38:57,626 --> 00:38:59,295
What? No. Just asking.

448
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:03,632
Anyway, I bet you had a huge fight
with your boyfriend.

449
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:08,095
With Jun-su? Why would I?

450
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:11,307
He didn't tell you?

451
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:17,521
You called your boyfriend, thought
he was Su, and said some stupid things.

452
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:20,524
What?

453
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:24,862
Is your boyfriend that kind?
Or does he not care?

454
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:28,157
How could he say nothing
after hearing all that?

455
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:33,537
I'll call you later, Yeong-hui.

456
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:34,663
Okay.

457
00:40:17,164 --> 00:40:18,082
Go in.

458
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:22,253
Is there anything you want to tell me?

459
00:40:24,171 --> 00:40:25,089
No.

460
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:31,470
Okay. Thank you for dropping me off.

461
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:33,222
Goodnight.

462
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:36,976
You, too.

463
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:15,222
I want to like what you like.
I should like the same things.

464
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:17,892
I'm okay. Because it's you.

465
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:19,393
There's no need to do that.

466
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:22,480
If you need anything, I'll give it to you.

467
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:23,939
I'm your Genie.

468
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:29,320
Will effort make things better?

469
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:32,281
Effort won't betray you

470
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:34,909
except for a few things.

471
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:40,706
When it comes to one's feelings
or sudden misfortunes,

472
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:43,334
effort won't be able to do anything.

473
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:15,449
Hello?

474
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:18,202
Let's meet tomorrow.

475
00:42:19,578 --> 00:42:20,955
I want to talk to you.

476
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:24,833
Okay.

477
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:46,522
What kind of ring do you want?

478
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:51,443
Well, I'm going to propose
to my boyfriend.

479
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:54,446
Can I take a look at that one?

480
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:06,542
Effort won't betray us,

481
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:08,586
but

482
00:43:09,169 --> 00:43:12,923
there are things that need our effort
and things that don't.

483
00:43:14,174 --> 00:43:16,427
HAPJEON UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

484
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:24,602
It's gastric cancer.

485
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:31,066
For instance,
misfortunes that we cannot avoid

486
00:43:32,985 --> 00:43:34,862
or one's feelings.

487
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:46,081
I could've come to you.

488
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:49,752
I thought
I should be the one coming to you.

489
00:43:52,504 --> 00:43:54,632
I ordered coffee for us.

490
00:44:07,269 --> 00:44:10,147
There are too many reasons
why I should like you.

491
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:13,609
But even when I think about those reasons,

492
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:19,323
I can't fall in love.

493
00:44:21,867 --> 00:44:25,454
Is it you who's unable to love?
Or are you just unable to love me?

494
00:44:30,542 --> 00:44:31,919
It hurts to be considerate.

495
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:37,174
I'm sorry.

496
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:43,639
Your words hurt me even more.

497
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:46,767
And holding back doesn't?

498
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:51,355
Why won't you tell me
what's going on, Jun-su?

499
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:53,607
Why do you always hold back?

500
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:58,404
You should have gotten mad when I
called you, mistaking you for another man.

501
00:44:58,487 --> 00:45:00,114
You should've resented me.

502
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:04,618
You should've criticized me.

503
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:09,498
How could I do that? I was worried
that you'd leave me if I did.

504
00:45:10,457 --> 00:45:12,126
I knew that you didn't love me

505
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:15,045
and that you hadn't gotten over him.
So I tried my best.

506
00:45:16,422 --> 00:45:17,714
I thought I could be patient

507
00:45:17,798 --> 00:45:20,384
and you would eventually love me
if I wait for you.

508
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:25,055
Couldn't you have considered my feelings?

509
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:29,560
You could have given me time to think.

510
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:32,938
I needed time to consider
what could happen in the future.

511
00:45:35,023 --> 00:45:36,900
Why would you need to do that?

512
00:45:37,484 --> 00:45:39,695
Why torture yourself
over something so obvious?

513
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:45,367
No matter how hard you try,
you feel insecure,

514
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:46,910
so you hold back your feelings.

515
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:50,539
You'd lose yourself in this relationship.

516
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:54,460
That's not a good relationship.

517
00:46:02,801 --> 00:46:04,094
So

518
00:46:08,682 --> 00:46:10,017
let's break up.

519
00:46:19,818 --> 00:46:21,153
I'm sorry.

520
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:37,461
The lethargy that comes from
realizing that your effort was futile

521
00:46:38,712 --> 00:46:41,507
destroys us in the end.

522
00:46:44,092 --> 00:46:45,719
The downside of making an effort.

523
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:48,073
Will you hold back again?
But you have the right to be mad.

524
00:47:52,661 --> 00:47:54,871
I'll try harder.

525
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:58,083
How could you try harder than this?

526
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:38,915
What? Did Woo-yeon say that she likes me?

527
00:48:39,916 --> 00:48:41,251
You…

528
00:48:42,669 --> 00:48:44,379
You won't get a pass the second time.

529
00:48:46,882 --> 00:48:49,343
I don't care how she feels.
You can't date her.

530
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:50,802
She can date anyone but you.

531
00:48:50,886 --> 00:48:53,472
You have no right to decide that!

532
00:48:55,724 --> 00:48:57,559
You made her cry for ten years.

533
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:05,651
You don't even know
how to appreciate love like that.

534
00:49:16,703 --> 00:49:17,913
Now, I do.

535
00:49:20,874 --> 00:49:23,293
So I'll start liking her back from now on.

536
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:55,701
Excuse me.

537
00:49:58,161 --> 00:49:59,913
What are you two doing?

538
00:50:02,207 --> 00:50:04,167
-Woo-yeon.
-Woo-yeon.

539
00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:15,721
I don't even feel bad for you anymore.

540
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:32,487
What is this?
You guys aren't kids anymore.

541
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,364
Your lips are busted.

542
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:38,034
Jun-su, you've been sparring
for ten years.

543
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:39,828
You can't beat people up.

544
00:50:41,621 --> 00:50:43,790
Gosh. A boxer beat me up?

545
00:50:44,499 --> 00:50:47,085
So this wasn't just an assault.
This is a special case.

546
00:50:47,169 --> 00:50:48,295
My dad is a lawyer.

547
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:55,218
It's my fault.

548
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:05,604
Hey, I'm hurt, too.

549
00:51:07,981 --> 00:51:09,775
But you can move your lips fine.

550
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:14,821
Talk about playing favorites.

551
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:16,323
Don't you have a conscience?

552
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:18,825
You and Jun-su aren't the same.

553
00:51:20,452 --> 00:51:21,745
You're not him.

554
00:51:22,704 --> 00:51:24,164
It hurts.

555
00:51:35,133 --> 00:51:37,093
I want to stop being in bad relationships.

556
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:43,642
Either I get hurt
or end up hurting someone else.

557
00:51:43,725 --> 00:51:46,311
Being in such relationships
isn't good for me.

558
00:51:49,147 --> 00:51:50,732
It's too painful. I can't do it.

559
00:51:57,948 --> 00:52:00,367
So I can't date either of you.

560
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:03,495
I mean, I won't.

561
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:06,581
You can call me a bitch

562
00:52:08,124 --> 00:52:10,335
or resent me for being selfish.
I don't care.

563
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:20,053
Do you remember what I said?

564
00:52:21,513 --> 00:52:23,431
I'm responsible for my own feelings.

565
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:29,521
I'll aggressively cling onto you
or come see you with excuses.

566
00:52:31,064 --> 00:52:32,440
I will go to you.

567
00:52:39,197 --> 00:52:40,407
I'll wait.

568
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:44,744
As long as you come back to me,
I'll wait without any complaints.

569
00:52:50,166 --> 00:52:51,209
Suit yourselves.

570
00:52:53,169 --> 00:52:54,588
I'm done with both of you.

571
00:52:55,922 --> 00:52:58,425
I cherish myself more than anyone.

572
00:53:18,278 --> 00:53:21,281
ONE MONTH LATER

573
00:53:21,364 --> 00:53:23,950
A PLACE WHERE THE PAST
AND THE PRESENT COEXIST

574
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:25,452
WE STILL SURVIVE

575
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:27,412
EVERYDAY LIFE TO YOU, TRIP TO ME

576
00:53:27,495 --> 00:53:29,956
WANTING TO PROTECT SOMETHING

577
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,917
WANTING TO PROTECT SOMETHING

578
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,752
JUST LIKE FEELINGS YOU DIDN'T NOTICE
SUDDENLY APPEARING

579
00:53:33,835 --> 00:53:35,587
YOU FIND THEM
WHEN YOU FOCUS ON YOUR JOURNEY

580
00:53:46,348 --> 00:53:48,266
How beautiful.

581
00:53:48,934 --> 00:53:50,226
What did you buy this time?

582
00:53:51,019 --> 00:53:52,479
My book will be published soon.

583
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:55,857
So I'm giving myself a present.

584
00:54:01,655 --> 00:54:05,075
BE SUCCESSFUL, GYEONG WOO-YEON

585
00:54:07,035 --> 00:54:09,287
My gosh. This is amazing.

586
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:14,584
Aren't you going to date anyone?
You've only been working these days.

587
00:54:15,377 --> 00:54:16,753
No, I'm not.

588
00:54:16,836 --> 00:54:18,338
Did you break up with them both?

589
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:19,714
I broke up with one.

590
00:54:20,757 --> 00:54:22,217
I wasn't dating the other one.

591
00:54:23,426 --> 00:54:26,513
What about the love letter guy?
He said he'd wait. Did he give up?

592
00:54:26,596 --> 00:54:27,681
It's only been a month.

593
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:29,224
I told him not to wait.

594
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:33,812
Did you go through my room?

595
00:54:33,895 --> 00:54:36,231
You should've cleaned it yourself, then.

596
00:54:36,314 --> 00:54:39,067
Do you want to eat, sleep, and work
in that mess of yours?

597
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:41,569
Yes. I'll eat, sleep, work, and die there.

598
00:54:44,572 --> 00:54:48,076
Gosh. Men will stop chasing her
once they see that nasty temper of hers.

599
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:50,453
You don't get to say that.

600
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:52,580
She reminds me of you when you were young.

601
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:07,721
A HARMLESS PERSON

602
00:55:14,936 --> 00:55:17,397
A HARMLESS PERSON

603
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:19,315
I'LL BE TRAVELING FOR A WHILE

604
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:33,705
A HARMLESS PERSON

605
00:55:43,506 --> 00:55:46,426
I ALWAYS THOUGHT PEOPLE DISAPPOINTED ME
BUT I DISAPPOINTED THEM

606
00:55:48,261 --> 00:55:50,972
BEING AN EMPTY SHELL MADE
PEOPLE WHO LOVE ME TURN AWAY

607
00:55:58,104 --> 00:55:59,606
I'll be traveling for a while.

608
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:01,566
I'll be somewhere in Korea.

609
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:17,082
I'll only be a phone call away.

610
00:56:17,832 --> 00:56:19,834
If I stay here, I might bother you again.

611
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:36,726
I said I'd wait, so I'll wait quietly.

612
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:20,770
You can drunk dial me

613
00:57:22,939 --> 00:57:24,732
or call me because you miss me.

614
00:57:39,205 --> 00:57:41,082
She hasn't called me once for a month.

615
00:57:43,209 --> 00:57:44,669
It feels like it's really over.

616
00:58:01,186 --> 00:58:03,855
I opened this book
so I could get to know you more,

617
00:58:03,938 --> 00:58:05,607
but I ended up finding my faults.

618
00:58:25,835 --> 00:58:29,797
The sentences I underlined
have also been mistakes.

619
00:58:41,643 --> 00:58:44,479
Mr. On. I informed the photographer
and the writer about

620
00:58:44,562 --> 00:58:46,105
the calligraphy and photo exhibit.

621
00:58:48,233 --> 00:58:50,610
As you said, we made
ample space for the calligraphy

622
00:58:50,693 --> 00:58:53,196
so all the attention
doesn't go to the photos.

623
00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:57,992
What's bothering you?

624
00:58:58,076 --> 00:59:00,411
I don't want to work with a foolish CEO.

625
00:59:01,996 --> 00:59:04,082
Bring me your resignation letter, then.

626
00:59:04,165 --> 00:59:06,543
Hey, aren't you even mad?

627
00:59:06,626 --> 00:59:08,461
Why go out of your way for your ex?

628
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:10,088
We didn't break up.

629
00:59:11,506 --> 00:59:13,758
She said it was over
and won't answer your calls.

630
00:59:13,841 --> 00:59:16,719
You can't even ask how she's doing.
That's called a breakup.

631
00:59:18,596 --> 00:59:22,016
When writers are stuck,
they pause or start over.

632
00:59:22,809 --> 00:59:24,269
They take a break.

633
00:59:24,894 --> 00:59:25,979
That's what this is.

634
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:28,982
If she starts over,
would it be the same story?

635
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:33,278
Yes, as long as the intention is the same.

636
00:59:33,361 --> 00:59:34,988
EVERYDAY LIFE TO YOU, TRIP TO ME

637
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:36,406
Whatever.

638
00:59:37,865 --> 00:59:38,741
Give this to her.

639
00:59:40,952 --> 00:59:42,328
And bring her news back?

640
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:44,372
You can't change jobs.

641
00:59:44,455 --> 00:59:46,708
-Why?
-You know me so well.

642
00:59:48,543 --> 00:59:51,254
You're incredibly frustrating. Gosh.

643
00:59:56,134 --> 00:59:57,927
Mr. On wanted me to give you this.

644
00:59:59,137 --> 01:00:00,221
I see.

645
01:00:00,805 --> 01:00:03,641
EVERYDAY LIFE TO YOU, TRIP TO ME

646
01:00:03,725 --> 01:00:05,643
Did you get the text about the exhibit?

647
01:00:06,561 --> 01:00:08,187
-Yes.
-You're coming, right?

648
01:00:09,397 --> 01:00:10,690
Will Mr. On be there, too?

649
01:00:11,274 --> 01:00:12,650
That was the whole purpose.

650
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:16,529
You should still come.

651
01:00:18,448 --> 01:00:20,867
I should go. It's work.

652
01:00:22,869 --> 01:00:24,287
You must think I'm brazen.

653
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:28,333
As an editor,
I'm grateful for your attitude.

654
01:00:29,334 --> 01:00:32,420
But as his friend, I kind of hate you.

655
01:00:34,005 --> 01:00:35,757
He's a mess right now.

656
01:00:40,303 --> 01:00:42,847
I know you're not to blame.
Sorry for being nosy.

657
01:00:43,598 --> 01:00:44,432
It's okay.

658
01:00:46,142 --> 01:00:48,102
I'm done here. So I'll get going.

659
01:00:50,396 --> 01:00:51,773
See you at the exhibit.

660
01:01:05,161 --> 01:01:06,996
EVERYDAY LIFE TO YOU, TRIP TO ME

661
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:09,082
WRITTEN AND CALLIGRAPHED
BY GYEONG WOO-YEON

662
01:01:14,796 --> 01:01:17,882
Gosh. Now that the exhibit is set up,

663
01:01:17,965 --> 01:01:21,636
I can see that the photos and calligraphy
go really well together.

664
01:01:22,345 --> 01:01:24,847
-It's nice.
-You really have discerning eyes.

665
01:01:28,142 --> 01:01:28,976
SEONGSU-DONG

666
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:31,187
WANTING TO PROTECT SOMETHING

667
01:01:32,897 --> 01:01:35,149
WE STILL SURVIVE

668
01:01:49,330 --> 01:01:52,291
You must feel awkward
since we haven't talked for a month.

669
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:54,836
A bit.

670
01:01:54,919 --> 01:01:57,797
Congratulations on your first exhibit.

671
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:02,844
Thank you.

672
01:02:02,927 --> 01:02:05,847
It took me a month to find an excuse.

673
01:02:13,771 --> 01:02:14,897
What do you think?

674
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:18,818
HAEBANGCHON, SEOCHON

675
01:02:18,901 --> 01:02:19,986
WE STILL SURVIVE

676
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:21,487
AS A PHASE ENDS, ANOTHER PHASE BEGINS

677
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:22,947
YOU CAN START OVER WHEN ABANDONED

678
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:25,324
Effort won't betrays us,

679
01:02:31,289 --> 01:02:32,123
but

680
01:02:39,797 --> 01:02:43,801
there are things that need an effort
and things that don't.

681
01:02:47,054 --> 01:02:48,264
Our feelings

682
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:51,559
would be one example.

683
01:02:51,642 --> 01:02:54,312
-You're here, Mr. Lee.
-Hi. Thank you for your help.

684
01:03:12,413 --> 01:03:15,041
What will happen to us
when we're faced with

685
01:03:16,292 --> 01:03:17,585
the result of futile effort?

686
01:03:33,017 --> 01:03:33,935
WHY DID YOU DO THAT?

687
01:03:34,018 --> 01:03:35,728
Pardon? What do you mean?

688
01:03:37,104 --> 01:03:38,898
Oh, that?

689
01:03:38,981 --> 01:03:40,650
WHY DID YOU DO THAT TO WOO-YEON?

690
01:03:40,733 --> 01:03:43,236
People can't see things
that are too close.

691
01:03:44,153 --> 01:03:48,115
Look. If you look at a mirror like this,
you can't see anything.

692
01:03:48,950 --> 01:03:51,077
Plus, you're the closest to yourself.

693
01:03:52,578 --> 01:03:54,205
I misunderstood my own feelings.

694
01:03:55,623 --> 01:03:57,250
There are no misunderstandings now.

695
01:03:57,333 --> 01:03:58,918
BUT THAT SHIP HAS SAILED

696
01:03:59,001 --> 01:04:03,256
If Woo-yeon is a ship that has already
sailed, I'll swim until I catch up.

697
01:04:03,339 --> 01:04:04,674
SAY SOMETHING TO HER

698
01:04:04,757 --> 01:04:07,927
Woo-yeon,
you are bound to come back to me.

699
01:04:37,373 --> 01:04:40,668
-So you'll keep liking Woo-yeon?
-Of course!

700
01:04:40,751 --> 01:04:42,211
Mr. On!

701
01:04:42,295 --> 01:04:43,713
She'd better come back to me.

702
01:04:45,423 --> 01:04:48,342
I let it slide last night
because you two were totally wasted.

703
01:04:48,426 --> 01:04:50,052
This better be the last time.

704
01:04:50,136 --> 01:04:51,304
-Woo-yeon.
-Woo-yeon.

705
01:04:52,638 --> 01:04:53,472
Something is off.

706
01:04:54,056 --> 01:04:57,143
He won't answer my calls.
And he quit the cafe, too.

707
01:04:57,226 --> 01:04:58,728
Of course. You're my everything…

708
01:04:59,228 --> 01:05:02,189
Why would you pine over someone like him?
You're too good for him.

709
01:05:02,273 --> 01:05:03,232
You know nothing.

710
01:05:07,820 --> 01:05:09,780
Hello. I'm Gyeong Woo-yeon.

711
01:05:10,615 --> 01:05:12,700
-Who is she?
-The girl I like.

712
01:05:14,827 --> 01:05:19,832
