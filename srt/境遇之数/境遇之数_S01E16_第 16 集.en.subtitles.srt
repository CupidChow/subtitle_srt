00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:53,803
DOOR: THE END OF THE WORLD

2
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:01,352
Congratulations, son.

3
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:02,896
Congratulations.

4
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:05,857
Thank you.

5
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:32,091
Our son looks so haggard.

6
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:34,844
Is something wrong?

7
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:39,140
I guess they broke up.

8
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:42,560
-Su cried.
-What?

9
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:44,687
Did that punk cry?

10
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:50,902
Should I go see her?

11
00:01:50,985 --> 00:01:52,195
Hey.

12
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:55,448
Do you not remember
when my mom went to see you?

13
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:57,200
Why are you bringing that up?

14
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:01,204
I see.

15
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:03,373
That's what I'm saying.

16
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:28,273
Mr. Lee came again.

17
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:32,193
I know. Artists usually don't
come to their exhibition every day.

18
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,412
A FLOWER THAT BLOOMS WITH LONGING

19
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:35,465
What brings you here?

20
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:45,058
Can you give this to Yeong-hui?
Tell her that you got it for her.

21
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:49,479
It's vitamins.

22
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:51,522
Why don't you give it to her yourself?

23
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:55,026
I don't think she'd accept it.

24
00:03:58,321 --> 00:03:59,572
What does love mean to you?

25
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,034
-Why do you ask so suddenly?
-I'm curious.

26
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,496
If I were you, I would be hurt.

27
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:09,749
But you just continue loving her
without getting exhausted.

28
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:13,419
So I wonder what love means to you.

29
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:18,424
How far I can go for her,

30
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:21,928
how much I can give up,

31
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:24,514
and what I can put on the line.

32
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:26,432
I thought of those things.

33
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:30,395
And I realized I could do anything
if it was for her.

34
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,357
I'm envious.

35
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:36,109
Of Yeong-hui?

36
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:38,403
Both of you.

37
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:43,283
That you can give such love
and that she can receive such love.

38
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:46,244
I guess it's something
that will never happen to me.

39
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:52,417
If you are so quick to judge things
from the beginning,

40
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,253
no matter whom you meet
and what kind of love they offer,

41
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:58,131
you won't receive it.

42
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:07,390
What about Su's exhibition?
Did you go there?

43
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:22,947
Why does Mr. Lee keep
staring out at the entrance?

44
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,868
I guess he's waiting.

45
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:42,383
Gosh, how could he put
such a big portrait of himself here?

46
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:47,055
I shouldn't have come.
Why did I have to see this?

47
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,241
Hello, honey.

48
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:10,244
What now? We just talked on the phone.

49
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:12,497
Dinner?

50
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:14,916
Did you call me just to ask that?

51
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:18,127
What makes people happy is so simple

52
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,797
that it sometimes makes me dispirited.

53
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,549
-Woo-yeon.
-Why do you keep calling me?

54
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:26,177
I'm happy that I'm calling you like this.

55
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,470
I'll fix it.

56
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:30,807
I love you so much.

57
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,266
I love you, too.

58
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,355
Are you brushing your teeth, my Yeon?

59
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:39,357
I love you.

60
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:41,901
I love you too.

61
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:47,573
I'll be there soon. Okay.

62
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,826
All right.

63
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:53,621
Let's go.

64
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:55,957
-Goodbye, Mr. Lee.
-Goodbye, Mr. Lee.

65
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,917
-Let's go.
-Where should we go?

66
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:06,050
I lost you because I failed
to do such simple things,

67
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,053
and I'm regretting it for a long time.

68
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:12,557
How long will it continue?

69
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:16,686
I can't even dare to guess.

70
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:29,699
Son.

71
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:36,581
Heat them in the microwave
instead of eating out.

72
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:38,249
Why did you make so much curry?

73
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:41,252
Curry is good for your health.

74
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:44,297
It's anti-inflammatory
and immune-boosting.

75
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:47,633
And it helps you forget bad memories.

76
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:52,138
I guess the last one
is what you really wanted to say.

77
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:54,682
You got me.

78
00:07:57,018 --> 00:08:00,480
Did she come?
It looked like you were waiting for her.

79
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:03,941
She won't come.

80
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:06,444
Then go to her.

81
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:10,823
I can't.

82
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:14,994
You can stop acting now.

83
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:17,497
Su. Let's stop this act.

84
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:20,333
I can't cling to her because

85
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:23,002
I know how she feels.

86
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,633
And they are not bad memories to me.

87
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,478
WOO-YEON CALLIGRAPHY

88
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:48,778
Can you make it a little thicker?

89
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:51,697
Good.

90
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:01,165
-Thank you for today.
-Bye.

91
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:02,583
What shall we eat?

92
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,648
Thank you.

93
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:27,608
My pleasure.

94
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:33,906
What brings you here?

95
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:37,493
I saw your postcard at Su's place.

96
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:41,080
So I checked your social media
and found the address of this workshop.

97
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,297
I came to give you this.

98
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:52,883
I've always wanted to thank you.

99
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:59,390
Su grew up walking on eggshells
at home since childhood.

100
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:02,852
So he always worked hard
without crying or whining

101
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:04,604
to be in our good books.

102
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:10,067
After he grew up, he didn't do anything.

103
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:11,485
He just left us.

104
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:17,992
So we just thought we lost our child.

105
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:22,913
But Su changed a lot after meeting you.

106
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:24,665
I wanted to thank you.

107
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:29,795
I'm sorry, but I can't take this.

108
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:35,426
Actually, Su and I broke up.

109
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:37,845
I know.

110
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:40,598
I came knowing that.

111
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:44,644
Things have changed,
but I still appreciate it.

112
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:47,438
It's Su who's changed, not me.

113
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:52,026
I didn't do anything.

114
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:54,862
People don't change.

115
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:59,325
But if someone changed,

116
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:01,410
and if it was because of someone else,

117
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:04,163
that's an amazing thing.

118
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:11,170
Thank you for showing up in front of Su.

119
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:13,589
Do you think

120
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,970
it's really me that made Su change?

121
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:23,808
Do you think

122
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:26,727
I affected him that much?

123
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:30,731
I liked Su for a long time.

124
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:33,567
And I liked him a lot.

125
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:37,863
But I was always curious in the meantime.

126
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:42,743
Long ago, I wondered
why Su didn't like me.

127
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:45,204
And after we broke up,

128
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,543
I wondered if Su really loved me.

129
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:56,132
That's what I'm curious about.

130
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:04,682
It's between you two,
so it's not something I can judge.

131
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:08,144
But from the way I saw it,

132
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:12,440
Su seemed to really like you.

133
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:17,903
That's the biggest problem.

134
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:25,369
I just can't believe it.

135
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:31,959
I might have some lingering feelings.

136
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,922
Maybe I still like him.

137
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:42,470
And maybe

138
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:46,682
it might last forever.

139
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:51,812
And?

140
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:05,284
You know you two loved each other,
but you feel like it was unrequited love.

141
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:08,954
If you ask him to love you,
you're afraid he will drift away.

142
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:14,126
That's how you drift apart
with loved ones.

143
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:18,464
I understand.

144
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:21,675
I understand better than anyone.

145
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:27,515
So, as a woman,
I don't want to say "despite all that,"

146
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:30,518
but as a mother
who feels sorry for my son,

147
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:33,103
I want to ask you
to give it a try just once.

148
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:42,321
I'm sorry for saying this.

149
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,818
DOOR: THE END OF THE WORLD

150
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:29,243
DOOR: THE END OF THE WORLD

151
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:36,000
To a photographer,
his perspective is his everything.

152
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:44,466
DOOR: THE END OF THE WORLD

153
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:53,684
I'm glad everything is going well.

154
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:56,103
Please tell me if you have any problems.

155
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:10,326
Congratulations.

156
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,293
Woo-yeon is not coming.

157
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:21,754
I know. I didn't even give her a ticket.

158
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:24,548
Then why are you waiting for her?

159
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:30,429
No reason. Just in case.

160
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:32,890
It's unlikely, though.

161
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:36,226
I'm not on your side.
Acting pitiful wouldn't work.

162
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:41,607
You know what?
You're the only one who hates me now.

163
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:48,405
Jin-ju says emotions can wear out
if you use them a lot.

164
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:50,574
So she doesn't hate me anymore.

165
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:55,079
If that's the case for her,
it would be worse for Woo-yeon.

166
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:59,041
You sound like you want her to hate you.

167
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,543
I wish Woo-yeon would at least hate me.

168
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:06,674
I want her to think about me
one more time, even if it's hate.

169
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:12,638
You shouldn't have let her go, then.
Why cling to her after all this time?

170
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,182
You still cling to Hyeon-jae, too.

171
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:20,813
It seemed like that to me.

172
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:23,273
I know.

173
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:25,818
I'm in no position
to tell you such a thing.

174
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:27,611
If you can't let him go, go get him.

175
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:29,780
You both still love each other.

176
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:42,626
Give it to her yourself.

177
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,420
If I do, she won't take it.

178
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:46,505
Even if she doesn't,

179
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:48,757
you should at least see her.

180
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:51,593
You should keep showing up
so she'll think about you.

181
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:08,444
Yeong-hui.

182
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,626
What are you doing here?

183
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:29,381
Here.

184
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:30,340
What is this?

185
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:33,177
It's nothing much. Just some vitamins.

186
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:36,180
Are you doing this

187
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:40,601
out of responsibility or pity?

188
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:44,396
If I left you and lived well,

189
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:47,191
you would've met someone else

190
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:50,110
and gotten over me immediately.

191
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:51,737
Maybe.

192
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:58,035
But I would've regretted it right away.

193
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,789
I would've regretted it
for the rest of my life.

194
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:09,213
If what I believe to be love

195
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:12,007
feels like responsibility or pity to you,

196
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:16,720
I will try even harder
so it feels like love to you.

197
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:21,266
You were always good to me.

198
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:26,146
It's not like you weren't
good enough for me.

199
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:33,070
Can't you just let me blame myself?

200
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:38,075
And can't you just blame me too?

201
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,537
We broke up like that

202
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,998
because of me.

203
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,835
And I've changed.

204
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:50,754
Can't we just put it that way?

205
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:56,051
How could I do that?

206
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,220
None of that's true.

207
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:02,391
I know it's all my fault.

208
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:13,610
Hyeon-jae, if you keep doing this,

209
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,323
it will make things harder for me.

210
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,453
I'm doing this for my sake.

211
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,499
I'm doing all this because of me.

212
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:31,587
And this has nothing to do
with responsibility or pity.

213
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:36,258
I'm doing this because I still love you.

214
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:43,140
Yeong-hui.

215
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:48,103
I will always be here for you.

216
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,273
So don't forget that.

217
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:59,531
Just reach out for me
if you change your mind.

218
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:28,894
You're scaring me.

219
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:32,648
I'm already weak as it is.

220
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,737
Why go to Su's exhibition after lunch?

221
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:39,655
I might get sick.

222
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:42,908
You said you'd lose your appetite
if we went before eating.

223
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:47,371
-Right.
-You said emotions wear out.

224
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:49,581
Why do you still hate Su?

225
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:54,044
I just said that. I didn't really mean it.

226
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:57,297
You get pissed off when
people stop paying attention to you.

227
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:01,843
I hate everyone who makes
my friend cry. I hate him.

228
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:04,096
I just can't understand them.

229
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:07,057
-We should never be like them.
-Of course not.

230
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,393
I'm so happy when I see your face.

231
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:12,145
And I feel happy all day long
when I hear your voice.

232
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:15,232
Oh, right. Did you book our shoot?

233
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:16,400
What shoot?

234
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:20,112
Our wedding photoshoot.

235
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:21,613
I thought you booked it.

236
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:28,120
Didn't you book it? I sent you the link.

237
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:37,254
Jin-ju.

238
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:40,507
Jin-ju!

239
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:44,303
I did. I booked it. It's all done.

240
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:46,346
Why didn't you do it before, then?

241
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,640
I thought you sent me the link
after booking it.

242
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:50,726
Hey, I'm not the only one getting married.

243
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,728
I chose the venue, the dress.

244
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:55,647
and even your suit. Why do I have to
take care of everything?

245
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:56,857
It's just…

246
00:21:57,774 --> 00:22:00,569
You didn't like anything I chose.

247
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:03,822
And I like everything you like.
I thought it would be easier for you.

248
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:07,743
If you wanted to make things easy for me,
you could've found something I like.

249
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:10,620
Instead of sending me some online link
without even checking.

250
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:12,789
You should've done
some legwork like I did.

251
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:16,918
I'm not just upset about the booking.
I hate your insincerity.

252
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,170
Insincerity?

253
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:19,546
I work until late at night,

254
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:23,008
but I bring your lunch to see you
the next day. Is that insincerity to you?

255
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:24,676
Why are you bringing that up now?

256
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,969
I just don't get it.

257
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:29,473
You never talk about what I do well.
You just nitpick at one single mistake.

258
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:30,557
Nitpick?

259
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:34,102
-I mean…
-Hey.

260
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:37,689
I'm just saying what's right,
and you did wrong.

261
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:40,317
You made a mistake,
and I'm just pointing that out, okay?

262
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:43,153
It's exhausting when you're so forceful.

263
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:46,823
Exhausting?

264
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:49,785
I see. So I'm the bad one here.

265
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:52,287
I'm so sorry for giving you a hard time.

266
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:53,580
The villain will go, then.

267
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:54,831
Don't talk like that.

268
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:57,667
No. I'll get lost.
I won't give you a hard time.

269
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:59,795
I made you bring me lunch

270
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:02,714
after working until late at night.
I'm so sorry about that.

271
00:23:05,383 --> 00:23:07,052
-I'm sorry.
-Let go.

272
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:09,638
Don't follow me or call me again.

273
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:17,270
Did you fight again?

274
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,815
Why do you fight so often?

275
00:23:20,398 --> 00:23:22,484
I don't know. Things just keep coming up.

276
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:24,611
We keep fighting over petty things.

277
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:27,948
-Break up with him.
-Men are always like that.

278
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:29,574
Break up.

279
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:30,951
-Come on.
-Hey.

280
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:34,079
-What?
-Why do you keep saying that?

281
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:35,747
We already set the wedding date.

282
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:38,625
You don't fight to fix each other.
It's to adjust.

283
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:41,169
Exactly.
Couples aren't perfect from the start.

284
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:42,796
They should be, if it's fate.

285
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:44,548
How could you be so naive?

286
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:46,299
What kind of fairy tale is that?

287
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:49,553
I mean, if you two are
meant to be together.

288
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:51,555
She and Sang-hyeok are meant to be.

289
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:54,724
That's what the fortune-teller
from Sillim-dong said.

290
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:57,269
I just bribed the fortune-teller.

291
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:03,066
I knew it. There's no way we can
measure up to your way of thinking.

292
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:04,317
You progressive woman.

293
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:07,696
Is it okay to lie about something
so big like marriage?

294
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:11,741
What if you end up meeting
your soul mate or something?

295
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:15,078
It's not like my soul mate shows up
saying, "I'm your soul mate."

296
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:18,248
If I make someone my soul mate,
he's my soul mate.

297
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:21,042
And if I lose my soul mate
who's destined for me, it's over.

298
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:28,133
What? Why? What's wrong?

299
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:30,218
Woo-yeon, breathe.

300
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:36,683
I almost passed out from shock.

301
00:24:37,392 --> 00:24:40,437
I can't believe I heard
such a thing from you.

302
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,522
Unbelievable.

303
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:52,199
I guess it won't be over for you, though.

304
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:01,458
I'll be right back.

305
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:04,336
Go ahead. Make it quick.

306
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:19,434
What is it? Why did you come?

307
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:22,479
You told me not to call you

308
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:24,522
and follow you.

309
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:26,733
So I came to see you.

310
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:30,862
If you have anything to say, say it.

311
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:37,494
I wasn't being insincere.

312
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:41,873
You have a discerning eye,

313
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:44,542
and I felt I couldn't match your taste.

314
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:49,547
I just wanted to go with what you liked.

315
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:52,050
That's why I let you choose everything.

316
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:57,347
Because I like whatever you like.

317
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:03,395
I'm sorry I made you feel that way.

318
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:05,563
I mean it.

319
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:08,900
I'm sorry too.

320
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:13,113
I'm sorry for being so pushy.

321
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:15,115
Why are you crying?

322
00:26:16,574 --> 00:26:17,951
Come here.

323
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:26,209
I'm sorry.

324
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:27,877
I'm more sorry.

325
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:29,671
No, I'm sorry.

326
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:36,428
They've finally adapted
to each other after fighting.

327
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:50,608
If you are so quick to judge things
from the beginning,

328
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:53,236
no matter whom you meet
and what kind of love they offer,

329
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,612
you won't receive it.

330
00:26:55,613 --> 00:26:59,784
Wear the thickest armor you can afford.

331
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:02,120
Then it's one or the other.

332
00:27:02,203 --> 00:27:04,331
Whether the armor crushes you to death

333
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:06,750
or you take it off.

334
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:10,503
It's not like my soul mate shows up
saying, "I'm your soul mate."

335
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:13,381
If I make someone my soul mate,
he's my soul mate.

336
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:18,094
But if someone changed,

337
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:19,929
and if it was because of someone else,

338
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:22,807
that's an amazing thing.

339
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:27,854
Thank you for showing up in front of Su.

340
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:47,957
LEE SU

341
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:02,097
The receiver cannot be reached.

342
00:28:10,688 --> 00:28:14,901
WOO-YEON CALLIGRAPHY

343
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:26,681
Our timing is never right.

344
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:57,545
INTERVIEW WITH
PHOTOGRAPHER AND ARTIST LEE SU

345
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:05,970
What is your favorite photo
you have taken so far?

346
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:07,263
The self-portrait photo.

347
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:11,267
My principle of only taking photos of
the things I love applied to myself, too.

348
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:13,812
So I had never taken
a photo of myself before.

349
00:30:14,562 --> 00:30:18,525
Come to think of it,
I had never truly loved myself.

350
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:22,570
But I was finally ready to love myself,

351
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:25,240
so I had the courage
to take a photo of myself.

352
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:28,243
I met someone.

353
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:31,371
I received love
more than I deserved from her.

354
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:33,915
I was able to grow thanks to her.

355
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:38,002
The moment I took a photo
of myself for the first time,

356
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:40,547
I could finally face my world.

357
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:45,635
It was the most sincere photo
I'd ever taken,

358
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:48,721
and it will be for a while.

359
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:58,731
A photographer's
point of view is like a filter,

360
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:00,275
so his photos show his emotions.

361
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:03,820
For a photographer, eyes are everything.

362
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:41,858
EVERY MOMENT OF MY LIFE WAS A COINCIDENCE

363
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:53,870
EVERY MOMENT OF MY LIFE WAS A COINCIDENCE

364
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:11,471
Did I

365
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:14,933
make you cry again?

366
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:18,019
What's with you?

367
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:20,563
Why did you not answer my call?

368
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:22,315
I left my phone here.

369
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:26,486
I came to find it,

370
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:28,655
but I found you.

371
00:32:29,405 --> 00:32:30,615
Don't smile.

372
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:33,076
I'm sorry.

373
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:35,995
I was happy to see you.

374
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:38,206
I guess you're not happy.

375
00:32:39,582 --> 00:32:40,875
I made you cry again.

376
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:43,211
Right.

377
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,422
I hate you.

378
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:50,301
You're awful.

379
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:52,804
You can curse me if you want.

380
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:55,890
You can say

381
00:32:58,017 --> 00:32:59,519
everything you want.

382
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,498
I haven't changed.

383
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:24,502
I'm still

384
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:28,047
in love with you.

385
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:35,972
Say something.

386
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:39,017
If you're happy I'm here, say it.

387
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:43,813
If I'm too late, just say so.

388
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:53,990
You can never be too late.

389
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,660
I've always been yours.

390
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:12,633
I'm sorry

391
00:34:13,968 --> 00:34:15,219
for keeping you alone.

392
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:17,388
For making you cry.

393
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:25,063
I only cared about myself.

394
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:30,568
I didn't think about
what you were going through.

395
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:34,405
Wallowing in my emotions,
I just resented you.

396
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:37,867
I'm so sorry.

397
00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:42,789
If we start apologizing,
I won't be able to leave here tonight.

398
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:50,546
Gosh, we're still so immature.

399
00:34:52,715 --> 00:34:54,467
We just got older.

400
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:56,177
So we should grow up together.

401
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:59,180
And let's stop giving others hard times.

402
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:12,610
We are perfect for each other.

403
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:29,752
-Are we really going to be okay?
-What are you nervous about?

404
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:32,630
They say couples break up
for the same reasons.

405
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:36,551
We broke up once.

406
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:40,972
We can't be sure it won't happen again.

407
00:35:43,766 --> 00:35:45,268
Then I'll come back to you.

408
00:35:46,727 --> 00:35:47,979
I'll keep holding onto you.

409
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:50,439
I'll stay with you

410
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:54,152
until you get really sick of me.

411
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:58,406
You don't want to go away anymore?

412
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:01,659
I might go on a trip from time to time,

413
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:04,370
but I won't stay away for a long time.

414
00:36:06,038 --> 00:36:07,707
Am I holding you back?

415
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:09,083
I want to be held back.

416
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:12,003
I've always wanted you to hold onto me.

417
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:16,090
Then keep staying by my side.

418
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:18,384
I'll make you happy.

419
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:20,636
-Even happier than now?
-Sure.

420
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,847
Then I might die of happiness.

421
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:29,979
It was killing me to hold back.

422
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:36,777
Now you're letting me have my way.

423
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:40,615
I let you have your way three years ago,

424
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,950
so it's your turn to do so.

425
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:44,118
That's just…

426
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:47,830
You kept pushing me away, so I was upset.

427
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:52,627
Gosh, what should I do with you, you baby?

428
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:56,505
Look who's talking. You confess
your feelings when I have to leave.

429
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:59,592
Then I can't let you go nor hold onto you.

430
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:04,597
I'm sorry.

431
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:08,267
It was immature of me.

432
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:11,604
I told you, we should grow up together.

433
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:14,440
Kiss me if you agree.

434
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:07,034
Where are you going?

435
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:08,911
Weren't you asleep?

436
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:11,872
I just woke up.

437
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:13,874
I thought you were leaving.

438
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:18,254
I'm not going anywhere.
You can let go of me.

439
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:23,050
No. Let's sleep a little more.

440
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:39,817
All right. This is curry.

441
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,027
Wow.

442
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:44,613
Why do you have so much curry
in the freezer?

443
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:46,699
Mom made it.

444
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:52,663
Are you getting along with your mom now?

445
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:54,373
Kind of.

446
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,253
Actually,

447
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:02,548
your mom came to see me.

448
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:04,633
Did she say something?

449
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:07,511
She didn't say anything bad.

450
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:10,556
She gave me a painting.

451
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:12,641
To thank me.

452
00:39:14,226 --> 00:39:17,271
And she gave me the courage
to come back to you.

453
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:18,647
She did?

454
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:24,278
Tell your mom that we got back together.

455
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:27,365
Okay.

456
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:30,326
Let's eat. We will have a long day.

457
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:33,871
-Are we going somewhere?
-We have something to do.

458
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:38,542
100 QUESTIONS FOR COUPLES

459
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:40,544
Why do you want to do this?

460
00:39:42,671 --> 00:39:46,008
I thought about it, and like you said,
we weren't even friends.

461
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:50,262
I thought I knew all about you,

462
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:54,517
but I think the conviction and arrogance
was the reason we broke up.

463
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:56,852
I'm going to change that.

464
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:59,230
-Really?
-I said I would try.

465
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:03,776
Let's try together.

466
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:12,034
Next. Number 19.

467
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:14,537
"Which body part
are you most confident about?"

468
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:15,996
My face.

469
00:40:18,332 --> 00:40:22,545
Number 20. "Which part of your face
are you most confident about?"

470
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:24,130
Do I have to pick one?

471
00:40:24,713 --> 00:40:25,798
Does it have to be one?

472
00:40:25,881 --> 00:40:27,383
Yes. You have to pick only one.

473
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:30,302
Gosh, this is too hard.

474
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:32,513
My features?

475
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:35,975
I see.

476
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:38,352
EYES, EYEBROWS, EYELASHES

477
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:39,812
Fine.

478
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:43,774
Number 42. "What do you do
when you get drunk?"

479
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,402
I saw you drunk already.

480
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:47,570
Hey.

481
00:40:48,487 --> 00:40:50,990
Number 43. "What do you do
when you feel good?"

482
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:52,992
I smile broadly.

483
00:40:53,075 --> 00:40:55,911
That's not true. You don't smile broadly.

484
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:57,163
Then what do I do?

485
00:40:58,205 --> 00:41:00,499
You smile in a pretty, dazzling way.

486
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:05,629
Yes. I got it right.

487
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:10,509
Number 73. "What's your
most precious memory?"

488
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:15,473
Gyeong Woo-yeon.

489
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:21,896
Number 74. "Have you ever cried
out of happiness?"

490
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,064
Not yet.

491
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:27,651
But if I ever cry,
it will be because of you.

492
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:33,699
Number 75. "Have you ever cried
out of sadness, then?"

493
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:36,994
It wasn't long ago.

494
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:39,830
I guess it was because of you, too.

495
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:44,502
I'm so stupid.

496
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:47,379
I thought I really liked you.

497
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:50,799
But it turns out I like you incredibly,

498
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:54,261
and I just realized it.

499
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:02,561
Gosh, if it weren't for you,
I wouldn't have been so stupid.

500
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,776
-All right.
-Next.

501
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:14,657
MY SON

502
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:17,201
Hey, son. What's the matter?

503
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:18,285
Nothing.

504
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:20,579
You just made my day.

505
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:23,999
I'm seeing Woo-yeon.

506
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:25,668
Really? You're back together?

507
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:27,503
Yes, we are.

508
00:42:30,172 --> 00:42:33,133
Son, are you happy now?

509
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:37,263
Yes.

510
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:41,141
I'm sorry to say this, but I'm feeling
entirely happy for the first time.

511
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:44,186
Why do you feel sorry?

512
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:46,564
I'm happy for you.

513
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:50,568
I'm so grateful to her.

514
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:53,904
Thank you for being on my side, Mom.

515
00:43:00,035 --> 00:43:00,995
Bye.

516
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:16,051
Hey, it's me. Did you eat?

517
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:22,808
Shall we circle the block once more?

518
00:43:23,392 --> 00:43:25,227
We did it seven times already.

519
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:30,357
Gosh, why is the alley so short?

520
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:33,068
We can go to a longer alley next time.

521
00:43:33,152 --> 00:43:35,613
Maybe we should
walk the Santiago pilgrimage route.

522
00:43:37,531 --> 00:43:38,824
What should we do tomorrow?

523
00:43:39,825 --> 00:43:41,994
I have plans tomorrow.

524
00:43:42,077 --> 00:43:42,911
With whom?

525
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:45,873
Mr. On.

526
00:43:47,249 --> 00:43:48,334
On Jun-su?

527
00:43:49,501 --> 00:43:50,753
Yes.

528
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:56,592
Is it for work or something personal?

529
00:43:56,675 --> 00:44:00,554
Well, it's somewhere in-between.

530
00:44:01,555 --> 00:44:04,642
I recently worked on a movie title.

531
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:07,061
And Metaphor published its original novel.

532
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:09,813
So I was invited to the preview.

533
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:14,360
Just focus on work, then.

534
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:16,236
Don't do anything personal.

535
00:44:17,237 --> 00:44:18,280
Okay.

536
00:44:18,864 --> 00:44:21,408
You look cute when you're jealous.

537
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:23,786
Can I be jealous?

538
00:44:23,869 --> 00:44:26,246
Why would you even ask that?

539
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:30,000
Just figure it out yourself
and don't overdo it.

540
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:33,087
-But you don't like it when I get jealous.
-I never said that.

541
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:34,672
That's your relationship type.

542
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:38,676
Ludus. You hate jealousy and obsession.

543
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:41,637
How can I date someone without all that

544
00:44:42,596 --> 00:44:43,889
when I like them?

545
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:52,606
You sound so sweet, Woo-yeon.

546
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:58,445
Really? Did they get back together?

547
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:00,197
That's great news.

548
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:03,117
I know. It's great, right?

549
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:04,952
That punk.

550
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:08,831
But why did he not tell me?

551
00:45:13,919 --> 00:45:16,797
What? Do you have something to say?

552
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,677
I told you before

553
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:26,140
that emotions are determined
by the person who receives them.

554
00:45:28,183 --> 00:45:30,436
Right. You did.

555
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:36,775
Now I think it was
arrogant of me to say that.

556
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:43,907
I realized this
as I saw them get back together.

557
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:49,371
I think it would be okay to see you again.

558
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:54,418
What?

559
00:45:57,379 --> 00:45:58,714
Do you still like movies?

560
00:46:00,549 --> 00:46:02,551
Of course I do.

561
00:46:03,677 --> 00:46:05,387
Then let's go to the movies instead.

562
00:46:08,223 --> 00:46:09,600
But you don't like movies.

563
00:46:10,851 --> 00:46:13,228
I will try to like them again.

564
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:23,947
Oh, gosh.

565
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:26,033
It's hot.

566
00:46:29,786 --> 00:46:32,039
HAN THEATER

567
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:52,267
Did you like the movie?

568
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:54,269
Yes, it was fun.

569
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:58,190
Well…

570
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:02,903
I have something to tell you.

571
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:06,573
Not here. Can we go somewhere and sit?

572
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:11,286
I think I know what you'll say.

573
00:47:18,877 --> 00:47:21,004
I thought you wouldn't
want to eat with me.

574
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:27,219
I heard you're seeing him again.

575
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:31,181
Right.

576
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:36,103
Why do you like him?
He always makes you cry.

577
00:47:38,939 --> 00:47:40,065
No reason.

578
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:44,152
I like him even when I cry or feel hurt.

579
00:47:45,737 --> 00:47:47,573
And I also like it when I'm with him.

580
00:47:48,073 --> 00:47:51,076
I saw you break up once, so should I wait?

581
00:47:51,785 --> 00:47:55,163
But I saw you get back together too.
So should I give up?

582
00:47:57,958 --> 00:48:00,419
I'm not clinging to you.
And I don't have regrets.

583
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,297
Just don't cry.

584
00:48:06,258 --> 00:48:08,260
Don't walk around with a sad face.

585
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,351
I won't be like that again.

586
00:48:18,478 --> 00:48:21,148
But you don't have to pretend
to be fine when you're sad.

587
00:48:22,608 --> 00:48:24,234
It's always hard to pretend.

588
00:48:29,489 --> 00:48:31,450
What I really want to say is

589
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:36,455
that I want you to be happy.

590
00:48:41,793 --> 00:48:44,630
Even before I knew it was you,
I always wanted

591
00:48:44,713 --> 00:48:46,882
the woman on the phone to be happy.

592
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:53,805
You too, Mr. On.

593
00:48:56,516 --> 00:48:58,977
I really want you to be happy.

594
00:49:02,689 --> 00:49:03,774
I'll try.

595
00:49:33,011 --> 00:49:36,390
He was always mean to me,
so I'll be mean to him just this once.

596
00:49:45,315 --> 00:49:46,733
Thank you

597
00:49:47,776 --> 00:49:51,196
for giving pretty words
and pretty thoughts to me.

598
00:49:54,074 --> 00:49:56,451
You taught me what it's like to be loved.

599
00:49:59,287 --> 00:50:01,039
You warmed the cockles of my heart.

600
00:50:07,212 --> 00:50:09,297
I'm sorry I was
the only one who felt warm.

601
00:50:23,019 --> 00:50:26,690
I hugged you to get rid of lingering
feelings, but you made it worse.

602
00:50:31,153 --> 00:50:34,281
Go before I want to cling to you.

603
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:05,896
We started dating again.

604
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:24,539
Stop it.

605
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:26,500
Why aren't you looking at me? Look at me.

606
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:28,335
Can't you look at my handsome face?

607
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:34,800
Gosh, I'm so embarrassed.

608
00:51:35,425 --> 00:51:36,468
Woo-yeon.

609
00:51:40,222 --> 00:51:41,681
What? Why?

610
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:43,809
Don't look at me. If I see your face,
I can't stay mad.

611
00:51:43,892 --> 00:51:45,227
How can you make jokes now?

612
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:46,812
I'm not making jokes.

613
00:51:46,895 --> 00:51:50,148
I can't let this slide, so let me
just talk to the back of your head.

614
00:51:57,447 --> 00:51:58,949
We fought often.

615
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:15,590
Woo-yeon, I'm here.

616
00:52:22,681 --> 00:52:24,391
What do you like, photography or me?

617
00:52:25,267 --> 00:52:27,060
Of course I like you.

618
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:29,145
I like you the most.

619
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:33,149
Then why did you come 30 minutes
late because of photography?

620
00:52:36,736 --> 00:52:38,113
I'm really sorry.

621
00:52:38,196 --> 00:52:39,447
Freeze.

622
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:46,329
Hey, you have to tag me before you go.

623
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:53,044
I'm so stupid. I believed him again.

624
00:52:56,673 --> 00:52:59,175
Hey, I froze you. Who told you to move?

625
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:01,136
I melted because it's so hot.

626
00:53:02,178 --> 00:53:04,264
How can you be hot when it's so chilly?

627
00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:05,765
It's always summer for me.

628
00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:08,685
Because my heart is burning for you.

629
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:14,941
Seriously, you're…

630
00:53:16,443 --> 00:53:18,028
Shall we delete this memory?

631
00:53:27,704 --> 00:53:29,289
-What?
-You forget about bitterness

632
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:30,790
if I give you something sweet.

633
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:32,375
Forget about it.

634
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:40,926
It's sweet.

635
00:53:43,178 --> 00:53:45,722
I'm letting this slide
because this tastes good, okay?

636
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:48,892
Yes. Do you want to walk?

637
00:53:59,235 --> 00:54:02,280
Conversation and expression
are other words for fighting.

638
00:54:03,615 --> 00:54:06,910
By fighting often and making up often,

639
00:54:08,036 --> 00:54:09,996
we adapted to each other.

640
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:11,414
TONIGHT

641
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:15,335
We're back together.

642
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:16,503
We're dating again.

643
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:19,381
Why is your relationship so melodramatic?

644
00:54:19,464 --> 00:54:21,174
Are you the only couple in the world?

645
00:54:21,257 --> 00:54:22,592
That's great.

646
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:26,388
Now that we all are here together,
we should go on a trip.

647
00:54:26,471 --> 00:54:28,473
How about Gangwon Province
for some healing?

648
00:54:28,556 --> 00:54:29,516
Isn't that nice?

649
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:30,976
-Sounds great.
-Is everyone in?

650
00:54:31,059 --> 00:54:33,770
Hey. There's a couple here that broke up.

651
00:54:33,853 --> 00:54:35,105
Oh, right.

652
00:54:36,147 --> 00:54:37,691
I'm fine with it.

653
00:54:38,858 --> 00:54:40,860
As long as you're okay.

654
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:42,362
Gosh, what's going on?

655
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:44,072
I'll pay for the trip.

656
00:54:44,823 --> 00:54:46,241
So when should we go?

657
00:54:46,324 --> 00:54:49,786
This is the power of money, guys.

658
00:54:49,869 --> 00:54:53,498
All right. I'll play songs
that would be perfect for our trip.

659
00:54:58,086 --> 00:54:59,212
BEST TRAVEL SONGS

660
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:17,731
-You said it'd be a trip.
-You said it'd be relaxing.

661
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:19,858
She wasn't paying for our trip.

662
00:55:19,941 --> 00:55:21,568
She was paying for our labor.

663
00:55:22,402 --> 00:55:24,195
It's real capitalism.

664
00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:26,531
Guys, I'm not asking you
to do this for free.

665
00:55:26,614 --> 00:55:27,907
I have gifts for you.

666
00:55:30,118 --> 00:55:31,036
-Gifts?
-Gifts?

667
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:32,370
Yes.

668
00:55:33,872 --> 00:55:36,875
Look at you. You look cool.

669
00:55:36,958 --> 00:55:37,792
You look great.

670
00:55:40,128 --> 00:55:41,212
You said it's a gift.

671
00:55:41,963 --> 00:55:44,841
Everything you say is a lie.

672
00:55:44,924 --> 00:55:46,009
Are you fraudsters?

673
00:55:46,092 --> 00:55:47,969
Hey, do you know how much that suit is?

674
00:55:48,053 --> 00:55:49,846
Do you know how much my pay is?

675
00:55:49,929 --> 00:55:54,100
Do you think I can't fight you
because of this elegant dress?

676
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:56,436
-Bring it on. Let's fight.
-Stop it.

677
00:55:56,519 --> 00:55:58,229
I'm holding back for Woo-yeon's sake.

678
00:55:58,313 --> 00:56:00,398
-Then don't.
-Okay. Let's fight.

679
00:56:00,982 --> 00:56:02,734
Fine. Go ahead.

680
00:56:02,817 --> 00:56:04,486
-Come on.
-Come here.

681
00:56:04,569 --> 00:56:05,987
That's the real gift.

682
00:56:42,774 --> 00:56:45,360
What's going on? Why are you so pretty?

683
00:56:45,443 --> 00:56:47,695
-Stop it.
-Can you believe this?

684
00:56:48,446 --> 00:56:50,406
This is my 3,840th time falling for you.

685
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:51,616
Really?

686
00:57:04,045 --> 00:57:05,130
You look pretty.

687
00:57:05,964 --> 00:57:08,466
Thank you. You look great too.

688
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:19,686
One, two, three.

689
00:57:20,812 --> 00:57:22,147
Sang-hyeok, get closer.

690
00:57:22,647 --> 00:57:25,316
One, two, three.

691
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:27,444
-You look pretty.
-That's pretty.

692
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:29,654
You look pretty.

693
00:57:30,321 --> 00:57:33,324
Let's do it one more time.
One, two, three.

694
00:57:34,367 --> 00:57:36,870
-One, two, three.
-Give me that.

695
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:39,122
-Pick one.
-I like this one.

696
00:57:39,205 --> 00:57:41,708
All right. Okay.

697
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:44,419
Come here.

698
00:57:45,628 --> 00:57:47,464
-Stand here.
-Gosh, no.

699
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:49,174
-Just stand there.
-You look pretty.

700
00:57:49,257 --> 00:57:50,758
-Smile.
-Why are you so down?

701
00:57:50,842 --> 00:57:52,760
-What's the problem?
-Smile.

702
00:57:52,844 --> 00:57:54,762
Go ahead and smile.

703
00:57:54,846 --> 00:57:57,599
-Just smile.
-Don't smile like that.

704
00:57:57,682 --> 00:57:58,933
One, two, three.

705
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:00,727
Sang-hyeok.

706
00:58:02,687 --> 00:58:03,980
One, two, three.

707
00:58:06,649 --> 00:58:09,068
Okay. One, two, three.

708
00:58:09,819 --> 00:58:12,739
One, two, three.

709
00:58:13,698 --> 00:58:14,866
Let's take it together.

710
00:58:15,950 --> 00:58:18,411
All right. One, two.

711
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:21,206
-Stop.
-Hey, you too?

712
00:58:26,461 --> 00:58:27,420
Give me that.

713
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:30,423
What? Why?

714
00:58:36,095 --> 00:58:40,016
Darn, you punk. Should I kill you?

715
00:58:41,893 --> 00:58:44,896
Well, every moment of my life is Woo-yeon.

716
00:58:46,105 --> 00:58:48,483
-Darn it.
-What? Stop that.

717
00:58:49,943 --> 00:58:52,278
Do it right, okay?

718
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:54,113
Come here. Let's do it again.

719
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:55,490
That punk.

720
00:59:00,119 --> 00:59:03,748
You're still like a baby,
but you're getting married.

721
00:59:03,831 --> 00:59:06,084
We met in high school,
and you're getting married.

722
00:59:06,668 --> 00:59:09,170
I still remember the Han Jin-ju
studying English words

723
00:59:09,254 --> 00:59:10,672
in round glasses.

724
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:13,967
-I'm happy.
-I'm sad, but you're just happy?

725
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:16,594
I even feel like crying,
but you're just happy?

726
00:59:16,678 --> 00:59:20,848
Yes. I'm happy I'm getting married,
but it's not just that.

727
00:59:20,932 --> 00:59:24,477
I'm also happy that my friends
who remember my high school times

728
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:26,729
are here to celebrate my wedding.

729
00:59:28,022 --> 00:59:30,858
The time we've shared
makes me feel reassured and happy.

730
00:59:30,942 --> 00:59:31,818
I feel reassured.

731
00:59:33,194 --> 00:59:34,904
I'll kill you if you make Jin-ju cry.

732
00:59:36,656 --> 00:59:39,242
All right, everyone.
Did you enjoy your dinner?

733
00:59:39,325 --> 00:59:40,618
-Yes.
-Yes.

734
00:59:40,702 --> 00:59:43,621
First, I'd like to thank you all

735
00:59:43,705 --> 00:59:46,332
for coming all the way here in the cold.

736
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:50,211
Please give Han Jin-ju a big hand
for throwing this party for us.

737
00:59:50,795 --> 00:59:52,088
You're the best.

738
00:59:53,131 --> 00:59:55,675
Thanks to your love and support, we will

739
00:59:55,758 --> 00:59:58,344
try to live happily ever after
till death do us part.

740
00:59:59,971 --> 01:00:03,016
Please make sure to bring
fat envelopes to our wedding…

741
01:00:03,099 --> 01:00:04,851
Puppy, that's enough.

742
01:00:39,844 --> 01:00:43,139
You're still wearing the ring.

743
01:00:46,517 --> 01:00:47,644
Yes.

744
01:01:01,407 --> 01:01:02,575
Hyeon-jae.

745
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:10,541
I'm still cranky and gloomy.

746
01:01:11,876 --> 01:01:14,671
I still have complicated thoughts
that you can't understand.

747
01:01:14,754 --> 01:01:17,048
And I'm still poor,

748
01:01:17,799 --> 01:01:19,509
so I'll have to work hard.

749
01:01:22,011 --> 01:01:23,346
If you're with me,

750
01:01:24,597 --> 01:01:27,809
you will have to work hard too.

751
01:01:29,185 --> 01:01:32,480
I will make you do the housework.

752
01:01:32,563 --> 01:01:34,607
I'll peel shrimp only for me.

753
01:01:39,654 --> 01:01:40,905
But

754
01:01:43,157 --> 01:01:44,367
if your proposal

755
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:48,287
still stands,

756
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:54,293
will you marry me?

757
01:01:59,215 --> 01:02:01,134
-Yes.
-Okay.

758
01:02:06,222 --> 01:02:08,099
Don't cry. If you cry, I'll take it back.

759
01:02:08,182 --> 01:02:09,767
I'm not crying.

760
01:02:09,851 --> 01:02:11,394
-Yes, you are.
-I'm not.

761
01:02:27,952 --> 01:02:28,911
I love you.

762
01:02:29,954 --> 01:02:31,414
I love you too.

763
01:03:49,951 --> 01:03:52,119
GYEONG WOO-YEON, LEE SU

764
01:04:03,881 --> 01:04:06,759
-Hey, let go.
-Stop it.

765
01:04:10,054 --> 01:04:12,098
We never know what the future holds.

766
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:16,060
They were broken up yesterday,
but they're lovers today.

767
01:04:17,562 --> 01:04:20,690
And two people I thought would be
friends forever are getting married.

768
01:04:22,650 --> 01:04:24,151
I don't know about others,

769
01:04:24,652 --> 01:04:26,779
but I do know what our future holds.

770
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:29,699
Hey!

771
01:04:30,491 --> 01:04:31,659
What will happen?

772
01:04:31,742 --> 01:04:34,370
GYEONG WOO-YEON, LEE SU

773
01:04:37,790 --> 01:04:41,586
GYEONG WOO-YEON'S SU

774
01:04:46,173 --> 01:04:47,592
We will continue to be happy.

775
01:04:49,010 --> 01:04:50,303
Because we're meant to be.

776
01:04:56,267 --> 01:04:58,102
This happiness

777
01:04:59,103 --> 01:05:01,480
might just be passing us by.

778
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:04,567
We may break up.

779
01:05:05,401 --> 01:05:06,944
We may be happy together forever.

780
01:05:07,820 --> 01:05:10,615
Or we may break up and get back
together over and over again.

781
01:05:12,241 --> 01:05:15,286
There are a lot of things
that can happen between us,

782
01:05:15,369 --> 01:05:17,705
so I can't be sure of anything.

783
01:05:17,788 --> 01:05:20,708
I just try to love you completely today.

784
01:05:21,709 --> 01:05:24,629
Even though a lot of things
can happen between us,

785
01:05:24,712 --> 01:05:25,796
I'm sure of one thing.

786
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:28,925
Even if our timing is never right…

787
01:05:29,008 --> 01:05:31,052
-My only choice
-My only choice

788
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:32,345
-is you.
-is you.

789
01:06:45,501 --> 01:06:48,254
Su, come over here.

790
01:06:51,966 --> 01:06:53,050
What is it?

791
01:06:57,304 --> 01:07:00,433
YOU MUST HAVE THE COURAGE
TO BE CONFIDENT WHEN YOU LOVE

792
01:07:00,516 --> 01:07:02,935
THEN LOVE WILL BRING THAT PERSON TO YOU

793
01:07:08,441 --> 01:07:15,322
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING MORE THAN FRIENDS

794
01:07:16,991 --> 01:07:21,996
