1
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:05,565
I HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN YOU
EVEN WHEN THE FLOWERS WITHERED AWAY

2
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:25,168
I HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN YOU
EVEN WHEN THE FLOWERS WITHERED AWAY

3
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,054
I would like to thank our guests
for attending

4
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:39,224
the 20th-anniversary event
of Metaphor Publishing House.

5
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:42,727
The CEO, On Jun-su, will now
say a few words.

6
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:45,063
METAPHOR PUBLISHING HOUSE'S
20TH-ANNIVERSARY EVENT

7
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:56,449
It's been 20 years since
our publishing house was established.

8
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:59,577
We could come this far
thanks to all of your support.

9
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:01,663
Books are nothing more

10
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:04,124
than words printed on paper
until they are read.

11
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:07,669
Hence, I believed selling books was
what publishing houses were meant for.

12
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:11,673
I broke away from the conventional idea

13
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:13,133
that I must advertise books…

14
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:14,676
-What was that?
-What happened?

15
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:16,886
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

16
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,931
-I'm really sorry.
-Are you all right?

17
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:21,891
I'm sorry. Clean this up.

18
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:27,856
I hope you like the sound effect
I prepared for you.

19
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:36,322
Our publishing house has been aiming
to introduce books

20
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,659
that people want to keep
and are within arm's reach

21
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:41,536
for the last 20 years.

22
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,623
And this was only possible
thanks to the support you have shown us.

23
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:48,126
As we remind ourselves of our principles,

24
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:51,546
we will do our best in forging
a close relationship between our writers

25
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:54,090
and our readers.

26
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:56,384
Thank you.

27
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:11,274
Ms. Gyeong Woo-yeon.
What do you think you're doing?

28
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:20,533
I work part-time at a cafe
on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.

29
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:23,661
Enjoy your drink.

30
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:27,624
I teach after-school classes on Tuesdays.

31
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:33,463
And when I need more money,
I take on temp jobs.

32
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:38,009
HAPPINESS IS ALWAYS AROUND US

33
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:42,430
And the rest of the days,
I'm a calligrapher.

34
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,309
I'm not sure.

35
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:51,773
What am I doing with my life?

36
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,114
Do you want them wrapped?

37
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,200
Yes, please.

38
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,370
It's 2,000 won. Are you sure?

39
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:09,207
Just the men's underwear.

40
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:17,882
Please make the ribbon look nice.

41
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:28,935
Gosh, she's so grumpy.

42
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,529
-Hey.
-What are you doing?

43
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:42,448
Me? Nothing.

44
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:44,993
I guess you had a busy day.
What did you do today?

45
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,828
It's none of your business.

46
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:49,539
What are we doing tomorrow?

47
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:56,170
HAPPY 100TH DAY
THANK YOU

48
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:15,732
All done.

49
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,285
-Woo-yeon.
-Yes?

50
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:28,828
I love you.

51
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:32,874
I said, I love you.

52
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:34,208
Okay.

53
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:45,595
Let's break up.

54
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:54,937
We should break up.

55
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:58,399
Sure. Okay.

56
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:16,793
HAPPY 100TH DAY, THANK YOU

57
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:41,150
Wait.

58
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,361
I'm done.

59
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:45,863
My goodness.

60
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,783
-No, focus.
-Focus.

61
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:52,203
Wait a second.

62
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,288
Okay.

63
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:56,541
Let's use the blanket.

64
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:58,334
Hold on.

65
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:03,256
Yeong-hui, we just broke up.

66
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:04,966
This crazy bitch.

67
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:08,094
Does she collect exes as a hobby?
She broke up again?

68
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,096
We have no choice.

69
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:12,348
Right.

70
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,271
Let's make it quick, baby.

71
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:21,023
-What about Woo-yeon?
-She's got Jin-ju.

72
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:22,233
Come here.

73
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:25,862
That hits the spot.

74
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,490
I'm getting a fancy massage thanks to you.

75
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:31,993
I love it.

76
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:34,871
You worked so hard
on the Baek Chun-sik drug case.

77
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:38,458
I didn't do much.
You did all the heavy lifting.

78
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:41,544
To be honest,

79
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:44,005
you are younger than me,

80
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:48,176
but… How should I put it?
You're beautiful and good at your job.

81
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:50,094
You have my full respect.

82
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,597
I respect you.

83
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,182
How did the blind date go?

84
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:57,143
Oh, that?
I decided not to go on that date.

85
00:07:57,226 --> 00:07:59,770
Why not? You said he's a handsome doctor.

86
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:03,107
He is, but he wasn't what I expected.

87
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:05,735
He's 30 years old.

88
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:08,654
But goodness.
He's never dated a woman before.

89
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:16,120
-What's wrong with that?
-Isn't it obvious?

90
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:18,164
If he's never dated given his age,

91
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:21,042
I'm sure there's something wrong with him

92
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:22,543
either physically or mentally.

93
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:25,838
How else would he have
never dated anyone for that long?

94
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:32,762
I didn't mean it like that.

95
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:38,809
Let me apologize for what I said.
I'm sorry.

96
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:43,314
No, don't apologize.

97
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:45,233
I'm so happy.

98
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:46,943
Can I get some water?

99
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:57,954
Your phone has been ringing for a while.
You might want to check.

100
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:05,086
WE JUST BROKE UP. CAN YOU COME OUT?

101
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:07,129
PLEASE

102
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,422
Are you crazy?

103
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:10,758
You even got him a present.
Why did you break up?

104
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:13,636
I was dumped.

105
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,931
Meet you at Tonight?

106
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:20,017
That crazy bastard.

107
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:22,395
How could he dump me
on our 100th day anniversary?

108
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:24,564
It's as if he was waiting for today
to dump me.

109
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:25,690
I bet he did.

110
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:27,525
Is he a pervert?
Who waits 100 days to dump someone?

111
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:31,696
He was probably waiting to be loved.

112
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:44,750
I'm sorry. We just closed for the night.

113
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,796
But it looks open.
There are people inside.

114
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:51,507
They're not people.
They're alcohol-sucking monsters.

115
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:54,176
Anyway, when you come back next time,

116
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,012
I'll give you an omelet on the house.

117
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:58,264
I see. Okay. We'll go, then.

118
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:01,434
Okay. I'm sorry. Please come again.

119
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:04,937
How does it feel after a breakup?
I heard some people can't even eat.

120
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:09,817
-I love that you eat well.
-Gosh, you're so unreasonable, Woo-yeon.

121
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,278
I turned away my precious customers
because of you.

122
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:15,156
Why do you keep breaking up?

123
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:17,116
Yes, that's enough.

124
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:19,035
It's not like I asked for it.

125
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:22,246
Given that you have 12 exes,
you might be one of those people.

126
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,414
An ex collector.

127
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:28,794
How come no one is trying to console me
when I just got dumped?

128
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:30,504
-It's not the first time.
-It's not the first time.

129
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:32,465
-Jinx.
-Buttercup.

130
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,427
-I want to have a breakup, too.
-I'm sure you do.

131
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,390
I want to cry after a breakup, too.

132
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,768
Prosecutor Han,
you should lower your standards.

133
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:46,604
You can't meet men like
Gang Dong-won or Zo In-sung.

134
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:50,900
Then passing the bar exam
will be a waste of my effort.

135
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,027
Who will compensate
for my time spent studying?

136
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,236
I wonder.

137
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,572
Is that why you want to date men?

138
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,867
Dating is hard even if you
really love someone, you fool.

139
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,327
Did you get that?

140
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,954
Yes. You should listen to Yeong-hui.

141
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:06,957
That goes for you, too.

142
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:08,876
You should stop that, too.

143
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,087
What do you mean?

144
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,047
You don't even like the guy,

145
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,716
but you date him anyway,
hoping you'd fall for the guy.

146
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,302
It's not good for you or the guy you date.

147
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:22,139
Do you want a soft tofu stew
or a fishcake soup?

148
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:24,809
-Fishcake soup.
-I'll make it once you finish that.

149
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:32,441
What is it?

150
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,902
What? It's nothing.

151
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:38,072
I'm going to use the toilet.

152
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:39,031
Okay.

153
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:43,494
TONIGHT

154
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,465
You should never date.

155
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:59,176
You don't know how to love someone.

156
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:04,265
I don't know how to love someone.

157
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:07,101
That's my curse.

158
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:10,020
A curse that prevents me from

159
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:12,314
loving anyone.

160
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:19,405
SPRING OF 2012

161
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,329
Except for one guy.

162
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:29,999
He was the exception.

163
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:36,213
WINTER OF 2014

164
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,884
"Out of sight,

165
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:42,428
out of mind."

166
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:44,722
But why

167
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,809
am I remembering you more clearly?

168
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:51,395
You asshole!

169
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:53,481
SUMMER OF 2015

170
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:56,734
Why can't I stop having feelings for you?
Damn it.

171
00:12:58,152 --> 00:12:59,612
This is so annoying.

172
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:10,122
AUTUMN OF 2016

173
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:41,737
HAKUNA MATATA

174
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,199
PHOTO ALBUM

175
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:47,243
MY DEAR BESTIES

176
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:50,996
OUR FRIENDSHIP IS FOREVER

177
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,289
WE'RE SO CUTE TOGETHER

178
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,293
OUR GROUP PHOTO

179
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:57,795
VOLUNTEERING AT DONGHAE

180
00:13:57,878 --> 00:14:01,882
OUR SCHOOL IS SO PRETTY

181
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:13,269
-What?
-You're looking at a handsome student.

182
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:15,563
Your shoelace came undone.

183
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,277
I guess someone is thinking about me.

184
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,445
If that's what makes shoelaces come loose,

185
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:24,905
mine will always come loose.

186
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:28,993
-You're crazy.
-Let's go.

187
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:34,582
Flowers are in full bloom.

188
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:36,834
But yellow dust and spring fatigue

189
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:39,003
have returned with spring, too.

190
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,005
Let me ask this to you all.

191
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:45,759
Are you on track to complete the goals
you set at the beginning of the semester?

192
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:48,053
"This too shall pass."

193
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:50,556
I'm sure some of you
have heard this saying.

194
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,434
This saying was found in Midrash,

195
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:55,561
a Jewish biblical interpretation.

196
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:56,896
One day, David brought

197
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:59,773
-a ring to a craft worker.
-He's so handsome.

198
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:03,819
And he asked the craft worker
to engrave something on it.

199
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:07,281
"A phrase that keeps me in check
after victories…"

200
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:09,283
I thought you were just slacking off.

201
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:12,995
But letting you skip study hall paid off.
You always win awards.

202
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:16,373
"Engrave a phrase that gives me courage."

203
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:17,416
This student won

204
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,296
an award at the 15th Lee Sang National
High School Essay Contest.

205
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:25,674
I hereby give her the certificate
for the award.

206
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:36,769
Hey.

207
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,980
Take your certificate.

208
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:48,155
-Hey, she can be odd at times.
-She's weird.

209
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:55,537
That is all for the morning assembly.

210
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,221
-Su, I made this for you.
-Take this, please.

211
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:13,931
I made tangerine tarts for you.

212
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:17,893
-You're so hot!
-Su!

213
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:21,105
Ji-hyeon.

214
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:24,733
Here.

215
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,069
The third season of Gossip Girl
that you wanted.

216
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:32,741
Nice. I have Ethics for my first period.
I could've died of boredom.

217
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,076
Are you going to watch it in class?

218
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,328
It's all right. I won't lose it.

219
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:38,580
Woo-yeon.

220
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:43,293
Are you suffering from selective memory?

221
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:46,046
Or are you throwing it out
because you won so many awards?

222
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:48,257
I knew something was missing.

223
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:51,510
Hey. Take this.

224
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:52,428
What's that?

225
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,263
Tangerine tarts. You like tangerines.

226
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:57,307
I like tangerines, too.

227
00:16:57,391 --> 00:17:00,477
So what? Will you steal the tarts, too?

228
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,646
-Like you stole her media player?
-No, she--

229
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,064
Bye.

230
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:09,236
We can eat them together.

231
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,571
So annoying.

232
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:19,830
I'm sorry.

233
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:23,250
-Here.
-Hey, Gyeong Woo-yeon.

234
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,090
I like tangerine tarts, too.

235
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:36,680
Yeong-hui, it's raining.

236
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:39,850
-Here.
-It's fine.

237
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:41,018
Let's go.

238
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:52,988
Let's walk together. Where are you going?

239
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:57,076
Over there to the intersection.
Past Smile Tteokbokki.

240
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:59,495
You know you have to eat it
once you mention it, right?

241
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:02,915
Of course. Let's go. It's on me.

242
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,793
You're so nice.

243
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:07,002
What do you mean?

244
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:10,172
You're the first person
who wants to buy me food.

245
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:12,466
Let's go.

246
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:20,557
-Isn't their tteokbokki so good?
-Yes.

247
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:31,443
No way. Were you waiting for me?

248
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:33,487
How did you know I needed an umbrella?

249
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:36,073
Let's go.

250
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:45,582
Mom. Dad. I'm buying this
with the prize money I won so dig in.

251
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:49,419
When did our little girl grow up?
She's buying us beef.

252
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:51,755
I'm about to tear up.

253
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:55,217
I'll become a really famous writer
and buy you a cattle farm.

254
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,636
We don't need that. Just go to college.

255
00:18:57,719 --> 00:19:00,889
I'll major in creative writing.
That's why I won a lot of awards.

256
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,308
What if you don't want to be
a writer later?

257
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:05,352
Creative writing majors rarely find jobs.

258
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:07,771
And did you major in pessimism?

259
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:11,483
You're the best at ruining someone's mood!

260
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:13,569
I'm going to glue
that mouth of yours shut.

261
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:16,947
No, not my mouth. I have to eat this beef.

262
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:19,867
-Honey, let's just enjoy our food today.
-Gosh.

263
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,952
Open wide. Here. You should have some.

264
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:24,663
-Hello.
-Hello.

265
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,920
I hate that girl, Gyeong Woo-yeon.

266
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:34,256
Nobody likes her,
but she keeps talking to us.

267
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,676
-And she pretends to be nice.
-I hate how she thinks she's pretty.

268
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:40,053
-I hate her.
-Same here.

269
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:41,471
I know, right?

270
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:28,704
Clean the class and don't take
any detours. Go straight home after.

271
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:30,038
-Okay.
-Okay.

272
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:38,088
Woo-yeon.

273
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:41,341
I have plans today.
Can you take my cleanup duty?

274
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:43,510
-What?
-Woo-yeon.

275
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,346
Let's go.

276
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,598
We have a club meeting.
Everyone is waiting.

277
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,686
Sorry.

278
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,188
Don't apologize to her.

279
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:57,441
CLOSE FRIENDS

280
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:01,236
No one is here.

281
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:04,239
Don't you have any friends?

282
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:07,367
What?

283
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:10,078
Why do you let those girls
walk all over you?

284
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:12,706
Why can't you stand up to them?

285
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:14,916
Watch your tongue.

286
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:17,669
-You don't know anything.
-I know everything.

287
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:19,463
It's clear to me that

288
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:22,299
you're a fool and they're taking away
your self-esteem.

289
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:24,217
Why can't you see that?

290
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:28,555
This doesn't concern you.

291
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:30,557
It bothers me.

292
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:34,478
-What?
-It bothers me.

293
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,156
What? Your class ended so early.

294
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:48,533
Seriously.
My class is the last one to finish.

295
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:51,203
SHARE AND HELP

296
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:54,039
We're meeting at nine tomorrow
to help the community center.

297
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:57,167
I have a make-up class
at my academy tomorrow.

298
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,960
I have to be there before it's late.

299
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:01,880
Gosh, your family's rich.
Why do you study so hard?

300
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:04,841
Let us common folk
come in first place for once.

301
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:08,428
Even if I don't study,
that won't be you, Number 298.

302
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:11,014
Hey.

303
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:14,559
How come you memorized my ranking?

304
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:16,019
You must be interested in me.

305
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:18,522
You're not just dumb.
You must've hurt your brain.

306
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:21,274
-I bet she's interested in me.
-Focus.

307
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:24,486
We'll finish before it gets too late.
And you two, shut up.

308
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:27,405
Dress comfortably.
Tomorrow will be a tough day.

309
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:30,951
Next, someone has to be
in charge of snacks.

310
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:32,160
Who wants to do it?

311
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:03,525
If this is the best you can do,
don't even try cutting it.

312
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:05,152
Well, I can't cut you.

313
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:07,946
Of course. You cut carrots, not people.

314
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:27,090
Yeong-hui told me to do it.

315
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:34,639
Excuse me!
Can you help me move the food trays?

316
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:36,558
Okay. She'll do it!

317
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:41,396
They're heavy. What if I hurt my back?

318
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:44,024
Okay. I'll do it.

319
00:24:51,364 --> 00:24:52,699
Woo-yeon.

320
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:54,409
-You can scoop the soup.
-Why?

321
00:24:54,492 --> 00:24:56,995
It's hot. What if I get burnt
and get a scar?

322
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:07,047
-Yeong-hui.
-Yes?

323
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:08,048
Look over there.

324
00:25:09,257 --> 00:25:12,302
I'm so envious of them. They're still
in love after all these years.

325
00:25:13,803 --> 00:25:16,932
You're jealous? They scare me.

326
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:21,061
-This way.
-Enjoy.

327
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:33,823
I'll kill you
if you make me do your work again.

328
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:36,910
-That was good.
-What?

329
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:40,288
When someone orders you around,
tell them off just like that.

330
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:44,292
It seems to me you have
this stupid idea that

331
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,628
if you endure things,
everything will be okay.

332
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:48,046
You should stop that.

333
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:51,758
If I just endure things,
there won't be any problems.

334
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:55,637
I'd avoid offending other people
or putting them in a bad mood.

335
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,846
Is that so bad?

336
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:59,766
Yes. It's bad for you.

337
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,811
If you don't take care of yourself,
who will, then?

338
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:07,732
Wait.

339
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:11,528
Do you need some help?

340
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:13,488
The wheel broke.

341
00:26:13,571 --> 00:26:15,949
-You can get on my back.
-What?

342
00:26:16,032 --> 00:26:17,742
-Please get on my back.
-I'm heavy.

343
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:21,288
-It's all right. Please.
-Gosh. Thank you, young man.

344
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:39,014
I know that I'm freakishly handsome,

345
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:42,726
but you don't have to stare like that.
You're making me blush.

346
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:45,228
It's not that.
I didn't expect that from you.

347
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:47,897
-What?
-I expected you

348
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:49,441
to be only selfish and mean.

349
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:52,986
I can come across as cold,
so people often get the wrong idea.

350
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:59,242
You don't have any friends, do you?

351
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:03,288
-I do.
-I see. Jin Sang-hyeok?

352
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:05,165
I have more friends.

353
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:07,375
Like who?

354
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:10,670
Gyeong Woo-yeon.

355
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:32,752
Are we friends?

356
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:04,367
IF YOU DON'T TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF,
WHO WILL?

357
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:11,791
I don't think

358
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:16,171
we're friends.

359
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:23,136
-To the back!
-Over here.

360
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:24,471
-Right here.
-Here.

361
00:29:28,224 --> 00:29:29,893
-Woo-yeon.
-Are you okay?

362
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:31,644
-Awesome.
-Are you okay?

363
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:34,981
-Shouldn't we get the school nurse?
-Is she hurt badly?

364
00:29:35,064 --> 00:29:36,441
-Did she faint?
-Call the nurse.

365
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:38,109
It seems pretty bad.

366
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:39,819
Are you okay?

367
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:44,324
See? We're not friends.

368
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:45,533
-That must hurt.
-Right.

369
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:50,497
Are you okay, Woo-yeon?

370
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,332
I heard it's Lee Su's fault.

371
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:53,666
Of course,

372
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:58,379
-not. It hurts.
-My goodness, poor you.

373
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:03,593
Goodness, how did you get hit that badly?
Look at that bruise.

374
00:30:03,676 --> 00:30:07,388
Gyeong Woo-yeon had it coming. I hated
when she was pretending to be our friend.

375
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:09,474
She's so stupid. I talked to her
a few times,

376
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:11,226
and she thought we were friends.

377
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:14,521
Let's just go.

378
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:18,399
You're not going anywhere.
Why are you avoiding them?

379
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:20,944
-Should we get rid of her?
-Get rid of her.

380
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:25,240
Hey! You are such cowards.

381
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:26,991
Say all of that to her face.

382
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:29,869
-Why say that behind her back? Cowards.
-Jin-ju.

383
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:32,413
Hey, you're one little snake.

384
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:34,791
Were you eavesdropping? How uncultured.

385
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:37,544
"Uncultured"?

386
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:41,548
Unbelievable. You're the one who
badmouthed her behind her back.

387
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:42,799
And in a public place.

388
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:45,343
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.
Let's go, Jin-ju.

389
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:47,053
You heard them. Why would you do that?

390
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:50,557
We're not going anywhere.
Apologize to her.

391
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:54,018
Why would I do that?
I didn't make anything up.

392
00:30:55,728 --> 00:30:59,023
Hey, you tell me. Did I make up lies?

393
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:00,900
Stop it.

394
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,361
Or what?

395
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:06,239
Will you curse at me?
Or will you punch me?

396
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:08,533
I told you to stop.

397
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:11,536
Or I won't let it slide.

398
00:31:11,619 --> 00:31:14,873
No. You will keep letting this slide.

399
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:18,376
That's who you are
and what you're good at.

400
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:22,839
You pretend to be nice and a saint.

401
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:25,884
Because you keep pretending to be nice,

402
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:27,802
it makes me look like a villain.

403
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:31,264
How disgusting.

404
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:40,398
You're good at pretending to be nice.

405
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:44,360
You bitch!

406
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,785
I told you to stop.
I said I wouldn't let it slide anymore.

407
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:54,287
You crazy bitch!

408
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:58,416
You cowards! That's three on one!

409
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:00,084
Let go of me!

410
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:04,672
Yeong-hui.

411
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:07,717
I can't take a dump now.

412
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,933
-Let go of me.
-Let go! Hey!

413
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:17,852
She told you to apologize. Why won't you?

414
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:18,937
Hey!

415
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,981
The global festival,
the World Cup, will be held next month.

416
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:24,817
I'll play the song I chose for today

417
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:26,903
while rooting for our national team.

418
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:41,042
Hey, something is going on.

419
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:44,837
-What?
-Hey, is there a fight?

420
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:46,965
Woo-yeon and Jin-ju
are fighting Hwang Ji-hyeon.

421
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:49,676
What? Jin-ju doesn't know how to fight.

422
00:32:50,426 --> 00:32:51,678
Hey, aren't you coming?

423
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:53,930
Why would I?
What if I get scars on my face?

424
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:57,058
Smartass.

425
00:32:58,267 --> 00:32:59,769
-Hey, move.
-What's going on?

426
00:33:02,605 --> 00:33:03,648
Wait.

427
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:13,574
DON'T EAT, THIS IS FOR YOUR EYES

428
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:31,217
Stop it.

429
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:33,428
Stop!

430
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:37,348
Look at you brats.
What do you think you're doing?

431
00:33:38,307 --> 00:33:39,434
Answer me!

432
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:42,437
Look at your hair. Did a war break out?

433
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:44,188
And why are you here?

434
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:49,652
You brats.

435
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:54,407
Jin-ju, you're the top of your class.
Why are you here?

436
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:01,122
That doesn't mean
I can't cause any trouble.

437
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:02,457
I'm sorry.

438
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:06,127
I'm sorry. It's all because of me.

439
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:09,464
Hey, you're my friend. I'm not going
to let them badmouth you like that.

440
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:13,092
I just wanted to get in a fight today.

441
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:19,098
Damn that asshole who called the dean.

442
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:20,933
I hope they get a cut underneath
their fingernail.

443
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:45,750
TEXT MESSAGE

444
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:00,973
What?

445
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:04,936
Is your face a canvas? It's blue
in the morning, and red at night.

446
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:07,063
And you're responsible
for painting it blue.

447
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:14,737
What's that for?

448
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:17,406
Do you not know what it's for
or how to put it on?

449
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:18,866
I'm asking you why.

450
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,326
So you can get better quickly.

451
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:23,871
You look uglier now that you're bruised.

452
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:29,085
You should cherish that.
I don't buy medicine for anyone.

453
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,882
Why are you being nice to me?

454
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:36,634
You're always around me.

455
00:35:38,594 --> 00:35:39,512
What?

456
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:42,682
For two years, we've been in the same
class, club, and neighborhood.

457
00:35:42,765 --> 00:35:44,308
You're everywhere.

458
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,811
And when I saw you,

459
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:49,355
I felt bad.

460
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:51,566
Are you pitying me?

461
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:54,360
More like sympathy.

462
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,615
Don't change yourself for others.

463
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:02,076
Whatever you do,
those who want to leave will leave

464
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,953
and those who want to stay will stay.

465
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:13,671
MEDICINE

466
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:20,261
He likes you.

467
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:23,264
How can you interpret it like that?

468
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:24,891
"Those who want to stay will stay,

469
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:26,726
so I will stay."

470
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:30,605
And furthermore, he wants to be the one
who stays with you.

471
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:34,233
You want to be a writer.
How can you not read between the lines?

472
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:38,321
-She's clueless. She's just book-smart.
-What do you know about dating, then?

473
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:40,990
Well, more than Ms. Never-dated.

474
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:42,909
I'm not the only one.

475
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:44,243
She's never dated, either.

476
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:45,536
Looks like she will soon.

477
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:48,456
No, Yeong-hui. It's not like that.

478
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:51,334
Don't be shy. That's how everyone starts.

479
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:55,671
How did you and your boyfriend
start dating?

480
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:04,847
I think it was the first day
of a new semester.

481
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:09,060
-Flip the page.
-Flip it. Let's see.

482
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:42,301
He said he saw a halo behind me.

483
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:48,140
What's this reaction?

484
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:53,020
But why won't you date anyone?

485
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,939
My mom told me once I go to college,

486
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:58,609
I can date men who look like
Gang Dong-won or Zo In-sung.

487
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:01,028
Should we keep weeding?

488
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:04,156
I should be uprooting her false hope
than the weeds here.

489
00:38:05,324 --> 00:38:07,285
Anyway, Lee Su definitely likes you.

490
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:09,578
Yeong-hui.

491
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:31,225
Does he really like me?

492
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:55,249
At first, I started to watch him
because I couldn't believe it.

493
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:10,306
He's mature.

494
00:39:11,932 --> 00:39:13,309
Su.

495
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:18,898
What are you doing here?

496
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,360
He's kind.

497
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:24,862
Woo-yeon.

498
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:36,665
What?

499
00:39:39,126 --> 00:39:42,588
Hey! What are you doing?

500
00:39:44,131 --> 00:39:45,674
What was that all about?

501
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:48,010
-You look ugly.
-What?

502
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:49,804
I must only look at beautiful things.

503
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:52,306
And he looks out for me.

504
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,642
And as I kept observing him,

505
00:39:58,062 --> 00:39:59,146
I began to like him.

506
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:03,150
That's disgusting.

507
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:07,863
You're really that blinded by love?

508
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:10,783
Listen. How can you interpret
his rude behaviors like that?

509
00:40:10,866 --> 00:40:14,078
He might come across as cold,
but he's got a heart of gold.

510
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:16,831
-No. I doubt that.
-Hey, you don't know him.

511
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:18,999
Forget it.
Let's go to a concert this Saturday.

512
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:21,335
My dad got us tickets
because our tests are over.

513
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:23,212
I can't go this Saturday.

514
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:24,880
Why not?

515
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:27,800
-Are you seeing Lee Su?
-No.

516
00:40:27,883 --> 00:40:30,261
I have the second round
for the literary competition.

517
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:31,387
Oh, right.

518
00:40:31,887 --> 00:40:34,181
If you win,
you'll be a shoo-in for college, right?

519
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,309
That's amazing.

520
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:39,770
What if you really become a famous writer?

521
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:44,442
Ms. Gyeong, can you give me an autograph?

522
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:46,902
An autograph? Goodness.

523
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:48,112
Where should I sign?

524
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:50,990
-Here.
-There? Okay.

525
00:40:51,073 --> 00:40:52,867
-Do you want a receipt?
-No.

526
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:56,370
-Number 17. Your food is ready.
-Here's your card.

527
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,820
Let's go to a concert this Saturday.

528
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:32,072
My dad got us tickets. VIP tickets.

529
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:37,286
Han Jin-ju.

530
00:41:38,412 --> 00:41:39,955
I kind of hate you today.

531
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:13,155
Good job. It was hard, wasn't it?

532
00:42:21,121 --> 00:42:22,998
LATE-NIGHT FOOD BAR

533
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:25,584
I haven't seen you two for a while.
How did the CSAT go?

534
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:28,837
Why ask us that before we eat?
We'll choke.

535
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:31,799
-It went okay.
-It's okay. Bombing tests is no big deal.

536
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:33,008
You're still young.

537
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:36,929
It's not okay.

538
00:42:37,596 --> 00:42:39,473
If I do bad,
I won't be able to go to college.

539
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:41,350
Then I won't be able to get a job.

540
00:42:41,433 --> 00:42:43,644
And not having a job means I'll be poor.

541
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:45,854
If I'm poor, my kids will resent me.

542
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:49,108
And my kids will blame me for everything
and I'll die alone.

543
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:50,818
You're taking it too far again.

544
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:54,113
Don't worry and just eat.
You didn't have dinner.

545
00:42:54,196 --> 00:42:55,364
Okay.

546
00:43:00,536 --> 00:43:02,288
Eat slowly. Or you'll get indigestion.

547
00:43:05,457 --> 00:43:07,710
Now that the CSAT is over,
what do you want to do?

548
00:43:07,793 --> 00:43:10,546
You don't work on weekends.
How about an amusement park?

549
00:43:10,629 --> 00:43:11,922
Not the weekends.

550
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:14,842
I even said no
to Jin-ju's invitation to a concert.

551
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:17,136
Why are you so busy on weekends?

552
00:43:18,345 --> 00:43:20,055
Are you seeing someone?

553
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:21,223
What?

554
00:43:42,077 --> 00:43:43,829
Try to remember Dad's face,

555
00:43:44,913 --> 00:43:48,667
so you can remember him
when you grow up later.

556
00:43:56,675 --> 00:43:58,260
Did you put beef in the fridge?

557
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:00,304
Yes, I did. Do you need it?

558
00:44:00,387 --> 00:44:02,306
I'll make soup with it. Leave it out.

559
00:44:03,098 --> 00:44:04,183
Okay.

560
00:44:05,392 --> 00:44:06,602
Son.

561
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:11,398
Going somewhere?

562
00:44:12,232 --> 00:44:15,027
I bought groceries to cook dinner for you.

563
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:17,196
I have plans.

564
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:19,114
Let's stay together on a day like today.

565
00:44:20,032 --> 00:44:21,659
Especially on a day like today,

566
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:25,287
-I want to be with my friends.
-Hey.

567
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:27,164
Your mom will be gone for a while.

568
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:33,545
Right. At your age,
your friends are the most important.

569
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:35,506
Have fun.

570
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,301
And people around your age, too.

571
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:42,429
You stayed friends after your divorce.

572
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:44,264
Don't you care what people might think?

573
00:44:49,311 --> 00:44:51,021
You two enjoy your dinner.

574
00:44:51,605 --> 00:44:52,815
I have plans.

575
00:44:52,898 --> 00:44:54,733
-You brat.
-Let him be.

576
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:58,070
He's right.

577
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:09,081
Why all of a sudden?

578
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:14,711
The literary camp will be held in Goseong,
Gangwon Province for three days.

579
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:17,965
And the essay contest will be held
at 10 a.m. tomorrow.

580
00:45:19,466 --> 00:45:21,427
We'll get going now. Get on the bus.

581
00:45:22,511 --> 00:45:23,887
-Kim Seong-jun.
-Here.

582
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:26,265
DAESUN LITERARY AWARD FOR YOUNG WRITERS

583
00:45:26,348 --> 00:45:27,683
Gyeong Woo-yeon.

584
00:45:27,766 --> 00:45:28,684
Yes.

585
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:31,103
-Thank you.
-Shin Min-seok.

586
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:37,568
LEE SU

587
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:39,862
Hello?

588
00:45:39,945 --> 00:45:41,530
Where are you? Let's hang out.

589
00:45:41,613 --> 00:45:42,948
I can't. Not today.

590
00:45:43,031 --> 00:45:45,534
-I'll buy you meat.
-I really can't today.

591
00:45:46,118 --> 00:45:47,619
I'm on my way to…

592
00:45:49,663 --> 00:45:50,664
Hello?

593
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:53,250
Hello? Su.

594
00:45:59,673 --> 00:46:01,633
The number you have dialed
cannot be reached.

595
00:46:01,717 --> 00:46:03,469
Please leave a message after the beep.

596
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:08,807
Excuse me.

597
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:14,354
Hey! You!

598
00:46:40,297 --> 00:46:43,675
Did an emergency patient
named Lee Su come in here?

599
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:44,927
Please wait.

600
00:46:45,511 --> 00:46:47,095
No, no patient under that name.

601
00:46:58,106 --> 00:47:00,984
The number you have dialed
cannot be reached. Please leave a…

602
00:47:02,945 --> 00:47:04,112
Traffic accident patient!

603
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:09,910
EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

604
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:14,706
Is the patient conscious?

605
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:18,293
Sir? Can you hear me?

606
00:48:18,353 --> 00:48:19,730
Woo-yeon.

607
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:24,985
Why did you hang up your phone like that?

608
00:48:25,777 --> 00:48:26,862
Well,

609
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:29,781
a motorcycle came at me,
so my phone broke.

610
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:32,701
But what are you doing here?

611
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:37,039
I thought you were hurt!

612
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:40,417
And you wouldn't answer your phone.

613
00:48:41,043 --> 00:48:43,211
I thought something had happened to you.

614
00:49:04,524 --> 00:49:07,444
You didn't have to cry your eyes out.
People might get the wrong idea.

615
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:08,945
What wrong idea?

616
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:12,407
People on the street must have thought,

617
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:15,327
"That handsome young man made a girl cry.

618
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:17,162
He's such a bad guy."

619
00:49:17,245 --> 00:49:18,413
I was clearly not myself.

620
00:49:19,539 --> 00:49:21,667
Do you know what you cost me today?

621
00:49:22,709 --> 00:49:23,710
I don't know.

622
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:27,673
But it's a good day
to come looking for me.

623
00:49:27,756 --> 00:49:29,007
It's my birthday today.

624
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:30,676
Stop lying.

625
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:32,427
Your birthday is December 28.

626
00:49:32,511 --> 00:49:35,097
That's just on paper.
My real birthday is today.

627
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:38,850
By the way, you memorized my birthday?

628
00:49:43,188 --> 00:49:45,232
I'm good at memorizing people's birthdays.

629
00:49:47,776 --> 00:49:49,277
But don't memorize mine.

630
00:49:49,861 --> 00:49:51,321
I hate my birthday.

631
00:49:51,905 --> 00:49:52,781
Why not?

632
00:49:53,365 --> 00:49:56,743
I just do.
I don't think I should have been born.

633
00:50:12,801 --> 00:50:15,721
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, LEE SU

634
00:50:17,931 --> 00:50:21,017
Do you know why
people cut birthday cakes in half?

635
00:50:21,101 --> 00:50:22,477
Why?

636
00:50:22,561 --> 00:50:24,521
By doing so, you're splitting the days

637
00:50:25,313 --> 00:50:27,441
of your past and the days of your future.

638
00:50:33,071 --> 00:50:34,448
Here.

639
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:39,953
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, LEE SU

640
00:50:40,036 --> 00:50:43,582
You can consider all the bad days
as the days in your past

641
00:50:43,665 --> 00:50:44,666
and cut them out.

642
00:50:45,834 --> 00:50:48,503
-Isn't that a superstition?
-Whatever it is,

643
00:50:48,587 --> 00:50:50,297
it won't hurt to try.

644
00:50:58,096 --> 00:50:59,306
Happy birthday.

645
00:51:00,432 --> 00:51:01,933
When did you learn calligraphy?

646
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:04,561
I taught myself. I only started recently.

647
00:51:05,437 --> 00:51:06,438
You're good.

648
00:51:07,439 --> 00:51:08,815
How do you know if I'm good?

649
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:11,568
Because it made the recipient happy.

650
00:51:12,527 --> 00:51:14,112
I like this.

651
00:51:19,075 --> 00:51:20,911
I gave you your birthday present.

652
00:51:20,994 --> 00:51:22,287
Don't forget my birthday.

653
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:25,582
For your information,
my birthday is May 23.

654
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:31,213
What are you doing on Christmas Eve?

655
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:34,174
Why?

656
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:40,013
Obviously, to confess his feelings.

657
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:42,891
I'm sure he will.
He asked you out on Christmas Eve.

658
00:51:42,974 --> 00:51:44,976
How could he not
after acting all lovey-dovey?

659
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:48,271
-Meaningless kindness is a crime.
-Even Jesus won't forgive that.

660
00:51:48,897 --> 00:51:50,232
He's not going to ask me out.

661
00:51:50,982 --> 00:51:53,819
Then should I give him
my answer right away?

662
00:51:53,902 --> 00:51:55,946
Or should I ask for some time?

663
00:51:57,948 --> 00:52:00,200
My gosh. No. Don't give him an answer.

664
00:52:00,283 --> 00:52:01,952
-Why not?
-Just act dumb. Whatever.

665
00:52:02,035 --> 00:52:04,454
-No! Just tell him right away.
-Gosh.

666
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:06,623
DATE WITH SU

667
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:49,916
Hey, did you see him?

668
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,960
Look how tall he is.
He looks like a model.

669
00:52:52,919 --> 00:52:56,131
-I wonder if he has a girlfriend.
-I don't think he's here alone.

670
00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:05,223
Woo-yeon.

671
00:53:06,558 --> 00:53:07,475
Hey.

672
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:49,476
Too bad you couldn't focus on the movie.

673
00:53:51,019 --> 00:53:52,228
Me?

674
00:53:52,312 --> 00:53:53,897
You were busy looking at my face.

675
00:53:54,981 --> 00:53:57,817
-No, I wasn't.
-It's fine. That's normal.

676
00:53:57,901 --> 00:54:00,737
You don't want to look at me,
but you can't help it.

677
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:03,907
I really want to live a quiet life.

678
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:07,202
Why did I have to be so hot?
Living with this face is such a hassle.

679
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:12,582
Should I shoot that?

680
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:16,294
What?

681
00:54:17,629 --> 00:54:18,838
Are you game?

682
00:54:22,467 --> 00:54:23,802
I'm game.

683
00:54:38,149 --> 00:54:39,442
Hold this.

684
00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:57,043
Move.

685
00:54:58,545 --> 00:55:01,715
Hey, it's not something we can excel at…

686
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:22,777
Are you ex-military?

687
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:25,030
I surrender.

688
00:55:27,032 --> 00:55:29,034
I'm going to win that teddy bear today.

689
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:33,246
SHOOTING POINTS: 1,040 POINTS

690
00:55:49,054 --> 00:55:50,805
Here. You can take one.

691
00:55:52,557 --> 00:55:55,560
Actually, this isn't yours to give away.
I paid for the game.

692
00:55:55,643 --> 00:55:57,228
You couldn't even hit it once.

693
00:55:58,772 --> 00:56:00,690
Hey, I can't be good at everything.

694
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:03,902
God was plenty unfair to the others
by giving me this face.

695
00:56:05,403 --> 00:56:08,823
How can you say something like that
without even blushing?

696
00:56:08,907 --> 00:56:10,158
Technically, I'm not wrong.

697
00:56:16,748 --> 00:56:17,999
Merry Christmas.

698
00:56:21,169 --> 00:56:24,297
The store would never sell this.

699
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:25,799
How did you get this?

700
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:29,219
I begged and said I had to
confess my feelings to my crush.

701
00:56:31,596 --> 00:56:33,723
I'm pretty quick on my feet.

702
00:56:38,269 --> 00:56:39,270
Woo-yeon.

703
00:56:43,358 --> 00:56:44,359
I need to tell you something.

704
00:56:45,527 --> 00:56:48,404
-What is it?
-I've been wanting to say it for a while.

705
00:56:48,488 --> 00:56:51,032
I'm sorry that it took me this long.

706
00:56:53,118 --> 00:56:54,577
Gosh, don't be.

707
00:56:57,956 --> 00:56:59,040
You can tell me.

708
00:57:01,876 --> 00:57:03,044
The thing is,

709
00:57:08,842 --> 00:57:11,636
I'm going to the States tomorrow
for my studies.

710
00:57:14,556 --> 00:57:15,640
What?

711
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:17,725
I don't think I can be here

712
00:57:19,227 --> 00:57:20,520
for your birthday.

713
00:57:42,917 --> 00:57:44,627
Half a world away.

714
00:57:46,379 --> 00:57:47,964
He'll be half a world away.

715
00:58:17,243 --> 00:58:18,828
Let's go to the department store.

716
00:58:23,875 --> 00:58:25,543
Do you want anything?

717
00:58:27,629 --> 00:58:29,589
A typhoon or heavy snow.

718
00:58:30,423 --> 00:58:32,509
Turbulence or bad weather

719
00:58:35,136 --> 00:58:37,222
so planes can't take off.

720
00:58:37,805 --> 00:58:39,849
If not today, they'll take off tomorrow.

721
00:58:39,933 --> 00:58:41,309
You can't stop planes.

722
00:58:44,312 --> 00:58:47,690
You can't keep planes here,
but you can keep someone's heart here.

723
00:58:55,073 --> 00:58:57,825
Talk to him before he goes
or you'll regret it.

724
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:19,138
I'm sorry.

725
00:59:23,309 --> 00:59:24,435
Gyeong Woo-yeon.

726
00:59:32,068 --> 00:59:33,319
Why are you here?

727
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:36,739
I needed to talk to you.

728
00:59:37,448 --> 00:59:40,535
I knew I would regret it
if I didn't tell you this.

729
00:59:40,618 --> 00:59:42,328
And the regret might make me sick.

730
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:46,165
I've been thinking about it
since last night.

731
00:59:46,249 --> 00:59:48,543
I kept thinking all night long
without sleeping.

732
00:59:48,626 --> 00:59:49,877
But…

733
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:54,048
But I'm all right.

734
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:00,597
I'm all right even if you're
on the other side of the world,

735
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:03,558
and even if there's a 16-hour difference
between us. I'm…

736
01:00:09,063 --> 01:00:11,649
confident that I can wait for you
even if it takes years.

737
01:00:15,528 --> 01:00:16,654
Are you saying…

738
01:00:19,115 --> 01:00:20,408
I like you.

739
01:00:26,039 --> 01:00:27,665
I like you very much

740
01:00:30,168 --> 01:00:31,252
and I've

741
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:33,713
liked you for a long time.

742
01:00:34,839 --> 01:00:37,383
I'm sorry. I just see you as my friend.

743
01:00:39,427 --> 01:00:41,262
I hope we continue to stay

744
01:00:41,846 --> 01:00:42,805
friends.

745
01:00:56,402 --> 01:00:57,487
Woo-yeon.

746
01:00:59,030 --> 01:00:59,989
Are you crying?

747
01:01:02,575 --> 01:01:05,161
-No, I'm not.
-Thank god.

748
01:01:05,244 --> 01:01:06,496
I thought you were crying.

749
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:12,877
Okay.

750
01:01:15,463 --> 01:01:16,756
Let's stay friends.

751
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:26,641
Be well and have a safe flight,

752
01:01:28,351 --> 01:01:29,394
my friend.

753
01:01:34,399 --> 01:01:37,026
Okay. You, too. Take care.

754
01:01:51,916 --> 01:01:52,875
Bye.

755
01:01:53,459 --> 01:01:55,586
This is a boarding announcement.

756
01:01:55,670 --> 01:01:59,048
Passengers boarding Flight 081,

757
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:01,384
please come to Gate One.

758
01:02:43,718 --> 01:02:45,511
On the day my first love left,

759
01:02:46,429 --> 01:02:48,556
I thought the sky
was going to crumble down.

760
01:02:54,562 --> 01:02:56,522
But the sky was ever so high,

761
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:07,909
and time

762
01:03:09,202 --> 01:03:10,495
kept going.

763
01:03:14,832 --> 01:03:17,293
HAVE YOU ALWAYS BEEN SO PRETTY, FRESHMEN?

764
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:24,842
At the age of 20, I started dating.

765
01:03:30,765 --> 01:03:32,683
I dated a few more guys.

766
01:03:32,767 --> 01:03:34,227
GYEONG WOO-YEON,
IN A RELATIONSHIP

767
01:03:34,310 --> 01:03:35,812
And nothing

768
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:38,189
changed.

769
01:03:38,773 --> 01:03:40,483
LEE SU TO GYEONG WOO-YEON

770
01:03:40,566 --> 01:03:44,904
ARE YOU DOING WELL?

771
01:03:44,987 --> 01:03:46,572
COMMENT

772
01:03:46,656 --> 01:03:48,241
OF COURSE

773
01:03:48,324 --> 01:03:51,452
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

774
01:03:52,912 --> 01:03:55,039
The fact that we were still friends…

775
01:03:56,916 --> 01:03:58,251
-Look.
-So what?

776
01:03:58,334 --> 01:04:00,294
-You know what I mean.
-Yes.

777
01:04:00,378 --> 01:04:02,171
-What are you talking about?
-No.

778
01:04:02,255 --> 01:04:04,257
-I…
-Hey.

779
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:05,758
-Really?
-Seriously.

780
01:04:05,842 --> 01:04:07,093
-Cheers.
-On the house.

781
01:04:07,176 --> 01:04:09,762
-No way. How did you know I love salmon?
-Thanks, man.

782
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:11,389
Are you buying again, Jin-ju?

783
01:04:11,472 --> 01:04:13,349
-Of course.
-Thank you for the food.

784
01:04:13,432 --> 01:04:14,475
-I'll check in later.
-Eat up.

785
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:15,768
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

786
01:04:16,477 --> 01:04:19,272
-Right? "You two look alike."
-Seriously.

787
01:04:19,814 --> 01:04:21,566
Stop teasing me.

788
01:04:21,649 --> 01:04:23,734
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

789
01:04:24,235 --> 01:04:26,654
-Cheers.
-Me? I made that sound?

790
01:04:27,363 --> 01:04:28,865
I didn't finish it.

791
01:04:28,948 --> 01:04:30,241
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

792
01:04:34,704 --> 01:04:36,205
Let's finish this and go home.

793
01:04:37,206 --> 01:04:39,750
-Hey.
-So I just have to leave, right?

794
01:04:39,834 --> 01:04:40,960
Finish before you go.

795
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:48,426
And my feelings for him.

796
01:04:56,726 --> 01:04:58,686
Why is the call going through?

797
01:05:04,692 --> 01:05:05,610
What?

798
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:08,529
He answered it.

799
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:18,456
He's answering his phone today.

800
01:05:34,305 --> 01:05:35,514
Hello, Woo-yeon.

801
01:05:48,486 --> 01:05:49,737
I was still

802
01:05:51,739 --> 01:05:53,866
under that old curse.

803
01:06:00,039 --> 01:06:01,040
She's coming.

804
01:06:10,216 --> 01:06:11,342
Woo-yeon.

805
01:06:22,061 --> 01:06:23,062
What?

806
01:06:25,272 --> 01:06:28,859
Hey! What are you doing?

807
01:06:29,610 --> 01:06:30,736
Stop it.

808
01:06:39,161 --> 01:06:40,955
What was that all about?

809
01:06:41,038 --> 01:06:42,331
You look ugly.

810
01:06:42,915 --> 01:06:45,167
-What?
-I must only look at beautiful things.

811
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:21,829
Poor guy. He had to go through that
as soon as he returned.

812
01:07:21,912 --> 01:07:22,830
He's back?

813
01:07:22,913 --> 01:07:24,999
-Who is it?
-That wasn't a dream?

814
01:07:25,082 --> 01:07:26,667
Until when are you here?

815
01:07:26,751 --> 01:07:29,211
Next week. I'll see you
as much as I can until I leave.

816
01:07:29,295 --> 01:07:31,213
-Why?
-To go on dates?

817
01:07:31,297 --> 01:07:33,424
Do whatever you want to do
and end the curse.

818
01:07:33,507 --> 01:07:36,677
Whenever I come back,
I always want to see you as my friend.

819
01:07:36,761 --> 01:07:39,430
Let's end it here
and never see each other again.

820
01:07:39,513 --> 01:07:41,015
I'm Calligrapher Gyeong Woo-yeon.

821
01:07:41,098 --> 01:07:43,225
This is a calligraphy postcard I made.

822
01:07:43,309 --> 01:07:45,352
-Can you put it on display there?
-Thank you.

823
01:07:45,436 --> 01:07:46,937
Are you going in or coming out?

824
01:07:48,939 --> 01:07:49,982
Woo-yeon?

825
01:07:53,694 --> 01:07:58,699
