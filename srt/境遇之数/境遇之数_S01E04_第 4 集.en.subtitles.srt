1
00:00:57,932 --> 00:00:59,142
All right.

2
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:02,020
-Ta-da.
-Gosh.

3
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:07,776
You've worked really hard for 30 years.

4
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:08,943
Thanks.

5
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:12,280
Dad, you worked so hard all these years.

6
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:13,990
Thank you, dear.

7
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:15,700
Let me see.

8
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:19,537
I thought you'd get a job
before your dad retired.

9
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,917
Why would you say that now?

10
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:26,878
Let's eat.

11
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:37,055
LONG-SERVICE AWARD

12
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:39,182
I wasn't sure
if I could become like my dad.

13
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:44,062
Until I started working,

14
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:48,191
I didn't realize how amazing he was.

15
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:54,030
And that no matter how hard I try,

16
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:57,742
I could never be as amazing as he is.

17
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:04,958
And I learned that a person has

18
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,043
a limited shelf life.

19
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:12,006
Mr. Kim, my contract expires next month.

20
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,885
Would it be possible
to extend my contract?

21
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:20,390
Why would we do that
when younger and prettier women

22
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,392
keep applying for the position?

23
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:25,895
Aren't you going to get a job?

24
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:29,440
It's been almost two years
since you quit your job.

25
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:32,777
You won one contest
and acted like you succeeded.

26
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:35,029
You said, "Don't worry. I'm doing well."

27
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:37,240
And you're working part-time at a cafe?

28
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:40,243
-Gosh, Mom.
-She'll get an upset stomach.

29
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:42,662
I told you she shouldn't major
in creative writing.

30
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:48,751
You think the world is literature?
You're not the only one struggling.

31
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:52,005
Everyone's trying to hang in there.
When will you grow up?

32
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:58,428
Is it my fault I can't get a job?
Is it the young people's fault?

33
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:01,014
I mean, they hire two people
instead of three.

34
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:03,808
And they even try
to make it just one person.

35
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:06,811
It's impossible
for all of us to find a job.

36
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:09,314
I want to stay away from the competition

37
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:11,816
and work on making my dream come true,

38
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,986
but the world treats me like a loser.
That's the problem.

39
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:19,949
Yeong-hui is an assistant manager,

40
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:21,910
and Jin-ju is a prosecutor.

41
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:25,330
But you are just my daughter.

42
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:27,707
Honey, let's just eat.

43
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:30,335
Here, eat up.

44
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:33,504
Let's eat.

45
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:41,304
I'm leaving.

46
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:43,139
Oh, Woo-yeon. Hang on.

47
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:53,900
Here. Have something delicious
with your friends.

48
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:59,364
I'm sorry that I couldn't work longer.

49
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:15,338
And I knew my place.

50
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:20,802
Yeong-hui is an assistant manager,
and Jin-ju is a prosecutor.

51
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:22,804
But you are

52
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,932
just my daughter.

53
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:35,108
I tried to blame the society,

54
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,611
but I couldn't help but feel small.

55
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:44,826
It became clear.

56
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:47,787
What I should run away from now

57
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:50,248
isn't this jerk,

58
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:52,709
but my shame.

59
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:54,752
Look.

60
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,881
I'm not running away.

61
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,267
Why are you being so tough?

62
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:14,188
Open your pretty ears
and listen to me carefully.

63
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,650
I don't care for a bad guy
like you anymore.

64
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:20,028
And I won't like you ever again.

65
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:21,654
Never.

66
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,949
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

67
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:32,081
ON JUN-SU, GYEONG WOO-YEON

68
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:35,418
ON JUN-SU, LEE SU

69
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:43,551
How about Seoul with Stories?

70
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:47,805
We give a subtitle
to every town photographed.

71
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:50,975
Think of gentrification in Hongdae.

72
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:54,437
The local markets there were pushed out
to Yeonnam-dong and Mangwon-dong.

73
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,981
For them, we can have a subtitle
like "We still survive."

74
00:05:58,608 --> 00:05:59,567
I like that.

75
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:02,361
What do you think, Mr. Lee?

76
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:04,530
Let's do that.

77
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:08,201
I'll photograph the 8 towns mentioned,
the abandoned railroads near Seoul,

78
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:10,161
and an abandoned amusement park.

79
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:13,289
Okay. I can write
after looking at the photos.

80
00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:17,293
Not the photos. You should
be visiting the places with me.

81
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,253
Why would I go with you?

82
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:24,592
This isn't a personal meeting.
Please show me some courtesy, Ms. Gyeong.

83
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,473
I don't need to go around with him.

84
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:31,682
I'll write--

85
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:33,601
The book is all about emotional photos.

86
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:35,812
What she writes sitting at a desk
can't be the same

87
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,897
as what she actually sees
and feels herself.

88
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,441
I don't plan to write sitting at a desk.

89
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:42,110
I'll go separately.

90
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:43,653
That wouldn't work.

91
00:06:44,403 --> 00:06:46,531
Even if it's the same place,
it would feel differently

92
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:48,616
with time, season,
and eye of the beholder.

93
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:52,328
If it's photographed and written
separately, it wouldn't feel sincere.

94
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:55,957
Can't you keep personal feelings
and work separate?

95
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,625
This isn't a personal meeting.

96
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:01,003
Will you stop making
personal assumptions about me?

97
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:05,174
I'm in charge of the writing,
so it's my domain.

98
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:08,219
I don't want to be forced to feel
the way the photographer does.

99
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:11,389
That's why I want to go on my own.

100
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:21,232
I'd like you two to reach
an agreement on the issue.

101
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:42,545
You're so simple, Gyeong Woo-yeon.

102
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:45,506
The second I provoked you,
you fell for it right away.

103
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,049
Don't get the wrong idea.

104
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:49,719
I'm just trying to work.

105
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:55,141
This job is very important to me
even more than you think it is.

106
00:07:56,767 --> 00:08:00,480
I don't have to give up
because of my mere feelings.

107
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,190
"Mere feelings"?

108
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:04,942
Your feelings for me are pretty big.

109
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:07,987
This is the chance of a lifetime
for me, so I said it right.

110
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,322
And

111
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,742
what do you know about me?
Don't act like you know me.

112
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:16,204
Of course I know you.
We've been friends for years.

113
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:20,166
"Friends"?

114
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:24,795
Fine.

115
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:27,924
Let's be friends.

116
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:40,311
When you reach out your hand,
it usually means go away or get lost.

117
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:44,023
Why are you pushing me away
when you want us to be friends?

118
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:45,816
It means we just work together.

119
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:50,321
In order to do that,
we need to draw a line.

120
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:54,742
I don't want any confusion or false hope
like "what if" or "maybe."

121
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:57,286
The friend zone will filter them out.

122
00:08:58,496 --> 00:08:59,830
So

123
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,875
let's be friends now.

124
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,466
I don't make friends on such conditions.

125
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:22,937
He's going alone. How cheap.

126
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,275
Woo-yeon.

127
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:30,903
It's raining,
so I'd like to take you home.

128
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:44,125
"Mere feelings"?

129
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:52,091
She never brings an umbrella.

130
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:07,315
She always glares only at me.

131
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:15,489
I'm sorry that I stormed out
like that earlier.

132
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:18,242
It's fine since you came back,

133
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:21,078
but you should apologize
for something else.

134
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:21,996
What?

135
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,373
A button on my jacket sleeve came off.

136
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:29,045
Gosh, I'm sorry.
I'll compensate you for it.

137
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:32,173
I already took care of it.

138
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:33,507
Just buy me a meal.

139
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,761
-A meal?
-You said you were sorry.

140
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,181
I want to have a meal with you
using that as an excuse.

141
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:42,975
What are you doing this Saturday?

142
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:48,105
I have no plans for Saturday yet.
Shall we eat lunch together?

143
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:50,399
Not lunch. I want dinner.

144
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,443
I guess you have plans for lunch.

145
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:56,113
I understand you are busy. You're a CEO.

146
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:58,115
It's not because I'm busy.

147
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:01,827
Dinner sounds more like a date.

148
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:16,926
Well,

149
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:18,969
I'm sorry,

150
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:21,764
but are you…

151
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:24,642
What you're thinking is probably right.

152
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:27,686
But you don't know what I'm thinking.

153
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:32,024
"Is he interested in me?
Is he hitting on me?" Isn't that it?

154
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:36,821
And my answer to these questions is yes.

155
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,126
Hang on.

156
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:53,838
Can you pull over for a moment?

157
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:03,681
Does the photo book project have
anything to do with your feelings?

158
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:10,020
You're so pathetic, Gyeong Woo-yeon.

159
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:14,525
Do you know what upsets me the most?

160
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:17,611
For a split moment,

161
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:21,699
I thought about using your feelings
to hold on to this job.

162
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:25,703
I desperately need this job,
and I need to be acknowledged.

163
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:27,788
That way,

164
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:32,793
I can live proudly
doing what I want to do.

165
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:36,464
It's not like that.

166
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:38,549
How could I believe you?

167
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:41,510
It's just strange.

168
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:44,013
I have nothing to show off

169
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,390
and I'm nothing,

170
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:48,809
but you want me to write a book.

171
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,063
Why do you think you have nothing?

172
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:55,274
Why do you say you're nothing?

173
00:12:55,774 --> 00:13:00,613
Then what about those who were
consoled by your writing?

174
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:05,075
When I look at your work,

175
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:08,204
I feel like it's speaking to me.

176
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:12,249
That's the reason
why I offered you this project.

177
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,710
What more do I need to explain?

178
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,854
I've finished the discharge procedures.

179
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:40,611
You must be hungry.

180
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:42,696
-Hello.
-Oh, hello.

181
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,409
Did you have plans?

182
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:51,121
Not really. He was just dropping by.

183
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:53,082
I didn't know she had a visitor.

184
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:55,918
I'm not a visitor.

185
00:13:58,587 --> 00:13:59,838
I'm her guardian.

186
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:02,091
Won-jeong, shall we go?

187
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:06,262
Oh, well…

188
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:09,223
This is good.

189
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:12,142
I have to go back to my office anyway.

190
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:17,106
All right, then.

191
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:20,025
Let's go.

192
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:38,377
Happy?

193
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:50,264
Thank you for the ride.

194
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:53,392
Then I should probably thank the rain.

195
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:55,519
It might rain again.

196
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,563
No, it's okay.

197
00:14:58,355 --> 00:14:59,815
This is my next excuse.

198
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:08,490
I'll try my best with the photo book.

199
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:13,621
I'll do a good job, so I don't get
the wrong idea about myself.

200
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:16,165
Go in.

201
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:30,346
Drop the pressure.

202
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:32,514
Good.

203
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:37,728
Calligraphy is more like drawing
than writing letters.

204
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:40,481
Since it focuses on
individuality and fortuity,

205
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:43,567
it's important to have
your own handwriting. Okay?

206
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:44,860
-Yes.
-Yes.

207
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:47,279
You should write a lot to improve.

208
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:16,058
Is something wrong?

209
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:20,437
-No.
-What is it? Tell me.

210
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:24,483
-Nothing.
-Just say it.

211
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:29,738
What?

212
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:33,826
So she's that girl, and he's that guy?

213
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:37,579
Yes. I should tell them first, right?

214
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:38,872
Why would you tell them?

215
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:40,708
They will eventually find out.

216
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:42,918
So I should tell them first.

217
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:46,255
I don't think Lee Su is the kind of guy
who nitpicks at everything.

218
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:49,717
And Gyeong Woo-yeon hasn't said anything.
It means they didn't talk about it.

219
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,719
Why would you reveal it yourself? Why now?

220
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:53,137
Because it's lying.

221
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:58,058
It's not lying. It's taking things slow.

222
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:04,231
What do you think brakes are for?
It's to prevent accidents.

223
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:07,234
If you go straight like this,
there will be a big accident.

224
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:11,989
You need to win her over first.

225
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:14,491
She should warm up to you
so she can be understanding.

226
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:16,368
Then Gyeong Woo-yeon won't run away.

227
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:20,456
That's how you write
a happy ending, Jun-su.

228
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:23,584
Gosh, I'm feeling dizzy.

229
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:25,294
I guess I lost my cool.

230
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:27,171
By the way,

231
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,840
when was your last date?

232
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,051
It was before Christ, you jerk.

233
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:36,722
Gosh, it's hot.

234
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:46,940
Why did you want to see me?

235
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:48,233
I have something to say.

236
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:50,611
Let me go first.

237
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:52,654
What's up between you and the CEO?

238
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:55,449
-CEO?
-On Jun-su.

239
00:17:57,534 --> 00:17:58,827
Are you dating the CEO?

240
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:01,914
What do you mean? Why are you asking that?

241
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:04,583
Just answer me. That's the most
important thing to me now.

242
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:08,212
What do you mean?

243
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:12,299
I don't plan on letting my photos
be pawns in some people's love game.

244
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,136
Nothing's going on between us.

245
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:18,430
You don't have to worry.

246
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,603
Fine. It's your turn now.

247
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:30,400
Is there a reason we need to travel around
together for the photoshoot?

248
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:33,904
A photographer's
point of view is like a filter,

249
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:35,489
so his photos show his emotions.

250
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,534
The photos I take
will only show my emotions.

251
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:41,870
And your writing
will only show your emotions.

252
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:43,956
I want them to match.

253
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:46,458
Because it's our calligraphy photo book.

254
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:48,252
I see.

255
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,588
We can go to two adjoining towns together

256
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:52,965
once a week then.

257
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:56,844
I work Mondays to Wednesdays,
and on Friday.

258
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:58,887
I'm available otherwise.

259
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,139
You sound busy.

260
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:02,933
Saturday at 1 p.m. Meet me
at Hongdae Station, Exit 3.

261
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:05,644
Okay. I'll see you then.

262
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,147
Why are you being so obedient?

263
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,400
You didn't want to see me again
just a few days ago.

264
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:12,526
You avoided me.

265
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:14,903
I told you. I want us to be friends.

266
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:17,781
-We were friends back then.
-It was unilateral.

267
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:19,908
Now it's mutual.

268
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:23,078
Why is it so complicated
for you every time?

269
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,288
Why…

270
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:28,417
Why is it so easy for you every time?

271
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:36,633
-If you're done--
-I'll go. I'm leaving.

272
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:39,636
You don't have to push me away
because I'll leave when it's time.

273
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:51,148
Don't do it unless you still
have feelings for him.

274
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:53,358
It's not about my feelings but my future.

275
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:55,903
For an unknown calligrapher like me,

276
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:57,738
publishing a book with a major company

277
00:19:57,821 --> 00:19:59,823
is the chance of a lifetime.

278
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:02,242
-But working with Su--
-What do you mean, "but"?

279
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:04,828
Just leave her be. It's her life.
What can you do with it?

280
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:07,706
You sound so cold-hearted when you speak.

281
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,168
-Do you even bleed?
-Hey.

282
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:18,842
Just be careful.
Su is like a tiger to you.

283
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:20,677
When you enter a tiger's den,

284
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:23,305
you must have your eyes wide open.

285
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:44,326
You startled me.

286
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,412
What are you doing here
with the lights off?

287
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,333
Nothing.

288
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:56,088
Son.

289
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,216
Do you want some beer?

290
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:00,842
Gosh, no…

291
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:18,235
Did Mom leave the hospital?

292
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:22,823
I guess she did.

293
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:29,705
Your mom…

294
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:34,626
She left with Dr. Kim.

295
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:44,011
Nothing’s going right for me.

296
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:49,808
You shouldn't feel jealous
after getting divorced.

297
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,395
Jealous, my foot.

298
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:57,190
If you're not jealous,
how would you explain this popcorn?

299
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:58,692
It didn't do anything wrong.

300
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:01,361
But why is it paying for what you've done?

301
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:04,740
It's not like that. It's just…

302
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:09,036
I just feel a bit upset. That's all.

303
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:12,289
She hurt her back,
so I got her into the hospital.

304
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:15,083
I took care of her
and called her son she missed.

305
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,085
I did it all for her.

306
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:20,380
But she ditched me
as soon as she got discharged.

307
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:22,007
That's what she did.

308
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:24,134
Then you should've held on to her.

309
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:27,721
Don't be absurd.

310
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:30,599
She was staring at me
waiting for me to leave.

311
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:36,938
But she seemed so nice and kind
to Dr. Kim.

312
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:41,610
I wonder why you got divorced
in the first place.

313
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:43,445
Because your mom wanted it.

314
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:46,573
That's just what she said all the time.

315
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:50,243
That's what I thought.

316
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:54,456
But she suddenly stopped
talking to me one day.

317
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:59,044
She didn't nag, cry, or get mad at me.

318
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:03,965
I thought she was being understanding.

319
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:09,429
But she was just breaking up

320
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:13,683
with me.

321
00:23:20,857 --> 00:23:22,567
Then you should've ended it there.

322
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,528
Why did you stay friends?

323
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:31,827
I thought I could start over that way.

324
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:36,748
I didn't know it was over.

325
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:42,587
A man can remain friends with someone
only when he still has feelings for her.

326
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:45,549
But a woman

327
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:50,804
can remain friends only when

328
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:54,933
she doesn't have any feelings.

329
00:24:03,024 --> 00:24:04,693
I have no feelings for him anymore.

330
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:06,444
So

331
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:09,156
we can work together as friends.

332
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:13,410
Gosh, don't worry.

333
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:16,788
I'll remember it's a tiger's den
and keep my eyes wide open.

334
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:19,416
A tiger's den?

335
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:24,546
Do you know what a real tiger's den is?

336
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:46,818
A lot of young women say
they want to stay single and have no kids.

337
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:49,738
But I like that you are
so affable, Yeong-hui.

338
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:52,699
When are you having the wedding ceremony?

339
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:54,034
We will have it soon.

340
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:56,494
Hyeon-jae is a teacher now.

341
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:59,581
You might lose him to another woman
if you wait too long.

342
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:03,460
-Stop it.
-Just let her eat.

343
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:06,838
She wouldn't feel comfortable
eating with her in-laws.

344
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:09,674
Your mother-in-law
should tell your husband

345
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:12,010
to help you with the work so you can rest.

346
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:14,429
Mom, is there anything I can do?

347
00:25:14,512 --> 00:25:16,431
No, it's okay.

348
00:25:16,514 --> 00:25:18,767
I'll be just distracted with you around.

349
00:25:24,397 --> 00:25:26,691
The world has changed.

350
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:29,110
How could they treat only sons-in-law well

351
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:31,905
and work daughters-in-law like slaves?

352
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:34,115
That's just ridiculous.

353
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:35,492
Mother.

354
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:43,583
Do you want me to cut kimchi now?

355
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:48,255
Sure. Go ahead.

356
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,881
Okay.

357
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:57,430
I wonder if other tigers' dens are fine.

358
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:46,938
-What is this?
-A good song.

359
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:49,524
It's good only for you.

360
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:13,506
The way you swallow sounds inappropriate.

361
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:16,259
Don't be silly.

362
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:46,581
-I'm sorry.
-Why do you accumulate

363
00:27:46,664 --> 00:27:48,416
mistakes like mileage points?

364
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,793
You might win a prize soon.

365
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:51,586
What are you talking about?

366
00:27:57,675 --> 00:27:59,427
-What was that?
-Darn it.

367
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:00,762
-Gosh.
-What?

368
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:03,014
You've finally won a prize.

369
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:06,476
I don't want it anyway.

370
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:34,254
LIFE CYCLE OF THE STREETS

371
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:35,713
"Life cycle of the streets"?

372
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:38,299
Yes. I heard it somewhere.

373
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:40,218
Streets have a life cycle.

374
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:44,055
I didn't know what it meant,
but I get it now.

375
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:46,182
Streets are just like people.

376
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:50,353
They got pushed out of Hongdae
to neighboring areas.

377
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:56,484
But they're doing just fine.

378
00:28:58,486 --> 00:28:59,571
It's no wonder.

379
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:03,158
They must've learned how to survive
during the process.

380
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:06,369
Like I said before, the subtitle

381
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:08,496
can be "We still survive." Is it okay?

382
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:10,331
I like that.

383
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:48,203
This place is interesting, too.

384
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:56,461
WHISPER THAT YOU LOVE ME

385
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:22,987
Did you take it?

386
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:38,837
WE STILL SURVIVE

387
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,560
You don't take photos of people.

388
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:55,228
I don't take photos of people.

389
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:57,897
There's no one I want to take photos of.

390
00:30:57,981 --> 00:30:59,858
-Why not?
-There's no one

391
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:01,651
I want to see for long.

392
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:13,872
Did you not have a girlfriend?

393
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:17,292
I did. Many different girlfriends.

394
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:23,256
Then why did you not take photos
of your many different girlfriends?

395
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:25,300
It wasn't serious.

396
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:33,725
So if I take a photo of someone,

397
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:38,730
it means I like her

398
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:43,234
a lot.

399
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:46,529
But

400
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:48,907
I don't think it will happen.

401
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:06,883
What does that mean?

402
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:10,720
-What?
-Taking a photo of someone.

403
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:12,180
You said it wouldn't happen.

404
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:15,892
I'm too lazy

405
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:18,561
and timid to like someone.

406
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,148
I'm not sure if I can stay unchanged

407
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:24,859
or be responsible in a relationship.

408
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:27,445
It just

409
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:30,114
doesn't suit me.

410
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:32,575
-Is it what you experienced?
-It's what I witnessed.

411
00:32:33,242 --> 00:32:35,161
I've never seen a happy ending around me.

412
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:38,706
Is there such a thing as a happy ending?

413
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:41,334
All endings are sad.

414
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:42,669
My point.

415
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:46,464
So not starting at all can be an option.

416
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:13,324
Gosh, I'm so tired.

417
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:15,159
What are you thinking?

418
00:33:16,035 --> 00:33:17,078
They're cute.

419
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:19,122
I'm cuter than both of them.

420
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:22,125
That's not what I meant.

421
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:27,255
They are just looking at each other
without doing anything,

422
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:30,049
but they still look so happy.

423
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:34,137
Isn't that amazing?

424
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:38,307
Where do people meet
and how do they fall in love?

425
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:42,186
I mean, at the same time.

426
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:51,821
Are there more places to photograph?

427
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:54,949
I'm done. Aren't you hungry?

428
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,159
Hang on.

429
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:01,080
METAPHOR PUBLISHING HOUSE

430
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,791
Hello?

431
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:07,128
Mr. On?

432
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:10,298
Excuse me.

433
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:15,344
Oh, yes.

434
00:34:22,685 --> 00:34:25,104
Are you at work on a Saturday?

435
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:27,648
I'm working and waiting

436
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:29,317
for the date.

437
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:32,487
I can't call it a date.

438
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,782
If you don't want it to be a date,

439
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:38,284
let's call it returning a favor.

440
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:40,453
You said you were sorry
and grateful to me.

441
00:34:41,704 --> 00:34:43,664
Okay. That sounds better.

442
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:47,627
When will you be done? I can go there.

443
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:50,213
He's still taking photos,

444
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:51,964
but I guess it will be over soon.

445
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:54,842
Then I'll come over.

446
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,928
-What?
-I'll see you there.

447
00:35:03,976 --> 00:35:05,520
He's unexpectedly sly.

448
00:35:11,984 --> 00:35:15,738
Thanks to my kids,
I get a feast for my birthday.

449
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:17,406
-I'm sorry I'm late.
-Hey.

450
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:18,866
-You're here.
-Come sit.

451
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:21,619
-You must be hungry.
-Dad.

452
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:23,246
-Happy birthday.
-Well done today.

453
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:26,499
Happy birthday, Grandpa.

454
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:29,669
-Happy birthday!
-You're here.

455
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:31,671
Come and have a seat.

456
00:35:31,754 --> 00:35:35,174
-Happy birthday.
-Thank you, sweetheart.

457
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:37,969
-Let's eat now.
-Okay.

458
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:40,429
-Eat up before it gets cold.
-It looks delicious.

459
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:41,722
Eat before it gets cold.

460
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:46,602
You go on ahead. I have plans.

461
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:50,148
-With whom? The CEO?
-Yes.

462
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:51,566
You said nothing's going on.

463
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:53,442
Why are you going to see him then?

464
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:56,154
Why are you seeing a man
at this late hour?

465
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:58,781
Why do you even care whom I meet? You…

466
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:04,787
It's not what you think.

467
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:08,374
And even if something's going on
between Mr. On and me,

468
00:36:08,457 --> 00:36:09,750
it's separate from work.

469
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:12,253
So something's going on.

470
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:15,631
You'll be the first to know
if we become romantically involved. Okay?

471
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:24,807
Ms. Gyeong.

472
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:27,185
Bye.

473
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:31,647
Did you not see me?

474
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:34,650
I'm impossible to miss
because I'm good looking.

475
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:38,154
I'm sorry. I only saw Woo-yeon.

476
00:36:39,071 --> 00:36:40,698
I guess you have narrow vision.

477
00:36:40,781 --> 00:36:42,700
I usually see only what I want to see.

478
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:46,370
I see.

479
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:48,831
Hey, aren't you leaving?

480
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:51,375
I'll leave. I'm going now.

481
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:53,878
Okay. Go home safely.

482
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,466
I'll see you around then.

483
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:05,514
Are his intestines made of cheese?
Why is he so cheesy?

484
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:19,153
Did you agree to go around together?

485
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:21,739
I want to do well on the photo book.

486
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:23,616
I'm sure you will.

487
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:40,341
You must be tired today.

488
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:44,387
Right.

489
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:47,807
Mom said you worked hard today,
so she'll buy you a meal later.

490
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:52,395
Mom really thinks of you as her daughter.

491
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:58,109
I worked all day today.

492
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,987
Your first sister helped out,

493
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:02,947
but your second sister just kept eating.

494
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:07,159
And your third sister
came just in time for dinner.

495
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:12,498
If that's thinking of me as a daughter,

496
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:15,001
I don't want that.

497
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:17,753
I'm sorry.

498
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:25,303
-I'll tell Mom not to call you again--
-You should've done it sooner.

499
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:28,764
You told me not to do that.

500
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:32,768
You didn't do it because I told you so?

501
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:36,522
How could I trust you
when you're like that?

502
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:38,858
You like that I do as you say.

503
00:38:38,941 --> 00:38:41,193
I didn't know that you'd only do as I say.

504
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:43,779
It's been 10 years, but how
could you not know how I feel?

505
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:46,115
You told me to ask you
before doing anything.

506
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:53,289
Yeong-hui, I didn't mean to yell at you.

507
00:38:53,372 --> 00:38:54,582
Stop the car.

508
00:38:57,126 --> 00:38:57,960
No.

509
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:01,964
I won't talk to you, so just stay.

510
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:12,224
I bet you go to a lot of nice places,

511
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:15,227
so this might not be good enough for you.

512
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:18,981
But we have no choice.
I'm still a poor calligrapher.

513
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:21,192
I was going to buy you dinner.

514
00:39:22,568 --> 00:39:25,071
I knew you'd be like that,
so I already paid.

515
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:29,116
You like excuses,
so I knew your next move.

516
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:32,370
"I paid this time, so you should
buy me dinner next time."

517
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:34,914
I knew you'd make an excuse like that.

518
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:37,500
You got me.

519
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:41,712
Do you

520
00:39:43,005 --> 00:39:44,715
believe in destiny?

521
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:54,517
Are you trying to say
that we are meant to be together?

522
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,894
I think we are.

523
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:06,362
We haven't known each other for long yet.

524
00:40:07,863 --> 00:40:10,408
You recognize a good novel
only with the first sentence.

525
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:16,789
How many excuses will I need
to see you without excuses?

526
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:05,296
I wanted to escape,

527
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:08,424
but that doesn't seem right either.

528
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:27,359
-I'm home.
-You're late.

529
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:28,903
I know. I'm tired.

530
00:41:31,238 --> 00:41:32,364
Are you sick?

531
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:35,117
Yes. I guess I have an upset stomach.

532
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:38,120
-I feel bloated.
-Should I prick your fingers for you?

533
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:43,334
Why are you being so silly?

534
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:47,505
Instead of drinking that or pricking
your fingers, go see a doctor.

535
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:49,548
It's just an upset stomach.

536
00:41:50,257 --> 00:41:52,635
And I have to do the dishes all day.

537
00:41:52,718 --> 00:41:54,220
I have no time to go to a doctor.

538
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:56,847
Just go to a doctor before you
end up spending more money.

539
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:58,432
Okay. I will.

540
00:41:59,391 --> 00:42:01,018
-What about Cheol-su?
-I don't know.

541
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:04,980
I said I can't afford some special
lecture, so he got mad and left.

542
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:06,690
What did you say to make him leave?

543
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:11,028
It's just obvious. I've been there too.

544
00:42:11,987 --> 00:42:14,114
If you're poor,
you should at least be kind.

545
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:18,577
I'm too poor to afford being kind.

546
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:20,037
I'm busy making a living.

547
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:30,589
Where are you, Cheol-su? Come home.

548
00:42:32,174 --> 00:42:34,134
How much is the special lecture? I'll pay.

549
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:49,775
Ms. Gyeong.

550
00:42:50,317 --> 00:42:53,445
-I have something to say…
-Oh, right. Your umbrella.

551
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:55,281
I'll give you back your umbrella.

552
00:42:55,364 --> 00:42:57,866
I guess you're trying
to settle all my excuses tonight.

553
00:42:58,492 --> 00:43:00,911
Yes. I think that's the right thing to do.

554
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:02,079
Next time.

555
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:05,666
When I'm out of excuses.

556
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:09,211
When I don't have any excuses
but still want to see you.

557
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:12,006
I'll use the excuse then.

558
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:20,389
You just said you had
something to tell me.

559
00:43:23,892 --> 00:43:25,227
Actually, you…

560
00:43:29,648 --> 00:43:31,025
Dad?

561
00:43:32,526 --> 00:43:33,402
Mom?

562
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:35,321
Oh, hey.

563
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:39,825
-Hello.
-Hello.

564
00:43:39,908 --> 00:43:41,952
-I'm On Jun-su.
-I see.

565
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:44,121
You don't have to introduce yourself.

566
00:43:44,204 --> 00:43:47,249
-But still…
-Just go. Hurry and go.

567
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:50,669
-I'll get going then.
-Okay. Bye.

568
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:18,072
Are you seeing someone already?

569
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:19,823
That means she's popular.

570
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:22,076
You're the best. Awesome.

571
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:23,494
Stop that.

572
00:44:23,577 --> 00:44:25,913
Do you hate that
your daughter is seeing someone?

573
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:29,208
Is that because you treasure me so much?

574
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:32,086
He must be someone's precious son.

575
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:34,838
I just feel bad for him as a mother.

576
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:40,386
All right.

577
00:44:40,969 --> 00:44:41,970
What…

578
00:44:44,431 --> 00:44:45,933
You'll be punished.

579
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:48,519
If you hurt someone,
it will boomerang back on you.

580
00:44:55,609 --> 00:44:57,027
Is she really my mom?

581
00:45:17,464 --> 00:45:20,759
ACROSS THE SEA BETWEEN YOU AND ME

582
00:45:32,104 --> 00:45:34,731
Why did you smile so broadly
when there's nothing going on?

583
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:37,901
Yes?

584
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:53,041
Are you not going to come back?

585
00:45:54,501 --> 00:45:56,462
You didn't even leave a toothbrush.

586
00:45:57,045 --> 00:45:58,464
I have no reason to come back.

587
00:46:00,048 --> 00:46:02,009
What will you do with all this
after you go abroad?

588
00:46:03,135 --> 00:46:05,220
We have good luggage service in Korea.

589
00:46:05,971 --> 00:46:09,099
Just live with me.
Why do you have to move out?

590
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:12,019
I'm staying in Korea for now.

591
00:46:12,811 --> 00:46:14,062
That's what I meant.

592
00:46:14,688 --> 00:46:17,441
You're just staying for now
and will be gone for a long time.

593
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:20,944
Would it be that terrible to live with me?

594
00:46:23,405 --> 00:46:25,073
Yes. It would be agonizing.

595
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:35,042
I'm busy.

596
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:38,086
If you're done talking,
please get out, Father.

597
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:42,382
Okay.

598
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:45,302
Tell me if you need anything.

599
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:20,462
Here's your bubble tea.

600
00:47:21,588 --> 00:47:22,923
Please enjoy.

601
00:47:29,805 --> 00:47:32,224
Hey, will you stop glaring at me?

602
00:47:32,307 --> 00:47:34,560
Things never end well when you're around.

603
00:47:34,643 --> 00:47:35,936
So I'm nervous.

604
00:47:37,771 --> 00:47:39,106
How did you know I was here?

605
00:47:40,607 --> 00:47:42,025
Sang-hyeok told you, didn't he?

606
00:47:43,318 --> 00:47:45,904
You don't have to
look so resentful. It hurts.

607
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:50,200
I'm here to give you this.

608
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:55,914
Why did you leave that
in my room? Was that a tip?

609
00:47:55,998 --> 00:47:58,667
-I don't need this.
-Why not?

610
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:00,419
I lost the other one too.

611
00:48:02,254 --> 00:48:03,463
I'll just throw it away.

612
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:05,507
You finally got it back. Don't.

613
00:48:06,258 --> 00:48:08,802
Who knows? You might find the other one.

614
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:14,391
-Is this why you came here?
-Of course not.

615
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:16,059
I was passing by.

616
00:48:19,354 --> 00:48:22,107
I'm leaving, so don't tell me to go.

617
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:24,192
I was going to say thank you.

618
00:48:25,527 --> 00:48:26,820
Don't be so dramatic.

619
00:48:29,197 --> 00:48:31,366
You always tell me to leave
whenever we meet.

620
00:48:37,831 --> 00:48:39,625
I have a customer. Go.

621
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:43,420
So you said that again.

622
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:46,923
I'm leaving now.

623
00:48:47,966 --> 00:48:49,301
Welcome.

624
00:48:49,843 --> 00:48:53,388
Gosh, is it you, Gyeong Woo-yeon?

625
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:56,600
It's been so long.

626
00:48:57,267 --> 00:49:00,312
Are you working part-time here?

627
00:49:00,896 --> 00:49:02,022
Are you going to order?

628
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:05,233
I heard you were doing calligraphy.
I guess it was just a hobby.

629
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:07,778
It's my job.

630
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:10,280
There are a lot
of jobless people these days.

631
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:13,033
-Things are tough now.
-Jobless?

632
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:14,159
Hang in there.

633
00:49:16,662 --> 00:49:19,247
Call me sometime. We can talk over a meal.

634
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:25,045
SAMIN INVESTMENT, HWANG JI-HYEON

635
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:31,635
Forget about a meal.

636
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:33,804
I'll send my book to your office.

637
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:36,181
-Your book?
-Yes.

638
00:49:36,264 --> 00:49:38,183
I'm publishing a calligraphy photo book.

639
00:49:38,266 --> 00:49:39,601
Metaphor Publishing House.

640
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:42,729
Isn't that a major publisher?

641
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:44,189
Are they publishing your book?

642
00:49:45,107 --> 00:49:48,193
Yes. It was the CEO's request.

643
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,331
Here's your bubble tea.

644
00:50:03,291 --> 00:50:04,835
Please enjoy.

645
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:13,468
What is he still doing here?

646
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:20,892
Woo-yeon. Take a break.

647
00:50:20,976 --> 00:50:21,852
Yes, ma'am.

648
00:50:26,481 --> 00:50:28,734
Hello. What would you like to order?

649
00:50:29,317 --> 00:50:32,320
One black sugar milk tea
and one black milk tea please.

650
00:50:32,404 --> 00:50:33,405
Okay.

651
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:37,200
What's with that face?
You just had your say.

652
00:50:37,284 --> 00:50:39,202
Your face is all crumpled up.

653
00:50:40,954 --> 00:50:41,997
Nothing.

654
00:50:43,415 --> 00:50:44,583
It feels so strange.

655
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:47,502
When someone calls me a calligrapher,

656
00:50:47,586 --> 00:50:49,755
I feel like I'm doing well.

657
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:51,631
But when I'm working part-time,

658
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:53,717
or talking to my parents,

659
00:50:55,635 --> 00:50:57,304
or at a moment like this,

660
00:50:58,764 --> 00:51:00,766
I can't help but question
if I'm of any use.

661
00:51:03,935 --> 00:51:06,021
Now I feel sorry every day.

662
00:51:06,104 --> 00:51:08,774
I feel sorry for myself and my parents.

663
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:12,235
I'm not proud of anything about me.

664
00:51:14,154 --> 00:51:15,947
I feel like I'm a useless person.

665
00:51:18,074 --> 00:51:20,327
I don't know why I'm telling you this.

666
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:23,413
You'd never know what it's like.

667
00:51:24,164 --> 00:51:26,666
I bet you don't know what's like

668
00:51:27,542 --> 00:51:29,753
to be neglected, denied,
anxious, or left behind.

669
00:51:33,882 --> 00:51:36,092
How many are there
who don't know what it's like?

670
00:51:37,886 --> 00:51:40,180
My parents fought every day
and got divorced.

671
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:42,891
Whether I was frightened or sick,

672
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:45,977
they divorced without caring about me.

673
00:51:46,561 --> 00:51:48,605
And one day they just became friends.

674
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:52,234
I was so upset
that I ran off to the States.

675
00:51:52,317 --> 00:51:55,529
But I was faced with a language barrier
and bitter racism.

676
00:51:55,612 --> 00:51:58,949
I thought I was good at photography,
but there were geniuses everywhere.

677
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:04,120
So I took photos
all day and night like crazy.

678
00:52:04,204 --> 00:52:05,372
I was nervous.

679
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:08,458
I didn't want to fall behind.

680
00:52:10,001 --> 00:52:11,127
I was frightened.

681
00:52:15,215 --> 00:52:18,176
I'm not telling you to stop complaining
because I've been there.

682
00:52:19,177 --> 00:52:20,220
I'm just saying

683
00:52:21,596 --> 00:52:23,348
I don't think I'm that distinguished.

684
00:52:24,432 --> 00:52:25,725
The only good thing about me

685
00:52:27,269 --> 00:52:28,562
is just my looks.

686
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:32,774
You don't sound like such a jerk now.

687
00:52:32,858 --> 00:52:34,150
I'm not.

688
00:52:34,234 --> 00:52:35,652
You're like my friend today.

689
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:38,405
I've always been your friend.

690
00:52:49,124 --> 00:52:52,419
METAPHOR PUBLISHING HOUSE

691
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:54,796
Hello?

692
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:57,257
Yes, Mr. On.

693
00:52:59,217 --> 00:53:00,510
You have something to say?

694
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:04,306
Okay. I'll see you then.

695
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:14,733
Do you have something to say?

696
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:17,235
Please excuse me for a moment.

697
00:53:23,283 --> 00:53:25,869
Hey, you stupid CEO.
Why would you tell her that?

698
00:53:25,952 --> 00:53:27,579
I don't want to lie to her.

699
00:53:27,662 --> 00:53:29,414
She will be upset when she finds out.

700
00:53:31,124 --> 00:53:32,834
Jun-su!

701
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:35,962
That's the problem with you.
You're too righteous.

702
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:38,506
When will you stop observing
all the signals and rules?

703
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:43,428
Still. I don't want to hurt
her feelings in any way.

704
00:53:44,095 --> 00:53:46,640
You're getting cheesier and cheesier.

705
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:49,726
CEO ON JUN-SU

706
00:53:51,144 --> 00:53:52,646
The friend mode is off now.

707
00:53:55,273 --> 00:53:56,524
I'll show myself out.

708
00:53:57,484 --> 00:53:59,194
Please call me when you're done.

709
00:53:59,277 --> 00:54:00,320
Okay.

710
00:54:16,753 --> 00:54:18,046
Mr. On?

711
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:24,511
First, can you promise me one thing?

712
00:54:25,595 --> 00:54:28,098
Whatever I say, you will keep seeing me.

713
00:54:28,598 --> 00:54:30,892
I can't make any rash promises.

714
00:54:32,477 --> 00:54:33,937
Please go ahead.

715
00:54:36,147 --> 00:54:38,316
I changed my number a year ago.

716
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:40,860
And I got this call.

717
00:54:43,863 --> 00:54:46,616
-And it was…
-Is there the owner of the car 7364?

718
00:54:48,201 --> 00:54:49,869
Is it your car?

719
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:50,996
Excuse me.

720
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:22,736
He was getting on his high horse,
but he's just clumsy.

721
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:47,469
MS. GYEONG

722
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:03,943
I'm sorry. I had to move my car.

723
00:56:06,404 --> 00:56:07,781
You got a call.

724
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:09,074
I see.

725
00:56:18,166 --> 00:56:19,209
Ms. Gyeong.

726
00:56:20,085 --> 00:56:22,253
-Let me explain.
-Don't explain.

727
00:56:23,838 --> 00:56:26,216
That will just embarrass me even more.

728
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:35,475
Ms. Gyeong.

729
00:56:38,478 --> 00:56:39,646
Just listen…

730
00:56:42,107 --> 00:56:43,525
You can at least hear me out.

731
00:56:46,152 --> 00:56:47,570
Has it been fun for you?

732
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:51,991
As you saw me weep and wail for a guy,

733
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:54,077
did you think I was easy?

734
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:56,204
You must've thought so little of me.

735
00:56:56,287 --> 00:56:59,165
You were giving me jobs
like giving candy to a kid.

736
00:56:59,749 --> 00:57:02,377
I found out during the party,
and I liked your calligraphy.

737
00:57:03,294 --> 00:57:05,380
I've never thought little of you.

738
00:57:06,214 --> 00:57:07,674
How could I do such a thing

739
00:57:08,424 --> 00:57:09,884
when I know what it feels like?

740
00:57:14,305 --> 00:57:15,932
There was a woman I liked.

741
00:57:16,015 --> 00:57:18,268
For quite a long time, and quite a lot.

742
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:22,981
The things you said on the phone
were just like how I was feeling.

743
00:57:23,982 --> 00:57:25,358
That's why I warmed up to you.

744
00:57:27,986 --> 00:57:30,989
The chance of meeting
someone who's like you is very slim.

745
00:57:31,573 --> 00:57:33,366
That slim chance means it's special.

746
00:57:35,493 --> 00:57:37,537
And I never miss anything special.

747
00:57:44,919 --> 00:57:46,004
I'm sorry.

748
00:57:46,713 --> 00:57:48,798
It's not something
I should yell at you about.

749
00:57:49,382 --> 00:57:50,800
I was embarrassed.

750
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:54,471
It's the part of me that I hate the most.

751
00:57:55,263 --> 00:57:57,765
I can't say things like that
even when I'm sober.

752
00:57:57,849 --> 00:58:00,018
I was embarrassed that you heard it all.

753
00:58:00,643 --> 00:58:02,395
I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner.

754
00:58:05,106 --> 00:58:08,151
I'd like to use my apologetic feeling
as an excuse

755
00:58:09,068 --> 00:58:10,403
and drive you home today.

756
00:58:26,127 --> 00:58:27,128
Can I

757
00:58:28,254 --> 00:58:29,964
ask you something?

758
00:58:30,882 --> 00:58:31,758
Sure.

759
00:58:32,425 --> 00:58:33,468
Well…

760
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:37,305
Why didn't things work out
with the woman you talked about?

761
00:58:38,973 --> 00:58:39,974
Oh, well…

762
00:58:41,476 --> 00:58:43,478
Was it rude?

763
00:58:44,604 --> 00:58:46,272
She married my older brother.

764
00:58:48,691 --> 00:58:51,152
-I see.
-You don't have to be like that.

765
00:58:51,694 --> 00:58:52,946
If things had worked out,

766
00:58:54,113 --> 00:58:55,490
I wouldn't have met you.

767
00:58:58,493 --> 00:59:00,203
You're so straightforward.

768
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:04,249
I've learned that I'll miss everything
if I hesitate too long.

769
00:59:09,504 --> 00:59:10,421
I'll get going.

770
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:18,513
Did you see his face?

771
00:59:18,596 --> 00:59:20,640
-Did you see his car?
-Did you see his figure?

772
00:59:21,891 --> 00:59:23,226
-He's amazing.
-He's amazing.

773
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:44,330
-What's going on?
-Tell us everything.

774
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:46,457
I'm feeling dizzy.

775
00:59:56,384 --> 01:00:00,346
So you called the CEO of the publishing
company for a year by mistake.

776
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:04,267
You said all that when you were drunk,
but he started liking you because of that?

777
01:00:04,350 --> 01:00:05,184
Close enough.

778
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:07,812
This is unbelievable.

779
01:00:07,895 --> 01:00:09,564
I respect you, Gyeong Woo-yeon.

780
01:00:09,647 --> 01:00:10,898
Stop it.

781
01:00:12,817 --> 01:00:15,737
Other people would take the case
to the police station,

782
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:17,363
but you turned it into a romance.

783
01:00:21,075 --> 01:00:22,493
Is she blessed with guys?

784
01:00:23,077 --> 01:00:24,245
It's more like bad luck.

785
01:00:24,996 --> 01:00:27,498
Stop making fun of me.
I'm really embarrassed now.

786
01:00:27,582 --> 01:00:30,793
That's the point.
Despite all that, he still likes you.

787
01:00:30,877 --> 01:00:33,588
If that's not true love, what is?

788
01:00:35,715 --> 01:00:37,300
I envy you, Woo-yeon.

789
01:00:38,259 --> 01:00:41,679
My mom said I could meet Hyun Bin
and Lee Min-ho once I passed the bar exam.

790
01:00:43,181 --> 01:00:46,059
While I don't even see a single guy,

791
01:00:46,142 --> 01:00:48,102
you have a bunch of men around you.

792
01:00:48,186 --> 01:00:50,188
That's not true. It's just one man.

793
01:00:50,271 --> 01:00:51,439
Lee Su is in Seoul now.

794
01:00:52,815 --> 01:00:55,276
So this is how Su brings you good luck.

795
01:00:56,152 --> 01:00:57,278
Oh, right.

796
01:00:59,947 --> 01:01:00,948
Why?

797
01:01:05,036 --> 01:01:07,080
UNREASONABLE GYEONG WOO-YEON

798
01:01:17,965 --> 01:01:19,300
Woo-yeon?

799
01:01:20,635 --> 01:01:23,346
Su? Why are you answering the phone?

800
01:01:24,055 --> 01:01:25,932
Doing the dishes. Should I put him on?

801
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:27,642
No, it's fine.

802
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:32,271
Hey, you should've told me
that you changed your number.

803
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:35,942
That would've been nice.

804
01:01:36,025 --> 01:01:37,485
Do you have a dual personality?

805
01:01:37,568 --> 01:01:39,821
It's not easy to show
two personalities at a time.

806
01:01:43,074 --> 01:01:46,202
If you're at Tonight,
wait there for a while.

807
01:01:46,285 --> 01:01:48,079
You left your sunglasses at the cafe.

808
01:01:48,621 --> 01:01:50,164
-Are you coming now?
-Yes.

809
01:01:51,165 --> 01:01:53,418
And I have something to tell you.

810
01:01:54,001 --> 01:01:55,002
Okay.

811
01:01:57,171 --> 01:01:59,298
Did you tell Mr. On

812
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:02,635
that his number is your old number?

813
01:02:03,594 --> 01:02:06,431
-Why would I tell him that?
-Good.

814
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:10,143
Then don't tell him.

815
01:02:10,226 --> 01:02:12,311
To be exact,

816
01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:14,939
can you not tell Mr. On that I liked you?

817
01:02:15,773 --> 01:02:16,607
Please.

818
01:02:17,108 --> 01:02:18,818
You came here just to say that?

819
01:02:18,901 --> 01:02:21,654
And to give your sunglasses back.

820
01:02:24,031 --> 01:02:26,075
Please.

821
01:02:27,076 --> 01:02:28,411
Stop talking like that.

822
01:02:28,494 --> 01:02:29,746
Okay.

823
01:02:36,169 --> 01:02:38,713
I'll send you an address.
Be there by 1 p.m. on Thursday.

824
01:02:39,881 --> 01:02:41,132
What?

825
01:02:41,215 --> 01:02:43,885
Oh, right.
I just realized this about myself.

826
01:02:43,968 --> 01:02:45,470
I have loose lips.

827
01:02:46,053 --> 01:02:47,096
Hey!

828
01:02:50,099 --> 01:02:51,601
Do you think I'll go there?

829
01:02:58,524 --> 01:03:00,318
-You're here.
-You told me to.

830
01:03:00,401 --> 01:03:03,070
I didn't know you'd come. Come in.

831
01:03:15,958 --> 01:03:17,043
What is this place?

832
01:03:30,973 --> 01:03:32,183
Start working.

833
01:03:33,184 --> 01:03:35,478
Hey, I'm not here to work.

834
01:03:35,561 --> 01:03:36,646
You don't want to?

835
01:03:37,688 --> 01:03:41,025
I think my mouth has just got
a little bigger than yesterday.

836
01:03:42,944 --> 01:03:44,570
I'm a great worker.

837
01:03:44,654 --> 01:03:46,030
I bet you didn't know.

838
01:03:46,739 --> 01:03:48,825
Where should we start?

839
01:03:53,788 --> 01:03:55,540
-Carry that one.
-Okay.

840
01:03:57,333 --> 01:03:58,584
Where should I put this?

841
01:03:59,544 --> 01:04:00,878
In the bedroom.

842
01:05:13,784 --> 01:05:15,661
Oh, gosh. It slipped.

843
01:05:20,124 --> 01:05:21,083
No, it didn't.

844
01:05:22,043 --> 01:05:23,127
I think you threw it.

845
01:05:23,836 --> 01:05:24,962
Did you see that?

846
01:05:36,807 --> 01:05:38,225
The office dinner is tonight.

847
01:05:39,018 --> 01:05:40,436
You all must come.

848
01:05:40,519 --> 01:05:42,605
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

849
01:05:43,230 --> 01:05:45,691
Why do we have
office dinners all the time?

850
01:05:51,906 --> 01:05:54,200
Honey. Are you working overtime tonight?

851
01:05:57,703 --> 01:05:59,789
I'm having an office dinner.

852
01:06:01,999 --> 01:06:04,460
What? Did you make up
with your girlfriend?

853
01:06:04,543 --> 01:06:05,586
You look better now.

854
01:06:05,670 --> 01:06:07,588
-I should go apologize.
-What?

855
01:06:08,839 --> 01:06:11,342
You're on a leash
even before getting married?

856
01:06:11,425 --> 01:06:14,136
I want her to hold the leash tight
and never let it go.

857
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:17,014
Look at you. What a devoted husband.

858
01:06:17,848 --> 01:06:19,475
Thank you for the compliment.

859
01:06:29,610 --> 01:06:31,904
Sort them by size,
literature and non-literature.

860
01:06:31,988 --> 01:06:34,699
And literature should be
divided into poems and novels.

861
01:06:43,958 --> 01:06:46,210
Don't you have any friends
to help you move?

862
01:06:47,086 --> 01:06:49,005
I do. You.

863
01:06:52,508 --> 01:06:54,051
I must've committed a lot of sins.

864
01:06:55,636 --> 01:06:57,638
Maybe I was a traitor in my past life.

865
01:07:17,533 --> 01:07:19,410
THANK YOU FOR BEING BORN, SU

866
01:07:23,164 --> 01:07:25,583
Happy birthday. Buy us dinner.

867
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:38,721
HI, SU. I HOPE YOU WILL
LEARN HUMILITY THIS YEAR

868
01:07:38,804 --> 01:07:42,099
Lee Su, I like you.

869
01:07:45,394 --> 01:07:47,563
How many times did I tell him?

870
01:07:49,732 --> 01:07:51,150
And he rejected me every time.

871
01:07:52,902 --> 01:07:54,111
Are you done?

872
01:07:55,321 --> 01:07:57,406
Gosh, it's still here.

873
01:07:57,907 --> 01:07:59,533
Look at the dust.

874
01:07:59,617 --> 01:08:01,952
Things only collect dust over time.

875
01:08:02,745 --> 01:08:04,580
That's it. I'm done.

876
01:08:11,045 --> 01:08:12,254
You did it all.

877
01:08:12,797 --> 01:08:14,757
I did you a favor.

878
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:16,300
So you should…

879
01:08:16,383 --> 01:08:17,927
Do you want to hide it that badly?

880
01:08:19,261 --> 01:08:20,304
What?

881
01:08:21,347 --> 01:08:24,683
Would you really hate it
if the CEO finds out

882
01:08:25,684 --> 01:08:26,560
that you liked me?

883
01:08:28,395 --> 01:08:31,607
It's not just him.
I don't want anyone to know.

884
01:08:32,483 --> 01:08:33,567
It hurts my pride.

885
01:08:35,027 --> 01:08:36,821
Does liking someone hurt your pride?

886
01:08:38,239 --> 01:08:39,865
I had a crush on someone for years.

887
01:08:39,949 --> 01:08:41,700
That's enough to hurt my pride.

888
01:08:45,079 --> 01:08:48,165
It makes me look pathetic and easy.

889
01:08:48,916 --> 01:08:51,919
Just like how you played with my heart,

890
01:08:52,002 --> 01:08:53,504
other people might do the same.

891
01:08:53,587 --> 01:08:56,298
I didn't say any of the things you said.

892
01:08:56,382 --> 01:08:57,591
Anyway,

893
01:08:58,592 --> 01:09:01,804
I still have half of my pride left
after you destroyed it.

894
01:09:02,763 --> 01:09:04,014
I want to protect it.

895
01:09:04,723 --> 01:09:07,059
You can do that for me, right?
I'll get going.

896
01:09:10,104 --> 01:09:11,730
Eat something before you leave.

897
01:09:11,814 --> 01:09:14,358
I have plans for dinner.

898
01:09:14,441 --> 01:09:17,027
With who? The CEO?

899
01:09:17,111 --> 01:09:18,237
Yes.

900
01:09:24,952 --> 01:09:26,287
How do I open this?

901
01:09:43,345 --> 01:09:44,430
Don't go.

902
01:09:47,224 --> 01:09:49,018
Don't meet him.

903
01:10:04,408 --> 01:10:05,993
I don't want you to see him.

904
01:10:08,954 --> 01:10:11,832
When you're in a tiger's den,
you must keep your eyes wide open.

905
01:10:14,627 --> 01:10:16,086
And this tiger is

906
01:10:19,423 --> 01:10:20,591
exceptionally dangerous.

907
01:10:31,977 --> 01:10:35,147
Woo-yeon. Take a break.

908
01:11:08,681 --> 01:11:12,184
If you make Woo-yeon cry again,
I won't forgive you.

909
01:11:12,685 --> 01:11:13,769
Did I make you cry?

910
01:11:13,852 --> 01:11:15,980
-What?
-Did you cry because of me?

911
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:17,398
What do you like?

912
01:11:17,982 --> 01:11:19,608
You're a nice guy.

913
01:11:19,692 --> 01:11:22,528
I hope that changes to "the guy I like."

914
01:11:23,112 --> 01:11:25,197
Just forget all about Su.

915
01:11:25,281 --> 01:11:27,283
-I'll only work with him.
-Hi.

916
01:11:27,366 --> 01:11:31,161
Just like how the feelings
you didn't notice suddenly appear.

917
01:11:31,245 --> 01:11:33,414
How can you not notice your own feelings?

918
01:11:37,459 --> 01:11:39,670
Woo-yeon called in sick today.

919
01:11:39,753 --> 01:11:41,088
Wait until she comes out.

920
01:11:41,171 --> 01:11:42,715
What will you do if she collapsed?

921
01:11:42,798 --> 01:11:44,967
I will take care of everything.

922
01:11:45,050 --> 01:11:46,385
Do you like Woo-yeon?

923
01:11:47,344 --> 01:11:52,349
