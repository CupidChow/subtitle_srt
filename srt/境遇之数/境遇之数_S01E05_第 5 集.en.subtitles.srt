1
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:51,509
Don't go.

2
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:56,097
Don't meet him.

3
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:08,109
I don't want you to see him.

4
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:16,826
Do you know what you're saying?

5
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,078
I do.

6
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:23,083
I'm stopping you.

7
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:30,340
You said your dating life
sucked because of me

8
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:32,592
and you couldn't like anyone else but me.

9
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:34,969
So you were unhappy.

10
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,473
I feel responsible for
what you went through.

11
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:42,185
You shouldn't just date anyone
when you don't even like--

12
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:45,021
Who says I don't like him?

13
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:46,773
He's not just anyone.

14
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:49,692
He's a good man.

15
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:51,861
I think I can learn to like him.

16
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:54,781
So…

17
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:58,076
you don't have the right
to feel responsible

18
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:02,080
or to tell me who I should
or should not date.

19
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:03,706
We're just…

20
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:07,418
friends, right?

21
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,901
He still has that habit.

22
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:35,363
He still confuses me.

23
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:44,831
PROSECUTOR HAN JIN-JU

24
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:54,841
YOU ARE INVITED TO
SHIN DONG-HUN AND JUNG JI-YUN'S WEDDING

25
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:03,933
How dare he send me a wedding invitation?

26
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,894
Why not?

27
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:08,813
I'll be blunt. You guys weren't dating.

28
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:09,939
It wasn't even a fling.

29
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,900
It wasn't because of my lack of trying.

30
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:14,277
It's not some amusement ride
I can ride alone.

31
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,820
I need permission to go on it.

32
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:19,741
Right. Why are you so worked up?
You just had a crush on him.

33
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:24,162
I'm angry only for one reason.

34
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,957
Everyone else is actively dating
and getting married.

35
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,168
But how come I'm still single?

36
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:31,628
Why am I always alone?

37
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:34,213
Dating a lot of men
isn't so special, either.

38
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:37,175
Look at me. I'm alone right now.

39
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:39,636
Then since we're both alone,
let's grab a drink.

40
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:41,930
Now?

41
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:44,140
Yes. Should I pick you up?
Are you outside?

42
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:46,559
Well,

43
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:50,063
I have plans tonight.

44
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:51,356
With who?

45
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,400
I see. Your CEO?

46
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:55,568
Yes.

47
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,779
Do you want to call Yeong-hui?

48
00:03:57,862 --> 00:04:00,865
No. Have fun on your date.

49
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:02,450
Okay.

50
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:05,870
She said she was alone.

51
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:10,959
Why are you out here?

52
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:15,630
To do this.

53
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:38,653
You must be hungry.
Let's go and get some delicious food.

54
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:00,258
I've always had bad relationships.

55
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:03,636
I just dated anyone even though
I didn't have feelings for them.

56
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,514
Since I started liking you,
I couldn't like anyone else.

57
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:08,182
It's too hard for me.

58
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:10,893
I feel responsible for
what you went through.

59
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,562
You don't have the right to feel

60
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:15,356
responsible or to tell me
who I should or should not date.

61
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:16,983
We're just

62
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:19,193
friends, right?

63
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:33,249
GIRL WITH THE CURSE OF THE NINTH

64
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,210
Come on, what is she doing?
Why isn't she answering her phone?

65
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:39,630
-Hello.
-The receiver cannot be reached.

66
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:42,383
-Please leave a message.
-Fine. Just hang up on me.

67
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:45,386
-Have a drink. Let's raise our glasses.
-Sure.

68
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:49,223
By the way, how come
you never fight with your boyfriend?

69
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:51,017
We had a fight recently.

70
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,852
But you don't seem bothered.

71
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:53,895
Aren't you nervous?

72
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:55,688
We dated for ten years.

73
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:57,523
So our patterns are fixed now.

74
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:01,486
"She's probably cooled off by now.

75
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:04,739
I should give her a signal
that I want to make up.

76
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,367
I should let this go now."
You know, things like that.

77
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:13,081
Ms. Kim, did you have a fight
with your boyfriend?

78
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:14,165
No.

79
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:16,667
I have ears, too.
I heard you say you had a fight.

80
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,921
You have good hearing for no good reason.

81
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:21,339
This is a compliment.

82
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:25,468
-Right. I have good hearing, don't I?
-Yes.

83
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:29,430
By the way, you should apologize, Ms. Kim.

84
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:32,809
You can't date other guys now.
You dated him for ten years.

85
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:36,020
What do you mean by that?

86
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:37,438
Let's be honest.

87
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:40,316
Unofficially, you're a married woman
who went all the way.

88
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:41,984
No men will accept it.

89
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:45,613
Only pushovers will accept your history.
Don't you agree?

90
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:49,033
Sir, let me pour you a drink.

91
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:52,245
-My glass is filled.
-Can you pour me a drink, then?

92
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:56,249
All right. Let's stop drinking.

93
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:06,801
Do you not like the food?

94
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:10,304
No. It's good.

95
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:17,728
Why don't we do something
that will lift your mood after dinner?

96
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:20,148
What do you like, Ms. Gyeong?

97
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:30,575
You're a nice guy.

98
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:33,244
I hope that changes to "the guy I like."

99
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:35,580
If I met you a long time ago,

100
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:38,541
I would have caved in and dated you.

101
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:41,335
I don't dislike you.

102
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:44,964
And I would have hoped
that I might grow to like you.

103
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:47,717
Why don't you cave in
and hope that you will?

104
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,428
That hope has always betrayed me.

105
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:54,640
I don't want to be
in another bad relationship.

106
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:56,392
It might turn out differently.

107
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:00,271
I don't think I could be

108
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,983
in a good relationship.

109
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:08,988
Then, why don't we test this out?

110
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:12,074
Let's see if you could be
in a good relationship or not.

111
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:15,328
I'll be your test subject.

112
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,668
I don't want to do that.

113
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:24,462
But you don't dislike me.

114
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:27,423
You said you could have hoped
it would be different.

115
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:31,677
If you're turning it down for my sake,
you don't have to.

116
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:34,138
You turned me down,

117
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:36,599
but despite that,
I'm still hanging onto you.

118
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:39,644
So I'll be responsible for my own pain.

119
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,940
There's no need to think so hard about it.

120
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:47,777
When I ask you out with a decent excuse,
please say yes like today.

121
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:51,572
When you do, you will end up liking me.

122
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:53,533
I'll make sure you do.

123
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:57,954
You're quite confident.
You do sound trustworthy.

124
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:59,789
It's all an act,

125
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:01,832
so you can trust me.

126
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,590
-Let's eat.
-Okay.

127
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:18,182
Can you get something from the backseat?

128
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,059
Sure.

129
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:26,607
It's a bribe for brownie points.

130
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:42,331
TONIGHT

131
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:45,126
Goodness. What is it this time?

132
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:48,212
It's obvious that
you have something on your mind.

133
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:51,966
Come on, lighten up.
Just tell me what's bothering you.

134
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:55,553
Am I that unattractive?

135
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,682
-Am I that lacking?
-Oh, my.

136
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,475
So many guys like Woo-yeon.

137
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:05,104
And Hyeon-jae is crazy about Yeong-hui.
But why am I alone?

138
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:06,314
Why am I always alone?

139
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:09,775
Why are you blaming yourself?
You just haven't met the right person.

140
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:11,485
It's not your fault.

141
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:15,656
Besides, being single is awesome.

142
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:17,283
How?

143
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:19,744
You have a lot of time and money.

144
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:24,415
Oh, right. That's why you deserve to drink
this high-quality traditional liquor.

145
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:27,752
I was just about to say
you don't have to if you don't want to.

146
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:29,670
Why are you always so angry?

147
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:34,175
Perfect timing. If it weren't for you,
I would've been dead.

148
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:36,010
You're coming here often.

149
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:37,845
Is ignoring me a trend with you girls?

150
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,682
-It's a long tradition.
-Is ignoring me your habit?

151
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:44,644
You just realized that now?

152
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:47,021
-You punk.
-Beer, please.

153
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:48,356
You don't get a beer.

154
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:52,443
Aren't you going back to Jeju Island?

155
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:55,279
Are you leaving? You should go somewhere.

156
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:58,491
-Does she hate me?
-You just realized that now?

157
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:06,165
I wonder if Woo-yeon's date is going well.

158
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,250
Is she dating again?

159
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,044
He's a really nice guy.

160
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:13,589
He's hot, rich,
and totally straightforward.

161
00:11:13,672 --> 00:11:15,049
"Totally straightforward"?

162
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:16,842
On top of that, he's so gentle.

163
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,762
They're like a match made in heaven.

164
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:22,848
You call yourself a prosecutor.
But where's your sense of justice?

165
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,934
Save that guy. Tell him to run away.

166
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:31,315
-Where are you going?
-To the restroom.

167
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,363
-What's his job?
-I don't know.

168
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:39,824
What? You guys must think
you can walk all over me.

169
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:42,827
-You just realized that now?
-You little…

170
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:46,997
What did you mean
by "totally straightforward"?

171
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:48,833
TONIGHT

172
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,086
Oh, right. I don't smoke.

173
00:11:58,342 --> 00:12:00,094
All right. Wait.

174
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:03,764
Has anyone here bought
concert tickets online?

175
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:07,143
Have you done that?

176
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,311
I…

177
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:14,650
-What is it?
-The moment they find out you're capable,

178
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:16,610
that will always be your job.

179
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:19,113
I see.

180
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:26,495
Sir, didn't you say you went to
Red Velvet's concert the other day?

181
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:29,165
You need serious skills
to buy their tickets.

182
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:30,082
Totally.

183
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,501
-You're amazing.
-You're so amazing.

184
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,336
-You're so good.
-You're amazing.

185
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,255
-Really? Then help me out.
-Amazing.

186
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,926
My daughter has been pestering me
to buy tickets for NCT's concert.

187
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:44,346
Sure. Tell me the date
of the concert she wants.

188
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,683
-Sure. Let's have a drink, everyone.
-Nice.

189
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:59,195
JIN-JU

190
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:06,243
-Hello.
-Hey, girl. You've got to come over here.

191
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:07,369
Hey!

192
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:11,290
Our Cultured Pearl is totally wasted.
It's a huge mess here.

193
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:12,958
-Jin-ju? Why?
-Hey, stop that.

194
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:14,793
-No.
-Beats me.

195
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:17,254
She told Su not to make you cry
and won't let him go.

196
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:20,758
-Okay. I'll be there quickly.
-Okay. Don't move. Hurry.

197
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:23,761
What's wrong?

198
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:29,892
I need to stop by somewhere.

199
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:32,728
Sure.

200
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:39,068
I can drive into the alley.

201
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:42,863
No. It's a narrow alley.
It's better if I walk.

202
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:45,199
I'll wait if it won't take long.

203
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:47,910
No. My friend probably drove here.

204
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:50,246
I thought we were getting close.

205
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:54,083
Don't you think you're refusing me
a bit too often?

206
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,963
-Drive safe.
-Bye.

207
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,058
When will she stop being so distant?

208
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:14,395
Sir. Get home safely.

209
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:15,896
-Bye.
-Bye.

210
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:19,066
Wait. Hold on. Wait.

211
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,738
Guys, we should go for round three.

212
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:26,448
Round three.

213
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:28,617
-Round three.
-Round three.

214
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,828
-You almost made me sad.
-Round three.

215
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:33,873
-Let's go.
-Round three.

216
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:36,375
-Let's go, round three.
-Let's go.

217
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:38,752
-Over there?
-Yes.

218
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:45,175
When are you going to go home?

219
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:54,768
Did you drink a lot?

220
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:58,606
How did you know I was here?

221
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:00,316
You texted me to come here.

222
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:03,402
You go to Pretty Pig's
for company dinners.

223
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:05,654
Afterward, you always go to this karaoke.

224
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:09,074
My gosh, what a clever lady.

225
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:10,242
It wasn't my intention.

226
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:19,168
I'm sorry. I regret what I did.

227
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:22,713
-How much?
-Enough to not do it again.

228
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:28,385
I'm going to let it slide just this once.

229
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:29,678
Okay.

230
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:32,681
-Sweetie.
-Yes?

231
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:35,434
Should I have ramyeon
at your place tonight?

232
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:36,810
-Tonight?
-Yes.

233
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:38,437
Will you?

234
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:41,398
-What?
-Let's go.

235
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:46,111
Seriously. When did you get here?

236
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:47,655
I know everything.

237
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:54,787
What took you so long?

238
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,080
Where's Jin-ju?

239
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:00,960
Hey! Jin-ju.

240
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:02,628
Jin-ju.

241
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:04,630
Why did you let her drink this much?

242
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:08,467
Her? She drinks like a fish.

243
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,427
How can a prosecutor be so violent?

244
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:11,971
Su got beaten up pretty good.

245
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:14,598
See it for yourself when he comes back.
There he is.

246
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:20,938
Tell your friend that she'll be
a defendant tomorrow, not a prosecutor.

247
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:23,774
There's no need to be that harsh.

248
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:24,817
Jin-ju, wake up.

249
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:32,116
You…

250
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:39,581
If you break Woo-yeon's heart
one more time, you're dead meat.

251
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:42,710
If you make Woo-yeon cry again,

252
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:45,587
as the prosecutor of this country

253
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:49,258
and as her friend, I won't forgive you!

254
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:50,884
What? Is she Sailor Moon?

255
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:53,262
Have you gone mad? Hey, wake up.

256
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:57,933
Woo-yeon means so much to me.

257
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:02,438
My gosh, she's a goner.
Hey, put her on my back.

258
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,106
-Jin-ju.
-Put her on my back.

259
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:08,110
-Get her cell phone and her bag.
-Okay.

260
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:10,654
Goodness.

261
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:14,950
Move.

262
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:18,579
Watch your head.

263
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:28,547
I cannot leave the restaurant unmanned.
I'm going back in.

264
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:29,548
Get home safely.

265
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:33,218
-Call me.
-Okay.

266
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:36,430
Let me come with you.

267
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:39,308
-Why?
-To sue Jin-ju.

268
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:56,658
Did the date go well?

269
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:58,327
Yes.

270
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,622
-Woo-yeon.
-Yes?

271
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:03,290
Did I make you cry?

272
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:04,750
Yes.

273
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:08,337
-What?
-Did you cry because of me?

274
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:13,008
That's what Jin-ju said earlier.

275
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,177
She'll kill me if I make you cry again.

276
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:20,307
Seriously?

277
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:24,645
Why would you listen to a drunk girl?

278
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:28,899
Some use alcohol to tell the truth.

279
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:31,568
Drunk people tend to say things
by mistake more often.

280
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:33,362
That's how they are.

281
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:37,324
What the heck is Su thinking?

282
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:39,076
Didn't Su talk about Woo-yeon?

283
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:40,160
No.

284
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:43,580
That's Su. He always keeps
a straight face and doesn't say anything.

285
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:45,457
I have no idea what he's thinking.

286
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:48,377
I'd never date a guy like him.
I'd be frustrated.

287
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:51,880
Here.

288
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:55,008
Don't worry.
I'll be the last guy you'll ever date.

289
00:18:58,428 --> 00:18:59,847
But you're like that, too.

290
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:02,224
You don't talk about yourself, either.

291
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:08,522
I've dated you for ten years,
but there's a lot I don't know about you.

292
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,613
You didn't know? That's my thing.
I want to be a mysterious woman.

293
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:23,162
So you could be even more attractive?

294
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:28,876
-By the way,
-Yes.

295
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:33,380
are we just going to eat ramyeon?
No additional activity?

296
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,551
Can't we finish this?
It's a waste of food.

297
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:55,861
Hello, ma'am.

298
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,572
Thank you for looking out for her.

299
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:01,950
Not at all. This is nothing.

300
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:05,245
My gosh. She only ends up drinking
because she can't date.

301
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:06,663
She's rich, has a nice job,

302
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:08,457
is well-educated, and pretty.

303
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,626
Why can't she date?

304
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:13,837
It's because of you, ma'am.

305
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:16,131
My mom told me once I go to college,

306
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:19,843
I could date men
like Gang Dong-won and Zo In-sung.

307
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:24,014
Dating is harder than getting into SNU
and passing the bar exam for her.

308
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,851
My gosh. But she doesn't want to
go on blind dates.

309
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:29,061
She's so stubborn.

310
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,897
She drives me crazy
when she's all grown up.

311
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:35,484
It was you who caused this.

312
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:37,110
My mom said I could meet Hyun Bin

313
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:39,196
and Lee Min-ho once I passed the bar exam.

314
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:43,283
I'll get going, then.

315
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:45,744
Okay. Get home safe. It's late.

316
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:48,121
Okay. Bye.

317
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:49,206
Bye.

318
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:52,501
-Thanks.
-Sure.

319
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,676
What took you so long?

320
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:06,265
What could you possibly talk about
with a drunk girl?

321
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:07,683
You're still here.

322
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:08,934
How could I go?

323
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:11,270
Why are you asking me? Get a cab.

324
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:13,105
The transportation wasn't the problem.

325
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:15,565
How can I leave without you?
It's dangerous at night.

326
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:21,905
What if something happens to you?

327
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:24,283
I don't want to feel guilty
because of you.

328
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:27,953
You don't care about
anyone else but yourself.

329
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:30,789
Do you think
the world centers around you, too?

330
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:31,957
Of course.

331
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:34,918
Let's go.

332
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:52,894
If you break Woo-yeon's heart
one more time, you're dead meat.

333
00:21:57,065 --> 00:21:58,233
He's a good man.

334
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:00,610
I think I can learn to like him.

335
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:13,790
Oh, right. My flowers.

336
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:15,292
Wait.

337
00:22:17,961 --> 00:22:19,004
Pass me my flowers.

338
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:26,636
Do you have selective memory?
Why did you remember this?

339
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,973
I'm using my memory to the fullest
after forgetting you.

340
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:33,060
Thank you.

341
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:45,447
Gosh, it's so chilly.

342
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:58,835
How long have you been out here?

343
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:01,797
Are you a two-timer?
Or did you break up with him already?

344
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,006
It's not what you think.

345
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:07,177
Did you manage to see his face
when it's so dark?

346
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,513
It's dark, but his face was
shining like a star.

347
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:12,265
You have a bad taste in men.

348
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:15,060
What? No.
You and I have a similar taste in men.

349
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:19,314
This was all your fault.

350
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:25,904
She always takes everything out on me.

351
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:27,531
My goodness.

352
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:28,824
Unbelievable.

353
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:34,538
I'm going to put them on soon.
Why fold them?

354
00:23:35,163 --> 00:23:37,124
I don't want your clothes to get wrinkled.

355
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:42,129
My gosh, you're so nice. You're amazing.

356
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:45,549
Then why won't you marry me?

357
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:48,802
I don't want you to suffer.

358
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:50,679
I'm kind of serious.

359
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:52,472
I don't want a serious conversation.

360
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:55,892
You won't marry me?

361
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:59,646
If I get married, I'll marry you.

362
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:00,730
And I'll get married.

363
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:02,649
Then why do you always avoid the topic?

364
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:06,486
I'm not avoiding it. I'm 29 years old
this year, the curse of the ninth. Okay?

365
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:57,162
I'm a total idiot if I ever drink again.

366
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:58,663
Prosecutor Han.

367
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:01,666
Hey.

368
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:02,792
Did you drink a lot?

369
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:06,213
A bit. No. I drank a lot.

370
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:07,839
Drink this.

371
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:11,176
Did you also drink a lot last night?

372
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:14,137
No. I had one with me.
And it looked like you needed it.

373
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:17,807
Thank you.

374
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:20,227
Don't drink too much.
Your liver won't last.

375
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,701
How could the bottle be green, too?

376
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:39,246
It's a green light, right?

377
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:43,250
He's a really nice guy.

378
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:46,461
What is it? Why aren't you talking?

379
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:49,547
You're the one who drank last night.

380
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:53,134
But I'm the one who's feeling sick.

381
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:55,512
Are you sick? How?

382
00:25:56,346 --> 00:25:58,056
My body's aching all over.

383
00:25:58,139 --> 00:25:59,849
Did you go to the hospital?

384
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:03,311
The only thing I can do is talk.

385
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:05,730
What about your parents?

386
00:26:10,443 --> 00:26:12,279
Woo-yeon, we're going to Namhae.

387
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:16,074
Oh, no. What should we do?
I have to work late today.

388
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:19,035
-Why don't you call Yeong-hui--
-No.

389
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:22,706
I'm sure she's busy as well.

390
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:26,710
I'm sure
I'll be fine after I get some rest.

391
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:30,463
Okay.

392
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:36,511
JIN-JU

393
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:46,479
What about this week's shoot?

394
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:58,074
METAPHOR PUBLISHING HOUSE

395
00:26:59,242 --> 00:27:01,077
-Mr. On.
-Yes?

396
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:03,747
Do you want to go
to the school reunion together?

397
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:04,831
I can't make it.

398
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:07,000
Why is that?

399
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:09,502
I'm on a test.

400
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:13,381
I see. All right, then.

401
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:34,402
WHAT ABOUT THIS WEEK'S SHOOT?

402
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,196
She's ignoring my text?

403
00:28:05,308 --> 00:28:08,228
Woo-yeon called in sick today.

404
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:10,021
She says she's aching all over.

405
00:28:10,605 --> 00:28:11,648
I see.

406
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:14,234
Okay. Thank you.

407
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:17,195
You're not the only one asking for her.

408
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:21,616
I mean, a handsome guy came by
earlier and asked about her.

409
00:28:21,699 --> 00:28:24,035
I thought he was her boyfriend.

410
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:31,334
He's not her boyfriend.

411
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:39,759
Hello?

412
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,971
I heard you're sick.
Did you go to the hospital?

413
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:47,684
It's late.

414
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:50,645
I bet you didn't eat or take any medicine.

415
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,648
I've been sleeping.

416
00:28:56,484 --> 00:28:58,528
Come out. Let's go to the hospital.

417
00:28:59,195 --> 00:29:00,238
What?

418
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:04,492
I'm at your house.

419
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:06,703
No way. You can't be.

420
00:29:07,203 --> 00:29:08,580
No.

421
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:10,665
I know women don't like it when

422
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:13,293
men suddenly show up
and ask to meet without a heads-up.

423
00:29:14,377 --> 00:29:17,255
But you need to go to the hospital
and have some food, too.

424
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:20,216
No, I'm okay.

425
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,427
I'm really okay.

426
00:29:23,052 --> 00:29:24,512
I'm not okay with this.

427
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:28,224
I'm not okay with this, either.

428
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:29,392
I won't look at you.

429
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:33,021
I'll keep my eyes on the road.
Let me drive you to the hospital.

430
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:44,657
Wait until she comes out.
She said she was coming out.

431
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:47,410
I'm here because she's taking too long.

432
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:49,954
What will you do if she collapsed?

433
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:52,081
I will take care of everything.

434
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:57,378
-Woo-yeon.
-Ms. Gyeong.

435
00:29:58,463 --> 00:29:59,506
Are you okay?

436
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:04,844
What are you two doing here?

437
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:06,930
-Let's go to the hospital.
-Let's go.

438
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:09,682
Can't you see the driver is waiting?

439
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:12,936
So take the taxi back and go home.
I was here first.

440
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:17,106
Ms. Gyeong, are you okay?

441
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,858
-Come with me.
-Come with me.

442
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:21,194
My gosh.

443
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:24,489
I just want both of you to go home.

444
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:28,201
I'm taking the taxi.

445
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:29,786
You can't go all by yourself.

446
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:31,412
Right. Come with me.

447
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:33,581
She said she wants to take the taxi.

448
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:36,084
-She doesn't want to take it with you.
-Gosh, come on.

449
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:38,753
Can you two…

450
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:42,048
Can you just go?

451
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:44,717
I have a really bad headache.

452
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:46,302
Ms. Gyeong.

453
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:56,521
Jin-ju.

454
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:03,152
Get your hands off her.

455
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:06,322
You're the CEO.

456
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:08,032
She told me so much about you.

457
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:09,325
I'm On Jun-su.

458
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:11,953
I'm sorry,
but I'll take her with me today.

459
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:14,122
Then please take good care of her.

460
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:32,974
What's going on here?
Why are they both here?

461
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:34,767
I don't know.

462
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:38,313
Why are you sick?
You're breaking my heart.

463
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:39,606
Because you can't brag?

464
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:43,484
Yes. Today is a historical day.
Why did you get sick?

465
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:45,570
Gosh. My ears are ringing.

466
00:31:56,956 --> 00:31:58,041
You know what?

467
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:06,049
I don't even know
why I'm asking this, but…

468
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:07,425
Then don't.

469
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:13,139
You guys aren't dating right now.
It's rude to come to her house like this.

470
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:16,851
There's no need to worry about that.

471
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:18,978
We're more than just colleagues.

472
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:24,943
In my opinion,
you're the one who's being rude

473
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:26,361
when you're just her friend.

474
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:30,698
Or

475
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:33,701
do you like Woo-yeon?

476
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:44,545
As if. I told you. We're just friends.

477
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:49,092
That's great. I hope you will keep
your word and your friendship.

478
00:32:49,592 --> 00:32:50,843
Bye, then.

479
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:43,479
-Are you feeling better?
-Yes, totally.

480
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:47,442
But how are you here?
I thought you had to work late today.

481
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:49,652
I finished quickly because I was worried.

482
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:53,781
-I'm the best, aren't I?
-You showed up at the perfect timing.

483
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:57,535
Right. Why did you hesitate?
You could have just gone with the CEO.

484
00:33:58,494 --> 00:33:59,996
I wasn't hesitant.

485
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:03,750
I was too sick to think.

486
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:20,516
Tangerines.

487
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:24,729
They must be from your CEO.

488
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:28,691
He's so considerate.
Tangerines are your favorite.

489
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:31,944
And this is porridge.

490
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:34,280
I'll heat this up for you.
You should eat this.

491
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:57,220
Thank you for the porridge.

492
00:34:57,303 --> 00:34:58,471
I'm glad.

493
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:02,141
I'm sorry about earlier.

494
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:05,645
I showed up unannounced
and made a scene there.

495
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:09,565
Don't show up
without a heads-up like that.

496
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:10,900
I'm sorry.

497
00:35:11,692 --> 00:35:14,403
Because I was worried,
I let my emotions take over.

498
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:17,698
I don't want you to see me

499
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:20,201
when I'm not ready.

500
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:24,622
You looked pretty earlier.

501
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:26,707
You said you wouldn't look.

502
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:29,752
I couldn't stop looking at you
because you're pretty.

503
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:36,634
Oh, right. How did you know
that I like tangerines?

504
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:38,803
-Tangerines?
-Yes.

505
00:35:38,886 --> 00:35:41,639
Tangerines are my favorite.

506
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,644
The tangerines

507
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:50,106
were from someone else.

508
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:05,413
-What are you doing?
-These are from Su.

509
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:06,831
Don't eat them.

510
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:08,207
They are just tangerines.

511
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:12,587
By the way, I really don't understand him.

512
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:14,672
The way he looked at you.

513
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:17,341
It looked like he had feelings for you.

514
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:19,927
You're way off base again.

515
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:21,637
That's what you said ten years ago.

516
00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:23,639
You said he liked me.

517
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:25,808
I mean, the things he did…

518
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:29,312
You're right.
No one knows what he's thinking.

519
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:31,314
Right.

520
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:33,900
Whatever. Let's stop.
Let's just stop talking about him.

521
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:36,235
Hey. You're the one who started it.

522
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:39,947
How is it going with your CEO?
Are you seeing him, then?

523
00:36:43,075 --> 00:36:45,119
-For now?
-What does that mean?

524
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:48,873
What? Why are you smiling like that?

525
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:52,126
You know, he told me

526
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:54,086
to test him out.

527
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:56,214
-Do what?
-Test him out.

528
00:36:57,131 --> 00:36:59,050
I told him all my relationships were bad.

529
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:03,512
He told me to test him to see
if he can help me

530
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:05,139
have a good relationship.

531
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:07,725
He's weird, isn't he?

532
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:12,772
He's the perfect guy.

533
00:37:14,857 --> 00:37:17,193
He does seem like a really nice guy.

534
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:20,279
Right. Just forget about Su.

535
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:24,825
Anyway, he'll probably leave soon.

536
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:27,036
I'll only work with him

537
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:30,498
if nothing happens.

538
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:39,173
How can she not give me a call
after leaving me like that?

539
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:01,445
Who parked in front of my house?

540
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:13,416
Hi.

541
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:16,252
Get in.

542
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:21,048
What's this car?

543
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:24,218
-I bought it.
-You're staying in Korea?

544
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,137
-For now.
-Why?

545
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,430
I just wanted to.

546
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:29,432
What's today's theme?

547
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:35,021
We're going to Euljiro and Haebangchon.

548
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:37,523
For Euljiro…

549
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:41,736
Old printing shops there
are still operational.

550
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:43,529
And there are old restaurants.

551
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:48,367
Next to these shops,
retro cafes and restaurants sprang up.

552
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:50,453
This area got popular because of them.

553
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:52,121
It's the same with Haebangchon.

554
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:49,720
So the theme is a place
where the past and present coexist.

555
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:50,930
What do you think?

556
00:39:51,013 --> 00:39:51,847
It's good.

557
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:58,896
No messing with me today.

558
00:39:58,979 --> 00:40:00,648
I put effort into my makeup today.

559
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:04,527
I wanted to get this off your hat.

560
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:06,362
I wasn't trying anything.

561
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:08,948
I just thought

562
00:40:09,031 --> 00:40:11,033
you were going to cover my face again.

563
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:15,162
-When did I ever do that?
-What?

564
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:17,748
My gosh. The old sayings are all true.

565
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:21,585
The one who did wrong
can't even remember it.

566
00:40:22,169 --> 00:40:24,463
-What?
-You said that I was ugly

567
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:26,841
and that you should only look
at beautiful things.

568
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:28,926
That's why you put my hoodie over my face

569
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:31,637
and pulled my drawstrings.
You did that ten years ago.

570
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:34,140
Hey!

571
00:40:34,223 --> 00:40:35,975
What are you doing?

572
00:40:36,058 --> 00:40:37,643
Stop it.

573
00:40:43,899 --> 00:40:45,192
What was that all about?

574
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:48,487
You look ugly.
I must only look at beautiful things.

575
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:55,161
Hey, that was…

576
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:59,582
You should only look at good things.
I didn't want you to get hurt.

577
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:03,878
You totally misinterpreted my kindness.

578
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:11,051
Why do you have so many
misunderstandings against me?

579
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:19,477
Then you shouldn't have

580
00:41:20,394 --> 00:41:22,021
let me misunderstand you.

581
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:29,820
Nothing over 20,000 won. Let's go.

582
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:35,826
He must not want to buy a toy for him.

583
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:38,996
He could really not have enough money.

584
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:41,999
No way. Every toy here is over 20,000 won.

585
00:41:42,082 --> 00:41:43,459
I'm sure he knows that.

586
00:41:44,418 --> 00:41:46,545
He really might not know
how much they cost

587
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:48,589
if he doesn't buy toys often.

588
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:51,133
Is that so?

589
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:55,221
We can't possibly know everyone's story.

590
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:58,849
Please have a sample.

591
00:42:03,145 --> 00:42:04,438
I'm sorry.

592
00:42:05,898 --> 00:42:07,650
You always eat unhealthy food.

593
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:10,528
Look who's talking.
You're a picky eater, too.

594
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:12,696
I'm a reasonable picky eater.

595
00:42:13,906 --> 00:42:15,366
You think you're always right.

596
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:19,578
If you keep it up, I'll scold you.
I'm serious.

597
00:42:52,486 --> 00:42:53,862
Is this the wrong way?

598
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:01,370
If we circle around again,
it'll be our tenth time.

599
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,123
Already?

600
00:43:07,209 --> 00:43:08,085
What?

601
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:10,004
Isn't that the place?

602
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:14,592
Yes, it is.

603
00:43:15,175 --> 00:43:16,885
It's good news. Why are you mad?

604
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:21,599
I feel cheated. We went around the block
ten times, but it was here.

605
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:29,565
It's your fault for not spotting it.
It's not the cafe's fault.

606
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:31,734
Him and his temper.

607
00:43:45,539 --> 00:43:47,833
EULJIRO

608
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:54,798
"Just like how the feelings
you didn't notice suddenly appear…"

609
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:57,009
EULJIRO WILL APPEAR WHEN YOU ARE LOST

610
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:02,389
EULJIRO WILL APPEAR WHEN YOU ARE LOST

611
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:09,897
How can you not notice your own feelings?

612
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:11,440
Shut it.

613
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:13,400
Give it back.

614
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:14,985
Or what?

615
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,780
Take it.

616
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:22,534
I must use violence when words don't work.

617
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:25,120
Hey.

618
00:44:29,249 --> 00:44:31,210
This used to be a real printing shop.

619
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:33,379
Interesting.

620
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:44,348
By the way, that day…

621
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:47,643
"That day"? When?

622
00:44:48,644 --> 00:44:51,105
If Jin-ju didn't show up,
who were you going to pick?

623
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:56,944
You?

624
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:01,573
Why?

625
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:04,201
I heard you and the CEO are dating.

626
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:08,205
Exactly, my point.
I can't let him see me like that.

627
00:45:08,997 --> 00:45:10,249
You saw me that day, right?

628
00:45:10,332 --> 00:45:12,418
I hid my face because I couldn't wash up.

629
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:15,671
And I was wearing an old hoodie.
I'd never let him see me like that.

630
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:20,259
Was that it?

631
00:45:21,593 --> 00:45:23,011
What else could it be?

632
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:25,514
My gosh. You are…

633
00:45:30,769 --> 00:45:32,229
Why won't you answer me?

634
00:45:32,312 --> 00:45:33,355
Forget it.

635
00:45:35,732 --> 00:45:37,109
What's gotten into him?

636
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:42,865
Wait up.

637
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:47,369
What do you want for dinner?

638
00:45:48,787 --> 00:45:50,122
Pasta?

639
00:45:50,205 --> 00:45:51,206
Yes, ma'am.

640
00:45:56,378 --> 00:45:57,379
Yes?

641
00:45:59,798 --> 00:46:01,091
Yes.

642
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:04,261
Yes, I got it. Okay.

643
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:10,184
What's wrong?

644
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:13,145
I'm sorry. I have to get going now.

645
00:46:13,228 --> 00:46:14,563
What is it?

646
00:46:14,646 --> 00:46:16,899
It's nothing. I'll call you later.

647
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:22,613
If it's nothing, tell me.

648
00:46:24,323 --> 00:46:25,574
Please talk to me.

649
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:30,621
Later.

650
00:46:31,705 --> 00:46:33,165
I'll call you later.

651
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:52,184
Get in. I won't ask any questions.

652
00:46:52,267 --> 00:46:53,727
No need to tell me anything.

653
00:46:53,810 --> 00:46:55,145
I'll go alone today.

654
00:46:59,107 --> 00:47:00,776
I'm sorry. I'll call you later.

655
00:47:09,785 --> 00:47:11,495
How tight-lipped she is.

656
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,665
Write everything down.

657
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:17,125
I want him to be punished. Okay?

658
00:47:24,841 --> 00:47:27,970
-I'm sorry.
-Yeong-hui, I didn't do anything wrong.

659
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:30,055
This was the first time I hit him first.

660
00:47:30,138 --> 00:47:31,765
He bullied me first.

661
00:47:31,848 --> 00:47:35,269
He bullied me since middle school
because I was poor and fatherless.

662
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:37,187
-How come only I--
-Cheol-su, shut it.

663
00:47:40,232 --> 00:47:41,400
I'm so sorry.

664
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:46,572
Do you think he can get away
with your apology?

665
00:47:46,655 --> 00:47:48,323
How will you fix this?

666
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:50,742
Look at my son. What are you going to do?

667
00:48:01,461 --> 00:48:02,796
I'm so sorry.

668
00:48:14,516 --> 00:48:16,518
Bring five million won
if you want to settle.

669
00:48:16,602 --> 00:48:19,229
Without that,
your brother is going to jail.

670
00:48:21,773 --> 00:48:22,899
I'm sorry, Yeong-hui.

671
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:29,072
I want to tell you not to worry
and say something nice to you.

672
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:32,117
I want to buy you a bowl of rice soup
to reassure you it's okay.

673
00:48:34,202 --> 00:48:37,998
But I don't think I can when
I'm about to pay her five million won.

674
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:57,225
Someone once said

675
00:48:58,060 --> 00:48:59,436
in real life, poverty

676
00:49:00,312 --> 00:49:02,439
doesn't mean
small, worn-down houses with bugs

677
00:49:02,522 --> 00:49:04,399
or shabby clothes.

678
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:09,279
It's getting a call in the morning
about your credit card debt,

679
00:49:09,988 --> 00:49:13,158
not being able to go to a dentist
when your teeth ache,

680
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:16,662
feeling guilty for failing
to take care of your loved ones,

681
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:19,581
and feeling pathetic

682
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:23,293
and scared that I have to
ask my friend for money.

683
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:25,712
JIN-JU, CAN I BORROW SOME MONEY?

684
00:49:27,005 --> 00:49:28,924
That's what poverty means.

685
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:32,511
Unless you experience it, you never know.

686
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:37,474
There's no point telling anyone about it.

687
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:10,882
What are you staring at?

688
00:50:12,008 --> 00:50:13,051
Namsan Tower.

689
00:50:14,386 --> 00:50:17,806
Come to think of it,
I've never been to that tower.

690
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:20,600
-Not even once?
-No.

691
00:50:21,727 --> 00:50:24,813
I was saving it for a special day
with someone special.

692
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:26,982
But I never went there.

693
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:29,067
Why not?

694
00:50:29,151 --> 00:50:31,528
No one I met so far was that special.

695
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:40,620
You could go there with the CEO.

696
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:41,997
With the CEO?

697
00:51:06,188 --> 00:51:07,981
Why does he keep going without me?

698
00:52:07,707 --> 00:52:09,292
You walk like a baby giraffe.

699
00:52:35,068 --> 00:52:36,903
Do you know why it's called Haebangchon?

700
00:52:37,487 --> 00:52:38,321
I'm not sure.

701
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:41,157
After Korea was liberated,
people who came back from abroad

702
00:52:41,241 --> 00:52:44,703
and North Koreans who fled from religious
persecution stayed here.

703
00:52:46,538 --> 00:52:48,790
Hence the name.
Haebang, as in "liberation."

704
00:52:50,959 --> 00:52:51,877
Isn't it sad?

705
00:52:53,211 --> 00:52:54,880
Everyone wanted to be liberated,

706
00:52:54,963 --> 00:52:57,465
but it didn't come in a shape
everyone was happy with.

707
00:52:58,466 --> 00:52:59,676
I find that sad.

708
00:53:04,806 --> 00:53:05,891
Right.

709
00:53:06,474 --> 00:53:08,268
God can be mean at times.

710
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:09,936
God is mean by nature.

711
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:11,730
So you should only trust yourself.

712
00:53:11,813 --> 00:53:13,398
Don't lose the talisman.

713
00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:16,651
-The talisman?
-How's the compass I gave you?

714
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:21,364
I threw it away.

715
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:23,992
What?

716
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:26,453
I threw it away.

717
00:53:26,536 --> 00:53:27,787
Why did you throw it away?

718
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:31,082
It'd be ridiculous for me to hold onto it
after what happened that day.

719
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:33,084
I'm not stupid.

720
00:53:35,253 --> 00:53:38,006
Why do you always hold onto bad memories?

721
00:53:38,089 --> 00:53:39,966
Why do you ruin good memories?

722
00:53:44,763 --> 00:53:46,598
Do you think they're beautiful memories?

723
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:50,393
To me, those memories

724
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:54,147
are painful.

725
00:53:58,109 --> 00:53:59,194
I got the wrong idea.

726
00:54:01,613 --> 00:54:02,822
And I got my hopes up.

727
00:54:06,368 --> 00:54:07,953
Then, I got my heart broken.

728
00:54:15,001 --> 00:54:16,711
Am I responsible for your feelings?

729
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:31,893
Right.

730
00:54:33,853 --> 00:54:36,231
I'm a fool
who liked and hated you by myself.

731
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:40,527
I am stupid.

732
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:52,038
I didn't ask you to like me.

733
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:55,166
You're making me feel bad.

734
00:54:57,961 --> 00:55:00,171
HAEBANGCHON

735
00:55:00,255 --> 00:55:04,426
A PLACE WHERE THE PAST
AND THE PRESENT COEXIST

736
00:55:04,509 --> 00:55:06,803
You can't just leave me like that.

737
00:55:06,886 --> 00:55:09,472
Go. I have plans tonight.

738
00:55:09,556 --> 00:55:11,474
You do? With who?

739
00:55:13,226 --> 00:55:14,769
Are you seeing the CEO again?

740
00:55:14,853 --> 00:55:15,937
Why do you care?

741
00:55:23,194 --> 00:55:24,446
Goodbye, then.

742
00:55:29,826 --> 00:55:30,744
We meet again.

743
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:33,204
Right. We're meeting way too often.

744
00:55:33,788 --> 00:55:34,664
Move.

745
00:55:34,748 --> 00:55:36,332
Can you buy me a meal?

746
00:55:37,292 --> 00:55:40,295
I haven't eaten anything
because I was working all day, Mr. On.

747
00:55:41,755 --> 00:55:42,714
What?

748
00:55:43,298 --> 00:55:44,632
Sure.

749
00:55:44,716 --> 00:55:46,509
My gosh. You don't have to.

750
00:55:46,593 --> 00:55:48,386
Aren't you coming? I'll go alone, then.

751
00:56:11,409 --> 00:56:13,244
Don't say anything weird to Mr. On.

752
00:56:13,328 --> 00:56:14,496
That depends on you.

753
00:56:16,289 --> 00:56:17,999
My gosh, that jerk.

754
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:38,186
How long have you been friends?

755
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:42,190
We're not really friends.
We just went to the same high school.

756
00:56:42,273 --> 00:56:44,275
That's it. Nothing more.

757
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:48,279
I doubt that was the whole story.

758
00:56:49,614 --> 00:56:50,782
We were pretty close.

759
00:56:55,745 --> 00:56:57,455
Don't let your imagination run wild.

760
00:56:57,539 --> 00:57:01,543
He went to the States for his studies
when he was 18.

761
00:57:01,626 --> 00:57:05,421
-And we barely saw each other after that.
-But those few meetings were intense.

762
00:57:06,965 --> 00:57:10,552
Woo-yeon and I have
a pretty special relationship.

763
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:16,224
Well,

764
00:57:16,808 --> 00:57:18,893
I don't think it's that special.

765
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:20,603
Really?

766
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:22,939
I liked you.

767
00:57:28,653 --> 00:57:31,030
I liked you as a friend.

768
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:45,211
I hope your special friendship
will continue for a long time.

769
00:57:46,546 --> 00:57:47,672
Let's eat.

770
00:57:56,389 --> 00:57:57,765
Take your time.

771
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:10,987
If you pull this stunt again,
you're done for.

772
00:58:15,241 --> 00:58:16,201
Does everything I do

773
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:19,329
seem like a joke?

774
00:58:19,412 --> 00:58:21,581
-I know it is.
-Says who?

775
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:28,296
Can't you listen to
what I have to say as it is?

776
00:58:30,673 --> 00:58:33,176
No. I can't.

777
00:58:36,638 --> 00:58:38,014
It's a defense mechanism.

778
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:40,475
I don't want a misunderstanding

779
00:58:41,267 --> 00:58:43,019
or get hurt from false hope.

780
00:58:46,856 --> 00:58:48,733
That's why I'm bound
to suspect your intention

781
00:58:49,484 --> 00:58:51,903
and interpret your words differently.

782
00:58:55,406 --> 00:58:57,534
This happens when you're always rejected.

783
00:59:14,175 --> 00:59:16,010
What if I really have feelings for you?

784
00:59:20,848 --> 00:59:22,016
Answer my question.

785
00:59:23,935 --> 00:59:25,270
What if I'm serious?

786
00:59:27,647 --> 00:59:28,731
What will you do?

787
00:59:30,483 --> 00:59:32,986
Objects are closer than they seem
in the mirror.

788
00:59:34,654 --> 00:59:36,698
So we must always prepare ourselves

789
00:59:37,448 --> 00:59:38,908
for unexpected accidents.

790
00:59:41,828 --> 00:59:43,037
Don't toy with me.

791
01:00:48,561 --> 01:00:50,855
How would you feel
if your first love came back?

792
01:00:50,938 --> 01:00:53,191
I'd be tempted.
Your first love is hard to forget.

793
01:00:53,274 --> 01:00:55,026
You're only nice
when something's happened to me.

794
01:00:55,109 --> 01:00:57,862
-What are you talking about?
-You haven't changed at all.

795
01:00:57,945 --> 01:00:59,864
I'm not the impatient type.

796
01:00:59,947 --> 01:01:02,033
But I always get impatient
in front of you.

797
01:01:02,116 --> 01:01:03,785
Let's watch a musical this Saturday.

798
01:01:04,285 --> 01:01:07,038
-Mom, are you crazy?
-He's not just anyone. You'll marry him.

799
01:01:07,121 --> 01:01:09,248
Are you the only one in love?
Don't make me be your burden.

800
01:01:09,332 --> 01:01:11,250
I don't want someone I love to suffer.

801
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:13,461
You can rely on me.

802
01:01:14,462 --> 01:01:17,256
Let's not see each other after work.

803
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:18,841
I don't want to hurt him.

804
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:20,927
Why are you here?

805
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:23,763
You told me
if nothing happens, you'll date him.

806
01:01:23,846 --> 01:01:26,766
Something has happened now.
