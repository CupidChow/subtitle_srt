1
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,651
I like you.

2
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:14,282
I mean, I would like you to like him.

3
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:17,786
I hope it won't end badly this time.
I mean it.

4
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:25,627
I will.

5
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:29,923
I'll get going.

6
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:39,641
Mr. On is outside.

7
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:41,810
Oh, right.

8
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:44,354
You go first.

9
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:46,439
Bye.

10
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:02,705
You always hold me back
just to push me further away.

11
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:50,545
Are you hurt?

12
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:54,257
It's nothing. It's the new shoes…

13
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:57,051
They don't look like shoes
that would hurt your feet.

14
00:02:57,927 --> 00:02:58,970
Right.

15
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:03,474
Did the shoot go well?

16
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:05,685
Yes. We have only one shoot left now.

17
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:08,313
-I hope it ends soon.
-Why?

18
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:10,857
So you can stop calling me Mr. On.

19
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,985
-When will you stop calling me that?
-What should I call you, then?

20
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:16,988
I don't know.
I haven't thought about it yet.

21
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:22,493
You call me Woo-yeon,
so can I call you Jun-su, to be fair?

22
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:24,412
Or "Honey"?

23
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:27,957
Or how about "Sweetie"?

24
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:32,629
You seem to like that a lot.

25
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:35,882
Why do men like being called that so much?

26
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:38,259
It's because
someone I like is calling me that.

27
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:42,639
But you said you didn't like me
calling you Mr. On. That makes no sense.

28
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:45,975
Go in. It's late.

29
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,977
Look at you changing the subject.

30
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:50,855
You should go in.

31
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:52,815
Bye.

32
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:24,138
Mom.

33
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:26,349
Did you put this here?

34
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:28,977
Yes. Can't you keep your room clean?

35
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:32,063
You just leave stuff lying around
and buy them over and over again.

36
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,194
I'm here to give you this.

37
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:42,407
I don't need this.
I lost the other one too.

38
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:43,658
I'll just throw it away.

39
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:45,994
You finally got it back. Don't.

40
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:48,621
Who knows? You might find the other one.

41
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,667
It really came back.

42
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:04,053
All these photos were telling me

43
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,724
that I had countless chances.

44
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,144
And all those chances

45
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,771
have become my regret.

46
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:25,825
PROSECUTOR HAN JIN-JU

47
00:05:32,623 --> 00:05:34,125
I went to see a doctor.

48
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:37,837
Send me the receipt to claim the expense.
Your account number, too.

49
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:48,347
SEND ME THE RECEIPT TO CLAIM THE EXPENSE.
YOUR ACCOUNT NUMBER, TOO.

50
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:50,892
Can you give me the money
in person instead?

51
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:53,061
What is he up to?

52
00:05:57,565 --> 00:05:58,691
Are you a criminal?

53
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,194
Or a credit delinquent?
Don't you have a bank account?

54
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,697
This is my ID card. And my student ID.

55
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,908
And my driver's license.

56
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:11,454
If you can't trust me,
you can check it with the police.

57
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,791
Then why ask to receive it in person?

58
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,167
So I can

59
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:19,045
see you again.

60
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,714
Actually, I wasn't hurt at all.

61
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:24,425
But you told me
to go to the hospital and call you,

62
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:26,552
so I got a checkup.

63
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:30,014
And I thought about
what I should say when we meet

64
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:33,267
to get another chance to see you.

65
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:41,317
For the past month
since the first moment I met you,

66
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:45,404
I only thought about you.

67
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:49,951
Can I stay

68
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:53,746
in touch with you?

69
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,627
An SNU student who's younger than you?

70
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:01,379
Is he cute?

71
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:07,176
-Pass!
-Pass!

72
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:09,470
Why did he pass so easily?

73
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:15,268
That's enough.

74
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:17,520
Isn't he a fraud?

75
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:20,815
Think about it. Why would one
think of this face for a whole month?

76
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:23,151
Is this a face that you would
keep thinking of?

77
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:26,070
Are you sure it's not
a pyramid scheme or a cult?

78
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:27,113
All right.

79
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:28,489
I just find it weird.

80
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:32,285
If he's still a student, he might
feel uncomfortable seeing you.

81
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:35,204
Why? What? I didn't do anything yet.
What's the problem?

82
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:38,124
-You're a prosecutor.
-Do men feel uncomfortable

83
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:40,209
around women who are better off than them?

84
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,752
Do they?

85
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:44,005
It's not about men or women.

86
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:47,967
Everyone would feel small in front
of those who are better than them.

87
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,554
-He's clueless.
-Right.

88
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:53,514
Fine, I am. So what?

89
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,905
-Are you all right?
-Are you okay?

90
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:11,616
Yes, I'm fine.

91
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:15,745
-It was a mistake.
-It wasn't a mistake.

92
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:18,247
I was going to tell you
that this wasn't your seat.

93
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:20,458
What?

94
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:22,126
-Hello, Jun-su.
-Hello.

95
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,628
Hello, Mr. On.

96
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:26,005
Have you been doing well? Are you okay?

97
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:30,218
Why did you do that?
You could've just told me.

98
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:32,637
-Why did you just pull out the chair?
-I'm sorry.

99
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:36,849
You just said you were okay.

100
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:40,061
Why do you always
develop your anger gradually?

101
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:43,231
Hey, just let it go.
You know he's short-tempered.

102
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:44,899
Be quiet.

103
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:47,026
He's scary.

104
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,031
Sit here.

105
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:55,910
What were you talking about?

106
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:58,287
Nothing special. Just this and that.

107
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:02,208
There's an SNU student
who's cute and younger than her.

108
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:03,876
And he says he likes her.

109
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,002
That's nice.

110
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:08,965
-Thank you. Please come again.
-Bye.

111
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:10,424
Bye.

112
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:16,347
Oh, right. Do you remember
our teacher, Mr. Gi-han?

113
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,432
-Our club teacher.
-What about him?

114
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:20,059
I recently met him.

115
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:22,103
His wife is a director of an orphanage.

116
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:24,939
And he's running the orphanage
with her after his retirement.

117
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:28,943
He says they are short of hands,
so I'm going to help out this Saturday.

118
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:32,196
-That's very nice of you.
-I know. So I want you guys to join me.

119
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,574
Do you see this?

120
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:38,369
It is completely dry, tough, and hard.

121
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:39,912
That's how I am.

122
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:43,416
There's no such thing as humanity
in the heart of an office worker.

123
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:46,127
I know what you mean.
You're just like the dried squid.

124
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,837
-Hey, you…
-What?

125
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,798
Why is everyone trying
to throw something at me?

126
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:53,634
Anyway, I'm not going.

127
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:55,720
I already said we're all going.

128
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:56,929
Hey!

129
00:09:58,681 --> 00:09:59,849
Will you join us, Jun-su?

130
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:03,185
Don't bother Jun-su.

131
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:07,023
I'll go too.

132
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:10,401
It's okay. You don't have to go.

133
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:12,194
I'm going because I want to.

134
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,030
I want to see you.

135
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:17,867
That's so sweet.

136
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:21,329
-So we all are going.
-Okay.

137
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:22,580
What time on Saturday?

138
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:25,082
I think we should meet at around 11 a.m.

139
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:43,351
I look handsome every time you
see me, right? Even guys fall for me.

140
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:47,647
I know. I think
we see each other too often.

141
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:52,610
Whenever I meet Woo-yeon,
you just come along.

142
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:53,986
Like an unnecessary freebie.

143
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:57,073
I think you are the unnecessary freebie.

144
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,116
Between Woo-yeon and me.

145
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:04,246
Do you know why there are
labels for every relationship?

146
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:08,709
That's because you're supposed
to stick to your role within that label.

147
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:12,296
Just be her friend. The seat
for her boyfriend is already taken.

148
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,799
-And if I say no?
-If you don't want that,

149
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:16,884
just stay away.

150
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:19,095
If you don't even want to be her friend,

151
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:21,222
then there's nothing you can do.

152
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:24,266
So you should just disappear
from Woo-yeon's life.

153
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:29,105
I guess you're not confident.

154
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:32,608
-Of course I am.
-I don't think so.

155
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:35,945
If you're so confident,
why tell me to disappear?

156
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:39,615
Because you're being so brazen.

157
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:43,119
-What?
-You rejected her for ten years.

158
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:46,080
And now you hover around her
saying you have feelings for her.

159
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:47,832
That seems pretty shameless.

160
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:51,377
I had no right to meddle in it until now,
but now I do.

161
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:53,587
I won't put up with this anymore.

162
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:05,933
-Woo-yeon is a heavy drinker.
-No, Woo-yeon can't hold her liquor well.

163
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:07,935
-I know.
-What do you know?

164
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,312
Oh, right.

165
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:12,940
I should give it back to you.

166
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,943
The thing you took off in my car.

167
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:25,244
What are you talking about now?

168
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:26,328
What did I take off?

169
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:31,041
It's not like that.

170
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,628
I mean your shoes.
The shoes you got from Mr. On.

171
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:49,518
Mr. On, there's a misunderstanding.

172
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,353
I didn't misunderstand anything.

173
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:59,945
-My glass is empty now.
-May I?

174
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:00,905
Thank you.

175
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:03,782
Gosh.

176
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:07,077
Did you really have to
talk about the shoes?

177
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:09,121
And with those words?

178
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:11,832
You can dump me
or humiliate me in front of others.

179
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:12,958
It's fine.

180
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:14,752
But why would you make a fool of him?

181
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:16,295
How dare you hurt his feelings?

182
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:18,088
Is he that great?

183
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:21,300
Is he even more important than you?

184
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:25,429
Yes. He's really precious to me.

185
00:13:27,806 --> 00:13:30,059
-You're really easy.
-What? Easy?

186
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:33,812
How could you find something
more precious than yourself so quickly?

187
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:37,358
Fine. I'm easy.

188
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:39,485
I'm an easy person.

189
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:43,113
That's why I got hung up
on you for ten years.

190
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:44,865
Did you really have to rub that in?

191
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:47,368
-I didn't say that.
-You asked if you were mean.

192
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:51,956
Yes, you are. You're really mean.

193
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:54,250
You just ignore how others feel.

194
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,418
You're a selfish and inconsiderate jerk.

195
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:02,883
That's why you're always

196
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:06,845
so lonely like that.

197
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:34,123
Are you upset?

198
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:38,252
We had to walk for long for the shoot,
and I got blisters on my heels…

199
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,795
You don't have to explain.

200
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:42,172
You didn't do it on purpose.

201
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:47,970
I don't want to do anything
to feel sorry for.

202
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:50,931
But I keep apologizing.

203
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:53,726
Everything is fine.

204
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:55,352
Because it's you.

205
00:14:58,981 --> 00:14:59,940
Thank you.

206
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:09,325
No, it's not on the main street.
There's a small alley next to it.

207
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,869
-Stay there. I'll go there.
-Bye.

208
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:20,461
-Go.
-Stop acting pitiful and go.

209
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:22,755
Go home and sleep.

210
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,382
And stop bothering Woo-yeon from now on.

211
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,887
It was 10 out of 28 years.

212
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:33,766
Woo-yeon spent more than
a third of her life liking you.

213
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:36,936
And when she gave up on you,

214
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:40,064
she must've been
really determined to do so.

215
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:42,900
Don't ignore those feelings too.

216
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:01,961
TONIGHT

217
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:16,600
CHOI WON-JEONG'S SOLO EXHIBITION

218
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:21,772
Instead of using primary colors,
I tried to add a sense of dimension.

219
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:24,900
-With one color?
-Yes.

220
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:27,486
Can you see what I tried to do?

221
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,781
-It feels quite new.
-It's totally different.

222
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:33,742
-It's impressive.
-It has more depth.

223
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:35,744
Son.

224
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,543
What happened to your hand?
Did you get hurt?

225
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:46,880
-Yes.
-You should've been careful.

226
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:51,802
Is everything all right?

227
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:54,722
Yes.

228
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:57,850
Are you seeing anyone?

229
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:00,728
No one?

230
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:04,106
-No.
-Why not?

231
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:06,191
Isn't there anyone you like?

232
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:17,369
There is.

233
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:23,375
Mom, are you just friends with Dad?

234
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:28,839
You said you two were very much in love.

235
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:31,091
Dad

236
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:33,761
still loves you.

237
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:41,268
Son, do you know what the most
valuable thing is

238
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:43,020
in a long relationship?

239
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:47,941
It's the memories.

240
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:53,030
Your dad and I share
a lot of good memories,

241
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,908
but we have more painful memories.

242
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:59,328
And I don't think

243
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:02,456
I can get over those memories.

244
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:47,376
What a coincidence to see you here.

245
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:50,712
I know.

246
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:53,090
How did that happen?

247
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,676
Well…

248
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:00,848
-About that day…
-You're sorry?

249
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:04,434
-I mean…
-For saying such harsh things?

250
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:09,982
I wonder how you can
understand my words so quickly.

251
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:12,526
It's because my ears are pretty.

252
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:20,742
For the last shoot, I want deserted places
that are loved the way they are.

253
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:25,164
Like a railroad with no trains
or a theme park that stopped operating.

254
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:28,041
Places where time is standing still.

255
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:32,880
I don't know. I guess that's how
those who abandoned them feel.

256
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:35,716
From their point of view,
they were just abandoned.

257
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:41,305
But they did it for a reason.
The places were of no use.

258
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:44,474
Things always get abandoned for a reason.

259
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:48,937
They are useless, tedious, or hurtful.

260
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:53,192
Glorifying abandonment
in the name of memories is

261
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:55,819
a privilege that only those
who abandon them have.

262
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:59,406
And those who were abandoned
just feel hurt the whole time.

263
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,540
Do you think they're beautiful memories?

264
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,043
To me, those memories

265
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,421
are painful.

266
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:23,680
What?

267
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:25,390
I'm sorry.

268
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:30,479
-For what?
-For being so mean to you.

269
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:34,316
For all the things I've done wrong to you.

270
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:40,781
All of a sudden?
Are you finally growing up?

271
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:45,160
I guess so.

272
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:50,499
I should have matured sooner
if it was this simple.

273
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:56,380
They say maturing suddenly
means you will die soon.

274
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:58,340
But I'm not worried about you.

275
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:02,261
You must've been cursed
by loads of people,

276
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:04,221
so I'm sure you will live a long life.

277
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:20,112
Don't fall down ever again.

278
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:36,545
PROSECUTOR HAN JIN-JU

279
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:51,643
Will you go to the movies with me today?

280
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:56,023
What's wrong?

281
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:58,442
He wants to go to the movies.

282
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:00,736
What?

283
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:03,572
He asked me out for a movie.

284
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:07,492
What movie are you watching?
What's so surprising?

285
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:18,587
Hello?

286
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:23,675
Yes. I was going to send you a draft.

287
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:26,553
No, that's not necessary.

288
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:28,221
Pardon?

289
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,935
I want to know why.

290
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:36,730
Why am I suddenly losing the opportunity?

291
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:41,651
The new calligrapher we're working with
is Ms. Han Jin-seo.

292
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:46,823
She's famous.

293
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:49,117
I guess that answers your question.

294
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:51,244
About why you lost your opportunity.

295
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:55,665
She's more experienced
and well-acquainted with the director.

296
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:58,126
We had no reason to stick with you.

297
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:02,005
There will be another chance.

298
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:04,466
Personal connections make your career,

299
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:07,177
and your career makes you famous.

300
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,930
And that builds more personal connections.

301
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:12,891
I guess that's how the world works.

302
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:15,143
A rookie like me

303
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:18,188
can't get a chance in such a cycle.

304
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:21,691
But you're still young.
Don't be too impatient.

305
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:23,443
It's not about getting older.

306
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:27,781
It's hope that makes you move forward.
And stopping leads to despair.

307
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:31,201
I believe that impatient hope is
better than peaceful despair.

308
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:33,995
That's why I can't stop

309
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:35,622
being impatient.

310
00:24:19,374 --> 00:24:20,876
Cry. I won't look.

311
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:22,460
I'm not crying.

312
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:25,422
I'm not a kid.

313
00:24:28,216 --> 00:24:29,217
Good.

314
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:33,722
See? This is how I live.

315
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:36,474
You can laugh at me if you want.

316
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:37,517
Why would I?

317
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:41,021
Do you think I'm that evil?

318
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:55,243
Here.

319
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:56,369
What's that for?

320
00:24:57,287 --> 00:24:58,705
Do you really think I'm a kid?

321
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:05,629
You need something sweet
after eating something bitter.

322
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:14,930
Come and get your shoes later.

323
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:17,390
Okay.

324
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:19,726
Come in the evening
and have dinner with me.

325
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:28,276
Any ideas for Writer Lee Do-gyeong's
new book event?

326
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,695
Sharing photos of your room or house

327
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:33,114
is a popular trend
on social media these days.

328
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:36,660
So we can have people share pictures
of their studies or bookshelves

329
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:38,203
and select winners…

330
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:41,373
Just be her friend. The seat
for her boyfriend is already taken.

331
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:45,961
I guess you're not confident.

332
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:48,546
I think it'll help promote the new book.

333
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:51,716
Okay. That doesn't sound bad.
What do you think, Mr. On?

334
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:59,557
Mr. On, what do you think
of the new book event idea?

335
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:03,645
Sharing bookshelves. That sounds good.

336
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:05,438
Let's go with that.

337
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:18,410
He's handsome.

338
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:32,716
Have you waited for long?

339
00:26:33,591 --> 00:26:34,884
No.

340
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:38,096
Actually, I did wait for a bit.

341
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:40,640
I was really thrilled, so I came early.

342
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:42,475
Thrilled?

343
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:47,480
I wore contacts for the first time.
And I bought new clothes.

344
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:50,317
Because this is our first date.

345
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:53,111
Date?

346
00:26:58,491 --> 00:26:59,534
Let's go, Jin-ju.

347
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:02,746
"Jin-ju?"

348
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:23,266
Are candles too much?

349
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:42,452
-Eat before you go.
-It's okay.

350
00:27:42,535 --> 00:27:44,329
I'm not giving you a choice.

351
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:48,333
I didn't ask. I said, "Eat before you go."

352
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:49,959
You always get your way.

353
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:53,713
I'm trying to hold on to you so you won't
fall to the tenth basement floor.

354
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:58,968
-What will you cook?
-Seafood noodles.

355
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:03,515
-Add a lot of seafood.
-What about noodles? Chewy?

356
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:06,351
-With a lot of spicy chilies.
-Have a seat.

357
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:13,817
Hello?

358
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:20,949
Okay.

359
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:24,285
I have to go down.

360
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:27,705
-Someone scratched my car.
-Okay.

361
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:45,306
It's well past six o'clock.
Now I'm your friend, not your employee.

362
00:28:47,016 --> 00:28:48,476
I didn't say anything.

363
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,229
Tell me. Something's going on, right?

364
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:52,814
Don't try to hide it.

365
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:55,567
You've finally started
dating the woman you wanted.

366
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:57,402
And your business is going well.

367
00:28:57,902 --> 00:28:59,946
You should be in seventh heaven now,

368
00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:01,865
but why do you seem so lost?

369
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:04,617
Do I?

370
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:06,453
Yes, you do.

371
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:09,622
You've been like that
the whole time, so tell me.

372
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:15,712
It's natural to feel nervous when
you're holding something precious, right?

373
00:29:17,046 --> 00:29:18,173
Sure.

374
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:20,341
All right.

375
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:23,261
But you can't be happy
if you keep feeling that way.

376
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:28,057
If you're too nervous, just let it go.
It doesn't belong to you.

377
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:30,685
I'd rather feel nervous.

378
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,146
Gosh, you stubborn fool.

379
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:47,410
Why isn't he coming?

380
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:56,669
Gosh, I can't wait any longer.

381
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:06,429
Is this the restroom?

382
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:35,166
So if I take a photo of someone,

383
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:37,460
it means I like her

384
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:40,421
a lot.

385
00:30:58,189 --> 00:31:01,860
JUN-SU

386
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:47,572
Oh, dear.

387
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:02,211
Where are the bandages?

388
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:18,436
I'm home.

389
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:35,495
Why did you go through my room?

390
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:37,246
Does that even matter?

391
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:39,248
Yes, that's what matters to me.

392
00:32:39,874 --> 00:32:41,501
I know you gave birth to me,

393
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:44,003
but I'm an individual human being.
I have my privacy.

394
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:47,465
Is that the kind of privacy
you wanted to protect?

395
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:49,968
You're not even married yet!

396
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:54,055
Mom. I'm 29.

397
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:56,557
And I have a boyfriend
I've been dating for ten years.

398
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:58,476
-You're being ridiculous.
-Ridiculous?

399
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:01,521
You're not like others.

400
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:06,317
I've tried so hard to make sure
you're not called a fatherless child.

401
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:08,987
What if you get pregnant?

402
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:11,531
What would Hyeon-jae's family
think of you?

403
00:33:11,614 --> 00:33:14,367
Will you stop making a fuss
about being a fatherless child?

404
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:17,036
Is it my fault that I don't have a dad?
Did I kill my dad?

405
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,581
Why do I have to feel small
for something I didn't even do?

406
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:26,254
Mom, I just want to live normally
like others do.

407
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:31,592
If you wanted to meddle in my life,
you should've been more responsible.

408
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:05,460
Why did you get caught?

409
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:07,795
You should've hidden it.

410
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:09,714
I mean, you should've swallowed it.

411
00:34:09,797 --> 00:34:12,008
How would I swallow 100 condoms?

412
00:34:13,926 --> 00:34:16,304
Wow, that's a huge number.

413
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:21,059
Do I really have to fight with my mom
over some condoms at this age?

414
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:25,063
Parents think
their children are still babies.

415
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:29,650
My dad always tells me to chew well.

416
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:32,612
And when I went to my grandma's
on New Year's Day,

417
00:34:32,695 --> 00:34:34,197
I saw Grandma say

418
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:36,449
the same thing to Dad.

419
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:38,993
I guess it's just like that.

420
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:41,537
It's like a baby filter in a camera app.

421
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:43,331
Parents always have

422
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:46,042
the baby filter installed in their eyes
for their children.

423
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:49,754
I wish that was the case.

424
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:59,472
What about you?
Why are you acting pitiful all alone?

425
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:01,390
What?

426
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:14,946
Su once

427
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:17,990
told me this.

428
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:21,244
So if I take a photo of someone,

429
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:26,165
it means I like her

430
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:30,294
a lot.

431
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:33,005
So why does he have my pictures there?

432
00:35:34,757 --> 00:35:35,883
In his darkroom.

433
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:49,105
-Woo-yeon.
-Yes?

434
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:51,566
On your birthday,

435
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:54,986
Su went to see you.

436
00:35:58,364 --> 00:35:59,657
He had an accident.

437
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:02,535
He passed out for about an hour.

438
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:16,007
Why are you telling me that?

439
00:36:18,384 --> 00:36:20,303
There's nothing I can do about it now.

440
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:24,390
It's not about Su.

441
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:28,311
It's about Mr. On and you.

442
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,441
You know, right?

443
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:38,529
If you really like him, you won't
be swayed no matter what happens.

444
00:36:50,082 --> 00:36:52,543
The number you have dialed cannot be…

445
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:08,434
LEE SU

446
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:23,241
Why did you come back?

447
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:25,910
Who said you could?

448
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:36,462
-Hello.
-Hello.

449
00:37:36,545 --> 00:37:38,256
Hi. Have you been doing well?

450
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:39,715
-Yes.
-Of course.

451
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:42,301
You should dye your hair.
You've got a lot of gray hair.

452
00:37:43,135 --> 00:37:44,637
I know.

453
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,264
Have you been well?

454
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:49,100
Yes. You guys should get married soon.

455
00:37:49,183 --> 00:37:51,936
-What? Well…
-I think it's too soon to get married.

456
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:53,604
We want to date a little longer.

457
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:56,816
It's not good to date
for too long, though.

458
00:37:56,899 --> 00:37:59,277
What's with you?
You always talked about marriage.

459
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,028
He's changed.

460
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:03,239
-Hyeon-jae has changed, right?
-He's changed.

461
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:05,783
If we get married,
Yeong-hui will have a hard time.

462
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:07,493
I have three older sisters.

463
00:38:07,576 --> 00:38:09,745
Oh, I keep forgetting

464
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:12,415
that marriage involves
the spouse's family as well.

465
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:28,556
We meet again, Mr. Lee.

466
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:35,438
Will you say hi to me?

467
00:38:37,898 --> 00:38:39,025
Oh, hi.

468
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:47,491
-Well…
-Sir.

469
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:50,411
-Hello.
-Hello, Jun-su.

470
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:51,412
Hello.

471
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:53,205
Have you been doing well, sir?

472
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:54,790
I've been well.

473
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:02,381
It's nothing much.

474
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:05,176
They're just school supplies.

475
00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:10,389
You didn't have to prepare all these.

476
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:13,100
Su, you look pretty cool now.

477
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:16,228
Su, you look pretty cool.

478
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:17,938
That's right. It's all about money.

479
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:20,524
You can't be cool without spending money.

480
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:23,819
-You bought a lot of good stuff.
-Right. Kids will love them.

481
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:35,081
Hello.

482
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:36,791
-Hello.
-Hello.

483
00:39:39,668 --> 00:39:42,296
METAPHOR PUBLISHING HOUSE

484
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,298
What's all this?

485
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:45,633
Mr. On is donating two sets

486
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:49,428
of world literature series, three sets
of children's literature series,

487
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:52,723
and another 100 must-read books
for teenagers.

488
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:56,936
That's awesome.

489
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,606
They are mostly refurbished books,
so please don't feel overwhelmed.

490
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:04,693
You're Woo-yeon's teacher,
so I wanted to do something to help.

491
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:08,239
He's my boyfriend.

492
00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:11,575
I see. Nice to meet you.

493
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:14,578
Gosh, it will take forever
to organize them.

494
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:20,876
We'll organize them too,
so you don't have to worry.

495
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:25,965
-Shall we move them?
-Okay.

496
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,802
-More.
-What?

497
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:34,557
-Give me more books.
-You don't have to overdo it.

498
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:39,854
Give me more books.
These are too light for me.

499
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:41,480
I think this is heavy.

500
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:43,232
-More books.
-What?

501
00:40:45,192 --> 00:40:47,069
-More.
-You want more?

502
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:50,865
-One more.
-Are you sure?

503
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:54,869
You should carry a little.

504
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:57,538
-Your back is precious.
-I know.

505
00:40:58,414 --> 00:41:01,542
-They don't seem to know what's important.
-Right.

506
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:05,421
-More.
-I think that's too much.

507
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:10,176
-Why don't you stop?
-Why? Is it too heavy?

508
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:13,679
This is really light.

509
00:41:17,933 --> 00:41:20,186
-Are you okay?
-Oh, dear.

510
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:22,938
Gosh. I knew you were straining yourself.
This is heavy.

511
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:24,356
Are you okay?

512
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:49,089
You can't just send books like this.
Organizing them is a lot of work.

513
00:41:51,425 --> 00:41:53,928
Doing this with you wasn't my plan.

514
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:57,139
Were you going to do this
with Woo-yeon then?

515
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:59,225
Do you want her
to breathe in all the dust?

516
00:41:59,808 --> 00:42:01,185
You're so inconsiderate.

517
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,939
You keep talking casually to me.

518
00:42:05,898 --> 00:42:07,483
You're the one who did it first.

519
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:12,029
I took the college entrance exam
when you were a little kid.

520
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:15,366
All right.

521
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:18,077
I'll be sure to use honorifics, Grandpa.

522
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:22,706
"Grandpa"?

523
00:42:32,591 --> 00:42:34,593
Did something happen between them?

524
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:39,056
Actually, I was going to ask you that.

525
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:41,642
What's wrong with them?

526
00:42:57,157 --> 00:42:59,410
-Are you staying in touch with that guy?
-Yes.

527
00:43:00,536 --> 00:43:02,079
You look so happy.

528
00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:05,249
I'm really excited these days.

529
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:10,170
I love how I get his message
when I wake up in the morning.

530
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:12,590
And I like it when he asks me
about what I did,

531
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:14,550
what I'll eat, or what I'll do.

532
00:43:14,633 --> 00:43:17,678
What's the big deal? It's nothing special.

533
00:43:19,888 --> 00:43:22,308
This is my first time
getting liked by someone.

534
00:43:26,812 --> 00:43:29,315
Make sure to wipe it clean. Be thorough.

535
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:31,650
All right.

536
00:43:39,658 --> 00:43:41,035
Why did you lie earlier?

537
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:42,494
I didn't lie.

538
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:44,288
You said you wanted to date more.

539
00:43:44,913 --> 00:43:46,415
And it's too soon to get married.

540
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:51,670
I've given it some thought.

541
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:55,132
I thought my dream was
to become your husband.

542
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:58,218
-And?
-But

543
00:43:59,428 --> 00:44:01,138
my dream is just you.

544
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:05,142
I want you to feel full, to smile,

545
00:44:05,225 --> 00:44:06,518
and to be happy.

546
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:09,104
Everything that involves you.

547
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:13,192
What a humble dream.

548
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:17,321
Then I'll just live as a man
with a humble dream.

549
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:42,054
Woo-yeon.

550
00:44:42,846 --> 00:44:46,141
Yeong-hui, do you need any help?

551
00:44:46,725 --> 00:44:49,269
-Woo-yeon, can you put this over there?
-Okay.

552
00:44:58,987 --> 00:45:01,031
Here. Eat up.

553
00:45:10,165 --> 00:45:12,501
You can eat it like this. Eat up.

554
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:19,883
Do you want more? No?

555
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:21,927
Do you not like it?

556
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:25,514
Enjoy.

557
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:42,531
Now you're running away into your dream.

558
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:08,182
I told you not to cross the line.

559
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:10,809
I know I have pretty hands,

560
00:46:10,893 --> 00:46:13,479
but you shouldn't
just grab them like that.

561
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:15,981
Don't change the subject with some jokes.

562
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:23,322
What are you doing?

563
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:26,783
Woo-yeon.

564
00:46:29,745 --> 00:46:31,705
Now that you're up, we need to talk.

565
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:34,166
You can talk here.

566
00:46:36,418 --> 00:46:39,213
-I have nothing to say.
-Then just listen to me.

567
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:42,132
-I don't want to hear it.
-But you have to.

568
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:44,551
Just this once.

569
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:48,514
Are you always this rude?

570
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:53,769
She said no. You can't treat her like that
even if she's your friend.

571
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,235
Woo-yeon.

572
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:05,906
What? Jin-ju, do you need me?

573
00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:07,658
No, I got this.

574
00:47:07,741 --> 00:47:09,493
Okay. I'm coming.

575
00:47:14,748 --> 00:47:16,208
I told you not to grab my hand.

576
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:19,253
And I told you not to cross the line.

577
00:47:37,896 --> 00:47:38,981
Su.

578
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:54,204
Woo-yeon waited for you that day.

579
00:47:55,497 --> 00:47:56,832
She waited.

580
00:47:57,708 --> 00:48:01,003
She waited for a long time
before she left.

581
00:48:07,342 --> 00:48:09,052
Did Su and Mr. On fight?

582
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:13,056
-Of course not.
-Right.

583
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:16,393
Why would they fight?
It's not like Su likes you.

584
00:48:16,476 --> 00:48:18,604
-What?
-But why do sparks fly

585
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:21,064
between them every time they meet?

586
00:48:21,648 --> 00:48:22,899
What's with that tension?

587
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:27,571
There weren't any sparks.
I'm sure you were mistaken.

588
00:48:27,654 --> 00:48:28,655
No way.

589
00:48:29,781 --> 00:48:31,783
Woo-yeon, I need to go to the restroom.

590
00:48:35,203 --> 00:48:36,788
She's so sensitive.

591
00:48:37,664 --> 00:48:39,416
She's got a good hunch.

592
00:48:45,797 --> 00:48:47,591
-Honey.
-What did you do wrong?

593
00:48:48,717 --> 00:48:49,801
What?

594
00:48:51,303 --> 00:48:53,680
Well, I didn't do anything wrong.

595
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:55,807
-Here's what I think.
-Okay.

596
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:58,727
A misunderstanding can cause
a bigger misunderstanding.

597
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:00,687
You told Su, didn't you?

598
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:01,647
How did you know?

599
00:49:03,523 --> 00:49:05,817
Why did you tell him? There's no point.

600
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:11,031
Woo-yeon knows
that Su went there that day.

601
00:49:11,114 --> 00:49:14,660
But she said she'd pretend not to know
about it. It's over for her.

602
00:49:19,915 --> 00:49:22,668
-Then how did Woo-yeon find out?
-I told her.

603
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:44,356
You saw the pictures, right?

604
00:49:45,774 --> 00:49:48,110
That day, you waited for me, right?

605
00:49:49,528 --> 00:49:52,614
I went there too.
I got into an accident there.

606
00:49:54,157 --> 00:49:56,743
I didn't want to worry you,
so I just said it was nothing.

607
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:57,911
Su.

608
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:00,831
It won't change anything.

609
00:50:00,914 --> 00:50:03,959
Of course it will. You came,
and I went there too.

610
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:08,171
We only ended up like this
because of bad timing.

611
00:50:10,716 --> 00:50:12,551
Do you think this is about the timing?

612
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:17,055
You had thousands
of chances during the past ten years.

613
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:20,350
And you missed all your chances.

614
00:50:22,978 --> 00:50:25,856
People always feel regret about
the last chance they missed.

615
00:50:49,796 --> 00:50:50,881
Go somewhere.

616
00:50:50,964 --> 00:50:54,426
Just like you always did,
go somewhere else. Please.

617
00:50:56,553 --> 00:50:59,306
Get lost for good
so you won't confuse me anymore.

618
00:51:01,016 --> 00:51:03,769
-Are you even confused?
-Do you think I'm just confused?

619
00:51:03,852 --> 00:51:07,022
I'm a mess and a wreck because of you.
It really pisses me off.

620
00:51:08,023 --> 00:51:10,776
So you like me? Now?
After all these years?

621
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:13,487
That's not love. You're mistaken.

622
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:16,239
You don't want me, but you don't
want me to date anyone.

623
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:20,327
You thought I'd be hung up on you for
good, but I'm not. So you're just jealous.

624
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:21,620
Don't talk like that.

625
00:51:22,204 --> 00:51:23,872
Then what am I supposed to say?

626
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:30,837
That's the only way
I can interpret your actions.

627
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:33,340
It's been ten years,
but why does it have to be now?

628
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:37,385
When I just started dating Jun-su?

629
00:51:37,469 --> 00:51:40,722
This is about you and me.
Stop bringing him into this.

630
00:51:40,806 --> 00:51:43,433
You're the one who should stay
out of my relationship.

631
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:49,731
To me, "we" mean Jun-su and me, not you.

632
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:53,401
So…

633
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:58,573
let's just end things here.

634
00:52:03,662 --> 00:52:05,121
I'm so exhausted.

635
00:53:11,062 --> 00:53:12,981
Why aren't you eating? Do you not like it?

636
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:16,568
No. I love it.

637
00:53:27,203 --> 00:53:30,248
Oh, you can't eat chicken feet.
Why didn't you tell me?

638
00:53:30,332 --> 00:53:31,625
I just found out today.

639
00:53:33,084 --> 00:53:35,211
This is actually my first time trying it.

640
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:40,884
Now I know that I can't eat chicken feet.

641
00:53:42,218 --> 00:53:43,595
You sound so nonchalant.

642
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:47,140
I'll get used to it eventually.

643
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:50,644
What else do you like?
I should practice in advance.

644
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:53,104
Why? Just don't eat it
if you don't like it.

645
00:53:54,522 --> 00:53:56,358
I want to like what you like.

646
00:53:57,317 --> 00:53:58,985
I should like the same things.

647
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:05,575
Just be touched. Don't feel sorry.

648
00:54:11,873 --> 00:54:13,124
Steamed eggs, please.

649
00:55:07,345 --> 00:55:09,639
Let's finish up the photo shoot.

650
00:55:11,224 --> 00:55:13,601
What? Is something wrong?

651
00:55:14,436 --> 00:55:15,478
No.

652
00:55:18,064 --> 00:55:20,984
The shoot will be over soon.

653
00:55:22,068 --> 00:55:22,902
What a relief.

654
00:55:24,529 --> 00:55:26,948
-What do you mean?
-I mean,

655
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:30,493
it seems the shoot will end smoothly.

656
00:55:33,913 --> 00:55:34,998
I see.

657
00:55:48,553 --> 00:55:49,637
Okay.

658
00:56:08,823 --> 00:56:10,325
Is it raining today?

659
00:56:10,408 --> 00:56:12,452
That's what I heard, but I'm not sure.

660
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:15,789
If it rains during the shoot,

661
00:56:15,872 --> 00:56:17,665
-we can just--
-Let's finish it today.

662
00:56:21,961 --> 00:56:24,089
Okay. Let's do that.

663
00:57:22,522 --> 00:57:24,357
-This is really nice, isn't it?
-Yes.

664
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:27,402
Why did they shut this down?

665
00:57:27,902 --> 00:57:29,779
-Let's go check the merry-go-round.
-Okay.

666
00:57:38,955 --> 00:57:40,498
People are mean.

667
00:57:41,749 --> 00:57:43,710
They abandoned it, saying it was useless.

668
00:57:45,336 --> 00:57:46,546
But they came back for it.

669
00:57:48,423 --> 00:57:49,549
After all this time.

670
00:57:53,386 --> 00:57:55,346
I guess I'm always making mistakes.

671
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:59,184
It won't happen again.

672
00:58:00,101 --> 00:58:01,978
I'll stay out of your way for good.

673
00:58:06,524 --> 00:58:07,734
Are you really leaving?

674
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:19,245
Where are you going?

675
00:58:20,038 --> 00:58:21,080
Anywhere.

676
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:23,374
When?

677
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:25,210
Anytime. Soon.

678
00:58:26,294 --> 00:58:29,589
So just pretend that you're hanging out
with me for the last time

679
00:58:29,672 --> 00:58:30,840
and smile.

680
00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:32,967
Hanging out?

681
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:35,178
We're here to work.

682
00:58:41,017 --> 00:58:42,894
Su is leaving again.

683
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:46,439
He's left like that so many times before.

684
00:58:47,482 --> 00:58:49,400
It seemed like he had feelings
for someone.

685
00:58:49,984 --> 00:58:51,236
Didn't it work out well?

686
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:54,197
Does he like someone?

687
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:55,990
He wouldn't tell me, but I think so.

688
00:58:58,409 --> 00:59:00,954
He runs away when things get tough
just like you do.

689
00:59:04,874 --> 00:59:06,584
You're the one who ran away.

690
00:59:07,794 --> 00:59:10,713
You threw divorce papers at me
and spent years in the States.

691
00:59:10,797 --> 00:59:13,675
I didn't run away. I just left.

692
00:59:14,884 --> 00:59:17,178
-What's the difference?
-It's different.

693
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:20,139
I left because you kept running away.

694
00:59:21,641 --> 00:59:24,811
Every time I tried to talk to you,
you just worked overtime.

695
00:59:24,894 --> 00:59:26,479
You ran away to work.

696
00:59:29,315 --> 00:59:30,149
That's just…

697
00:59:32,485 --> 00:59:35,613
Running away isn't always about
going somewhere far away.

698
00:59:59,887 --> 01:00:02,390
Maybe it could start over
because it was abandoned.

699
01:00:05,351 --> 01:00:07,604
If it weren't abandoned,
it wouldn't have changed.

700
01:00:10,106 --> 01:00:12,692
If the deserted railroad
were still used by trains,

701
01:00:13,401 --> 01:00:15,528
and if this theme park weren't closed,

702
01:00:16,529 --> 01:00:20,325
they would've been
an ordinary railroad and theme park.

703
01:00:27,874 --> 01:00:30,585
But now they might believe
that they can start over.

704
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:35,340
They might look at it like this.

705
01:00:52,482 --> 01:00:54,192
-One, two, three.
-Three.

706
01:01:04,577 --> 01:01:11,167
THEY MIGHT BELIEVE THEY CAN START OVER

707
01:01:12,126 --> 01:01:13,586
What time are we going to meet?

708
01:01:14,087 --> 01:01:15,546
The shoot isn't over yet.

709
01:01:16,297 --> 01:01:18,007
I'll call you when we're done.

710
01:01:19,592 --> 01:01:20,718
I'll wait.

711
01:01:29,602 --> 01:01:32,146
I've never seen a merry-go-round
that's not moving.

712
01:01:52,291 --> 01:01:54,377
Why are you being careless?
I can't let you go.

713
01:01:55,211 --> 01:01:58,131
-I didn't ask you to hold me.
-I know.

714
01:01:58,214 --> 01:02:01,175
That's all I've been waiting for,
but you never did it.

715
01:02:05,763 --> 01:02:09,434
You already found out, so I don't
want to hide the fact that I like you.

716
01:02:11,144 --> 01:02:12,645
I told you, you don't like me.

717
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:15,231
I do. Why is it so hard to believe?

718
01:02:15,314 --> 01:02:17,066
I can't believe it because it's you.

719
01:02:17,692 --> 01:02:18,818
I've been fooled before.

720
01:02:18,901 --> 01:02:20,945
Hey. You're hurting me again.

721
01:02:22,864 --> 01:02:25,950
Before you break my heart again,
I'll just go take more pictures.

722
01:02:35,626 --> 01:02:36,711
Excuse me.

723
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:39,380
You dropped this.

724
01:02:40,631 --> 01:02:41,758
That's not mine.

725
01:02:41,841 --> 01:02:45,052
I guess it belongs to your boyfriend.

726
01:02:45,595 --> 01:02:46,888
Here.

727
01:02:54,270 --> 01:02:55,229
Bye, then.

728
01:02:56,397 --> 01:02:57,690
Excuse me.

729
01:03:04,405 --> 01:03:06,240
I'm sorry to ask you this,

730
01:03:06,324 --> 01:03:08,576
but can you give this
to him yourself later?

731
01:03:09,410 --> 01:03:11,829
-Don't tell him about me.
-I see.

732
01:03:12,830 --> 01:03:13,956
Please.

733
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:15,291
Okay.

734
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:28,262
It didn't rain today.

735
01:03:29,555 --> 01:03:31,682
So the shoot ended well.

736
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:33,392
I know.

737
01:03:34,393 --> 01:03:35,478
Excuse me.

738
01:03:36,687 --> 01:03:39,190
Here. You dropped this, right?

739
01:03:39,273 --> 01:03:40,775
Yes. Thank you.

740
01:03:48,407 --> 01:03:49,700
Aren't you coming?

741
01:03:51,619 --> 01:03:54,372
I think I lost something. Wait in the car.

742
01:03:54,455 --> 01:03:56,791
-If it's not important--
-It's important.

743
01:03:56,874 --> 01:03:58,543
It won't take long. Wait a moment.

744
01:04:05,508 --> 01:04:07,093
Why is he being like this?

745
01:05:03,441 --> 01:05:05,192
It's raining. Why isn't he coming?

746
01:05:24,712 --> 01:05:25,880
Are you looking for this?

747
01:05:40,353 --> 01:05:42,980
What are you playing at?

748
01:05:43,064 --> 01:05:44,607
Give me that. It's mine.

749
01:05:44,690 --> 01:05:46,776
-It's a photo of me.
-I took it.

750
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:51,072
-Are you kidding me?
-Do you think this is a joke?

751
01:05:51,155 --> 01:05:53,032
I wish it was a joke.

752
01:05:58,329 --> 01:06:01,207
Why did you lie to me
if you were going to be so pathetic?

753
01:06:01,290 --> 01:06:04,877
You should've told me that
you couldn't come because you got hurt.

754
01:06:15,054 --> 01:06:17,306
Now that you act like you're serious,

755
01:06:20,893 --> 01:06:23,187
I keep going back to that day
standing there.

756
01:06:28,067 --> 01:06:29,276
Why are you…

757
01:06:34,865 --> 01:06:37,618
Why are you acting so sincere
and confusing me?

758
01:06:43,541 --> 01:06:45,418
A missed chance will turn into regret.

759
01:06:51,132 --> 01:06:53,050
If I have no more chances to miss,

760
01:06:54,343 --> 01:06:57,471
I should make one myself.

761
01:07:11,861 --> 01:07:14,572
I'll be the one with a crush on you now.

762
01:07:16,741 --> 01:07:18,701
Just like you liked me.

763
01:07:19,493 --> 01:07:23,080
I'll like you longer,
and I'll like you more.

764
01:07:26,542 --> 01:07:28,502
I'll be just like you.

765
01:07:29,587 --> 01:07:31,213
And you can be like me.

766
01:07:34,216 --> 01:07:36,343
Then just like I came to like you,

767
01:07:39,638 --> 01:07:41,223
you should come to like me again.

768
01:07:45,227 --> 01:07:46,979
If that's the cycle we're in,

769
01:07:50,775 --> 01:07:52,151
I'll wait.

770
01:09:33,502 --> 01:09:36,714
Will things get better as time passes?

771
01:09:37,256 --> 01:09:40,050
Will effort make things better?

772
01:09:40,134 --> 01:09:42,636
It's okay.
Everything gets better over time.

773
01:09:43,971 --> 01:09:46,891
I told you not to cross the line
and just be her friend.

774
01:09:47,516 --> 01:09:50,269
I'm going to propose to my boyfriend.

775
01:09:50,352 --> 01:09:52,771
-When are you coming?
-Do you have something to say?

776
01:09:52,855 --> 01:09:55,316
No. I just wanted to know
when you were coming.

777
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:58,611
I'm sorry I always made
a joke out of everything.

778
01:09:58,694 --> 01:10:00,946
I said I'd wait, so I'll wait quietly.

779
01:10:01,614 --> 01:10:03,824
You must've had a huge fight
with your boyfriend.

780
01:10:03,908 --> 01:10:05,910
-Why?
-Didn't he say anything?

781
01:10:05,993 --> 01:10:08,579
Why do you always put up with everything?

782
01:10:08,662 --> 01:10:10,206
That's a bad relationship.

783
01:10:10,706 --> 01:10:12,458
I can't do this anymore.

784
01:10:15,628 --> 01:10:20,633
