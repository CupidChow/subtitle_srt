1
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:50,300
I said I want us to stay friends.

2
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:51,968
I said I want to keep seeing you.

3
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:55,805
I let you have your way three years ago,
so it's your turn to do so.

4
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,599
You only care about your feelings.

5
00:00:57,682 --> 00:01:00,894
Bad guys always care
only about themselves.

6
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:05,940
You told me
to take care of myself before others.

7
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,487
Whether it's a curse or something else,

8
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:13,031
I'm ending everything here today.

9
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:15,075
How?

10
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:17,994
Whether it's a curse, me,
or something else?

11
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:43,061
The curse

12
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,272
is lifted now.

13
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:01,704
Excuse me.

14
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:04,290
Excuse me.

15
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:06,251
Could you put your seat upright?

16
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:27,021
It really is different.

17
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:06,769
Gyeong Woo-yeon?

18
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,192
I missed you.

19
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:14,819
You won't be here.

20
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:16,279
Is it a token of apology?

21
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:17,697
It's just juice.

22
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:26,581
It's okay to get lost.

23
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:28,333
It will tell you where to go.

24
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:33,588
I must be going insane.

25
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:41,346
It's hot.

26
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:05,954
Woo-yeon, want to grab a beer?

27
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:08,915
WOO-YEON, WANT TO GRAB A BEER?

28
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:10,208
Sure.

29
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,168
I'll call you after dinner.

30
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:15,964
What did I expect?

31
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:19,801
What? Why was he there?

32
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,762
The owner of the guesthouse
Sang-hyeok told me about

33
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:24,597
is Su's father's friend.

34
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:26,683
He met the owner through Su, too.

35
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:30,770
Is that why you made 35 candles?
Because you had a lot on your mind?

36
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:32,021
No, I didn't.

37
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:35,733
-I just made them because I wanted to.
-Why did you have a lot on your mind?

38
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:38,194
Are you falling for him again?

39
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,154
You foolish homo sapiens. You pushover.

40
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:42,240
I'm not falling for him.

41
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:45,535
Did you sleep with him?

42
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:51,916
Gosh, Yeong-hui.

43
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,627
Come on. Think about
all those nights you spent there

44
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:56,754
and all those morning suns you saw.

45
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:59,299
-But there's only one sun.
-Anyway,

46
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:01,801
there's no way nothing happened.

47
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:04,262
You were in the romantic Jeju Island.

48
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:08,850
What's going on?
Why is your face getting red?

49
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:10,685
What did you do? Why is it red?

50
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:12,770
I didn't do anything.

51
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:20,611
Oh, right.

52
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:23,823
I broke the curse.

53
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:25,533
How did you break the curse?

54
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,828
I said I won't see him again.

55
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:31,873
We won't
run into each other again, anyway.

56
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:34,876
If it was that easy to lift the curse,

57
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,461
it wouldn't have taken ten years.

58
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:39,922
It's lifted anyway.

59
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:42,300
But

60
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:45,762
doesn't a curse get lifted
when the witch is dead?

61
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,655
A girl's earring? What is this?

62
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:21,589
What brings you here?

63
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:24,592
Su. It's about your mother.

64
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:36,229
Places contain memories.

65
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:43,152
To me, Seoul was

66
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:46,030
a place of nightmares.

67
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:48,199
Fine! Let's get a divorce!

68
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:57,041
Your mother and I decided to stay friends.

69
00:06:57,125 --> 00:07:00,878
You stayed friends after your divorce.
Don't you care what people might think?

70
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:04,632
It was a strange world.

71
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:10,138
You're a breeze.
You just go around everywhere.

72
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:13,015
Then I'll be a flower breeze.
It sounds pretty.

73
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:17,728
Now that I think of it, it's so mean.

74
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:20,064
Why does it have to come
and drop all the petals?

75
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:23,818
It doesn't come to drop petals.
I guess it just comes to see flowers.

76
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:26,070
Even when I could go anywhere…

77
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:29,157
Visit again later, Woo-yeon.
I had fun with you.

78
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,035
Oh, even if you do, I won't be here.

79
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,455
You're not coming back to Seoul?

80
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,874
No. I'm not.

81
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:41,085
I see.

82
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:47,383
…I never wanted to stay in Seoul.

83
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,807
I was told she was dying.

84
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,601
You even made your friend lie.

85
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:58,644
I thought she was going to die.

86
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,897
She just sprained her back a bit.

87
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,900
Hey, the spine is a really important
part of the body.

88
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,943
If the core loses balance…

89
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:11,449
Your mother missed you a lot.

90
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:16,120
When I missed you guys,
you weren't there for me.

91
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:17,872
Su.

92
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:19,373
I'm leaving. I'm tired.

93
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:21,584
Wait. Let me drop you off.

94
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:27,215
Don't be nice to me all of a sudden.
It's awkward.

95
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:42,355
I guess we deeply hurt our boy.

96
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:46,400
-Min-a, hand me a stapler.
-Okay.

97
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:51,280
Did you buy all that for yourself?

98
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,199
Yes, for when I'm low on sugar.

99
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:57,161
If you eat stuff like this, it won't be
the problem. It'll be your image.

100
00:08:57,828 --> 00:08:59,789
Take care of yourself
if you want affection.

101
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,417
Ms. Kim. You, too.

102
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:06,462
Don't get too comfortable
in a long-term relationship.

103
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:07,713
You must make an effort.

104
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:10,800
Don't dress casually because
you dated the guy for a long time.

105
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:13,636
Even if you've dated a long time,
you should make an effort.

106
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:16,097
It's good to have such manners, isn't it?

107
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:17,765
Yes.

108
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:20,518
What's that now?

109
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:25,690
I need to look at some
good things in my life.

110
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:27,233
As a guy, they don't look hot.

111
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,569
How are they any different from me?

112
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:33,864
There's a difference between you and them.

113
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:37,034
I like them
even when they don't do anything.

114
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:39,120
And I just want you to do nothing.

115
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:48,337
Ms. Kim, I didn't peg you
to be the funny type.

116
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:50,214
What a compliment.

117
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:10,359
I've been wondering for a while…

118
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:14,697
Is your family rich, by any chance?

119
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:21,662
I've never
been well-off in my entire life.

120
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:25,791
Then how can you always be so confident?

121
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:29,962
If I had a lot to lose,
I'd watch out for myself.

122
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:33,090
But my health and my pride are

123
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:34,634
the only two things I have.

124
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:37,386
So I should protect
the only things I have.

125
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:42,058
And it's not like this job pays enough
to compensate for my pride.

126
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:47,980
So you shouldn't lower
your own self-esteem for other people.

127
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:52,026
If you do, you have to bow and kneel.

128
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:54,779
Later, you'll end up like that.

129
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,368
She's so cool.

130
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:08,501
Hello, Mother.

131
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:12,671
I see. Father's birthday?

132
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:15,216
I see. At home?

133
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:19,470
We're going to have a simple dinner
with the family. It's been a while.

134
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:23,307
Don't buy anything. There's no need to
feel obligated. Come comfortably.

135
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:26,227
I see. Okay.
By what time should I be there?

136
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:28,562
One in the afternoon?

137
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:32,191
But you said it was dinner.

138
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:39,198
I see. Right. To have dinner,
we should prepare it in the afternoon.

139
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:43,160
Okay. I got it. Okay.

140
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,667
So by "comfortably," she meant I should

141
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:52,336
dress comfortably to do chores.

142
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:10,498
UNCLE

143
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,543
I don't need a traitor.

144
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:18,881
Don't call me a traitor. I did it for you.

145
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:22,468
You seem to want me
to get along with my parents.

146
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:25,888
I just want you to be happy.

147
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,890
Then you shouldn't have sent me here.

148
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:30,434
Seoul is nice. It's beautiful.

149
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:33,229
I don't like Seoul. It's boring here.

150
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:35,773
I don't think that's the word.
You're lonely there.

151
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:39,818
Emotions are like living organisms.

152
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:43,072
If you cover them up and look
the other way, they grow.

153
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:45,741
Especially hatred.

154
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:48,744
It feeds on our memories
and keeps growing.

155
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:52,248
You can create new memories.

156
00:13:52,831 --> 00:13:54,875
Or you can pour it out of your chest.

157
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:57,962
Whatever you do, don't just neglect it.

158
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:02,758
What? Are you drunk?

159
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:08,639
Are you in Jeju Island?

160
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,420
I would like to order the couples'
passport cases with your calligraphy.

161
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:43,007
Write, "People who are meant to be
will cross paths."

162
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:56,896
I'm hungry.

163
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:04,737
PEOPLE WHO ARE MEANT TO BE
WILL CROSS PATHS

164
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:10,451
Thank you.

165
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:17,499
Woo-yeon?

166
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:23,130
Hello.

167
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:27,009
I have the TV on at my house.

168
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:31,221
The electricity bill is crazy, especially
with the progressive rate system.

169
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:33,307
Bye.

170
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:42,566
Woo-yeon.

171
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:51,742
Why did you ignore me when I said hi?

172
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:53,869
You stopped me to hear me say hi?

173
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,412
You just ruined my day.

174
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:57,539
I was doing fine until you ruined it.

175
00:15:57,623 --> 00:16:00,292
-Why are you ignoring me?
-It's the other way around.

176
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:03,420
I said I didn't want to see you again.

177
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:05,130
That includes

178
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:08,258
even when we run into each other
like this. I don't want to say hi.

179
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:11,595
But I never agreed to it.

180
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:15,641
And I need to ask you something.

181
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,104
Why did you kiss me that day?

182
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:22,398
Hey.

183
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:26,026
How can you ask that so bluntly?

184
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:29,154
Then what should I do?
Will you answer me if I act all shy?

185
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:33,033
Why did you kiss me?

186
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:43,585
Everything is a joke to you, right?
Nothing's serious to you.

187
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:46,505
-Everything's easy for you.
-I'm not joking. It was a question.

188
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:47,756
Fine.

189
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:50,217
I'm sorry about that day.

190
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:53,053
I apologize.

191
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:55,723
-What?
-Other people ask if they should

192
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:58,475
apologize or confess
their feelings after a kiss.

193
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,729
But I won't even ask. I'll apologize.

194
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:05,232
I'm sorry.

195
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:08,819
I deserve to die for what I did.

196
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:12,740
No, you don't deserve to die.

197
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:15,200
You harassed me. It's sexual harassment.

198
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:19,079
Hey, don't get all legal on me.

199
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:20,706
You said you deserved to die.

200
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,125
You've committed a crime, now pay for it.

201
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,335
As a punishment,
you have to keep seeing me.

202
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:26,795
And I reject

203
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:28,881
your rejection.

204
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:31,633
Hey.

205
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,973
What a jerk.

206
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:41,810
So the kiss meant nothing to you, right?

207
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:48,067
You refused another blind date.

208
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:51,570
Mom is very worried.

209
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:54,615
Blind dates are too uncomfortable.

210
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:59,328
How about this? Why don't you
set him up with one of your friends?

211
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:00,788
Shall I?

212
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:03,165
What kind of woman does he like?

213
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:05,584
What was your first love like?

214
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:12,216
-Did you know her?
-What?

215
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:14,343
You've been friends since college.

216
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:17,763
I'm not sure.

217
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:21,767
I prefer to meet naturally.

218
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:25,604
I hope you're still not holding out
for "the one."

219
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:28,440
I might be.

220
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,611
HAPJEONG-DONG POST OFFICE

221
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:41,870
SENDER: GYEONG WOO-YEON

222
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:44,581
-Thank you.
-Thank you. Take care.

223
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:52,172
I'm the one who ordered the passport
cases. Please cancel my order.

224
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:53,549
What?

225
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,760
I'm sorry. But custom orders

226
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:58,971
can't be canceled, exchanged, or refunded

227
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:01,807
due to a change of heart.
I notified you of this in advance.

228
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:06,854
We broke up.

229
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:08,939
WE BROKE UP

230
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:16,155
Your refund is complete.

231
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:18,240
So many people canceled this month.

232
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:21,535
This is why I can't quit my part-time job.

233
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:26,874
Sir.

234
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:31,044
Mr. On, the calligrapher
we hired for today's event

235
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:33,005
broke her wrist.

236
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:36,425
We have three hours until the event.

237
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,760
Can we hire another calligrapher
in three hours?

238
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,929
We are looking for
a replacement right now.

239
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:43,223
But we don't have much time left.

240
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:46,643
For now, prepare a package
with our merchandise for every guest

241
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:48,520
just in case the event gets canceled.

242
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:49,938
Yes, sir.

243
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:55,611
-Mr. Min.
-Yes?

244
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:57,571
Hold on.

245
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:06,330
HAPJEONG-DONG POST OFFICE

246
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:09,416
What is it?
Do I need to give another refund?

247
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:13,462
Hello. This is Min Sang-sik
from Metaphor Publishing House.

248
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:15,130
I'm contacting you

249
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:18,050
about a calligraphy event
our company is preparing.

250
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:19,968
Please call me when you get this.

251
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:22,054
No freaking way.

252
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,515
PLEASE CALL ME WHEN YOU GET THIS

253
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:29,645
I don't have her phone number,
so I left a message on her social media.

254
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,396
I don't know when she'll check…

255
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,274
"Okay." She said she's coming.

256
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,861
What if this was a scam?
How can she say yes right away?

257
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:39,404
Because she likes her job.

258
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,114
Do you know her?

259
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:43,325
I know that she's a calligrapher.

260
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:49,665
I would very much appreciate it
if you can come to our office.

261
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:53,794
METAPHOR PUBLISHING HOUSE

262
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,012
This way.

263
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:10,269
Well, I hope it wasn't too troublesome
coming to our office.

264
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:11,520
-It was fine.
-I see.

265
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:14,773
I know it was a last-minute request.
But thank you for coming.

266
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:16,858
No. I should thank you.

267
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:21,071
He's the CEO of our company.

268
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:22,823
What?

269
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:25,575
I told you I like books.

270
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:28,245
I'm CEO On Jun-su
of Metaphor Publishing House.

271
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:29,871
I see.

272
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:32,082
I don't have a business card.

273
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:34,501
What I got was prettier
than a business card.

274
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:36,586
-Pardon?
-In the inner pocket of my jacket.

275
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:39,006
I saw your ID on the postcard.

276
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:43,844
Please do a good job today.

277
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:46,763
Okay. I'll do my best.

278
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:47,973
Let's go.

279
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:52,728
My marketing team
will explain the details.

280
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:53,812
Okay.

281
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:01,403
Goodness. It was a lovely painting.

282
00:22:04,614 --> 00:22:07,034
-Anyway, take good care of yourself.
-Thank you.

283
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:14,666
-Bye.
-Okay.

284
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:28,680
Why did you call Su? He's busy.

285
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:32,017
Then why call me? I'm busy, too.

286
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,101
And Dr. Kim as well.

287
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:36,813
Well, you were the first person
I thought of.

288
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,275
I know you have a lot of time now.

289
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:43,320
I'm busy, too.

290
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:49,993
A SENTENCE IN YOUR WALLPAPER

291
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:53,914
There's an event
before the interview with the writer.

292
00:22:53,997 --> 00:22:57,626
Make a one and only wallpaper
with a quote of your choice.

293
00:22:58,376 --> 00:23:00,003
Hello. Welcome.

294
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:01,421
Check out our event.

295
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:02,547
EVERY DAY IS A GOOD DAY

296
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:05,592
There's an event
before the interview with the writer.

297
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:09,679
Make a one and only wallpaper
with a quote of your choice.

298
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:11,389
MAKE A CALLIGRAPHY WALLPAPER

299
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:15,727
YOUR BEAUTY MAY BECOME WORDS

300
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:18,146
It's all done. Check your email, please.

301
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:21,358
-This is beautiful.
-Thank you.

302
00:23:21,441 --> 00:23:22,984
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

303
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:24,402
MAKE A CALLIGRAPHY WALLPAPER

304
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:26,905
-Hello.
-Hi.

305
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:28,406
METAPHOR PUBLISHING HOUSE

306
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:29,533
Say hello.

307
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:32,244
Hello. I'm Lee Yeon-gyeong.

308
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:39,042
What's the message you wanted to
deliver with your novel?

309
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:42,921
Jae-o is an ordinary guy in his 20s.

310
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:46,633
He's the guy that we might have
come across once in our lives.

311
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:49,094
Or perhaps, you could be Jae-o.

312
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:52,973
In the book, it looks like

313
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:56,726
Jae-o is walking
through an endless tunnel.

314
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:59,938
People in their 20s have a hard time
with their jobs and dating lives.

315
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:01,481
It's natural to mess up.

316
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:03,358
So there are four tones in Chinese.

317
00:24:03,441 --> 00:24:08,321
First, second, third, and fourth tones.
There's a total of four tones in Chinese.

318
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:11,533
Depending on how you change your tones,

319
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:13,910
ma can have different meanings.

320
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:16,121
Learning the correct intonation
is important.

321
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:18,582
Shall we begin with the first tone?

322
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:21,001
Here's the first tone. Ma.

323
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:22,002
-Ma.
-Ma.

324
00:24:22,085 --> 00:24:23,962
-Ma.
-Ma.

325
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:26,298
This is it for today. Good work.

326
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:27,883
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

327
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:41,521
Excuse me.
Aren't we going to form study groups?

328
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:43,899
There are no study groups for Chinese.

329
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:16,640
LATE-NIGHT FOOD BAR

330
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:17,557
Here.

331
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:21,519
Are you still just dating?
Aren't you going to get married?

332
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:23,521
I do want to get married.

333
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:27,359
But weddings cost a fortune. I just
finished paying off my student loan.

334
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:30,028
Don't be like that.
Your boyfriend became a teacher now.

335
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:32,113
And you have a job with a steady paycheck.

336
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:36,034
You might not have a lot of money now,
but saving together is all the fun.

337
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:39,329
We don't have money right now.
We'll end up in debt little by little.

338
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:44,334
-Can you help a girl out here?
-Fat chance of that. I have no money.

339
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:50,966
See? She doesn't have any money
even at that age.

340
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:53,176
We'll always be short of money.

341
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:56,638
If we're always short of money,
when will we get married?

342
00:25:57,472 --> 00:25:58,598
When we have money.

343
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:04,521
If you accept me,
I'll do my best not to disappoint you.

344
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:06,690
Leave my boy alone.

345
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:09,609
That's how you can help me.

346
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:11,695
I love Gyeong-min, Mother.

347
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:14,155
-She should check the envelope.
-I'm not your mother.

348
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:19,452
How much money would you
break up with me for?

349
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,417
Five hundred million won.

350
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:29,129
So you have a number in mind.
Do you often think about it?

351
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:33,466
It's too hard to save that much.
I'll be old by then.

352
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:39,931
I'll give you a billion won.

353
00:26:40,807 --> 00:26:41,808
Marry me.

354
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:49,399
What?

355
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:54,070
So when will you have one billion won?

356
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:00,952
When will you have it?

357
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:03,204
Eat up.

358
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:04,831
LATE-NIGHT FOOD BAR

359
00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:06,249
Why can't you answer me?

360
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:08,793
Why are you so quiet?

361
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:11,296
This is what your mother said.

362
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:14,090
"You're coming
to the birthday party, right?"

363
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:17,010
She wasn't asking.
It sounded like she was confirming it.

364
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:20,597
How can I say no when she was
so sure that I would be there?

365
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:23,183
Don't come if you don't want to.

366
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:25,852
I'm sure she called you
because she wants to see you.

367
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:29,689
No need to feel pressured.
I won't do anything you don't want.

368
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:32,275
Your family always ate out
for your father's birthdays.

369
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:36,237
But she's been cooking meals
ever since I went. Guess what it means.

370
00:27:36,863 --> 00:27:38,114
What does it mean?

371
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:39,407
"Watch and learn.

372
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:42,619
This is the family tradition
you must carry on in the future."

373
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:46,247
Is that what it means?

374
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:48,917
I made a mistake at the beginning.

375
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,752
I was too young back then.

376
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:54,589
I didn't know your family would also be
in my life once I met them.

377
00:27:56,424 --> 00:27:58,134
I'm a fool.

378
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:02,222
-Yeong-hui.
-What?

379
00:28:03,556 --> 00:28:06,393
Stop calling my girl a fool.

380
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:07,811
Apologize now.

381
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:15,610
I'm sorry for not doing a better job
in the middle.

382
00:28:15,693 --> 00:28:17,445
I'll talk to my mom.

383
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:21,199
You can just hide behind me.

384
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:22,450
I'll handle it.

385
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:26,079
No, don't.

386
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:29,666
If her precious youngest son does that,
she'll think I put you up to it.

387
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:33,044
No. My mother is not that old-fashioned.

388
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:34,295
Are you a mama's boy?

389
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:37,674
Are you?

390
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,093
Why can't you answer me?

391
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:42,262
Are you really?

392
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:45,056
-Hurry up.
-Wait for me.

393
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:49,811
-Thank you so much for your help today.
-Thank you.

394
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:51,730
-Please wait.
-Okay.

395
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:55,275
Mr. On.

396
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,321
Good job today.

397
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:02,031
I had so much fun today.

398
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:05,076
Thank you for the opportunity.

399
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,579
Don't thank me for a job
you earned with your skill.

400
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:11,040
We're going out for a meal. Join us.

401
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:14,169
No. I don't think I belong there.

402
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:15,837
No, you do.

403
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,757
It's for the people who worked hard
for today's event.

404
00:29:23,636 --> 00:29:26,014
I could open a tteokbokki restaurant
because of you.

405
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:29,601
You went to a Chinese language school.
Just focus on your studies.

406
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:32,395
You shouldn't be looking for men to date.
How dare you?

407
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:35,190
Shut up. You might not know,

408
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:38,443
but I'm pretty good at Chinese.

409
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:41,946
What? You can speak Chinese, too.
Who on earth are you?

410
00:29:43,656 --> 00:29:45,325
I should've stuck to a TOEIC school.

411
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:47,702
Who knew there would be no study groups?

412
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:50,288
You got a perfect score in TOEIC.
Why would you do that?

413
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:52,999
If you want to meet guys,
go on blind dates.

414
00:29:53,082 --> 00:29:54,876
I want to meet them organically.

415
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:59,047
I get the feeling if you insist on meeting
them organically, you might die alone.

416
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:01,841
But I should probably shut up, right?
I was just about to.

417
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:03,593
I catch on pretty fast, you know.

418
00:30:06,554 --> 00:30:09,974
Who's coming? Yeong-hui is working late.
And Woo-yeon has other plans.

419
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:13,061
So you didn't know.
Su said he was going to come over.

420
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:18,775
My goodness. How long has it been, Su?
Let me see you.

421
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,861
You haven't aged at all.
You still look handsome.

422
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:24,072
No way. I probably look more handsome.

423
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:25,615
And you're still annoying.

424
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:28,034
Sit right here.
I'll make you a rolled omelet.

425
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:32,789
Why are you here? How are you here?

426
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:35,917
-I had to take care of something in Seoul.
-Like what?

427
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:40,421
-Does Woo-yeon know you're here?
-Yes. We ran into each other yesterday.

428
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:43,842
I don't want you to see her.

429
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:46,094
Don't run into her.
Don't even go near her.

430
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:49,264
-Am I a bomb or something?
-Yes, you are.

431
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:50,765
A nuclear bomb. A social evil.

432
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:52,934
Too bad I can't fight a girl.

433
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:56,229
My gosh. Hey, come on. Let's fight.

434
00:30:56,312 --> 00:30:59,107
Goodness. Hey, I want a beer.

435
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,275
Okay.

436
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:08,241
All right. If your glasses
are filled, let's raise them.

437
00:31:08,324 --> 00:31:11,786
-Cheers. Good job today.
-Good job.

438
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,454
-Good job.
-Great work.

439
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:21,379
Who are you, though?

440
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:23,840
I'm Calligrapher Gyeong Woo-yeon.

441
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:27,385
My handwriting sucks. I'm always
envious of people like you.

442
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:32,724
To be honest,
I transcribed a lot of your novels.

443
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:34,767
A creative writing major?

444
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:38,396
Yes. But I don't write anymore.

445
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:40,565
It's nice to meet you, Woo-yeon.

446
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:42,025
Thank you.

447
00:31:45,361 --> 00:31:47,947
-Well done.
-Good job.

448
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:56,414
Hey, I heard you saw Su yesterday.

449
00:31:56,497 --> 00:32:00,627
He's having a blast
with Jin Sang-hyeok at Tonight.

450
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:08,176
Oh, my. You can hold your liquor.

451
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:10,136
You're my kind of girl.

452
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:12,931
Well, Ms. Lee…

453
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:16,059
I want your wallet, not your commentary.

454
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:23,232
-Here.
-Good work, everyone.

455
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:25,443
-Raise your classes. A ray of sunshine!
-Okay.

456
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:26,736
A ray of sunshine!

457
00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:31,741
-One more shot?
-Let me pour you a drink.

458
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:34,160
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

459
00:32:34,243 --> 00:32:35,870
-You're okay, right?
-Yes.

460
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:37,580
Cheers.

461
00:32:39,707 --> 00:32:42,293
We don't have time to eat the food.

462
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:45,004
-There's some left. Cheers.
-Cheers.

463
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:54,013
You guys are truly evil.

464
00:32:54,597 --> 00:32:57,809
I heard you went all the way
to Jeju Island to track down Mr. Han.

465
00:32:57,892 --> 00:33:01,729
You even brought a laptop and forced him
to write after locking him up.

466
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:04,524
Come on, it was Mr. Han's fault.

467
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:08,861
And you! Stop pecking at me.

468
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:11,155
I'll get it done without your nagging.

469
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:15,034
Do I look like a tree to you?
Are you a woodpecker?

470
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:17,662
Well, you're not a tree.

471
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:21,165
Oh, right. My darned CEO once said

472
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:24,961
writers are the most human-like machines.

473
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:28,297
What? Machines?

474
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:30,258
Writers are human, too.

475
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:33,678
No. I was borrowing what Mr. Han said.

476
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:36,806
Gosh, but that was your fault.

477
00:33:36,889 --> 00:33:38,599
Why would you say it like that?

478
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:41,686
Goodness. You're heartless.

479
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,857
You're a tree.

480
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:52,155
You're a woodpecker.

481
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,369
You're the devil.

482
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:03,249
Ms. Lee.

483
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:06,586
You're the devil.

484
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:10,590
No. That's not it.
Watch. Right where his hair parts.

485
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:13,718
You're the devil.

486
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:17,096
Here's your card. Let me do that again.

487
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:23,019
I should stop here.
I almost got myself in trouble.

488
00:34:23,102 --> 00:34:25,605
-Here you go. Thank you for the card.
-Thank you.

489
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:28,399
-Thank you.
-Gosh, don't thank me. I didn't do much.

490
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:30,151
Thank you.

491
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:36,699
Who knew there would be
no study groups at the Chinese school?

492
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:40,745
So what? Because there are
so many people in China, they don't date?

493
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:42,163
Why not?

494
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:44,457
I can smell alcohol from this photo.

495
00:34:45,124 --> 00:34:48,294
No wonder why she and Woo-yeon
are friends. It's crystal clear.

496
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,713
Goodness.

497
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:54,425
What?

498
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:58,679
You jerk. Get out of Seoul!

499
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:00,640
Hey, stop telling him to leave Seoul.

500
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:02,975
He just got here.

501
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:07,480
Here's why. He's evil.

502
00:35:07,563 --> 00:35:09,023
"Evil"?

503
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:11,859
My gosh, you're totally wasted.

504
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:14,195
-Bye.
-What? Already?

505
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:16,489
I should get going. See you.

506
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:20,660
Bye. Get lost!

507
00:35:25,998 --> 00:35:28,167
"I should get going. See you."

508
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:31,879
He's cool.

509
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:35,550
Ms. Lee. I'll be a ray of sunshine,

510
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:37,760
not a woodpecker.

511
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:41,013
Ta-da.

512
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:45,518
Damn it.

513
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:51,440
Where are you going?

514
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:53,067
To teach a villain a lesson.

515
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:53,985
-Good job.
-Good job.

516
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:59,115
-You seem pretty drunk.
-No.

517
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:03,828
I'll be back in one piece.

518
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:04,954
Wait.

519
00:36:06,038 --> 00:36:10,168
Damn it. The floor keeps shaking.

520
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:12,795
Don't move.

521
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:32,064
-Hello? I can't talk…
-You always do this.

522
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:34,066
I can't talk right now.

523
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:38,196
-I'm sorry, but…
-You're not even going to like me back.

524
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:41,407
Why did you like my photo?

525
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:43,784
You must think I'm a joke.

526
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:46,162
I said I didn't want to see you.

527
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:50,291
Do you think you can toy with my feelings?

528
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:54,420
Am I really a joke to you?

529
00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:00,927
I prayed every day.

530
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:04,889
I didn't ask for you to like me back.

531
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:07,350
I only prayed

532
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:11,395
that I could get over you.

533
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:23,699
-Hello?
-I guess

534
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:26,911
I still miss you.

535
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:30,039
-Who is this?
-You asshole!

536
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:31,457
You don't have to curse.

537
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,751
You're going to ignore me now?

538
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:37,213
You got the wrong number.
I'm going to hang up.

539
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:40,508
Hey, you jerk.

540
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:44,804
I prayed every day.

541
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:49,225
I didn't ask for you to like me back.

542
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:52,645
I only prayed that I could get over you.

543
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:55,022
I can't sleep because I'm so curious.

544
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:58,234
Why did you do that?

545
00:37:59,068 --> 00:38:02,571
If you were going to do this to me,
you shouldn't have hugged me

546
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:06,075
when you dropped me off that night.

547
00:38:07,034 --> 00:38:08,536
Why couldn't you give me a hug?

548
00:38:09,328 --> 00:38:11,706
Was that such a hard thing to do?

549
00:38:19,588 --> 00:38:20,589
Hello?

550
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:35,938
Will you like me just once?

551
00:38:36,772 --> 00:38:38,274
Will you please…

552
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:43,612
like me for once?

553
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:45,990
Please?

554
00:38:48,951 --> 00:38:50,411
Is it that hard for you?

555
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:08,387
Yes. Even I think this is ridiculous.

556
00:39:11,932 --> 00:39:14,643
You're not even going to answer it.

557
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:19,982
But talking to you like this
is just utterly ridiculous.

558
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,246
What a strange world

559
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:37,958
-Woo-yeon.
-What?

560
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:44,131
Are you the devil? I was just talking
about you, and you appeared.

561
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:46,550
Are you a beggar?

562
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:49,261
You keep coming back again and again.

563
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:52,306
Excuse me.

564
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:57,895
-Get off me. What are you doing?
-Be quiet. A pervert is following you.

565
00:39:57,978 --> 00:39:59,522
-What?
-Excuse me.

566
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:03,818
Run on my count of three. One, two, three.

567
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:11,283
What was that?

568
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:32,680
Does your liver want to be foie gras?

569
00:40:33,347 --> 00:40:36,725
How fatty do you want your liver to be?
You're always drinking.

570
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,061
Why do you care?

571
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:41,480
I saved you from a pervert.
Why are you scowling?

572
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:43,023
Did I ask you to save me?

573
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:45,484
Why did you do that?

574
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:48,779
-Why save me?
-Don't let me see you, then.

575
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:50,364
Stop showing up in front of me.

576
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:53,159
-So is that my fault?
-Yes, it is.

577
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:56,287
Why would you get wasted
and have a pervert follow you?

578
00:40:57,371 --> 00:41:01,584
Whether I get wasted
or have a pervert follow me around,

579
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:03,794
it's none of your business.

580
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:05,754
When I see you like that, it bothers me.

581
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,758
You always…

582
00:41:14,346 --> 00:41:16,390
You always have your reasons.

583
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:22,104
No room for misunderstandings.

584
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:23,772
Get up. You'll catch a cold.

585
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:25,441
You can go.

586
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:30,779
I'll go after I stay here for a bit.

587
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:35,034
Go to the underworld?

588
00:41:35,117 --> 00:41:37,411
Do you want to freeze to death out here?

589
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:43,626
Hey. Don't fall asleep here.

590
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:46,462
Woo-yeon. Hey!

591
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:53,052
Were you heading to dreamland?

592
00:41:57,473 --> 00:41:59,433
You're going to regret this tomorrow.

593
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:23,040
Why is she so heavy?

594
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:36,262
Are you the devil?

595
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:39,056
I was just talking about you,
and you appeared.

596
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:40,975
Are you a beggar?

597
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:44,061
You keep coming back again and again.

598
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:51,443
Is that the guy?

599
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:05,207
I hate you.

600
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:07,710
If you're awake, start walking.

601
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:09,878
I can't walk.

602
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:13,382
My gosh. Look at this shameless girl.

603
00:43:15,884 --> 00:43:17,678
I hate you.

604
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:20,139
Seriously?
I'm giving you a piggyback ride.

605
00:43:22,641 --> 00:43:23,934
Even so,

606
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:27,479
I hate you.

607
00:43:27,563 --> 00:43:31,150
What's the point of talking to
a drunk girl? Say whatever you want.

608
00:43:57,426 --> 00:43:58,385
Who is it?

609
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:01,388
A girl is passed out in front of the door.

610
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:02,306
What?

611
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:05,351
You're dead meat.

612
00:44:06,935 --> 00:44:08,854
Save me.

613
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:15,235
-My gosh.
-Save me.

614
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:17,488
I guess you know what's coming for you.

615
00:44:17,571 --> 00:44:20,074
Wake up, you brat. Woo-yeon!

616
00:44:21,033 --> 00:44:22,618
Hey, wake up.

617
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:40,344
How did I get home last night?

618
00:44:52,564 --> 00:44:55,692
I think you broke my back.
I'm going to sue you.

619
00:44:57,694 --> 00:44:59,238
If you're awake, start walking.

620
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:01,407
I can't walk.

621
00:45:02,574 --> 00:45:03,784
My gosh.

622
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:06,078
No way.

623
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:08,664
CALL HISTORY

624
00:45:08,747 --> 00:45:11,875
You're not even going to like me back.

625
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:14,545
Why did you like my photo?

626
00:45:14,628 --> 00:45:16,588
Do you think you can toy with my feelings?

627
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:19,591
Am I really a joke to you?

628
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:30,310
This is On Jun-su. Are you feeling okay?

629
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,027
You're the devil.

630
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:53,292
Mr. On, did you want to see me?

631
00:45:53,375 --> 00:45:55,335
Did Ms. Gyeong message back?

632
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:56,670
Not yet, sir.

633
00:45:58,005 --> 00:46:01,300
But why did you use my phone
to message her? You have a phone.

634
00:46:01,383 --> 00:46:03,093
I have my reasons.

635
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:05,304
Tell me as soon as she messages back.

636
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:08,557
Don't you care about me?

637
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:11,560
You worry about her liver but not mine.

638
00:46:11,643 --> 00:46:14,188
You've never worried about my hangovers.

639
00:46:15,355 --> 00:46:17,274
To be honest, I'm kind of disappointed.

640
00:46:17,357 --> 00:46:20,611
Right. You seemed
to have been pretty drunk.

641
00:46:20,694 --> 00:46:24,490
"My darned CEO," "devil,"
and what else did you call me?

642
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:28,243
-About yesterday…
-It was because you were drunk?

643
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:30,454
Of course!

644
00:46:30,537 --> 00:46:34,166
Oh, right. The photographer, Lee Su,
has gotten back to us.

645
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:12,829
She's ignoring my messages?

646
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:20,587
METAPHOR PUBLISHING HOUSE

647
00:47:21,838 --> 00:47:23,423
When did you come to Seoul?

648
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:25,551
Two days ago.

649
00:47:26,593 --> 00:47:29,972
I turned down your offer. But thank you
for the big welcome. I'm grateful.

650
00:47:30,055 --> 00:47:31,348
Because you're important.

651
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:33,892
You can turn me down as much as you want.

652
00:47:36,144 --> 00:47:37,479
But I won't do that again.

653
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:40,983
Let's publish that photo book.

654
00:47:43,151 --> 00:47:44,778
This is a nice surprise.

655
00:47:46,071 --> 00:47:49,449
Can I ask you
why you suddenly had a change of heart?

656
00:47:50,867 --> 00:47:52,828
You were pretty persistent.

657
00:47:52,911 --> 00:47:54,705
I tend to give in to persistent people.

658
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:59,042
And I think I can find a side of Seoul

659
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:02,754
that's not cold or competitive.

660
00:48:04,464 --> 00:48:05,549
I like that.

661
00:48:06,174 --> 00:48:08,719
Before we move on,
we need to discuss something.

662
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,763
That's the collection of novels
I mentioned.

663
00:48:12,514 --> 00:48:16,393
Our original plan was to insert quotes
from this book in the photo book.

664
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:20,480
But recently, I met a calligrapher.

665
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:24,985
She posts her own lines
on her social media account.

666
00:48:25,068 --> 00:48:28,614
I like her lines, calligraphy,
and how she writes them.

667
00:48:28,697 --> 00:48:29,698
WOO-YEON CALLIGRAPHY

668
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:32,284
As long as you're okay,

669
00:48:32,367 --> 00:48:35,203
I would like this calligrapher
to write the quotes.

670
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:38,498
But she's a new calligrapher
without much experience.

671
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:43,545
If everyone wants someone experienced,
how will novices become experienced?

672
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:46,882
So I plan to give her the chance
to build her career.

673
00:48:47,466 --> 00:48:50,302
Of course, as long as
you give us your green light.

674
00:48:51,928 --> 00:48:54,556
Sure. It sounds good to me.

675
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:56,350
Then it's settled.

676
00:49:05,859 --> 00:49:08,153
You're playing a losing battle, Woo-yeon.

677
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:18,413
I can tell you had drinks last night.

678
00:49:19,247 --> 00:49:21,083
You'd be dead if you were my daughter.

679
00:49:22,501 --> 00:49:24,336
Even my parents don't scold me.

680
00:49:34,388 --> 00:49:36,056
Can I answer this call for a moment?

681
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:47,776
-Hello?
-Why didn't you text back?

682
00:49:48,902 --> 00:49:50,987
-Who is this?
-This is On Jun-su.

683
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:56,451
Hello?

684
00:49:58,203 --> 00:49:59,705
Hello.

685
00:49:59,788 --> 00:50:01,415
Can we meet today?

686
00:50:01,998 --> 00:50:05,711
Why? Did I do something wrong?

687
00:50:05,794 --> 00:50:06,753
Pardon?

688
00:50:07,587 --> 00:50:11,508
Well, I had too much to drink last night.

689
00:50:11,591 --> 00:50:15,429
I'm so sorry
if I crossed any lines yesterday.

690
00:50:16,638 --> 00:50:17,723
I don't want to meet.

691
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:20,517
It's not about that. It's about work.

692
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:23,645
Work?

693
00:50:26,648 --> 00:50:27,649
I'm sorry

694
00:50:28,608 --> 00:50:30,152
for making you come here.

695
00:50:30,235 --> 00:50:31,737
It's fine.

696
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:34,364
I'm here to ask for your help.
I ought to come to you.

697
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:38,994
Let me cut to the chase. We're preparing
a calligraphy photo book.

698
00:50:39,077 --> 00:50:41,955
I want you to come up with the lines
and write them.

699
00:50:42,622 --> 00:50:44,082
for the book.

700
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,461
Are you sure you want me
to write the lines?

701
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:49,045
I'm not a professional writer.

702
00:50:49,129 --> 00:50:50,714
I read your lines.

703
00:50:51,339 --> 00:50:54,301
I've never seen such a beautiful diary.

704
00:50:57,137 --> 00:51:01,767
So I really want you to be the writer
for this book.

705
00:51:03,477 --> 00:51:04,728
I'll do it.

706
00:51:05,645 --> 00:51:06,855
I want to do it.

707
00:51:06,938 --> 00:51:09,608
I didn't even tell you
who the photographer is.

708
00:51:09,691 --> 00:51:12,486
I don't care who the photographer is.
I want to do it.

709
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:15,322
It's a good opportunity for me.

710
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:20,243
Next time, don't say yes right away
when you're discussing contracts.

711
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:23,997
Then let me think it over.

712
00:51:27,125 --> 00:51:29,044
I thought about making you sweat,

713
00:51:29,878 --> 00:51:31,505
but there's no need.

714
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:33,965
It's Metaphor Publishing House.

715
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:36,134
The best publishing house.

716
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:41,264
And more importantly,
you offered me the job.

717
00:51:42,474 --> 00:51:45,143
I sold calligraphy merchandise
that often got refunded,

718
00:51:45,227 --> 00:51:48,230
and took on odd jobs
to fill in for other people.

719
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:52,734
But this will really be my own project.

720
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:57,405
Sounds great.

721
00:51:57,906 --> 00:52:00,450
I look forward to working with you.

722
00:52:01,034 --> 00:52:03,829
I look forward to working with you, too.

723
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:07,707
Are you going home? I can drop you off.

724
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:09,501
No. It's okay.

725
00:52:09,584 --> 00:52:12,879
It's fine by me. Come on out.
I'll bring the car around.

726
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:27,394
Mi was the old word for water.

727
00:52:28,937 --> 00:52:30,647
I see.

728
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:33,066
As for water-related words in Korean,

729
00:52:33,149 --> 00:52:35,569
there are makda, mukda, malda, maruda,

730
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:37,320
mal, and mi.

731
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:39,823
Those words gave birth
to the Korean word for water, mul.

732
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:43,743
I see. Okay.

733
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:47,998
There's a reason for everything, and
you can solve anything if there's a will.

734
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:51,793
Despite that, if you can't find a reason,

735
00:52:51,877 --> 00:52:55,422
perhaps you are meant to let it go.

736
00:52:57,757 --> 00:52:59,175
I wrote that.

737
00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:02,762
Did I overstep?

738
00:53:03,638 --> 00:53:04,764
No.

739
00:53:06,141 --> 00:53:10,145
You're good at comforting people.
Did you know that?

740
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:12,731
I do.

741
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:15,567
So let me know when you need it.

742
00:53:29,748 --> 00:53:31,416
I can drop you off at your house.

743
00:53:31,499 --> 00:53:34,169
It's a narrow alley.
It's better if I just walk.

744
00:53:34,836 --> 00:53:36,504
Thank you for the ride.

745
00:53:37,422 --> 00:53:38,381
Get home safely.

746
00:53:41,676 --> 00:53:43,053
Ms. Gyeong.

747
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:45,263
Yes?

748
00:53:45,347 --> 00:53:47,599
Is work the only reason for us to meet?

749
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:50,518
-Pardon?
-You said that on the phone earlier.

750
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:52,354
You didn't want to see me.

751
00:53:52,938 --> 00:53:53,897
I see.

752
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:59,235
To be honest,
I have way too many blackouts.

753
00:53:59,319 --> 00:54:01,947
I'm always nervous
after a night of drinking.

754
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:05,617
So I was embarrassed
in case I made a fool of myself.

755
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:10,580
What?

756
00:54:11,539 --> 00:54:12,415
Did I

757
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:14,876
do something?

758
00:54:18,546 --> 00:54:19,756
I did.

759
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:21,633
Oh, I definitely did.

760
00:54:23,009 --> 00:54:24,803
Darn it. I totally did.

761
00:54:24,886 --> 00:54:26,554
No, you didn't do anything.

762
00:54:27,138 --> 00:54:29,975
So don't be nervous or embarrassed.

763
00:54:30,058 --> 00:54:30,976
Get some sleep.

764
00:54:35,063 --> 00:54:36,564
I'll get going, then.

765
00:54:37,232 --> 00:54:38,191
Bye.

766
00:54:59,504 --> 00:55:00,588
Hello, Woo-yeon.

767
00:55:07,846 --> 00:55:09,139
I've found you!

768
00:55:09,848 --> 00:55:11,975
You're ignoring my text and running away.

769
00:55:13,476 --> 00:55:15,478
If you know I'm running away,
don't stop me.

770
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:17,564
Stop showing up in front of me.

771
00:55:18,898 --> 00:55:20,025
Just get lost.

772
00:55:20,108 --> 00:55:21,943
Why are you so pissed off at me?

773
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:24,571
-Do you have to ask?
-Yes, I don't know why.

774
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:27,615
I was happy to see you in Jeju Island.
I was glad.

775
00:55:27,699 --> 00:55:29,492
I was sad when you suddenly left.

776
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:31,244
Why are you so upset?

777
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:33,246
You only think about yourself even now.

778
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:35,540
You rejected me. Twice.

779
00:55:35,623 --> 00:55:37,417
I don't even like you. Am I supposed

780
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,335
to say okay and start dating you?

781
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:40,545
Isn't that worse?

782
00:55:40,628 --> 00:55:43,965
Fine. You did nothing wrong.

783
00:55:44,549 --> 00:55:47,177
It was all my fault. I'm so sorry.

784
00:55:48,261 --> 00:55:52,223
I apologized. So let's not meet again.

785
00:55:52,307 --> 00:55:55,060
No, we will meet again.

786
00:55:56,394 --> 00:55:58,396
I've decided to keep seeing you.

787
00:56:01,066 --> 00:56:03,610
-That won't happen.
-It will.

788
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:04,944
Take my word for it.

789
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:08,490
-See you soon.
-Hey.

790
00:56:09,365 --> 00:56:12,118
You! Don't you ever show up again.

791
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:15,121
-I'm warning you!
-It was nice seeing you, too.

792
00:56:17,832 --> 00:56:20,001
I won't have to see you again.

793
00:56:21,294 --> 00:56:22,253
Ever.

794
00:56:23,671 --> 00:56:25,673
This girl who only cared about looks.

795
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:28,343
And this girl who only slept.

796
00:56:29,844 --> 00:56:31,888
This girl who collapsed
after eating an apple.

797
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:35,600
They all had only one solution.

798
00:56:36,518 --> 00:56:37,602
A kiss.

799
00:56:40,855 --> 00:56:42,607
It broke the curse.

800
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:47,821
But what are you doing

801
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:50,657
here?

802
00:56:52,951 --> 00:56:54,202
Say hello.

803
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:57,872
This is Photographer Lee Su.
This is Calligrapher Gyeong Woo-yeon.

804
00:56:57,956 --> 00:57:00,625
You will be working together.

805
00:57:03,336 --> 00:57:04,504
Hi.

806
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:10,135
Do you know each other?

807
00:57:10,218 --> 00:57:12,554
-We're friends.
-I'm sorry.

808
00:57:13,805 --> 00:57:15,390
I'll call you again.

809
00:57:17,767 --> 00:57:20,311
-Ms. Gyeong.
-We should postpone the meeting.

810
00:57:20,395 --> 00:57:21,438
Bye.

811
00:57:35,577 --> 00:57:38,246
No, we will meet again.

812
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:41,541
I've decided to keep seeing you.

813
00:57:42,792 --> 00:57:43,918
Hi.

814
00:57:44,002 --> 00:57:47,630
What? He knew everything?

815
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:50,133
Damn it.

816
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:55,763
Why do you always run away?

817
00:57:56,806 --> 00:57:58,141
You knew everything, right?

818
00:57:58,808 --> 00:57:59,934
But you didn't tell me.

819
00:58:00,852 --> 00:58:01,769
You didn't ask.

820
00:58:03,271 --> 00:58:05,815
But I will ask you
why you keep running away from me.

821
00:58:05,899 --> 00:58:07,734
I don't want to see you.

822
00:58:07,817 --> 00:58:09,694
I hate you, so I ran away.

823
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:13,198
I hate you.

824
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:15,783
Look at you lying to me.

825
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:18,328
What?

826
00:58:18,411 --> 00:58:20,371
It's impossible to hate me.

827
00:58:20,455 --> 00:58:21,539
Don't get the wrong…

828
00:58:26,461 --> 00:58:29,380
I don't know what I said that day.

829
00:58:29,464 --> 00:58:31,424
I don't remember a thing.

830
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:35,303
I tend to just spew out
some made-up stuff whenever I drink.

831
00:58:35,386 --> 00:58:38,223
I'm just a mean drunk
who talks trash and spits out lies.

832
00:58:38,806 --> 00:58:40,183
So you should just

833
00:58:41,643 --> 00:58:43,019
forget about what I said.

834
00:58:45,688 --> 00:58:46,981
I hate you.

835
00:58:47,732 --> 00:58:51,444
What's the point of talking to
a drunk girl? Say whatever you want.

836
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:55,198
I can't do that.

837
00:58:58,284 --> 00:59:01,120
They are my feelings,
but I can't control them.

838
00:59:03,414 --> 00:59:05,708
I covered them up
and pretended they didn't exist.

839
00:59:05,792 --> 00:59:07,210
I even tried to suppress them.

840
00:59:09,128 --> 00:59:12,048
But whenever I see you,
they keep coming back alive.

841
00:59:13,508 --> 00:59:15,134
That's why

842
00:59:16,135 --> 00:59:18,888
you should just leave me alone.

843
00:59:21,099 --> 00:59:23,142
Please help me.

844
00:59:36,030 --> 00:59:37,532
I've forgotten

845
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:40,410
that witches can

846
00:59:41,452 --> 00:59:43,580
put you under a new spell
whenever they want.

847
00:59:44,289 --> 00:59:46,291
I don't plan on

848
00:59:48,626 --> 00:59:49,711
helping you.

849
00:59:50,545 --> 00:59:53,506
METAPHOR PUBLISHING HOUSE

850
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:55,049
And this witch

851
00:59:57,552 --> 00:59:59,512
doesn't want to help me.

852
01:00:05,476 --> 01:00:07,353
I can smell alcohol from this photo.

853
01:00:08,062 --> 01:00:11,149
No wonder why she and Woo-yeon
are friends. It's crystal clear.

854
01:00:12,317 --> 01:00:13,693
Goodness.

855
01:00:16,195 --> 01:00:17,739
What?

856
01:00:19,407 --> 01:00:20,617
Get out of Seoul!

857
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:22,827
Hey, stop telling him to leave Seoul.

858
01:00:22,910 --> 01:00:24,162
He just got here.

859
01:00:25,163 --> 01:00:26,456
KINGDOM OF BARS

860
01:00:26,539 --> 01:00:28,249
Here's why. He's evil.

861
01:00:28,333 --> 01:00:30,001
"Evil"?

862
01:00:30,084 --> 01:00:32,795
My gosh, you're totally wasted.

863
01:00:32,879 --> 01:00:33,838
Bye.

864
01:00:33,921 --> 01:00:37,300
KINGDOM OF BARS

865
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:01,366
That pervert. Damn it.

866
01:01:02,075 --> 01:01:04,369
-Woo-yeon.
-What?

867
01:01:05,995 --> 01:01:08,414
Are you the devil?

868
01:01:08,498 --> 01:01:10,583
I was just talking about you,
and you appeared.

869
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:12,085
Are you a beggar?

870
01:01:12,168 --> 01:01:14,170
You keep coming back again and again.

871
01:01:14,754 --> 01:01:15,838
Excuse me.

872
01:01:17,173 --> 01:01:20,593
-Get off me. What are you doing?
-Be quiet. A pervert is following you.

873
01:01:20,677 --> 01:01:21,886
-What?
-Excuse me.

874
01:01:22,929 --> 01:01:25,807
Run on my count of three. One, two, three.

875
01:01:48,996 --> 01:01:50,540
This is very important to me.

876
01:01:50,623 --> 01:01:53,251
I don't have to give up
because of my mere feelings.

877
01:01:53,334 --> 01:01:55,795
"Mere feelings"?
Your feelings for me are pretty big.

878
01:01:56,379 --> 01:02:00,091
I'll do a good job, so I don't get
the wrong idea about myself.

879
01:02:00,174 --> 01:02:01,384
I'm sure you will.

880
01:02:01,467 --> 01:02:05,471
How many excuses will I need
to see you without excuses?

881
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:07,515
-Are you dating the CEO?
-What do you mean?

882
01:02:07,598 --> 01:02:11,060
I don't plan on letting my photos
be pawns in some people's love game.

883
01:02:11,144 --> 01:02:14,188
You'll be the first to know
if we become romantically involved.

884
01:02:15,106 --> 01:02:17,233
-Ms. Gyeong.
-Can you not tell Mr. On

885
01:02:17,316 --> 01:02:19,485
that I liked you?

886
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:21,154
Do you want to hide it that badly?

887
01:02:21,237 --> 01:02:22,822
Please.

888
01:02:25,533 --> 01:02:28,870
I just realized this about myself.
I have loose lips.

889
01:02:28,953 --> 01:02:33,958
