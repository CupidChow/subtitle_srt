1
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:51,885
-Su.
-Yes?

2
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:54,471
Don't keep what you love so much
by your side.

3
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:58,433
-Why not?
-They will just hurt you

4
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,062
or you will end up hurting them.

5
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:05,982
Okay?

6
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,192
Yes.

7
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,904
Should we break up?

8
00:01:25,084 --> 00:01:27,837
It's tough, isn't it?

9
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:42,227
I'm sorry I let you
go through all that alone

10
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,853
and couldn't help you.

11
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,439
But don't say anything like that.

12
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:50,276
Don't leave me.

13
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:58,076
Dad was wrong.

14
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,955
I have to stay with her
because I love her.

15
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:04,249
Please tell me my one-sided love is over.

16
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:11,631
I don't have to wait anymore, right?

17
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:18,972
I don't need your answer.
I'm done waiting.

18
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:18,865
When are the insurance people coming?

19
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:21,659
They will come if I call them.
But I didn't.

20
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,828
What?

21
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,831
Then how do we go home?

22
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,501
Don't worry.
I'll be sure to take you home.

23
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:49,979
What are you doing?

24
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:54,359
I'm a man with a plan.

25
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:01,616
Hey!

26
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:04,827
Don't be mad, sweetheart.

27
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:30,228
Done.

28
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:32,438
Let's go, sweetheart.

29
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:34,440
Stop it.

30
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,150
-Why, sweetheart?
-Gosh.

31
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,654
What's wrong, sweetheart? Honey?

32
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:41,281
I said stop.

33
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,286
Honey.

34
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:10,435
You're seeing someone, aren't you?

35
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:11,644
No.

36
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:13,229
You have flowers.

37
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:16,899
You came home humming and smiling.
And you say you're not?

38
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,526
I said I'm not.

39
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:20,069
I never told you not to date.

40
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:21,654
Why are you hiding it?

41
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:24,282
Well, I'm not hiding anything.

42
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:26,743
You're young. You should date.

43
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,244
Do you want to grow old alone?

44
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:31,205
It's fine as long as it's not him.

45
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:33,666
-What?
-I said it's fine as long as it's not him.

46
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:41,674
-Hey, are you…
-What? Why?

47
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:44,343
No. It can't be him. Never.

48
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:47,180
He's not Voldemort.
Why can't you say his name?

49
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:48,931
-He is a…
-I can't believe this.

50
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:52,560
You silly wench. Do you really want
to side with someone who made you cry?

51
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:55,396
I just cried on my own.
He didn't make me cry.

52
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,483
Actually, he had his own
circumstances and reasons.

53
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:04,113
I'm telling you.
You can't date him. Never.

54
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:10,328
Goodnight.

55
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:22,590
LEE SU

56
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:24,926
One, two, three.

57
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:29,138
Hello?

58
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:58,835
LEE SU

59
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:09,846
Did you hear my heart?

60
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,056
What was that?

61
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:16,060
-Gyeong Woo-yeon.
-Yes?

62
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:19,856
-Woo-yeon.
-What?

63
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:22,066
Woo-yeon.

64
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:24,277
Why do you keep calling me?

65
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:27,905
I'm happy that I'm calling you like this.

66
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,118
Me too.

67
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:36,497
Shall we talk on the phone
all night until we fall asleep?

68
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:39,208
No. I snore.

69
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:42,837
It's okay. I grind my teeth.

70
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,842
What should we do tomorrow?

71
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:51,137
-Tomorrow?
-We should go on our first date.

72
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,931
I'll be with you the whole day.

73
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:57,143
I don't know. What should we do?

74
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:00,354
What do you want to do?

75
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:03,649
Will you do everything I want?

76
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:06,736
Of course. You can do whatever you want.

77
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:10,865
Well…

78
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:17,830
"You'll break your nose
if you fall backward,

79
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:20,374
and break the back of your head
if you fall forward.

80
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:21,834
It will be a bad day

81
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,920
where nothing will work out for you.

82
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:27,256
You should be extra cautious today."

83
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:32,053
What? It just makes me feel crappy.

84
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:37,642
You didn't forget about today, right?
It's our date.

85
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:39,018
Darn it.

86
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:41,270
Date, my foot.

87
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:20,560
-What is this?
-This is for you.

88
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:23,729
From now on, you should get
flowers only from me.

89
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:26,065
Give flowers only to me.

90
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:29,026
I'll kill you if you give some
to anyone else.

91
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,529
Why do you have to be so dramatic?

92
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:37,618
-So what are we doing today?
-Whatever we do, we will have a great day.

93
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:47,003
Woo-yeon!

94
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:49,922
-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry.

95
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:56,304
Are you okay?

96
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:59,932
Are you sure we will have a good day?

97
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:30,338
-What is this?
-What's wrong?

98
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,167
Darn, why isn't he coming?

99
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,378
-Jin-ju.
-Why are you late…

100
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:13,255
I'm sorry. Because of the traffic.

101
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:16,300
Why are you late?

102
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:19,011
What's with your hair?

103
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:21,389
I dressed up for our date.

104
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:23,724
Does it look funny?

105
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:25,309
This isn't a date.

106
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:28,062
Don't get the wrong idea.
This isn't a date.

107
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:30,606
I'm just repaying you
for what you did the other day.

108
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:32,608
Well, that's not what really matters.

109
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:36,404
What matters is that
we're watching a movie.

110
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:38,989
-Let's go.
-Okay.

111
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,870
What? It's Woo-yeon and Su.

112
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,122
Why are they together?

113
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,337
What's the matter?

114
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:55,464
If they see us,
they might get the wrong idea.

115
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,383
-Like what?
-That we're on a date…

116
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,344
Anyway, I don't want them
to misunderstand.

117
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:08,227
Gosh, I'm so nervous.

118
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:15,192
Are you embarrassed of me?

119
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:19,697
No. It's not like that.
I just don't want to be misunderstood.

120
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:26,745
If I'd known this would happen,
I would've studied harder.

121
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:28,873
-What?
-I should've gone to a good university

122
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:30,583
and gotten a good job.

123
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,712
And I should've become a better adult.

124
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:35,838
Hey.

125
00:12:36,755 --> 00:12:38,466
Going to a good university

126
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:40,968
and having a good job
doesn't make you a good adult.

127
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:44,054
That's just how I feel now.

128
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:47,850
Let's go.

129
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:54,106
-Hello?
-Hello?

130
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,150
-What?
-What?

131
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:10,623
How can I be so unlucky today?

132
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:15,961
How about your forehead?
Don't you need medicine?

133
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:20,341
Why are you smiling?

134
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,512
-You're weird.
-Why?

135
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:26,555
You're not the Su I know.

136
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:31,227
Forget about him. He's dead.

137
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:35,856
It's so nice to be with you like this.

138
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:39,193
Excuse me while I go to the restroom.

139
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:40,736
Okay.

140
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:42,821
Gosh.

141
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:45,449
Gosh, I'm so sorry.

142
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,660
-Are you okay?
-Are you all right, ma'am?

143
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:50,412
-Yes, I'm fine.
-Please hang on.

144
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:57,169
Should we go home today?

145
00:13:58,796 --> 00:13:59,838
Yes.

146
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,759
All right.

147
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:07,012
But aren't you hungry?

148
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:09,848
-What?
-I mean,

149
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:12,434
we didn't eat,
nor watch the movie properly.

150
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:14,687
Are you feeling okay?

151
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,398
Yes. I'm feeling okay, but…

152
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:20,734
Is my dress too dirty?

153
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:24,238
No. I'm okay with that.
I'm just afraid you'd be uncomfortable.

154
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:26,782
You're right.

155
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:29,243
Or…

156
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,121
Do you want to go to my place?

157
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:38,711
I mean, we can eat there.

158
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:41,755
We didn't get to enjoy our date today.

159
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:50,472
If you want to.

160
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:52,683
Then let's go to my place.

161
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:54,852
Sure. Go ahead.

162
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:04,194
Mr. Kim Jun-yeong reported you
for the assault that occurred on August 8.

163
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:07,740
There's clear evidence
and a medical certificate,

164
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:10,409
so you should probably settle with him.

165
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:14,872
I have no intention of settling with them.

166
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,877
I'll make sure you go to prison.

167
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:23,964
-You said you'd love to see me sue you.
-Darn, you idiot.

168
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:29,845
Can I speak with him in private?

169
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,180
Sure.

170
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:42,399
This is too big, isn't it?

171
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:58,582
What are you doing?

172
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,543
You look so lovely. I must capture it.

173
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:05,839
What? I'm not in my best state.

174
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:09,802
I'll take more photos when you are.

175
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:11,637
Let me see.

176
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,557
Gosh, this looks good.

177
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:19,228
You take good photos.

178
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:24,525
And you're good at hitting.

179
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:26,819
You are really strong.

180
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:29,989
What are you talking about?
I'm really weak.

181
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:32,074
What do you mean? You're really strong.

182
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:45,587
Look at this.

183
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:47,464
It's too close.

184
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:49,508
Give me your wallet.

185
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:51,760
-Why?
-To give you settlement money.

186
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,679
-Why would you give him…
-Come on.

187
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:58,475
Why would you give it to me in cash?

188
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:01,228
If I wire you the money,
you'll have to pay 22 percent tax.

189
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:09,278
Gosh.

190
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:16,618
KIM JUN-YOUNG
STUDENT

191
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,121
What are you doing?

192
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:22,332
Criminal Code Article 231.

193
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:25,335
Those who forge private documents
will face up to 5 years

194
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:27,421
in prison
or up to 10 million won in fines.

195
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:29,840
This student ID is a private document.

196
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:31,216
Ten million won?

197
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,511
And it was for Seoul National
University of all schools.

198
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:38,140
It's a national university.
So you forged an official document.

199
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:39,516
Criminal Code Article 225.

200
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,852
Forging official documents
will be up to 10 years.

201
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:44,813
Too bad. It just doubled. Ten years.

202
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:50,152
-Who are you?
-Me?

203
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:52,654
A prosecutor.

204
00:17:57,534 --> 00:17:59,328
They have really thin blankets.

205
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:01,121
And the bathrooms are horrible.

206
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:03,290
So what will you do?

207
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:05,667
Do you want to film
Prison Playbook for 10 years?

208
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:11,757
Then what will you do?

209
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,052
I will drop the charges.

210
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:18,597
I guess you're not so stupid.

211
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:20,349
Get up.

212
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:22,184
Open the door.

213
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:28,524
Go tell them.

214
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:30,234
I want to drop the charges!

215
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:34,363
I don't need settlement money.

216
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:35,739
It's all my fault.

217
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:42,371
She's so cool. This is crazy.

218
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:45,457
Ta-da.

219
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:49,920
What? It's not like we were in prison.

220
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:52,131
Come on. Can't you just eat it?

221
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:53,757
We didn't eat yet.

222
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:58,679
It's hot.

223
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:04,309
It's good, isn't it?

224
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:07,688
I must say you're
a really good cook, Sang-hyeok.

225
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:15,487
What are you so happy about?

226
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:18,282
I'm just happy that I'm with you.

227
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:24,872
The first thing we got as a couple
was a lawsuit.

228
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:26,999
Are you crazy?

229
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:29,877
Let's just eat.
Help yourself, Prosecutor Han.

230
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:33,338
Why do you always try so hard to feed me?

231
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:37,217
I don't know. When I see you,
I just want to feed you

232
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:39,887
and make you laugh.

233
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,138
Are you my mom or what?

234
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:43,223
A mom's love is true love.

235
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:44,725
You don't want to pass it up.

236
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:46,977
Whatever.

237
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:52,524
Why are you suddenly
taking photos of people?

238
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:54,193
I suddenly wanted to.

239
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:56,528
Because of someone.

240
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:02,659
I guess I've never looked
at anyone with affection before.

241
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:06,955
"How much have I missed because of that?

242
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,291
And how much am I going to miss
in the future?"

243
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:15,505
Those questions came to mind.
So it's fun to take photos of people now.

244
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,222
What is this?

245
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:25,307
When did you take this one?

246
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,351
You were so pretty
that I couldn't help it.

247
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:36,360
When did you start taking photos?

248
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,111
When I was eight.

249
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,073
You started when you were so young.

250
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:42,449
Were you a prodigy?

251
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:45,535
I wasn't just a photography prodigy.

252
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:48,247
I was a prodigy in everything.
I was multi-talented.

253
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,501
You're a self-admiring prodigy.

254
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:59,383
I had to be a prodigy at the time.

255
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:03,679
Whenever my parents had a fight,

256
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,014
they would check first if I was asleep

257
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,142
and fight with the door closed.

258
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:12,938
I was never asleep, though.

259
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:15,148
I sleep with my door open.

260
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:16,400
Why?

261
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:18,318
I don't like closed doors.

262
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:24,950
I thought that was my fault.

263
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:27,160
"If only I were better.

264
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:29,496
If only I were smarter."

265
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:32,791
I thought my parents
would get along better then.

266
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:35,043
I was so foolish.

267
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,213
Don't change yourself for others.

268
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:41,049
Whatever you do,
those who want to leave will leave

269
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:42,634
and those who want to stay will stay.

270
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:46,805
I won all kinds of awards

271
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:48,348
for things like Go or chess.

272
00:21:48,932 --> 00:21:51,393
I only did things that would make
my mom and dad proud.

273
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:54,229
I guess that made him feel bad for me.

274
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:57,816
He would go to take photos
with me every weekend.

275
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:01,028
I mean, the guesthouse owner.
Remember him?

276
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:07,534
Those were the only happy moments.

277
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:12,289
There are no right answers
or grades in photography.

278
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:18,003
You must've felt lonely.

279
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:22,966
I'm fine now.

280
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:25,510
Because I have you, Woo-yeon.

281
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:07,761
What are you doing here?

282
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:11,348
Can't you just say hello to me?

283
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:14,059
Hello. What's the matter?

284
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:17,270
You can't keep me
outside the door like this.

285
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:18,814
Is that how you were raised?

286
00:23:19,397 --> 00:23:21,024
You're the one who raised me.

287
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:23,819
Give me some tea.

288
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:26,738
No, I can't.

289
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,032
You fool. What do you mean "no"?

290
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:33,745
I guess you can't.

291
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:36,540
Oh, hello.

292
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:38,792
I said I can't.

293
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:42,504
It's good to see you.

294
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,091
It was nice meeting you.

295
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:48,677
Have fun.

296
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,596
Wait…

297
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:01,606
That punk.

298
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:04,109
He's a man.

299
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:15,745
Why did you not listen to me?

300
00:24:16,454 --> 00:24:18,582
You should have told me sooner.

301
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:20,709
You didn't give me a chance to tell you.

302
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:26,506
Here.

303
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:29,092
What's all this?

304
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:31,303
-Peaches?
-Yes.

305
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:33,889
They're in season, so they looked good.

306
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:37,142
I thought of you.

307
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:45,233
Why? Do you not like peaches?

308
00:24:47,527 --> 00:24:48,778
I do.

309
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:50,405
This is the first time

310
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:53,241
that you thought of me
and got me something.

311
00:24:58,955 --> 00:25:00,707
I'm not used to situations like this,

312
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:03,376
but I'll let you off
because Woo-yeon likes peaches.

313
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:08,215
Thank you for letting me off, son.

314
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:12,928
Bye.

315
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:17,098
Dad, you were wrong.

316
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:22,354
What do you mean?

317
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:24,940
You told me not to keep
what I love so much by my side.

318
00:25:25,523 --> 00:25:29,152
But I have to keep it with me
because I love it.

319
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:46,336
WIFE

320
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:54,928
Hello?

321
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:58,056
Shall we

322
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:01,184
have dinner tomorrow?

323
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:04,729
-Did he leave?
-Yes.

324
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:08,024
He's going to hate me.

325
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:10,110
When we first met,
I was with someone else.

326
00:26:10,193 --> 00:26:12,237
And the second time, this is how I looked.

327
00:26:13,196 --> 00:26:16,116
It's okay because I like you.

328
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:17,575
That's just what you think.

329
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:21,746
What should we do tomorrow?

330
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:24,666
Do you want to see me every day?

331
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:27,919
Of course. To make up the whole time
we didn't see each other.

332
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:56,656
What? What were you taking?

333
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,074
You.

334
00:26:58,158 --> 00:26:59,451
From that distance?

335
00:26:59,534 --> 00:27:01,786
I want to see you even from far away.

336
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:04,622
What?

337
00:27:05,248 --> 00:27:06,791
What are the school uniforms for?

338
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:09,753
I want to manipulate our memories.

339
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:13,089
From the age of 18
when I hurt you until now,

340
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:16,843
I will replace all the memories
during the 10 years with good ones.

341
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:21,181
Let's go play, Woo-yeon.

342
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:30,106
-Let's go.
-Okay.

343
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:52,879
Look at you.

344
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:56,174
Look at you.

345
00:28:05,975 --> 00:28:07,352
I love you.

346
00:28:22,575 --> 00:28:23,827
I LOVE YOU

347
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:33,420
I LOVE YOU

348
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:50,687
FOLLOW ME

349
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,754
-The weather is so lovely.
-It's nice.

350
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:17,172
There's a cruise.

351
00:29:22,635 --> 00:29:24,304
Do you want to go ride it?

352
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:27,182
Not now. We can do it
when there's a firework festival.

353
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:30,101
It'll be really hard
to get a ticket, though.

354
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:32,103
I can manage that.

355
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:33,688
Let's go anywhere you want.

356
00:29:35,064 --> 00:29:36,149
Okay.

357
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:00,632
I love you.

358
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:10,683
We met every single day

359
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:14,270
as if we had never been apart.

360
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:18,942
As if there was no empty space between us.

361
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:22,153
-I'll get going.
-Bye.

362
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:31,955
-I really should go.
-Okay.

363
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:33,998
Let me go now.

364
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:36,167
Bye.

365
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:40,797
As if we were trying to replace
all our bad memories with good ones.

366
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:45,969
Like a religion, we had a blind faith
that we had to be together

367
00:30:46,052 --> 00:30:47,637
when we were in love.

368
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:51,975
We were so passionately in love.

369
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:56,938
What?

370
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:58,898
We're dating now.

371
00:31:00,483 --> 00:31:02,610
-I'm Woo-yeon's boyfriend now.
-Congratulations.

372
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:04,904
I've never even imagined this.

373
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:07,323
I didn't want to imagine it.

374
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:09,367
But I did expect it.

375
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:11,703
What? You knew about it?

376
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:15,331
-Why are you so calm? Did you know too?
-You're the only one who didn't know.

377
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:17,584
-Where's Yeong-hui?
-She has something to do.

378
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:20,211
Oh, okay.

379
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:22,589
Hey. Come to your senses.
She's a man-eater.

380
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:24,299
I have objective evidence.

381
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:27,010
You punk. I can hear you, you know.

382
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:29,929
Oh, you heard me. I'm sorry.
Then I'll just say it.

383
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:32,932
-She dated 12 guys.
-It's 13.

384
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:36,269
She once took some relationship type test.

385
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:39,814
-What was it? A man-eater?
-Ludus. She sees love as a game.

386
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:43,693
Hey, think carefully. You might end up
just being another ex-boyfriend.

387
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:45,778
Hey, I can't take this anymore.

388
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:48,281
What do you know about my Woo-yeon?

389
00:31:48,364 --> 00:31:49,407
"My Woo-yeon?"

390
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:51,659
Your Woo-yeon could be
someone else's later.

391
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,453
-How dare you…
-This is a weapon.

392
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:56,915
-It can be an attempted murder.
-Hey! Why did you hit my boyfriend's hand?

393
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:58,207
Are you all right?

394
00:31:58,291 --> 00:32:00,793
-Did it hurt a lot?
-Yes, it did.

395
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:05,381
You're so crazy about a man
you even yell at me now.

396
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:07,216
Hey, you crazy wench.

397
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:10,386
Why are you yelling at her?
You're scaring my girlfriend.

398
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:13,431
Why are you yelling at her?
You're scaring her. She has ears too.

399
00:32:13,514 --> 00:32:15,516
Seriously, do you want to die?

400
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,602
Why are you grabbing him by the collar?

401
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:19,312
Why do you even care?

402
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:22,357
Is he your boyfriend or what?
Are you two dating?

403
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:25,443
Go on, then.

404
00:32:26,235 --> 00:32:27,904
-Hey.
-What's going on?

405
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:29,781
Look at you.

406
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:32,492
Go ahead. Do whatever you want, Woo-yeon.

407
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:35,078
You can kill me if you want. Come on.

408
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:37,455
What's going on?

409
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:39,499
What? Hang on.

410
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:41,834
I guess this is deja vu.

411
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:45,964
I think I tried to stop someone.

412
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:49,550
When did I do it for Woo-yeon?

413
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:51,177
You didn't do anything.

414
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:54,305
No. Don't disturb me.
I think I can remember it.

415
00:32:55,014 --> 00:32:56,307
Gosh, what was that?

416
00:32:58,017 --> 00:32:59,102
On Jun-su.

417
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:01,729
Oh, right.

418
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:07,819
Gosh, you deserve to get beaten up.

419
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:19,205
I'll give you back your umbrella.

420
00:33:19,288 --> 00:33:21,833
I guess you're trying
to settle all my excuses tonight.

421
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:25,211
When I don't have any excuses
but still want to see you.

422
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:28,297
I'll use the excuse then.

423
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:50,153
Hey.

424
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:52,947
Why are you so hung up on her?

425
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:55,992
She's a girl who abandoned you.
Just forget about her.

426
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:58,077
She's the girl I like.

427
00:33:58,911 --> 00:34:01,664
-What?
-She's not a girl who abandoned me.

428
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,250
She's the girl I like.

429
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,547
Is that your drinking habit?

430
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:12,759
Why don't you change
your job to a passionate lover?

431
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:15,136
What makes you so desperate?

432
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:19,557
-Can I get another glass of Absinthe?
-Hey!

433
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,059
Are you Gogh or Rimbaud?

434
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:23,436
Why are you drinking
so much strong liquor?

435
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:25,605
You might start
having hallucinations later.

436
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:27,899
I don't care if it's a hallucination.

437
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:30,485
Anything is fine.

438
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:33,446
I just want to see her.

439
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:39,494
I want to hear her voice.

440
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:54,926
Is this a hallucination?

441
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:57,762
Can I visit you tomorrow?

442
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:02,975
I don't think so.

443
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:18,491
Gosh, you seem so happy. Unbelievable.

444
00:35:21,744 --> 00:35:22,745
What?

445
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:25,748
I don't think I should drink more.

446
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,057
A HARMLESS PERSON

447
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,309
HOW I WISH LOVE WAS THAT EASY

448
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:49,105
I ordered your drink already.

449
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:52,275
You only drink iced Americano.

450
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:04,412
I thought I should return this.

451
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:10,585
That was my last excuse,
but you brought it back.

452
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,756
Are you seeing him now?

453
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:24,765
Your consideration hurts every time.

454
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:31,272
You can go. I'll stay here.

455
00:36:33,649 --> 00:36:35,318
Don't tell me not to.

456
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:37,987
My heart has a mind of its own.

457
00:36:38,946 --> 00:36:40,781
You know that better than anyone else.

458
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,997
-Mr. On.
-I won't put pressure on you.

459
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:52,293
I will just stay here

460
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:54,962
like this.

461
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:59,800
And when you need some comforting…

462
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:03,471
Or anything else. If you ever need me,

463
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:06,557
you can come back to me.

464
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:15,900
I know that whatever I say
is going to hurt you.

465
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:20,154
I'll save my breath.

466
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:23,699
And you save your heart.

467
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:30,289
If you give all your heart
to someone who won't accept it,

468
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:34,877
you won't have anything left
for the next person.

469
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,262
And you stop being considerate.

470
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:48,140
All your considerations

471
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:50,226
hurt me.

472
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:22,842
Do you believe in destiny?

473
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:27,096
I did it for ten years.
Is it that difficult for you?

474
00:38:31,892 --> 00:38:33,978
-We meet again.
-Hello.

475
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:34,979
I'm CEO On Jun-su.

476
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,691
I'll try my best with the photo book.

477
00:38:38,774 --> 00:38:40,526
I'll do a good job, so I don't get

478
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:43,237
the wrong idea about myself.

479
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:45,281
I like you.

480
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:46,824
I ruined it.

481
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:49,493
I'm sorry.

482
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:52,413
There are too many reasons
why I should like you.

483
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,291
But even when I think about those reasons,

484
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:00,504
I can't fall in love.

485
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:02,965
I guess he keeps getting new chances

486
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:07,345
even if he misses his chances.
I'm jealous of him.

487
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:11,098
Even if he keeps throwing away
his chances or trampling on my heart,

488
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:16,187
I keep finding myself wanting
to give him more chances.

489
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:21,901
So please let me stop feeling sorry.

490
00:39:39,251 --> 00:39:41,128
-This place looks pretty.
-Hello.

491
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:58,854
What is he doing there?

492
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:00,981
Who is he?

493
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:02,400
What?

494
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:04,068
Did you meet your ex or something?

495
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,617
I'm hungry. Let's go eat something else.

496
00:40:15,996 --> 00:40:17,581
-Hello.
-Hello.

497
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:23,045
We will have seafood pan-fried rice
and stir-fried noodles.

498
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:24,255
Okay. Is it to go?

499
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:25,714
-We'll eat here.
-Okay.

500
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:40,604
This is good.

501
00:40:41,188 --> 00:40:43,149
-It's addictive.
-I know.

502
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:48,737
Was he really your ex?

503
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:53,117
We just dated for a while.

504
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:57,663
For about a month or two.

505
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:00,291
Don't worry about it.

506
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:02,376
You don't have to explain. I don't mind.

507
00:41:04,336 --> 00:41:05,379
Aren't you jealous?

508
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:08,924
Jealousy, obsession, or restrictions.
I don't do things like that.

509
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:12,720
Good. That's a relief.

510
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:18,767
Eat up.

511
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:34,992
I'm home.

512
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:37,077
-You're home early.
-Yes.

513
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:39,121
-Did you eat?
-I did.

514
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:41,707
Do you see Yeong-hui these days?

515
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:46,170
I do, but I can't
bring myself to call her often.

516
00:41:46,253 --> 00:41:48,088
I'm afraid I'd be bothering her.

517
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:50,716
You should bother her from time to time.

518
00:41:50,799 --> 00:41:52,343
She'll keep thinking about it.

519
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:54,553
She shouldn't spend all day
thinking about it.

520
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:57,973
She needs to be bothered at times
so she can stop thinking.

521
00:41:58,057 --> 00:42:00,017
She needs to get
some fresh air to live on.

522
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:04,313
-Get some rest.
-Okay.

523
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:18,327
Kim Yeong-hui!

524
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:26,252
What are you doing here?

525
00:42:26,335 --> 00:42:27,503
Get in.

526
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:29,338
-What?
-Just get in the car.

527
00:42:31,006 --> 00:42:33,217
What is going on? Why are you driving?

528
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:38,222
I haven't driven for quite a while,
so my driving got a little rusty.

529
00:42:38,305 --> 00:42:39,682
And I wanted to see you.

530
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:43,602
So where are we going?

531
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:44,853
Where do you want to go?

532
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:48,107
-What?
-No. Don't say anything. Just trust me.

533
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:52,861
What?

534
00:42:56,907 --> 00:43:00,369
Am I bothering you
when you have to go see your mom?

535
00:43:01,495 --> 00:43:03,038
She has a caregiver.

536
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:05,457
And I go to see her
whenever I have time. It's okay.

537
00:43:06,875 --> 00:43:08,127
It's good to see you.

538
00:43:12,214 --> 00:43:14,258
I heard you're dating Su. How is it going?

539
00:43:15,467 --> 00:43:16,510
Well…

540
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:20,097
Everything is good.

541
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:25,644
Jealousy, obsession, or restrictions.
I don't do things like that.

542
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:27,688
And he has total faith in me.

543
00:43:28,522 --> 00:43:29,982
I miss you, Woo-yeon.

544
00:43:31,317 --> 00:43:32,651
Shall I go see you right now?

545
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:34,486
What?

546
00:43:36,238 --> 00:43:38,574
Gosh, I'm not wearing makeup.

547
00:43:39,241 --> 00:43:40,659
Then I'll see you tomorrow.

548
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:47,958
Right. We can meet tomorrow.

549
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:50,794
What are you doing?

550
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:54,298
Me? I'm just working.

551
00:43:54,381 --> 00:43:57,843
You must be busy.
I'll call you tomorrow, then.

552
00:43:57,926 --> 00:43:59,303
Goodnight.

553
00:43:59,386 --> 00:44:02,598
Okay. Goodnight.

554
00:44:02,681 --> 00:44:03,849
MY SU

555
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:06,935
His actions always speak
louder than his words.

556
00:44:12,566 --> 00:44:16,445
-Go inside.
-I don't have to go home right now.

557
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:18,322
It's late.

558
00:44:18,864 --> 00:44:20,532
All right. Go.

559
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:26,955
He doesn't want to be away from me
even for a moment.

560
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:34,672
Why did you hold out for so long
when you'd be happy together?

561
00:44:36,048 --> 00:44:38,425
I was afraid it would be
a temporary thing.

562
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:41,303
I was afraid he was only being jealous.

563
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:44,515
I was afraid he was
misunderstanding himself.

564
00:44:46,266 --> 00:44:49,436
Those feelings might seem
sincere for a moment,

565
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,938
but they won't last long.

566
00:44:52,439 --> 00:44:53,649
I'm still scared.

567
00:44:54,316 --> 00:44:55,651
Then why are you dating him?

568
00:44:57,319 --> 00:44:58,779
I don't want to waste more time.

569
00:44:59,738 --> 00:45:02,241
If it's hard whether I see him or not,

570
00:45:02,324 --> 00:45:04,535
I thought it would be better to date him.

571
00:45:06,328 --> 00:45:08,330
Instead of struggling the whole time,

572
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:10,416
I'd rather enjoy some happy moments.

573
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:14,920
We've already made a long detour.

574
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:19,007
I already feel bad
about the time we've wasted.

575
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:21,844
I don't want to waste any more.

576
00:45:24,263 --> 00:45:28,475
Woo-yeon, you're a grown-up
who knows how to love.

577
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:29,977
Of course.

578
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:31,228
You're all grown up.

579
00:45:33,313 --> 00:45:37,025
Woo-yeon said she sometimes feels
like time is flying

580
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:39,987
when she's with someone she loves.

581
00:45:41,447 --> 00:45:43,740
And she doesn't want
to waste any more time.

582
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:49,371
I didn't realize
what that feels like until recently.

583
00:45:51,331 --> 00:45:55,085
Mom's time was running out quickly.

584
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:01,383
Here.

585
00:46:03,302 --> 00:46:06,805
This is no big deal. I wonder
what took me so long to try this.

586
00:46:06,889 --> 00:46:09,725
I know. What took us so long to do this?
This is no big deal.

587
00:46:11,643 --> 00:46:13,020
Come to think of it,

588
00:46:13,687 --> 00:46:16,440
I wasn't such a good mom, right?

589
00:46:16,523 --> 00:46:17,983
Did you just realize it now?

590
00:46:18,066 --> 00:46:19,610
I've known the whole time.

591
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:22,988
But I regret it a lot now.

592
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:26,658
It's fine. You said
I wasn't a good daughter.

593
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:28,285
You were a good daughter.

594
00:46:29,995 --> 00:46:31,997
If I were you,

595
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:34,917
I would've already run away
from my poor family

596
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,418
and sick mother.

597
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:39,004
I have nowhere else to go anyway.

598
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:44,092
My doctor said

599
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:47,304
that chemotherapy makes

600
00:46:47,387 --> 00:46:48,972
even a saint fly into a rage.

601
00:46:51,016 --> 00:46:53,060
I guess I'll become an even worse mom now.

602
00:46:57,606 --> 00:46:59,441
Do you think I won't understand that?

603
00:47:02,736 --> 00:47:04,363
Don't try to understand me.

604
00:47:04,446 --> 00:47:06,990
If you understand me and I don't,
you'll get sick.

605
00:47:07,616 --> 00:47:09,701
So don't come to see me

606
00:47:09,785 --> 00:47:11,370
unless you really have to.

607
00:47:11,453 --> 00:47:13,997
What a nice thing to say.

608
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:15,582
I'm your guardian.

609
00:47:19,378 --> 00:47:23,298
It's really good
to be protected by someone.

610
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:26,009
But if it's your child,

611
00:47:26,718 --> 00:47:28,887
it's just like
sitting on pins and needles.

612
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:31,265
It's uncomfortable.

613
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:33,517
Just put up with it.

614
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:39,273
I want to be with you
even if it's uncomfortable.

615
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:46,697
Being affectionate isn't your thing.

616
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:48,490
That's because I take after you.

617
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:51,910
-Here's gimbap.
-Did you buy different kinds?

618
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:56,248
Hey, why did you not buy anchovy gimbap?

619
00:47:56,331 --> 00:47:58,166
I don't like anchovies.

620
00:47:58,917 --> 00:48:03,171
You are so weak and short
because you don't eat anchovies.

621
00:48:04,256 --> 00:48:07,718
My growth plates can hear you.
Why would you say that?

622
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:09,720
What?

623
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:12,472
What did you say?

624
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:15,767
It looks delicious.

625
00:48:16,351 --> 00:48:19,938
Do you feel lonely these days?
Why do you keep asking me out to dinner?

626
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:22,274
No reason.

627
00:48:24,484 --> 00:48:25,944
I just want to be with you.

628
00:48:34,911 --> 00:48:37,039
-Did you know Su is seeing someone?
-Really?

629
00:48:37,956 --> 00:48:40,125
Who? That girl?

630
00:48:40,208 --> 00:48:41,126
Yes.

631
00:48:42,294 --> 00:48:45,047
Good for him. Su seemed to like her a lot.

632
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:52,721
I had this resolution when I was with you.

633
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:57,059
And that kind of became my belief.

634
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:01,146
That's what I always told Su.

635
00:49:03,482 --> 00:49:06,068
But it turns out he's better than me.

636
00:49:06,151 --> 00:49:07,486
What is it you told him?

637
00:49:09,863 --> 00:49:11,323
I told him not to keep

638
00:49:13,158 --> 00:49:14,743
what he loves so much by his side.

639
00:49:15,744 --> 00:49:17,329
He says I was wrong.

640
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:20,207
He says if you love something,

641
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:23,585
you have to keep it with you.

642
00:49:27,964 --> 00:49:30,676
You're right. Su is better than you.

643
00:49:36,431 --> 00:49:37,849
Next time, shall we

644
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:40,852
watch a movie?

645
00:49:42,979 --> 00:49:45,816
It's just… You like movies.

646
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:49,277
And I haven't been to a theater
in a long time.

647
00:49:53,073 --> 00:49:55,450
Okay. We can do that.

648
00:50:42,247 --> 00:50:43,415
Gosh.

649
00:50:59,181 --> 00:51:00,348
What did you do today?

650
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:04,603
I went on a picnic with Mom and Cheol-su.

651
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:06,855
A picnic?

652
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:09,232
It was nothing big.

653
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:11,651
We just had some gimbap at a park.

654
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:14,529
Sounds good.

655
00:51:15,238 --> 00:51:18,366
I know. I should've done this sooner.

656
00:51:19,826 --> 00:51:22,579
It's not too late. It's okay.

657
00:51:25,999 --> 00:51:27,042
Right.

658
00:51:29,294 --> 00:51:31,880
What about you? What did you do today?

659
00:51:32,839 --> 00:51:34,341
I visited my parents too.

660
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:42,849
Do your parents know about my mom?

661
00:51:45,101 --> 00:51:45,977
What did they say?

662
00:51:46,561 --> 00:51:48,814
They're worried and feel sorry.

663
00:51:49,564 --> 00:51:51,608
And they said they feel bad for you.

664
00:51:53,693 --> 00:51:54,653
Is that it?

665
00:51:54,736 --> 00:51:57,155
Yes, that was all.

666
00:52:01,159 --> 00:52:02,452
I see.

667
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:08,291
Let's play a game. The one
who jumps higher can make a wish.

668
00:52:21,137 --> 00:52:22,430
I'll let you win.

669
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:26,434
Don't go too high. You might get hurt.

670
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:37,445
-Hang on a second.
-Okay.

671
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:43,910
Why does he want to drink with me?

672
00:52:44,578 --> 00:52:46,746
-Who is it?
-Su.

673
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:47,789
What?

674
00:52:59,968 --> 00:53:02,762
Did I make a mistake?

675
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:06,141
No, it's not like that.

676
00:53:07,142 --> 00:53:08,810
I just remembered something.

677
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:12,606
Is it okay where I hit you?

678
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:17,027
Yes. It's fine.

679
00:53:17,736 --> 00:53:20,697
Are you sure you're not upset?

680
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:24,367
Hey, did Woo-yeon hit you?

681
00:53:24,451 --> 00:53:26,661
Hey, where are your manners?

682
00:53:27,245 --> 00:53:29,289
Let me see. Where did she hit you?

683
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:32,417
I know because Woo-yeon hit me before.
She's really strong.

684
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:34,169
Let me see. I'll give you medicine.

685
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:38,924
What? You are not telling me.

686
00:53:39,007 --> 00:53:41,384
I bet it's somewhere private. Like your…

687
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:45,096
Hey.

688
00:53:46,306 --> 00:53:48,475
I'm right. She did hit you there.

689
00:53:50,226 --> 00:53:51,603
This is serious.

690
00:53:52,228 --> 00:53:54,814
What did you do to make her hit you there?

691
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:57,233
However angry they are,
people won't hit you there.

692
00:53:57,859 --> 00:53:59,069
Unless it's useless.

693
00:53:59,152 --> 00:54:01,112
Exactly. It was useless.

694
00:54:02,238 --> 00:54:03,156
Oh, dear.

695
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:05,784
-I'm going to kill you.
-Hey.

696
00:54:05,867 --> 00:54:06,910
Does Woo-yeon

697
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:11,498
want something like platonic love?

698
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:13,917
That's not the case for Woo-yeon.

699
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,418
She loves physical love.

700
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:17,712
When did you come here?

701
00:54:17,796 --> 00:54:20,006
That doesn't matter right now.
You got hit.

702
00:54:21,967 --> 00:54:23,343
How much did you hear?

703
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:25,845
So why did she hit you?

704
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:30,225
Darn it.

705
00:54:31,059 --> 00:54:33,645
All my underwear looks so lame.

706
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:37,649
I can't show him something like this.

707
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:42,654
I don't know why.

708
00:54:43,863 --> 00:54:44,990
Did she get sick of you?

709
00:54:45,073 --> 00:54:48,201
Hey, it hasn't been even a month.

710
00:54:48,284 --> 00:54:50,412
She doesn't have long-term relationships.

711
00:54:50,495 --> 00:54:52,580
There's something she used to say.

712
00:54:52,664 --> 00:54:55,458
She just refused to give up
because you didn't like her back.

713
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:58,545
That mindset is what made
her ten-year-long crush possible.

714
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:01,339
Is it not working anymore?

715
00:55:01,423 --> 00:55:03,091
No way. That can't be it.

716
00:55:03,174 --> 00:55:07,303
Hang on. Did she have
a crush on him for ten years?

717
00:55:08,596 --> 00:55:10,056
Did she say she loves you?

718
00:55:11,891 --> 00:55:14,561
-What?
-That's the best way to know.

719
00:55:14,644 --> 00:55:16,354
It's Woo-yeon's rule.

720
00:55:16,438 --> 00:55:19,357
She says she can't say "I love you"
when she doesn't mean it.

721
00:55:19,858 --> 00:55:21,234
She said that's her last rule.

722
00:55:25,905 --> 00:55:26,865
I love you.

723
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:31,453
I LOVE YOU

724
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:36,958
I love you.

725
00:55:56,061 --> 00:55:58,480
-Hello.
-Woo-yeon.

726
00:56:00,648 --> 00:56:01,941
Are you crying?

727
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:05,695
Did I do something wrong?

728
00:56:05,779 --> 00:56:08,740
What? What are you talking about?

729
00:56:08,823 --> 00:56:10,658
Tell me if I did anything wrong.

730
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:15,914
If you don't want to talk to me
when I'm drunk,

731
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:18,666
I'll write it down.

732
00:56:21,294 --> 00:56:24,047
If you tell me, I'll fix it.

733
00:56:25,298 --> 00:56:28,176
Woo-yeon. Come and pick up your boyfriend.

734
00:56:28,259 --> 00:56:29,928
He's so unreasonable like you.

735
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:32,263
Okay. I'll be right there.

736
00:56:41,689 --> 00:56:42,774
What is he doing?

737
00:56:49,989 --> 00:56:51,533
Did you make him drink?

738
00:56:51,616 --> 00:56:54,452
Why do you try to sell drinks
to your friend?

739
00:56:54,536 --> 00:56:57,747
Hey. Your boyfriend drank on his own.
He didn't force him.

740
00:56:58,581 --> 00:57:01,835
He said you don't seem to like him,
and you never said you loved him.

741
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:03,586
He was being such a jerk.

742
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:05,630
What? Did you call me?

743
00:57:07,632 --> 00:57:10,718
That poor thing.
He thinks that's his name.

744
00:57:12,595 --> 00:57:14,139
I thought it was like a pet name.

745
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:19,018
Hey, why did you kick his thing?
It's really important.

746
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:21,771
-It was just a defense mechanism.
-What?

747
00:57:28,611 --> 00:57:30,697
-I see.
-What? What is it?

748
00:57:34,576 --> 00:57:37,370
Then do you love Su?

749
00:57:38,413 --> 00:57:41,458
-Of course.
-Then you should tell him that.

750
00:57:41,541 --> 00:57:44,210
Mr. Jin, you keep crossing the line.

751
00:57:44,919 --> 00:57:46,004
Come on, carry him.

752
00:57:46,754 --> 00:57:48,965
If you want to boss me around,
don't complain.

753
00:57:49,048 --> 00:57:50,758
Let me see. My goodness.

754
00:57:50,842 --> 00:57:53,303
Help him up. Gosh.

755
00:58:20,371 --> 00:58:21,247
Woo-yeon.

756
00:58:23,374 --> 00:58:24,375
Yes?

757
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:26,586
Are you up?

758
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:29,923
Are you toying with me?

759
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:33,593
What?

760
00:58:34,552 --> 00:58:37,305
Why won't you say that you love me?

761
00:58:40,975 --> 00:58:43,561
And how many guys did you date?

762
00:58:49,067 --> 00:58:52,028
I don't want to be
just another ex-boyfriend.

763
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:04,791
I was too nervous to say it.

764
00:59:11,923 --> 00:59:13,049
I love you.

765
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:05,101
-Ta-da.
-Is it your new menu?

766
01:00:05,184 --> 01:00:07,020
A special menu only for Han Jin-ju.

767
01:00:08,896 --> 01:00:10,732
-What is it?
-I selected ingredients

768
01:00:10,815 --> 01:00:13,276
that are good for your health. Enjoy.

769
01:00:18,823 --> 01:00:19,782
Seriously, you are…

770
01:00:23,036 --> 01:00:24,120
Why are you doing this?

771
01:00:25,872 --> 01:00:28,416
I said I'd do my best to make you like me,

772
01:00:28,499 --> 01:00:30,501
but I don't know what to do.

773
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:34,547
So I'm just doing what I'm good at

774
01:00:35,965 --> 01:00:37,008
and what I like.

775
01:00:37,884 --> 01:00:41,763
What? Do you think things like this
will make me like you?

776
01:00:41,846 --> 01:00:43,222
You don't have to like me.

777
01:00:44,098 --> 01:00:48,603
I want you to know
what it means to be loved.

778
01:00:49,479 --> 01:00:52,273
Then you won't like
some random guy for no reason.

779
01:00:52,357 --> 01:00:55,860
And you will have high standards
and stop getting hurt.

780
01:00:56,569 --> 01:00:57,945
That's my goal.

781
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:00,323
I don't want you to get hurt.

782
01:01:04,118 --> 01:01:05,078
My gosh.

783
01:01:07,288 --> 01:01:08,539
See?

784
01:01:09,332 --> 01:01:11,000
I don't want you to get hurt.

785
01:01:27,642 --> 01:01:29,435
HYEON-JAE'S SISTER

786
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:34,816
Can I see you after work?

787
01:01:46,285 --> 01:01:48,371
Are you looking for anything?

788
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:50,123
Well…

789
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,128
Something very sexy.

790
01:01:56,129 --> 01:01:57,380
Okay. One second.

791
01:02:01,676 --> 01:02:02,844
What about this one?

792
01:02:03,428 --> 01:02:05,805
This is the best for a hot date.

793
01:02:05,888 --> 01:02:07,432
Gosh, I'm embarrassed.

794
01:02:09,809 --> 01:02:11,394
I'll take it.

795
01:02:11,477 --> 01:02:12,812
Okay. One second.

796
01:02:21,863 --> 01:02:24,782
What brings you all the way here?

797
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:28,870
I'll be honest with you.

798
01:02:28,953 --> 01:02:31,956
When someone starts talking
with the phrase "I'll be honest,"

799
01:02:32,039 --> 01:02:33,416
you should be on your guard.

800
01:02:33,499 --> 01:02:36,169
Let Hyeon-jae go.

801
01:02:36,252 --> 01:02:38,421
It means she'll hide behind the shield

802
01:02:39,255 --> 01:02:41,257
called honesty and hurt you.

803
01:02:47,889 --> 01:02:49,599
Please wait.

804
01:02:50,391 --> 01:02:51,350
Thank you.

805
01:03:12,038 --> 01:03:15,541
You just can't stop staring at me
because I'm pretty, right?

806
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:16,918
Pardon?

807
01:03:17,877 --> 01:03:20,838
It's okay. I'm pretty
so people can stare at me.

808
01:03:53,162 --> 01:03:54,539
I've missed you, Su.

809
01:03:55,665 --> 01:03:57,625
It's been a long time. Come on in.

810
01:04:03,798 --> 01:04:07,885
Maybe Su was right about his formula.

811
01:04:09,470 --> 01:04:11,138
The things I love so much

812
01:04:12,431 --> 01:04:14,183
end up hurting me.

813
01:04:16,352 --> 01:04:19,605
LUDUS LOVE

814
01:04:22,275 --> 01:04:26,237
"They don't like restrictions, but they
feel drawn to a certain degree of it."

815
01:04:27,363 --> 01:04:29,156
They don't like restrictions,

816
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:31,200
so when their partners
try to control them,

817
01:04:31,284 --> 01:04:33,870
they try to avoid the situation.

818
01:04:33,953 --> 01:04:36,205
If someone else shows up and seduces them,

819
01:04:36,289 --> 01:04:39,000
they will easily fall for the person.

820
01:04:39,584 --> 01:04:43,546
So if a Mania shows
their possessive instinct too strongly,

821
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:47,884
a Ludus will resist
and run away from them.

822
01:04:50,386 --> 01:04:51,304
Aren't you jealous?

823
01:04:51,387 --> 01:04:54,849
Jealousy, obsession, or restrictions.
I don't do things like that.

824
01:04:56,809 --> 01:04:58,644
Good. That's a relief.

825
01:05:10,114 --> 01:05:11,532
I miss you, Woo-yeon.

826
01:05:12,491 --> 01:05:14,744
Shall I go see you right now?

827
01:05:14,827 --> 01:05:15,870
What?

828
01:05:17,413 --> 01:05:19,373
Gosh, I'm not wearing makeup.

829
01:05:20,416 --> 01:05:21,834
Then I'll see you tomorrow.

830
01:05:25,546 --> 01:05:28,049
Right. We can meet tomorrow.

831
01:05:28,132 --> 01:05:29,342
What are you doing?

832
01:05:29,425 --> 01:05:32,762
Me? I'm just working.

833
01:05:32,845 --> 01:05:34,096
You must be busy.

834
01:05:35,139 --> 01:05:36,599
I'll call you tomorrow. then.

835
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:38,976
Goodnight.

836
01:05:50,154 --> 01:05:51,447
Goodnight, Woo-yeon.

837
01:05:57,912 --> 01:06:01,791
-Go inside.
-I don't have to go home right now.

838
01:06:02,375 --> 01:06:03,668
It's late.

839
01:06:04,210 --> 01:06:05,836
All right. Go.

840
01:06:20,685 --> 01:06:22,144
I don't want to send you home.

841
01:06:44,625 --> 01:06:47,044
Can a man and a woman be friends?

842
01:06:48,087 --> 01:06:49,839
When a man and a woman are just friends,

843
01:06:49,922 --> 01:06:51,048
they both have lovers,

844
01:06:51,132 --> 01:06:53,092
-or one is holding back.
-Is someone here?

845
01:06:53,175 --> 01:06:56,887
-Woo-yeon. Can I have your number?
-Why do you want my girlfriend's number?

846
01:06:56,971 --> 01:06:59,265
-Is Su's friend that pretty?
-Yes.

847
01:06:59,348 --> 01:07:01,392
-Who is he? Your boyfriend?
-No.

848
01:07:01,475 --> 01:07:02,643
A lunch delivery guy?

849
01:07:02,727 --> 01:07:03,936
-Yes.
-I'm her friend…

850
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:05,396
I'm sorry about earlier.

851
01:07:05,479 --> 01:07:07,023
It's okay. I won't go there again.

852
01:07:07,106 --> 01:07:08,399
I'm sorry for bothering you.

853
01:07:09,150 --> 01:07:11,819
Yu-ra is a model. I want to do
some commercial photography,

854
01:07:11,902 --> 01:07:13,446
so I met her to talk about work.

855
01:07:13,529 --> 01:07:14,447
Gyeong Woo-yeon?

856
01:07:15,823 --> 01:07:17,783
-Hello.
-I'm Kwon Yu-ra.

857
01:07:17,867 --> 01:07:18,993
Let's hang out together.

858
01:07:19,076 --> 01:07:21,287
Do you like Su by any chance?

859
01:07:21,370 --> 01:07:23,956
If you're asking
if I have feelings for him,

860
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:25,583
my answer is yes.

861
01:07:27,835 --> 01:07:32,840
