1
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:50,717
Did you buy earrings?

2
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,343
You're such a fool.

3
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:53,803
All of a sudden?

4
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:56,097
But I like you for that reason.

5
00:00:58,266 --> 00:01:01,770
Jjae-jae, I'll call you back later.
I love you.

6
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:04,230
-I love you more.
-Bye.

7
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:08,902
The ring will wear out
even before you propose to him.

8
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:15,158
Hyeon-jae has waited for too long.

9
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:18,620
I want to propose to him
since I kept rejecting him.

10
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:21,915
What a touching love story.

11
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:24,209
Why are you so twisted?

12
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:26,628
You're mocking my relationship
since yours is over.

13
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:30,256
I'm a good person
who made you a proposal card

14
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,509
even when my relationship just ended.

15
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:37,180
-Is it your exhibition tomorrow?
-Yes.

16
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:40,892
Are you sure you'll be okay?
Su and Mr. On will be there.

17
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:43,520
Why would I not be okay?
It's all over now.

18
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:47,232
-What's over?
-All three of us.

19
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:48,650
When?

20
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:50,568
I got over it long ago.

21
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:54,322
And I haven't heard from Mr. On and Su
since then. So it's over.

22
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:56,950
I'm not sure about Mr. On,
but Su said he'd wait.

23
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:58,785
He's selfish.

24
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:02,288
If he wanted to call me,
he wouldn't have held back.

25
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:04,666
It's over for him too.

26
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:09,754
How can you be sure of that?

27
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,882
-Because I understand.
-What?

28
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:15,468
I was just like him.

29
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:20,473
Someone who I thought would only love me
started dating someone else.

30
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:23,434
And he did things for someone else

31
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:26,396
that I thought he'd only do for me.

32
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:29,357
Seeing that made me feel jealous.
That's absurd.

33
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:34,279
You don't want him, but you don't want
anyone else to have him. Is that it?

34
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:39,576
It's just a short moment of jealousy.
Something like that.

35
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,327
So Su would feel the same way?

36
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:42,871
Yes.

37
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:48,334
Are you sure about yourself?

38
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,295
Do you not doubt yourself at all?

39
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:52,505
What do you mean?

40
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:55,174
You seem so sure about your feelings.

41
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:56,885
But is that really how you feel?

42
00:02:57,552 --> 00:03:00,263
Sometimes people misunderstand themselves.

43
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:03,266
Do you think it's possible
to understand others?

44
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:09,147
The moment you think
you understand someone.

45
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,608
Maybe that's when
a misunderstanding occurs.

46
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:31,002
Is there any particular reason
why each town has different typefaces?

47
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:34,255
Yes. While working
on the calligraphy photo book,

48
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:35,715
we visited 10 different places

49
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:39,636
and chose different themes
for each town and location.

50
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:43,681
Yeonnam-dong is a famous example
of gentrification.

51
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:46,476
We had the theme, "We Still Survive"
for this town.

52
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:49,896
And I expressed it with the letters
as if they are swept by the wind.

53
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:55,026
I'd like to know
what made you choose these towns.

54
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:57,320
Famous places in Seoul.

55
00:03:57,403 --> 00:04:00,949
Those places have a mixture
of travelers and residents.

56
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:05,370
For me who lived abroad for ten years,
Seoul is familiar yet strange,

57
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:07,205
and that's what makes it beautiful.

58
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:11,960
So I photographed Seoul,
a place of everyday life and travel.

59
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:27,141
Yes.

60
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:30,395
-Are you busy?
-No. Why?

61
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,699
-Well, Yeong-hui.
-Yes?

62
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:44,701
Well…

63
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:47,078
The thing is, I…

64
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:50,790
Mom, one moment.

65
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,042
Yes, honey.

66
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:55,837
Now?

67
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:58,756
Okay. Bye.

68
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:01,759
You were saying.

69
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:06,139
What? It's nothing.

70
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:09,392
-Was it Hyeon-jae?
-Yes. He's right outside.

71
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:10,893
I'll step outside for a minute.

72
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:12,895
Okay.

73
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:15,273
You seem to have something to say.

74
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:17,483
I said it's nothing.

75
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,862
I'll be right back, then.

76
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:24,866
You're being strange.

77
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,118
Go.

78
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:28,870
-See you.
-Bye.

79
00:05:37,336 --> 00:05:40,089
Why did you run? I don't want you to fall.

80
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:42,425
If I fall, you'll help me up.

81
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:45,970
-Do you trust me that much?
-Of course. Is it wrong to trust you?

82
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:53,770
You're never wrong.

83
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:55,772
I know.

84
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:00,943
What? Hang on.

85
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:05,823
-Give it to me.
-You're so quick-witted.

86
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:10,995
This is for you.

87
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,083
I love it.

88
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,502
I saw it in front of my place,
so I got it for you.

89
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:19,295
You love peanut bread.

90
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:22,298
That's so sweet.
Aren't you the sweetest thing?

91
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:24,133
I only do sweet things.

92
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,301
That's not true.

93
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:27,386
Let's go.

94
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,348
-Kim Yeong-hui.
-Yes?

95
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:33,392
-Are you eating it alone?
-Come quick.

96
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:00,461
He didn't have to ignore me like that.

97
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:03,381
He embarrassed me.

98
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,926
I wonder if the exhibition went well.

99
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:08,928
The exhibition went well.

100
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:11,264
I bet they'll start something else now.

101
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:13,850
Something else? What?

102
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:16,936
Love.

103
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:21,941
Oh. Sorry, I…

104
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,570
Why did you stop apologizing?

105
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:27,989
Just keep ignoring me.
Why are you talking to me?

106
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:29,490
I was flustered earlier.

107
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:31,534
I didn't know how to say hi.

108
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:33,786
I said I'd wait,

109
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,414
so I couldn't just show up
and pretend nothing happened.

110
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:38,082
I would end up hurting you again.

111
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:44,797
I guess you were disappointed
that I ignored you.

112
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:46,883
It's not like that.

113
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:52,638
Woo-yeon, let's eat together.
I'll buy you meat.

114
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:56,142
-I'm a vegetarian.
-What about salad, then?

115
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:59,145
-I'm a meatatarian.
-You just said you were a vegetarian.

116
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:01,689
I did. I have a split personality.

117
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,692
Then you should
ask your other personality.

118
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:07,612
Does she hate me too?
I bet at least one of you likes me.

119
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:12,783
There you are. Let's go eat.

120
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:15,912
-No. I'll…
-I made a reservation at a restaurant.

121
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:18,122
And the employees are waiting for you.

122
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:19,916
Let's go.

123
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:41,812
Do you not like the food?

124
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,357
I like it. It's good.

125
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:51,989
-You said you're a vegetarian.
-I have a split personality.

126
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:54,575
So what's the relationship
between you two?

127
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:59,163
There are only a few names
that define relationships,

128
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:00,665
and we share many of them.

129
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:03,918
They are friends from high school.

130
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:14,971
Mr. On is so caring.

131
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:16,931
He cares about every person we work with.

132
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:32,071
-See you tomorrow.
-See you.

133
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:34,949
Aren't you going home, Mr. On?

134
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:37,451
-You go on ahead.
-Okay. Bye.

135
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:42,957
I'll get going too.

136
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,376
-I'll take you home.
-I'll take you home.

137
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:52,008
No. I'll go by myself.

138
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:53,467
This doesn't mean anything.

139
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:57,096
I just want to thank you for the hard work

140
00:09:58,055 --> 00:09:58,973
you've done.

141
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:00,433
Not me.

142
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:07,690
Sorry about today.

143
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:11,485
I'm sorry.

144
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:24,373
Get in.

145
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:45,144
I'll get going, then.

146
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:46,687
Let's have a drink.

147
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:53,110
I don't think we're close enough
to drink together.

148
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:55,488
We even had a fistfight.
It's just a drink.

149
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,746
Go inside.

150
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,921
I don't want to let you go.

151
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:22,431
-What are you doing?
-Taking pictures of your back.

152
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,271
To stab me in the back?

153
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:30,981
Yes.

154
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:34,902
Look at you. You look so joyful
that I can't even hit you.

155
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:37,405
Will you hit me if I look sad?

156
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:40,491
I can never hit you if you look sad.
You know I'm tender-hearted.

157
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:43,619
Oh, right.

158
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,330
Look forward to your birthday.

159
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:48,791
-Go home.
-Okay.

160
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:59,635
I don't think we're close
enough to offer each other drinks.

161
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:02,054
All right, then.

162
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:05,724
I don't want to share anything
with you either.

163
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:07,810
So we are on the same page.

164
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,276
-Why are you beating a dead horse?
-Why are you being clingy?

165
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:16,944
What? Clingy?

166
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:20,030
Setting up an exhibition for a girl
who left you, making excuses

167
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:22,074
so she can't refuse. That's being clingy.

168
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:25,035
And why do you keep hitting on her
when she doesn't like you?

169
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:26,579
You're making her uncomfortable.

170
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:29,623
She may feel uncomfortable
because of my good looks.

171
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:32,501
That's why Woo-yeon liked me.

172
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:39,967
She doesn't like you anymore.
You're too young to live in the past.

173
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:43,262
I'm trying to figure out
if she's really over me.

174
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:49,977
She rejected you every time.
Didn't it hurt?

175
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:55,107
I don't mind getting hurt.

176
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,654
Because I hurt her more than she hurt me.

177
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:27,848
I just didn't know how much she liked me.

178
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:29,683
How can I love her when I don't know?

179
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:34,939
I just put up with everything
feeling anxious the whole time.

180
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:36,565
And she dumped me.

181
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:40,444
I mean, I'm not some pushover.

182
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:45,282
Tell me about it.
She's even meaner than I am.

183
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:49,370
I know. That's why you should give up.

184
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:53,123
What? Gosh, no.

185
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:55,000
You should give up on her.

186
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:58,170
A mean girl should date a mean guy

187
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:00,422
so a nice guy won't become a victim.

188
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:04,927
You're just too good for her.

189
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:09,890
No, that's not true. Listen, Su.

190
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:13,727
Let's say there's a mean girl here.

191
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:17,439
If she dates a mean guy… Watch.

192
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:22,695
One of them will get killed right away.
She will die just like this.

193
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:24,780
-All of a sudden?
-So?

194
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:28,534
So you'll keep liking Woo-yeon?

195
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:31,912
Of course! She'd better come back to me.

196
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:33,205
What are you going to do?

197
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:37,668
- I'll be really nice to her.
-Really nice?

198
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:40,462
I'll do everything I can for her.

199
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:45,050
I will even do things that I can't do.
You know what I mean?

200
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,929
Gosh, you sound so ambitious.

201
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:52,975
I can do so much more than you,

202
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:57,354
but she won't come to me.

203
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:07,781
Excuse me. Can we get some more soup here?

204
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:19,335
What?

205
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:25,007
Oh, it's Gyeong Woo-yeon.

206
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,342
What's wrong with you?

207
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,720
Is it because I'm drunk?

208
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:32,222
You look so pretty.

209
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,393
You look amazing.

210
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:42,107
Gosh, I'm drunk.

211
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:46,445
Hey, you're really drunk.
How did you get here?

212
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:50,783
I took a cab. I had to pay a lot
for the extra charge.

213
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:52,826
Good for you.

214
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:55,204
I'll call you a cab so you can go home.

215
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:58,749
You always tell me to go.

216
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:00,376
Are you going to stay over then?

217
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,045
I'll call you a cab,
so stop being silly and…

218
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:10,594
Woo-yeon.

219
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:15,224
Can't you like me again?

220
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:19,520
You can't just end it on your own.

221
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:45,629
What a nice dream.

222
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,911
-My goodness.
-I guess they're both up.

223
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,289
Why aren't you surprised?

224
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,624
I raised you. Nothing can surprise me now.

225
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:28,422
It's just funny how they
behave the same way.

226
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:33,719
It's all my fault.

227
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:38,098
I just held everything in,
so you must've found it frustrating.

228
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:41,727
If I knew I'd be so clingy,

229
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:45,230
I should have held onto you
no matter what.

230
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:49,276
I shouldn't have acted all cool like that.

231
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:53,363
I didn't really think that through.

232
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:56,784
-It was so silly of me.
-Mr. On!

233
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,375
I can't end things with you.

234
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:08,545
I don't think I can.

235
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:13,050
Hurry.

236
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:14,885
Gosh, turn around.

237
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:19,848
-Mr. On.
-My goodness.

238
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:23,227
-Honey.
-Put his head over there.

239
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,355
-I got it.
-Oh, dear.

240
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,315
My goodness.

241
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:32,444
Woo-yeon.

242
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:35,989
I can't end things with you.

243
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,367
I can't.

244
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:45,833
Woo-yeon.

245
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:49,586
Gyeong Woo-yeon!

246
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:54,591
Hey, hurry.

247
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:56,468
-My gosh.
-Darn it.

248
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:58,762
Gosh, I can't believe this. Be careful.

249
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:06,311
Are you all right, honey?

250
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:07,938
You… My gosh.

251
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:09,773
-Honey.
-Careful.

252
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:11,441
It's all your fault.

253
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:13,944
"I can't end things with you."

254
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:16,947
"Gyeong Woo-yeon." Gosh.

255
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:20,033
Go and bring them both.

256
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:22,494
Okay.

257
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:27,374
What are you doing here?

258
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,960
Why were you holding my hand?

259
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:33,213
Hey, you were the one who grabbed my hand.

260
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:36,925
Darn it.

261
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:39,011
Oh, this is Woo-yeon's blanket.

262
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:41,555
Gosh, this is Woo-yeon's bed.

263
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:54,443
So did you guys have a good sleep?

264
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:03,827
Come on out.

265
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:06,163
Eat something for a hangover.

266
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:07,998
Okay.

267
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,048
Help yourselves.

268
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:17,216
Thank you.

269
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:19,218
Go ahead and eat.

270
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,014
Do you like the food?

271
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:25,974
-Yes.
-Yes, it's good.

272
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,434
I'm glad.

273
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:31,438
Both of you are so handsome, by the way.

274
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:34,107
You look like a sculpture.

275
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:37,027
You're also very beautiful, ma'am.

276
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:41,990
Just when I was young. Aren't you sweet?

277
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,117
Here.

278
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:47,454
I apologize for last night.

279
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:49,915
I couldn't say hello
to you earlier properly.

280
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:53,543
I'm On Jun-su, the CEO
of Metaphor Publishing House

281
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:55,295
that published Woo-yeon's book.

282
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:58,090
Gosh, you are the CEO.

283
00:20:58,173 --> 00:20:59,967
I thought you looked somewhat wealthy.

284
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:03,345
Mom, can we just eat quietly?

285
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:04,930
You can eat quietly.

286
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:06,431
What about you?

287
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:08,934
I take photos. I'm a photographer.

288
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:11,270
I see. A photographer.

289
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:14,773
And what do your parents do?

290
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:16,149
Mom!

291
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:19,319
My father is an attorney,

292
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:21,488
and my mother is a painter.

293
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:23,156
An attorney and an artist?

294
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:25,784
That sounds amazing.

295
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:27,703
-Have some eggs.
-Okay.

296
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,539
My father runs his own business.

297
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:32,958
Like what?

298
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:36,128
It's Tomorrow N, a company
that focuses on textbooks and workbooks.

299
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:39,798
Isn't it the largest workbook company
in the country?

300
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:41,466
Really?

301
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:43,927
I guess so.

302
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:46,805
All right. Let's stop talking and…

303
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:48,432
Here. Go ahead and eat.

304
00:21:48,932 --> 00:21:51,727
So you are the CEO
of a publishing company.

305
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:54,730
What about you? How do you know Woo-yeon?

306
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:56,273
I'm her friend from high school.

307
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:58,108
I worked on her latest book with her.

308
00:21:58,191 --> 00:22:00,610
-You're her friend.
-Yes.

309
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:02,904
Then you must know the guy
who rejected Woo-yeon.

310
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:14,499
Mom, why are you bringing that up now?

311
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:17,669
I'm so pissed whenever I think about him.

312
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:19,504
If you have his address, just tell me.

313
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:22,924
I'll go there and break his legs.

314
00:22:28,346 --> 00:22:31,308
-I don't know…
-I think she's talking about you.

315
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:32,350
What?

316
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:37,814
I'm sorry. It just came out.

317
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:51,578
-Dad.
-Why are you rolling your sleeves up?

318
00:22:57,542 --> 00:23:00,378
Is it you? Are you the one
who made my daughter cry?

319
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:04,341
Please wait, sir. Please calm down.

320
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:07,260
-Gosh, honey.
-Dad.

321
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:09,012
Get out of my house!

322
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,863
I got kicked out because of you.

323
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:29,533
Get the facts straight.
I got kicked out because of you.

324
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:31,660
It was because you told them about me.

325
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:34,079
You should've behaved yourself
to begin with.

326
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:35,080
Enough.

327
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:37,290
Will you please stop?

328
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:39,042
You always cut in when it's my turn.

329
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:41,962
You both said your pieces once.
Your turn is over.

330
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:46,383
And why are you being like this, Mr. On?

331
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:49,928
I thought you were a grown-up.
You always sounded so mature and kind.

332
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:51,471
Why are you acting like him?

333
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:53,181
Hey. What did I do?

334
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:55,267
Will you shut it, you baby?

335
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,692
I let it slide last night
because you two were totally wasted.

336
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:06,403
This better be the last time.

337
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,240
Or else I'll just send you off
in an ambulance or a patrol car.

338
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,452
-Woo-yeon.
-Woo-yeon.

339
00:24:22,085 --> 00:24:25,463
So is this your friends' exhibition?

340
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:26,631
Yes.

341
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:29,926
My best friend is the calligrapher.

342
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:33,096
And the photographer is
my least favorite friend.

343
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:36,308
It's like Love and War.

344
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,562
What?

345
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:41,646
Hey.

346
00:24:49,487 --> 00:24:50,864
What are you doing here?

347
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:53,366
I was hungry.

348
00:24:57,579 --> 00:25:00,332
He's just a friend who happens
to be a man. Don't mind him.

349
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:03,501
Just a friend.

350
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:05,629
Okay.

351
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:19,476
No, honey. I really don't
have any feelings for her.

352
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:21,102
It's just business.

353
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:24,981
Yes. She's just a pushover
with a lot of money.

354
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:27,359
She just buys me everything I want.

355
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:31,446
Of course. You're my everything…

356
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:33,490
MY SWEETIE

357
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:35,867
Hello? Honey.

358
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:43,250
MY SWEETIE

359
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:45,293
Gosh, look at you.

360
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:48,880
Are you this girl's father or boyfriend?

361
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:50,465
It's not like that.

362
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:54,261
It's a misunderstanding. I can explain.

363
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:55,637
How dare you…

364
00:25:57,681 --> 00:26:00,308
Where did Jin-ju pick up
a scumbag like him?

365
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:04,354
-Hey, you.
-Yes?

366
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:08,441
End things well with Jin-ju
so she won't get hurt.

367
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:15,115
-By telling her the truth?
-No. Are you kidding me?

368
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:20,662
Just say things are tough now.

369
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,041
And she's just too good for you.

370
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:29,254
Just make things up like,
"I'm sorry that I'm not a good guy."

371
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:34,009
You used your brain well to hit on her.
Why can't you do the same?

372
00:26:35,343 --> 00:26:37,304
Okay. I get it.

373
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:42,267
Darn you.

374
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:05,999
My friend just left. He said
something urgent came up.

375
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:07,500
Oh, okay.

376
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:10,879
Shall we go to a cafe?

377
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:16,009
Jin-ju, I have something to say.

378
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:17,469
Something to say?

379
00:27:20,263 --> 00:27:21,806
He broke up with me.

380
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:25,101
-Why?
-He says things are tough.

381
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:27,479
And I'm too good for him

382
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,939
that he doesn't deserve me.

383
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:34,736
And he says he's sorry that he's not

384
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:37,155
a better man.

385
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:39,741
-What a jerk.
-He is a jerk.

386
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:41,785
So he wants a beautiful goodbye.

387
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:43,995
He doesn't want to be the bad guy.

388
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:45,705
-What a jerk.
-What a jerk.

389
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:47,999
Why

390
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:49,959
are you badmouthing him?

391
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:54,297
What did Jun-yeong do wrong?

392
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:56,758
You crazy wench.

393
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:01,513
Leave her be. You shouldn't mess
with someone crazy.

394
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:07,310
Just drink from the bottle.

395
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:09,312
Okay.

396
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:15,985
What is going on? It feels
somewhat familiar but ominous.

397
00:28:18,154 --> 00:28:19,239
Are you sleeping?

398
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:24,911
It's all my fault.

399
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:27,163
The receiver cannot be reached.

400
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:30,208
You will be directed to voicemail.

401
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:33,002
Just pick up the phone.

402
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:34,796
Answer it just this once.

403
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:40,927
I'll try to be less good for you.

404
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:45,890
I will be stupid for you.

405
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:48,226
She seems stupid enough already.

406
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:52,397
How does it feel to watch it sober?

407
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:55,483
Was I like that too?

408
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,193
You were even worse.

409
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:02,991
You left a message. Thank you.

410
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,954
He really is of no use in my life.

411
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:17,005
-Please enjoy.
-Thank you.

412
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:22,010
One iced Americano.

413
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:24,721
It's 4,100 won.

414
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:27,140
How many coupons
do I need to get one for free?

415
00:29:27,223 --> 00:29:28,600
It's ten, sir.

416
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:30,310
I'll come just until I get ten.

417
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:39,444
I'll buy you one. Don't use
coupons as your excuse.

418
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:48,620
Okay. I'll come again
for free coffee tomorrow then.

419
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,458
What are you up to?
You've been quiet for a month.

420
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:57,003
-You didn't call me when I was quiet.
-I didn't call you for a reason.

421
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:01,257
Why did you like me?

422
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:05,470
-Do you want to argue with me?
-It's a question. Tell me.

423
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:07,597
I want to give off that charm again.

424
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:10,099
Don't.

425
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:12,268
Why do you always say that?

426
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:13,978
Is there anything I can do?

427
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:15,814
Sure.

428
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:16,856
Leave.

429
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:27,200
Talk to the marketing team
about product placements.

430
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:29,035
Okay.

431
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:34,415
What's this?

432
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:37,669
That's our new calligraphy photo book.

433
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:43,007
Can I meet with this calligrapher?

434
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:44,175
Why?

435
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:46,386
For the title of my new drama.

436
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:48,096
I was looking for a calligrapher.

437
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:50,807
I want her to work on the title.

438
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:56,813
-I'm off now.
-Okay. Bye.

439
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:20,378
My close friend is the CEO
of a drama production.

440
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:21,713
He saw your calligraphy

441
00:31:21,796 --> 00:31:24,090
and wanted you to work
on his new drama title.

442
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:27,260
-Is this…
-I assure you it's not like that.

443
00:31:27,343 --> 00:31:28,303
I didn't ask him.

444
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:32,640
-Are you a mind reader?
-I wish I could read your mind.

445
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:35,435
So I can tell what you're thinking.

446
00:31:39,814 --> 00:31:42,358
I hope there will be
another coincidental excuse.

447
00:31:45,528 --> 00:31:47,280
Gosh, what are they talking about?

448
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:54,746
I hope this is the last excuse.

449
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,375
You broke up with me on your own,

450
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:01,377
so I was frustrated, upset, and furious.

451
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:03,338
But in the end,

452
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:06,424
I missed you.

453
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:10,678
I thought about begging you
for a whole month

454
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:14,223
and forcing you to stay with me
by using your guilt.

455
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:16,142
I thought about all sorts of things,

456
00:32:16,225 --> 00:32:18,353
but I didn't want to give you a hard time.

457
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:20,772
So this is what I've come up with.

458
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:22,565
So…

459
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:25,109
let me do this.

460
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:35,787
Even if I offer you a ride, you will
say no. So I'll just get going.

461
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:37,538
See you again.

462
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:52,804
What did he say?

463
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:55,056
You couldn't hear it
with your good hearing?

464
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:56,683
I was too far away.

465
00:32:57,266 --> 00:32:58,476
What did he say this time?

466
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,603
Why are you being so nosy?

467
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:02,230
It's not like we are strangers.

468
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:03,815
You're not my boyfriend, either.

469
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:06,109
I'm being like this to be one.

470
00:33:09,737 --> 00:33:11,322
What did you do for ten years?

471
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:14,033
Why are you being like this
after all these years?

472
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:19,872
I regret realizing my feelings too late.

473
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:22,458
I guess I probably

474
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:24,585
liked you back then.

475
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,337
Don't manipulate your memories.

476
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:27,547
I'm serious.

477
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:30,842
I just didn't realize it
when I started liking you.

478
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:39,434
If I made forks for ten years,
I would have become a master by now.

479
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,147
But all I did for ten years
was have a crush on you.

480
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:47,275
So all I have left are wounds.

481
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:08,337
I'm home.

482
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:12,759
Mom, are you home?

483
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:20,933
Mom.

484
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:23,644
Mom!

485
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:26,147
Mom.

486
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,815
Wake up, Mom.

487
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:29,442
Mom.

488
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:48,795
You're in a hospital.

489
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:51,255
You passed out in the bathroom.

490
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:04,519
I'll go get the nurse.

491
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:25,748
She has stage three stomach cancer.

492
00:35:26,332 --> 00:35:28,543
The patient is
well aware of her condition.

493
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:31,921
And she refused the surgery.

494
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:35,383
She must have been in so much pain.
Didn't you know?

495
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:38,344
I didn't know.

496
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:41,013
Whether it's surgery or chemo,
we need to do something.

497
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:46,561
Can she survive after surgery?

498
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:50,231
Survival depends on whether a relapse
occurs within the next five years.

499
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:52,191
And it's between 25 and 60 percent.

500
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:56,279
Between 40 and 75 percent…

501
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,575
So she's more likely
to die than to survive.

502
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,743
I can't deny that.

503
00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:24,932
The medical examination costs a lot.

504
00:36:26,058 --> 00:36:30,021
Those who don't have money
would die even without knowing why.

505
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:33,149
Do you want to talk about money now?

506
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,776
They say poverty is the mother of crime.

507
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:39,906
The first thing I worried about was money.

508
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:43,576
But at least I have insurance.

509
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:46,287
Think about your dad.

510
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,998
He fell sick after he surrendered
his insurance contract.

511
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:51,709
He gave us such a hard time.

512
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:53,794
What do your children mean to you?

513
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:58,758
Even after thinking about money

514
00:36:58,841 --> 00:37:01,427
and insurance,
did you not think of us at all?

515
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:08,059
Of course I did. You're my children.

516
00:37:12,271 --> 00:37:14,023
Then why did you not tell me?

517
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:16,192
Why won't you get the surgery?

518
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:18,444
It would have only broken your hearts.

519
00:37:18,527 --> 00:37:21,739
And I will have to spend years
lying in bed after the surgery.

520
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:22,698
How would I feel?

521
00:37:24,116 --> 00:37:27,745
I know what it is like to have
a patient in a poor family.

522
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:28,955
It's just better to die.

523
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:34,502
That's why I told you not to skip meals.

524
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:35,878
I told you to stop drinking

525
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:38,422
and eating food
that passed the expiry date.

526
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:42,343
Why did you not listen to me?

527
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:45,346
Why do you not listen to me at all?

528
00:37:47,723 --> 00:37:49,183
And did you ever listen to me?

529
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:55,690
You know what?
You weren't a good daughter.

530
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:15,918
Mom, I'm sorry for everything.

531
00:38:19,046 --> 00:38:21,674
Mom, don't die.

532
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:26,595
Don't make me an orphan.

533
00:38:32,184 --> 00:38:35,855
Mom, I'm really sorry. It's all my fault.

534
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:39,275
I'm sorry.

535
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:42,611
Mom, I'm sorry.

536
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:46,073
Mom, please.

537
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:51,370
Please don't die.

538
00:39:05,384 --> 00:39:08,346
These are the scripts and synopses
that you asked for.

539
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:11,223
I'm sorry for all the trouble.

540
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:13,976
I thought I needed to know
the story and mood of the drama.

541
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:18,606
No worries. I believe it will bring out
good results, so I'm excited.

542
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:26,072
Well, if you don't mind,

543
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:29,325
can I ask why you chose me?

544
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:31,202
I just liked your work.

545
00:39:32,661 --> 00:39:34,080
Isn't it usually like that?

546
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:36,457
We just like things for no reason.

547
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:41,087
Do you have any plans for this Saturday?

548
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:43,047
No, I don't.

549
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:44,799
Then can we have a meal together?

550
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:47,009
Okay. I'd love to.

551
00:39:56,185 --> 00:39:59,188
This stop is Myeongnyun-dong 2-ga,

552
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:01,273
Sungkyunkwan University.

553
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:10,032
All right.

554
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:13,536
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

555
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:16,622
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

556
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:20,918
Happy birthday dear Hyeon-jae

557
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:24,171
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

558
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:33,013
-Happy birthday.
-Thank you.

559
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:36,225
Hey! Go away.

560
00:40:36,308 --> 00:40:38,686
I can't do this. Go.

561
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:41,814
Gosh, stop it. I just can't do this.

562
00:40:48,654 --> 00:40:50,114
Right, let's stop.

563
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:53,659
No more.

564
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:55,578
That's enough.

565
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:59,331
That's enough, okay?

566
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:03,627
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT

567
00:41:15,681 --> 00:41:17,016
I was flustered earlier.

568
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:21,395
I said I'd wait, so I couldn't just
show up and pretend nothing happened.

569
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:23,522
I would end up hurting you again.

570
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:25,107
Woo-yeon.

571
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:28,736
Can't you like me again?

572
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,738
I regret

573
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:33,616
realizing my feelings too late.
I'm serious.

574
00:41:34,408 --> 00:41:36,785
I just didn't realize it
when I started liking you.

575
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:39,830
But all I did for ten years
was have a crush on you.

576
00:41:40,414 --> 00:41:41,999
So all I have left are wounds.

577
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:53,552
I'm CEO Kim Han-su of HS Pictures.

578
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:55,179
I'll see you on Saturday at six.

579
00:41:55,262 --> 00:41:57,097
Attached is the map to the restaurant.

580
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:00,434
Okay. I'll see you then.

581
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:41,100
It's past midnight,
so it's not my birthday.

582
00:42:43,435 --> 00:42:45,521
You don't have to worry
about my feelings now.

583
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:52,736
Yeong-hui.

584
00:42:54,446 --> 00:42:57,199
Look at me. Okay?

585
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:06,625
So something really is wrong.

586
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:10,963
There's always something wrong.

587
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:14,550
I'm used to that now.

588
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:19,638
But this is just too much.

589
00:43:28,188 --> 00:43:29,565
My mom…

590
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:32,693
is sick.

591
00:43:34,403 --> 00:43:35,362
It's cancer.

592
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:37,573
Stomach cancer.

593
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:51,920
It's okay.

594
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:55,924
It will be okay, Yeong-hui.

595
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:01,764
Is it really okay?

596
00:44:02,348 --> 00:44:03,390
Sure.

597
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:05,684
Everything is okay.

598
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:08,103
I'm asking about you.

599
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:16,195
I'm poor.

600
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:18,906
I lost my dad when I was young.

601
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:21,742
I have a brother to support.

602
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:27,623
And now mom is sick.

603
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:30,709
Are you

604
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:33,545
really okay with all that?

605
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:36,006
Can you

606
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:39,134
understand my situation?

607
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:45,015
Yes.

608
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:47,393
It's okay.

609
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:50,145
I can understand.

610
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:56,568
I know his hasty answer is
just a misunderstanding or arrogance,

611
00:44:57,403 --> 00:44:59,696
but I don't want to correct it.

612
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:05,577
I just wanted

613
00:45:06,453 --> 00:45:10,749
to let Hyeon-jae
misunderstand himself for a long time.

614
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:40,571
Hello, Dad.

615
00:45:40,654 --> 00:45:41,780
Are you coming later?

616
00:45:42,739 --> 00:45:45,701
It's a question. Do I have a choice?

617
00:45:45,784 --> 00:45:48,871
Don't be late.
And don't come empty-handed.

618
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:54,626
You said you'd be nice to me.

619
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:12,644
The receiver cannot…

620
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:13,770
Darn it.

621
00:46:14,813 --> 00:46:16,482
Hey, that's enough.

622
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:19,485
Why would you pine over someone like him?
You're too good for him.

623
00:46:19,568 --> 00:46:20,944
You know nothing.

624
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:24,198
Something is off.

625
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:27,451
He won't answer my calls.
And he quit the cafe, too.

626
00:46:27,534 --> 00:46:29,453
I'm sure something happened to him.

627
00:46:29,536 --> 00:46:31,371
Why? If you're that worried,

628
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:33,499
go to his place
or put a notice in the paper.

629
00:46:34,374 --> 00:46:35,751
Just get over him.

630
00:46:36,251 --> 00:46:38,545
There are loads of men out there.
Find another…

631
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:39,671
I found it.

632
00:46:40,297 --> 00:46:41,757
You found one already?

633
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:44,384
Where are you going?

634
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:46,595
-Jun-yeong's place.
-You know where he lives?

635
00:46:46,678 --> 00:46:48,889
I sent a package to his place before.

636
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:50,891
Gosh, what did you send?

637
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:53,894
This is it, right?

638
00:46:57,397 --> 00:46:58,774
Put in the address yourself.

639
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:02,778
You don't have to do this.

640
00:47:02,861 --> 00:47:05,781
Really? All right, then…

641
00:47:05,864 --> 00:47:09,243
But since you want to give it to me…

642
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:24,174
What? That jerk!

643
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:29,304
Gosh. Oh, no.

644
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:34,268
Are you all right? I'm so sorry.

645
00:47:34,351 --> 00:47:36,103
Do you want me to kneel or something?

646
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:47,447
Shouldn't you be working?

647
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:50,075
I told you not to come.
Why did you follow me here?

648
00:47:50,158 --> 00:47:52,077
I told you not to go, but you came here!

649
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:53,620
You're so ridiculous!

650
00:47:56,957 --> 00:47:58,041
Don't go.

651
00:48:00,669 --> 00:48:02,087
Don't see him.

652
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:09,094
I don't want you to see him.

653
00:48:17,811 --> 00:48:20,063
Do you want another slap with a dishcloth?

654
00:48:32,534 --> 00:48:35,329
I guess it's all about the looks,
not the situation.

655
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:42,669
I have a reservation under Kim Han-su.

656
00:48:43,462 --> 00:48:45,339
It's the table by the window.

657
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:46,590
Thank you.

658
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:48,175
Woo-yeon?

659
00:48:51,803 --> 00:48:53,889
What are you doing here?

660
00:48:53,972 --> 00:48:55,432
It's my mom's birthday. You?

661
00:48:56,016 --> 00:48:57,434
I'm having dinner with someone.

662
00:49:01,063 --> 00:49:02,314
Will you say hello to them?

663
00:49:02,397 --> 00:49:03,899
-No, I'm…
-Let's go.

664
00:49:15,994 --> 00:49:17,079
They are my parents.

665
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:19,956
Hello, I'm Gyeong Woo-yeon.

666
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:22,793
Nice to meet you.

667
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:26,213
Nice to meet you.

668
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:27,464
Who is she?

669
00:49:28,423 --> 00:49:30,801
-I'm his friend…
-The girl I like.

670
00:49:41,353 --> 00:49:42,813
Did she come with you?

671
00:49:42,896 --> 00:49:46,692
No. I'm here to meet someone.
I just ran into him here.

672
00:49:46,775 --> 00:49:51,113
Okay. You should go then.
We can't keep you here for long.

673
00:49:51,196 --> 00:49:52,739
I'll see you around then.

674
00:49:53,573 --> 00:49:54,866
Happy birthday, ma'am.

675
00:49:55,951 --> 00:49:56,910
Thank you.

676
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:11,967
You said she rejected you.
Are you two dating now?

677
00:50:13,051 --> 00:50:14,428
We will soon.

678
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:24,521
I guess you're mistaken.

679
00:50:35,323 --> 00:50:36,491
What are you doing here?

680
00:50:36,575 --> 00:50:39,828
I asked Han-su to do this
so I can have dinner with you.

681
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:43,582
Was I being too cowardly?

682
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:03,894
You two have a lot of coincidences.

683
00:51:03,977 --> 00:51:06,396
And they are mostly because of you.

684
00:51:07,939 --> 00:51:09,316
I guess it's my fault.

685
00:51:11,693 --> 00:51:13,236
I'll get going.

686
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,655
I think they saw me.

687
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:18,909
If you leave like this,
it will make me look pathetic.

688
00:51:26,166 --> 00:51:29,669
I won't make you look pathetic in any way.

689
00:51:30,879 --> 00:51:32,547
It is a matter of courtesy.

690
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:35,634
He's finally doing me good today.

691
00:51:36,343 --> 00:51:37,552
What do you want to eat?

692
00:51:48,021 --> 00:51:51,149
-Let's just go.
-Why are you being like this?

693
00:51:51,233 --> 00:51:53,527
-Just go.
-Just wait in the car.

694
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:56,655
-Listen to me, just this once.
-Will you just go?

695
00:52:06,164 --> 00:52:07,165
Jin-ju.

696
00:52:08,583 --> 00:52:11,002
You didn't answer my calls.

697
00:52:11,711 --> 00:52:12,754
Who is she?

698
00:52:14,172 --> 00:52:15,465
Well…

699
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:17,884
Jun-yeong, who is she?

700
00:52:18,593 --> 00:52:19,845
Well…

701
00:52:19,928 --> 00:52:22,180
Why do you keep
repeating yourself like a parrot?

702
00:52:22,264 --> 00:52:25,308
I see. Is she the pushover
with a lot of money?

703
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:27,769
What is she doing at your place?

704
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:30,772
You said it was business.

705
00:52:30,856 --> 00:52:33,733
You met her just because
she bought you everything you wanted.

706
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:36,987
-You said it was over.
-It is over.

707
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:39,197
You know you're the only one I love.

708
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:41,032
My gosh.

709
00:52:41,116 --> 00:52:42,826
That scumbag…

710
00:52:50,542 --> 00:52:53,461
A pushover with money? Business?

711
00:52:53,545 --> 00:52:56,590
Is your business sponging off a girl,
you gold digger?

712
00:52:56,673 --> 00:52:59,426
-Did you just hit me?
-Yes, I did. So what?

713
00:52:59,509 --> 00:53:01,219
Will you sue me? Go ahead and sue me.

714
00:53:02,095 --> 00:53:04,764
I guess I was born in a rich family
for this very moment.

715
00:53:05,515 --> 00:53:07,601
Fine, Come here.

716
00:53:07,684 --> 00:53:10,645
-Come here. You…
-Gosh, no!

717
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:13,064
You said picking this up
can be attempted murder.

718
00:53:13,148 --> 00:53:14,149
You startled me.

719
00:53:16,109 --> 00:53:17,068
You think?

720
00:53:19,112 --> 00:53:22,532
Damn it! I've had enough of this.

721
00:53:23,116 --> 00:53:24,618
Gosh, are you all right?

722
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:26,119
Let me see. Are you hurt?

723
00:53:26,202 --> 00:53:27,746
Hey. You were so stupid.

724
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:30,040
-When did I ask you to buy…
-You jerk!

725
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:35,670
Be a man and feel ashamed
of yourself for sponging off a girl.

726
00:53:35,754 --> 00:53:37,422
How can you act so confident?

727
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:39,049
How can you do this?

728
00:53:39,132 --> 00:53:41,885
I'm going to sue you.

729
00:53:41,968 --> 00:53:44,262
-I'll sue both of you!
-Go ahead and sue us.

730
00:53:44,346 --> 00:53:45,931
I'd love to see that happen.

731
00:53:53,855 --> 00:53:56,816
Make sure to sue me. I'll wait.

732
00:54:00,779 --> 00:54:03,615
So are you really an SNU student?

733
00:54:06,576 --> 00:54:08,995
Tell the truth. I can find out right away.

734
00:54:09,579 --> 00:54:10,580
No.

735
00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:12,540
Okay.

736
00:54:50,245 --> 00:54:52,205
Are you crying?

737
00:55:38,126 --> 00:55:39,878
Does he bother you that much?

738
00:55:40,837 --> 00:55:41,755
Yes.

739
00:55:43,506 --> 00:55:45,258
Someone who shakes up your life.

740
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:49,345
It's not common to meet someone like that.

741
00:55:50,138 --> 00:55:51,806
I admit it's really special.

742
00:55:52,766 --> 00:55:56,227
But if things didn't work out for 10
years, you're not meant to be with him.

743
00:55:57,312 --> 00:56:00,523
You feel sad without him
and painful when he's around.

744
00:56:01,608 --> 00:56:04,694
He's not good for you, Woo-yeon.

745
00:56:10,533 --> 00:56:12,160
It's okay to like someone else.

746
00:56:13,495 --> 00:56:16,831
But if you can't love anyone else
because of your feelings for him,

747
00:56:16,915 --> 00:56:18,166
just stay with me.

748
00:56:19,334 --> 00:56:20,835
It's not that you hate me.

749
00:56:24,005 --> 00:56:25,173
That's

750
00:56:26,466 --> 00:56:28,968
-not love.
-There's love like this.

751
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:34,849
I will give you everything you want
and do things even before you ask.

752
00:56:35,725 --> 00:56:38,728
I don't mind becoming someone
you are grateful to.

753
00:56:39,979 --> 00:56:41,648
That's a kind of relationship, too.

754
00:56:49,906 --> 00:56:51,116
It's like a deal.

755
00:56:53,451 --> 00:56:54,536
An exchange of value.

756
00:56:56,663 --> 00:56:57,789
You're right.

757
00:56:58,915 --> 00:57:00,959
That's how relationships
and marriages work.

758
00:57:03,628 --> 00:57:04,838
But you know what?

759
00:57:06,214 --> 00:57:10,051
I'm still too young and naive
to have a relationship like that.

760
00:57:11,803 --> 00:57:13,847
I'm partly brave,

761
00:57:14,389 --> 00:57:16,433
and partly passionate.

762
00:57:17,475 --> 00:57:18,560
That's who I am.

763
00:57:21,563 --> 00:57:23,189
So I can't do

764
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:26,234
something like that.

765
00:57:34,742 --> 00:57:36,119
Will you stop crying?

766
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:41,207
You said you'd meet
Gang Dong-won and Lee Min-ho.

767
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:43,334
You studied hard to become a prosecutor.

768
00:57:43,418 --> 00:57:46,087
A smart girl like you
deserves a guy like you.

769
00:57:46,171 --> 00:57:48,798
Why are you crying over
a stupid jerk like him?

770
00:57:50,175 --> 00:57:52,218
I'm crying because I'm embarrassed.

771
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:55,930
I'm a prosecutor who went
to Seoul National University,

772
00:57:56,014 --> 00:57:58,683
so I'm really humiliated
that I fell for a fraud like him.

773
00:57:58,766 --> 00:58:01,728
-Who told you to date a jerk like him?
-I had no one else to date.

774
00:58:01,811 --> 00:58:04,063
-You can see me.
-I'm seeing you right now.

775
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:05,690
Not like this. I mean dating.

776
00:58:05,773 --> 00:58:08,401
-Why would I date you?
-Because I like you.

777
00:58:40,683 --> 00:58:42,727
You should go home now.

778
00:58:44,938 --> 00:58:47,398
Okay. I should go.

779
00:58:56,783 --> 00:58:58,159
This is my car.

780
00:58:59,661 --> 00:59:00,662
Oh, right.

781
00:59:02,497 --> 00:59:03,831
This is your car.

782
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:07,794
I'll get going then.

783
00:59:08,628 --> 00:59:10,004
Okay. Bye.

784
00:59:10,505 --> 00:59:11,506
Bye.

785
00:59:29,524 --> 00:59:31,067
What was that?

786
00:59:37,198 --> 00:59:38,825
Darn, it's so embarrassing.

787
00:59:42,161 --> 00:59:45,873
It's a shame. Su seems to like her a lot.

788
00:59:45,957 --> 00:59:50,378
If he likes her a lot, it might be better
for him to keep his distance from her.

789
00:59:50,461 --> 00:59:52,839
I guess there's a woman
you keep your distance from.

790
00:59:54,966 --> 00:59:58,428
Maybe. There's someone I regret losing.

791
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:03,433
What do we do now?

792
01:00:03,516 --> 01:00:05,226
-I'm meeting someone.
-Dr. Kim?

793
01:00:07,312 --> 01:00:08,438
I'm not seeing Dr. Kim.

794
01:00:10,398 --> 01:00:11,774
Is he busy today?

795
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:13,693
I'm not seeing him today nor tomorrow.

796
01:00:13,776 --> 01:00:15,278
I won't see him ever again.

797
01:00:16,779 --> 01:00:17,864
Why not?

798
01:00:18,448 --> 01:00:20,450
I can't develop feelings for him.

799
01:00:21,451 --> 01:00:23,703
You're such a romanticist.
That's your problem.

800
01:00:24,287 --> 01:00:27,874
People our age can't be in love
that makes your heart flutter.

801
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:31,919
Your heart should grow old
along with your body.

802
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:37,050
I just don't understand
how you were a judge.

803
01:00:41,888 --> 01:00:43,097
Did I do something wrong?

804
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:47,060
Forget it. Let's just go.

805
01:00:58,154 --> 01:01:01,240
I'd like to drive you home,
but you wouldn't want it.

806
01:01:02,325 --> 01:01:04,243
I think you'd better not.

807
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:07,747
I'll get going, then.

808
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:58,089
-What?
-It wasn't

809
01:01:59,799 --> 01:02:00,925
a date.

810
01:02:02,343 --> 01:02:03,344
Do you like me?

811
01:02:04,512 --> 01:02:05,930
No.

812
01:02:06,013 --> 01:02:08,558
Then are you toying with me?

813
01:02:09,142 --> 01:02:10,226
-What?
-I told

814
01:02:10,309 --> 01:02:12,687
my parents that I like you,
and you went on a date

815
01:02:12,770 --> 01:02:16,232
with someone else right away.
That was already hurtful.

816
01:02:16,315 --> 01:02:18,401
And now you came all the way here to say

817
01:02:18,484 --> 01:02:20,820
that it wasn't a date
when you don't even like me.

818
01:02:22,029 --> 01:02:23,698
How am I supposed to interpret that?

819
01:02:23,781 --> 01:02:25,032
It wasn't…

820
01:02:26,951 --> 01:02:29,203
It wasn't a date.

821
01:02:29,287 --> 01:02:31,664
I'm here because I don't
want you to misunderstand.

822
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:32,957
Misunderstand?

823
01:02:34,709 --> 01:02:37,128
How can I not misunderstand this?

824
01:02:37,837 --> 01:02:41,257
No matter how hard I try to understand
you, I have only one conclusion.

825
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:42,508
Gyeong Woo-yeon

826
01:02:44,051 --> 01:02:45,595
thinks I'm easy.

827
01:02:46,804 --> 01:02:48,306
What?

828
01:02:48,389 --> 01:02:50,183
You still don't seem to believe it,

829
01:02:51,058 --> 01:02:52,393
but I really like you.

830
01:02:53,311 --> 01:02:55,563
So don't toy with my feelings.

831
01:02:56,981 --> 01:02:59,942
-You're going on a power trip.
-Look who's talking.

832
01:03:00,026 --> 01:03:02,195
If you said you'd wait, just wait quietly.

833
01:03:03,070 --> 01:03:04,781
Don't do anything and just wait.

834
01:03:04,864 --> 01:03:07,158
"It'll be sold out soon."

835
01:03:07,241 --> 01:03:09,702
Don't pull cheap tricks
like a home shopping channel.

836
01:03:09,786 --> 01:03:11,496
-What?
-That's what you're doing now.

837
01:03:11,579 --> 01:03:15,416
"Buy it or just forget about it.
But if you don't buy it, it's your loss."

838
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:18,252
You're just watching
from a step back like a spectator.

839
01:03:18,336 --> 01:03:19,921
Do you want me to beg, then?

840
01:03:20,004 --> 01:03:21,380
Why are you asking me?

841
01:03:22,757 --> 01:03:25,134
Do you want me to give you
all the answers?

842
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:29,806
It was crazy of me
to come all the way here.

843
01:03:30,389 --> 01:03:32,058
You just threw your feelings at me,

844
01:03:34,685 --> 01:03:36,521
and I got swayed again.

845
01:03:40,608 --> 01:03:42,568
But I just got myself together.

846
01:03:43,486 --> 01:03:45,029
I'm all cooled down now.

847
01:04:23,276 --> 01:04:24,610
What are you doing here?

848
01:04:24,694 --> 01:04:26,362
I thought you'd look like this.

849
01:04:27,029 --> 01:04:30,116
I knew you would rush to see him.

850
01:04:30,199 --> 01:04:33,578
And you have this face on
every time you see him.

851
01:04:36,998 --> 01:04:38,791
You're someone I want so desperately,

852
01:04:39,792 --> 01:04:42,795
but why do you always look like that
after seeing him?

853
01:04:55,516 --> 01:04:59,395
It's dangerous to judge others in a world
where you can even misunderstand yourself.

854
01:05:00,187 --> 01:05:01,647
So I have to ask.

855
01:05:02,315 --> 01:05:04,859
I have to hear it myself.

856
01:05:05,359 --> 01:05:06,444
Woo-yeon.

857
01:05:15,494 --> 01:05:17,955
Say it, whether it's an excuse
or an explanation.

858
01:05:18,497 --> 01:05:20,708
I'll believe what you say,
even if it's a lie.

859
01:05:53,115 --> 01:05:55,076
I'M SORRY FOR REJECTING ALL YOUR PROPOSALS

860
01:05:55,159 --> 01:05:56,452
It was a dream.

861
01:06:02,708 --> 01:06:04,460
All I could do was dream it.

862
01:06:05,211 --> 01:06:08,422
I'M SORRY FOR REJECTING ALL YOUR PROPOSALS

863
01:06:33,197 --> 01:06:35,658
I did say that
in a fit of temper that day,

864
01:06:35,741 --> 01:06:37,743
but my feelings are real.

865
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:39,328
I like you.

866
01:06:39,412 --> 01:06:41,122
I'll be nothing but friends with you.

867
01:06:41,205 --> 01:06:44,250
Jin-ju. I'll do my best
to make you like me.

868
01:06:46,836 --> 01:06:48,671
Hey, are you all right?

869
01:06:48,754 --> 01:06:50,631
You're looking at me now that I'm hurt.

870
01:06:50,715 --> 01:06:51,966
Hold my hand. I'm hurt.

871
01:06:52,466 --> 01:06:54,135
Did you make up with him?

872
01:06:54,218 --> 01:06:55,469
I guess so.

873
01:06:55,553 --> 01:06:59,015
I guess he keeps getting new chances.
I'm jealous of him.

874
01:06:59,098 --> 01:07:01,350
It's good to be hurt.
I even get to eat with you.

875
01:07:01,434 --> 01:07:03,853
Spare some time for me tomorrow.
Let's go somewhere.

876
01:07:04,437 --> 01:07:07,231
Woo-yeon, can I keep
being unfamiliar to you?

877
01:07:07,314 --> 01:07:08,733
I will make you forget

878
01:07:08,816 --> 01:07:11,235
all the pain I gave you
by being unfamiliar to you.

879
01:07:13,863 --> 01:07:18,868
