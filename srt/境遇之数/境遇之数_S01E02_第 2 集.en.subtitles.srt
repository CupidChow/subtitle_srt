00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:03,897
GYEONG WOO-YEON

2
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:07,025
Why is the call going through?

3
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:12,030
What? He answered it.

4
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:22,791
He's answering your phone today.

5
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:38,181
Hello, Woo-yeon.

6
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,730
He even talks.

7
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:47,941
You're drunk, Woo-yeon.

8
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:49,901
You're drunk, Woo-yeon.

9
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:52,445
You're even seeing things.

10
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:01,371
Am I dreaming?

11
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,751
You're not dreaming. It's really me.

12
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:11,089
Gosh, it's warm.

13
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:26,771
Is it a 4D movie?

14
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:29,899
I can even smell him.

15
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:33,444
Will you add an adjective
in front of that?

16
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:34,612
A good smell.

17
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:38,074
He looks so real.

18
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,288
How much did you drink?

19
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,916
-Let's go in.
-I'm not going in.

20
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:50,670
You're not in there.

21
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:55,133
I want to stay in this dream.

22
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:20,742
Where are the business cards?

23
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:25,121
And why does my wrist hurt?

24
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:30,209
Once Ms. Kim shows up,
tell her to copy this.

25
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:32,003
Give it to me. I'll do it.

26
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:33,254
You don't have to.

27
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:35,215
Just make sure to tell her that.

28
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:37,217
Okay.

29
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:49,771
GROUP CHAT

30
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:51,731
You can pay as I announced.

31
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:01,241
Gosh, it's the wrong room.
It was for the permanent employees.

32
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,786
The others don't need to pay.

33
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,251
One iced Americano, please.

34
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:13,878
You can get a 15 percent discount
with an employee card.

35
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,546
-It's fine.
-Here.

36
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:18,174
Hey, So-yeong.

37
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:23,638
People think discrimination is
something huge,

38
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:26,432
but real discrimination is
something trivial like this.

39
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:30,937
Like a 15 percent discount on coffee.

40
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:33,940
"You don't have to do it.
You don't need to pay."

41
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:37,026
Or alienation disguised as consideration.

42
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,028
I guess you're right.

43
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,738
Before the workshop last month,

44
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:43,324
they asked me if I wanted to come.

45
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,786
Why would they ask a question like that?

46
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,289
You became a permanent employee, though.

47
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:51,165
But it's not the same.

48
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:54,377
I can't get a promotion or a pay raise.

49
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,921
They don't even want me
to come to the workshop.

50
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,675
Once blue, forever blue.

51
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:02,218
Once an intern, always an intern.

52
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:05,096
There's no future.

53
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:18,234
I played the punching game
and set a new record yesterday.

54
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,319
Really?

55
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,455
Yeong-hui.

56
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:33,416
Yeong-hui, did I play
a punching game yesterday?

57
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:35,209
Why does my wrist hurt?

58
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:36,794
Yes, you did. To Su.

59
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:40,339
Su? What are you talking about?

60
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:43,301
Poor guy. He had to go through that
as soon as he returned.

61
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:45,011
He's back?

62
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:48,890
That wasn't a dream?

63
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:51,142
Gyeong Woo-yeon.

64
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,608
Hello, Woo-yeon.

65
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:05,323
Where are her manners?

66
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:08,493
That one is pretty.

67
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:10,620
Can I get a size 275 for this?

68
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:12,663
You can try that on.

69
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:16,084
-I'm really okay.
-Try it on.

70
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:23,091
I have nowhere to go wearing this anyway.

71
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:27,386
You can't look scruffy
just because you have nowhere to go.

72
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:31,140
Don't feel small because you're studying
for a state exam. I hate that.

73
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,392
Are you buying me shoes to run away?

74
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:35,603
I'm buying you so that you can
become a public officer.

75
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:38,231
It looks nice.

76
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,526
-Do you want this?
-Yes. Good.

77
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:45,363
I'll do my best.

78
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:49,408
Hey. What are you doing here?

79
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:52,036
Why did you come here?

80
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,080
-You told me to come.
-Did I?

81
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:58,251
That can't be right.

82
00:06:58,334 --> 00:06:59,627
You did.

83
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:02,880
To get the settlement money.

84
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:06,759
No, I don't want to.

85
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:12,473
Lee Su.

86
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:13,683
Hey, Gyeong Woo-yeon.

87
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:15,059
-Woo-yeon.
-Don't go.

88
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:16,811
-Stop it.
-Slap.

89
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:19,188
I'm so unlucky.

90
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,149
I'm unhappy.

91
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:23,317
It's all because of you.

92
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:24,861
Stop hitting me.

93
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,696
Hey, Woo-yeon.

94
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:29,657
-Woo-yeon, wait.
-Stop it, Woo-yeon.

95
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:33,494
Ding-dong.

96
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:36,414
You should say, "Who is it?" Ding-dong.

97
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:38,082
Who is it?

98
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:39,834
If you're upset,

99
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:45,256
come to get settlement money from me.

100
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:50,011
I left my phone in my office.

101
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:51,220
Is your hand the office?

102
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,647
It's here.

103
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:04,025
So how are you going to pay me?

104
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:09,864
About yesterday,

105
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:14,368
I'm really sorry.

106
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:16,537
For what?

107
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:18,039
Well…

108
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:22,293
Did I hit you

109
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,420
lightly?

110
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:26,964
I don't think it was light.

111
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:29,634
I might have been a little heavy.

112
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:33,304
So is that how

113
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:37,350
I handed out my business cards?

114
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:40,686
What?

115
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:42,688
Did I do something else?

116
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:46,025
Even if I did, don't tell me.

117
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:47,527
I'm embarrassed enough as it is.

118
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,612
If I remember it,
I'll be really humiliated.

119
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:56,244
Okay.

120
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:00,414
-But--
-Just don't say it.

121
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:02,500
I was going to ask about something else.

122
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:07,880
-What is it?
-Why are you working at an office?

123
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:11,801
You wanted to become a writer.
Or a calligrapher.

124
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,722
It's not something anyone can do.

125
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:21,602
I tried to make ends meet
and now I'm working at an office.

126
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:24,480
That's ridiculous.
You should do what you want.

127
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:27,108
How many people can live
doing what they want?

128
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:30,570
Race, gender, religion, parents,

129
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:32,488
occupation, spouse, and so on.

130
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:35,700
Among those things, the only things
that you can choose for yourself

131
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:38,077
are your occupation and your spouse.

132
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,997
Isn't it too sad to not be able to
choose those two?

133
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:56,554
Which school do you go to?

134
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:02,351
That's a very famous school.

135
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:05,187
That sounds cool.

136
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:08,024
I'm quite busy being cool inside and out.

137
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:19,243
This place hasn't changed at all.
The houses and the convenience store.

138
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:21,746
You're right.

139
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,416
Everything is the same.

140
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:27,793
It's still good.

141
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:30,212
Bye, then.

142
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,592
Until when are you here?

143
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:36,802
-Next week.
-I see.

144
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:39,221
I'm just here for my visa
during spring break.

145
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,099
I see.

146
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:49,732
I'll see you
as much as I can until I leave.

147
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:57,657
Why would he want to see you often?

148
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,367
-To go on dates?
-Did he ask you out?

149
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:01,202
-Did he want to sleep with you?
-That's just

150
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:02,578
too American.

151
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,081
So? He's been
in the States for a long time.

152
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:09,460
You're right. That must be it.

153
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:11,379
What do you mean she's right?

154
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:14,215
You should see him if you want to.

155
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:16,884
If you want to kiss him,
you should kiss him.

156
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:19,303
And sleep with him if you want to.
Whatever you want.

157
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:22,556
-Why do you keep saying that?
-So she won't have any regrets.

158
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,017
She's been hung up on him for seven years.

159
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:31,941
Do whatever you want to do
and end the curse.

160
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:37,113
I agree.

161
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:39,740
Me too. Accept the majority's decision.

162
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:42,118
Cheers.

163

00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:28,330
THE WIND BRUSHES ITS HAIR NEATLY
IN THE MORNING PINE FOREST

167
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,918
DON'T LIVE LIFE BEATING AROUND THE BUSH

168
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,145
-Mom.
-Yes?

169
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:53,355
I want a 25-color crayon set.

170
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,065
You have crayons at home.

171
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:57,985
But it's only 24 colors.

172
00:12:58,068 --> 00:13:00,863
There are so many different colors
in the world.

173
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:55,209
Hey, get in.

174
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:06,136
Why did you come here?

175
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:09,723
I was bored, and you were upset.

176
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:12,685
-It's for both of us.
-You've become quite considerate.

177
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:14,395
I've always been considerate.

178
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:18,274
-Have you?
-"Have you?"

179
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:21,318
I've been nothing but nice to you.
Did you forget?

180
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:24,113
Are you saying that to me
after being nice to other people?

181
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:26,532
You're the only person I was nice to.

182
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:32,288
It's a shame. I wanted to see
cherry blossoms in Korea.

183
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:34,081
But it's all green here.

184
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:35,958
You should've seen them.

185
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:39,545
I love cherry blossoms,
but they fall off too soon.

186
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:42,715
People come to see them
because they fall off soon.

187
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:48,512
I guess you're right.

188
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:51,640
Unlike cherry blossoms,
there's no pine tree festival.

189
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:54,768
Cherry blossoms wither quickly,
but pine trees are armored.

190
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:55,978
So pine trees win.

191
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:58,480
You're such a smooth talker.

192
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:05,195
Are you feeling better now?

193
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:09,074
Yes. I feel better now.

194
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:12,494
Good. I'm glad that you feel better.

195
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,288
Why are you glad when I feel better?

196
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:16,665
Because we're friends.

197
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,009
I can't be friends with you.

198
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:30,346
You don't even ask why.

199
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,643
You know very well

200
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:38,687
that I still have

201
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:42,316
-feelings for you.
-Don't say that.

202
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:45,527
What?

203
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,614
Whenever I come back,

204
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:52,993
no matter how long I'm gone,
I always want to see you

205
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:55,204
as a friend.

206
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:58,791
So…

207
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:03,379
Don't say things like that.

208
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:16,433
I won't.

209
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,520
You just made me not want to say it.

210
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:24,858
Let's end things here.

211
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:29,780
My feelings for you

212
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:32,616
and our friendship.

213
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,248
I just said I wanted us to be friends.

214
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:44,920
And I said

215
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,466
I had feelings for you.

216
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,553
It's you who didn't want it.

217
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:57,349
So…

218
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:07,151
So let's just refuse both options
and not see each other again.

219
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:15,951
I'm done talking. Will you leave?

220
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:32,176
-I'll drive you home.
-I'm embarrassed, so just leave.

221
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:35,596
I'm embarrassed that I was rejected twice.

222
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:40,684
I hate that I still have
feelings for you despite all that.

223
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:45,898
So let's not see each other ever again.

224
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:26,605
Jin-ju.

225
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:33,570
What should I do?

226
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:36,532
That night,

227
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:39,868
I realized that green is sad.

228
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:51,880
Are you all right?

229
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,050
Of course I am.

230
00:18:57,386 --> 00:19:00,472
So how did you call me right on time?

231
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:04,476
Maybe it's telepathy.

232
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,479
Su told me that you were here
and asked me to pick you up.

233
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:08,605
Why did you tell her?

234
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:12,067
I can't change your mind

235
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:16,113
I see, that's how you felt

236
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:21,118
I liked you but you didn't feel the same

237
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:25,122
That's how you felt back then

238
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:28,917
I was the only one who thought about you

239
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,377
Please sing together.

240
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:33,839
-That night when you took me home
-That night when you took me home

241
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:36,717
Woo-yeon.

242
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:43,265
Gosh, this is so annoying.

243
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:47,477
He rejected me twice,

244
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:51,815
but I still like him. It pisses me off.

245
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,198
Cry your heart out.

246
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:02,117
We'll be embarrassed for you
so just keep crying.

247
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:11,418
There's something I learned
from my long-standing crush.

248
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:13,170
Why are you crying now?

249
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,881
Your heart isn't…

250
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:17,549
3 YEARS LATER, 2020

251
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:19,676
…something you can control.

252
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,763
YOU SHOULD NEVER DATE.
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO LOVE SOMEONE.

253
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:24,348
Whether I like someone…

254
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:27,392
Let's break up.

255
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,811
…or don't,

256
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:34,358
I just can't control my heart,

257
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:37,236
and it keeps hurting others.

258
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:38,487
Sure. Okay.

259
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:40,864
It's unfair.

260
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:47,913
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

261
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,041
All right.

262
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:53,627
You're good at it.

263
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:57,005
Green is a sad color.

264
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:00,425
It's certain now.

265
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:04,763
You jerk.

266
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,848
This is…

267
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,478
all your fault.

268
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:16,900
It's all because of you.

269
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:20,112
I'm so sick of it. Everything…

270
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:24,491
is your fault.

271
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:27,160
-It's really…
-Prosecutor Han.

272
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:30,038
Do you like puppies?

273
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:33,041
If you do, do you want to
hang out with me?

274
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:36,795
When I get drunk, I become a dog.

275
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:39,256
Woof, woof!

276
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:42,801
Is that so? Darn.

277
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:46,638
How dare a dog try to eat
at the same table as humans?

278
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:52,811
There she goes again.

279
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:55,856
She's doing that again?

280
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:59,192
Leave her be. The number's disconnected,
so he won't answer anyway.

281
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:02,195
What if he comes back to Korea?

282
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:05,324
What if he picks up?
It happened three years ago.

283
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:08,744
Leave her be. She won't learn
her lesson until she embarrasses herself.

284
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:12,956
Sometimes you can be so cold-hearted.

285
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,292
I'm glad that it's just sometimes.

286
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:18,670
I didn't even ask you out.

287
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:22,341
I wasn't

288
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:25,218
asking you for favors.

289
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:30,974
You know what?

290
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:34,311
When a guy says that he likes me,

291
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:36,730
all my feelings for him go away.

292
00:22:37,355 --> 00:22:40,025
It makes me lose all interest in him.

293
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:44,946
So…

294
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:47,908
will you like me just once?

295
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:51,244
Will you please…

296
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:56,750
like me just once?

297
00:22:57,959 --> 00:22:59,044
Please?

298
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:06,718
Is it that hard for you?

299
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:12,265
I did it for ten years.

300
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:17,395
Is it that difficult for you?

301
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:20,273
Is it?

302
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:29,366
Is it that hard for you?

303
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:34,913
I did it for ten years.

304
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:39,793
Is it that difficult for you?

305
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:41,753
CEO ON JUN-SU

306
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:42,921
Is it?

307
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:59,312
Following your dream
without a job at your age

308
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:01,481
is enough to make you a bad daughter.

309
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:04,359
And getting drunk like that
will upset your parents even more.

310
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,361
They will be devastated.

311
00:24:06,444 --> 00:24:09,656
I told you I have a job.

312
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:11,575
I'm a calligrapher.

313
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:14,911
If you made decent money with it,
you wouldn't be working here.

314
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,539
You're here because it's not a proper job.

315
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:24,129
Oh, right. We're remodeling this place,
so we'll be closed for a while.

316
00:24:24,212 --> 00:24:25,922
You should come back after 15 days.

317
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:29,551
What? Then what about my salary?

318
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:32,637
You're paid by the hour here.

319
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:34,723
It means you're not paid
when you don't work.

320
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:52,407
AAAKWKM LEFT A COMMENT ON YOUR POST

321
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:55,160
Everyone says they're a calligrapher.

322
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:03,043
Ms. Gyeong Woo-yeon,
what do you think you're doing?

323
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:06,129
You wanted to become a writer.
Or a calligrapher.

324
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:13,678
APRIL

325
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:16,473
It's money that I don't have, not time.

326
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:28,526
UNREASONABLE GYEONG WOO-YEON

327
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:31,029
Hello?

328
00:25:31,112 --> 00:25:33,240
Where's the guesthouse in Jeju Island

329
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:34,908
you mentioned the other day?

330
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:38,370
-Oh, that place…
-Just text me.

331
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:39,913
Who are you going--

332
00:25:39,996 --> 00:25:41,998
Hello?

333
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:44,292
Did she hang up on me?

334
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,711
Gosh, how rude she is.

335
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:52,008
Jieum Guesthouse.

336
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:54,511
Who is she going with?

337
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:08,108
Woo-yeon, you've worked really hard.

338
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:11,486
You should get a good rest
for 15 days doing nothing.

339
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:20,078
You said you like me

340
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:03,038
Breakfast is available at the cafe
from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m.,

341
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:05,165
and the restroom is in there.

342
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:12,005
-Did you sleep well?
-No.

343
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:13,673
Why not?

344
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:29,290
Why are there so many photos of hills?

345
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:31,000
They're the owner's favorite spot.

346
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:34,337
Woo-yeon, did you get some relaxation?

347
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:37,006
I'm leaving in two days,
but I still haven't.

348
00:28:37,757 --> 00:28:39,843
I came here to rest, but I'm working here

349
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:41,928
to save every penny.

350
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:44,681
After tomorrow morning,
you don't have to work anymore.

351
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:46,266
You can start relaxing tomorrow.

352
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:49,102
But I still have a lot of work to do.

353
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:52,439
I have to clean up the house
and hand out postcards.

354
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:55,734
Why am I so poor when I work so hard?

355
00:28:57,193 --> 00:28:59,904
I envy those who make a lot of money
doing what they want.

356
00:29:01,364 --> 00:29:03,158
Is that even possible?

357
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:04,451
I know a few people who do that.

358

TIMID BOOKSTORE

359

360
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:56,044
What are you doing out here so early?

361
00:29:57,712 --> 00:29:58,922
I couldn't sleep.

362
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:00,882
You've been back for three days now.

363
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:03,092
Are you still jet-lagged?

364
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:05,595
It will take me a few more days to adjust.

365
00:30:05,678 --> 00:30:07,305
I'll leave before I do, though.

366
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:11,559
Do you still have that?
It's over 20 years old.

367
00:30:13,102 --> 00:30:15,605
It's over 20 years old,
but it still works.

368
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:24,239
Why did you teach me photography?
I was only eight years old.

369
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:28,743
You were only eight, so I hated that
your only hobby was collecting awards.

370
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,664
I wanted to look cool back then.

371
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:35,542
I shouldn't have.

372
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:43,258
Aren't you going to go to Seoul?

373
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:44,509
I'm not going.

374
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:48,805
It's not like I'm your pigeon.

375
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:51,975
I'm tired of carrying messages
back and forth for you and your dad.

376
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:53,852
You don't have to do that for me.

377
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:55,979
I'll be even more grateful
if you don't tell him about me.

378
00:30:57,939 --> 00:31:00,149
I shouldn't have taught you photography.

379
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:02,735
I did it so you wouldn't be lonely.

380
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:06,030
But you adopted loneliness
as a profession.

381
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:08,700
It's tolerable.

382
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:10,994
Why do you tolerate your life
when you are young?

383
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:13,663
It's an old custom.

384
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:23,590
Mr. Han finally made us cross the sea.

385
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:26,509
But thanks to Mr. Han,
we've come to Jeju Island.

386
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:28,970
Did you talk to the photographer?

387
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:32,473
Yes. We will have a meeting
at Cafe Metaphor Jeju branch tomorrow.

388
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:35,101
Good. We'll get the photographer tomorrow.

389
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:37,604
Let's go get Mr. Han for now.

390
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:39,147
Okay.

391
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:41,900
Let's enjoy the moment, then.

392
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:20,271
So cute. It's so lovely.

393
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:22,231
Hey, kitty.

394
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:19,580
Darn it.

395
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,499
Who is it?

396
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:23,251
Room service.

397
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:25,378
What room service?

398
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:27,880
I didn't order room service…

399
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:30,008
Welcome, Mr. Han.

400
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:31,592
Nice to meet you, Mr. Han.

401
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:45,356
Make yourself at home
and write comfortably.

402
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,316
Writers have rights too.

403
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:51,988
You said this during the interview
with Metaphor Magazine in 2018.

404
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:54,073
"Writers are the most humane machines."

405
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:57,243
I admire you, Mr. Han.

406
00:33:57,326 --> 00:33:58,786
I admire you too.

407
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,830
I'm so sick of you publishers.

408
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:04,876
Take good care of Mr. Han.
I have somewhere to go.

409
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:08,629
-Okay. I'll see you later.
-Where are you going?

410
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:09,839
I'll go with you.

411
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:12,216
Mr. Han, you should focus on your writing.

412
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:33,738
With the photos he took
while traveling around the world,

413
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:37,533
he won a lot of awards
and got sponsored by big companies.

414
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:41,037
He even did the album cover for
the international pop star, Bruno Malabu.

415
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:43,539
I know he's a famous photographer.

416
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:47,710
That's why we got him this yacht.

417
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:53,800
Mr. Lee, there's only one thing
that the Jeju Tourism Organization wants.

418
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:55,510
We want your photos

419
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:59,055
to make people want to come here
before they die.

420
00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:04,519
So about the composition. You know…

421
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:08,064
Something magnificent but delicate.

422
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:11,484
Cold but warm.

423
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:16,656
Something that makes you
want to jump into the sea right away,

424
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:19,867
and also makes you want
to appreciate it at the same time.

425
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:23,287
Are you listening to me?

426
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:28,501
You've been listening.

427
00:35:28,584 --> 00:35:31,087
It's not something you can get
after a few words.

428
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:34,423
-Pardon?
-So

429
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:36,592
just stay quiet and watch.

430
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:39,637
Don't interrupt me and just wait.

431
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:45,226
That punk looks down on me.

432
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:47,645
No, he looks down on everyone.

433
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:53,234
He's still our client.
You were too harsh on him.

434
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:56,487
What if the Jeju Tourism
Organization fires you?

435
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,115
Oh, right.

436
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:01,576
Who could possibly fire you?

437
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:04,203
Who cares if you're rude
when you're this good?

438
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:08,332
When are we going to Seoul?

439
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:10,251
I got a few calls about commercials.

440
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:14,130
I thought I told you
that I won't go to Seoul.

441
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,549
Hey, what about me, then?

442
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:19,093
Why are you asking me about you?

443
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:25,183
I came all the way here
from the States because of you.

444
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:28,060
You always rejected
the commercials I got you,

445
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:30,938
but I thought you were ready
to settle down in Korea.

446
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:33,608
I thought your parents were
getting you a studio to work from.

447
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:35,818
That's the only reason
I came all the way here.

448
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:38,696
I told you not to come.
You're the one who insisted on coming.

449
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:40,781
Didn't I do the commercials?

450
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:44,202
And I rejected some of them for a reason.
You put money before my work.

451
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:45,995
Just to please your clients,

452
00:36:46,078 --> 00:36:47,455
you mangled my photographs.

453
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:50,082
There's nothing I can't do for money.

454
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:56,964
You may think you are my partner,

455
00:36:57,548 --> 00:37:00,635
but don't be mistaken. You are
not my partner, but a parasite

456
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:02,720
who's only after money.

457
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:10,436
You think you don't make
connections you don't need.

458
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:13,856
But that's not it. You can't make one.

459
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:16,692
You don't know how to accept
kindness or love.

460
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:18,694
You only care about yourself.

461
00:37:20,154 --> 00:37:24,158
Fine. Good luck
with your damn lonely life.

I'm going around to see

490
00:40:13,994 --> 00:40:16,997
how the local bookstore project
is coming along.

491
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:22,420
Gosh, it's done.

492
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:27,716
I'll give you a freebie
since you have good manners.

493
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:34,598
This jacket is really expensive.

494
00:40:36,058 --> 00:40:38,018
How many postcards
do I have to sell for this?

495
00:40:46,068 --> 00:40:49,280
It's a special edition,
so this is the bestselling book here.

496
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:50,614
I'm glad to hear that.

497
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:57,329
Well, I'm returning this to you.

498
00:40:57,913 --> 00:40:58,914
Okay.

499
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:02,376
SEE YOU AGAIN

500
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:09,884
Gosh, when did it drop here?

501
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:20,394
WIND BLOWS TO PASS THROUGH

502
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:27,902
If you're going
to throw out the other two,

503
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:29,737
can I take them back?

504
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:34,450
I didn't make these postcards
to be thrown away.

505
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:44,210
Bye.

506
00:41:58,349 --> 00:41:59,558
WIND BLOWS TO PASS THROUGH

507
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:27,503
Wind blows in everyone's lives.

508
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:31,048
It's okay.

509
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:34,802
Wind blows

510
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:37,846
to pass through.

511
00:43:38,365 --> 00:43:40,492
The old sayings are all true.

512
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:43,329
Seeing is believing.

513
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:46,540
Seeing hurts more than hearing.

514
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:49,126
WIND BLOWS TO PASS THROUGH

515
00:43:49,209 --> 00:43:51,629
It really put me in my place.

516
00:44:02,097 --> 00:44:03,349
Gyeong Woo-yeon?

517
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:20,574
WIND BLOWS TO PASS THROUGH

518
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:23,619
It's wrong.

519
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:28,624
Wind actually blows

520
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:31,794
to come back.

521
00:45:03,742 --> 00:45:05,702
Why are you running away? Am I a ghost?

522
00:45:06,286 --> 00:45:08,288
Yes. I thought you were a ghost.

523
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:11,792
What are you doing here? Why are you here?

524
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:14,086
How long are you going
to stay there like that?

525
00:45:14,586 --> 00:45:17,548
-Is it comfortable?
-How could you not even hold out your--

526
00:45:21,176 --> 00:45:22,261
Get on my back.

527
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:27,891
A ghost can't do this.
I'm not a ghost, so get on my back.

528
00:45:33,313 --> 00:45:34,481
Hold tight.

529
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:36,984
I'm holding on tight.

530
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:40,112
Don't make me say it twice.
I'm already exhausted.

531
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:49,621
Thank you.

532
00:45:53,375 --> 00:45:55,919
Thank you. You should go now.

533
00:45:57,171 --> 00:46:00,132
I just took you to a doctor.
Do you think I'm an ambulance?

534
00:46:00,674 --> 00:46:02,676
I just thought you'd be busy.

535
00:46:02,759 --> 00:46:04,678
You didn't hurt your mouth,
so explain now.

536
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:07,264
-Why did you run away?
-I didn't run away.

537
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:12,561
I told you. I thought you were a ghost.

538
00:46:12,644 --> 00:46:13,687
No way.

539
00:46:14,229 --> 00:46:16,732
Are you still upset about
what happened three years ago?

540
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:18,901
What? Upset?

541
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:22,279
Hey, I'm totally fine.

542
00:46:22,863 --> 00:46:24,072
I really am.

543
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:27,284
I can even eat, have tea,
and drink with you.

544
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:29,703
I can even poop at your place.

545
00:46:31,747 --> 00:46:33,040
Actually, not the last one.

546
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:35,918
-Do it then.
-What? Poop at your place?

547
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:37,211
Not that one.

548
00:46:38,253 --> 00:46:39,546
Everything else.

549
00:46:42,758 --> 00:46:45,886
Buy me a meal.
Private ambulances aren't free.

550
00:46:55,979 --> 00:46:57,397
What brings you to Jeju Island?

551
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:59,900
Nothing. I just came to rest.

552
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:04,947
-How are you doing?
-I just…

553
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:06,990
-Not bad.
-Gosh.

554
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:09,701
Can't you stop saying "just"?

555
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:12,246
I know, right?

556
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:14,498
How long are you staying here?

557
00:47:15,582 --> 00:47:16,708
I'm leaving tonight.

558
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:19,002
Are you going to the airport?
I'll give you a ride.

559
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:22,047
It's okay. I should stop by
my guesthouse to get my stuff.

560
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:23,382
Then I'll drive you there.

561
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:26,718
-It's okay.
-Do you want to hurt the other leg too?

562
00:47:26,802 --> 00:47:28,887
Even a newborn calf would
walk better than you.

563
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:32,307
I don't want to cause you trouble.

564
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:34,351
Just care about yourself, not others.

565
00:47:34,434 --> 00:47:38,146
Always be calculative
so you can minimize your loss.

566
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:41,149
All humans are selfish,
so they only care about themselves.

567
00:47:41,233 --> 00:47:44,528
No one puts others before themselves.
Even parents.

568
00:47:46,738 --> 00:47:49,616
-But still…
-Just do as I say unless you're upset.

569
00:47:50,826 --> 00:47:52,619
I said I'm not upset.

570
00:48:04,631 --> 00:48:07,801
Is that a treasure box?
You've been holding it in your arms.

571
00:48:08,427 --> 00:48:11,471
I thought it was,
but it's just a nuisance.

572
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:13,140
What is it?

573
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:14,766
This?

574
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:19,229
It's my calligraphy postcard.

575
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:20,939
Why are you carrying that around?

576
00:48:21,023 --> 00:48:23,984
I made some samples
hoping to sell them at bookstores.

577
00:48:24,943 --> 00:48:26,570
But they're stuck in my bag.

578
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:29,072
Give me one.

579
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:30,866
As a souvenir?

580
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:32,993
To remember you by.

581
00:48:34,202 --> 00:48:35,787
I missed you.

582
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:41,084
So where are you going?

583
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:43,670
To Jieum Guesthouse.

584
00:48:50,886 --> 00:48:52,512
Thank you. Bye.

585
00:49:00,812 --> 00:49:04,232
How could you just leave like that
after saying thank you?

586
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:06,818
Is that how they taught you in Korea?

587
00:49:06,902 --> 00:49:08,320
It was my mom, actually.

588
00:49:09,821 --> 00:49:12,908
Your mom raised you well
to be a go-ahead person.

589
00:49:12,991 --> 00:49:14,201
Did you believe that?

590
00:49:16,995 --> 00:49:19,831
So did you get off just to hear that?

591
00:49:19,915 --> 00:49:21,708
-Do you think so?
-You're here.

592
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:25,420
How did you two come together?

593
00:49:27,214 --> 00:49:30,050
He's like my son.

594
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:32,302
He's staying in the house
you cleaned earlier.

595
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:34,179
So how do you two know each other?

596
00:49:34,262 --> 00:49:37,849
-Well, we just--
-We're friends.

597
00:49:38,517 --> 00:49:41,311
It's not what you think.
We're just friends.

598
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:44,064
You wouldn't let a friend sit next to you.

599
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:46,900
What about my Yu-ra?
I thought you'd be my son-in-law.

600
00:49:46,983 --> 00:49:50,487
I said it's not like that.
Don't say anything to Dad about this.

601
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:53,323
All right, you fool. How fussy.

602
00:49:54,032 --> 00:49:55,367
I'll get going then.

603
00:49:55,450 --> 00:49:57,953
-You're leaving tomorrow, right?
-Yes.

604
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:06,211
Tomorrow?

605
00:50:06,294 --> 00:50:09,631
You ran away and lied to me.
You're being so mean.

606
00:50:09,715 --> 00:50:11,216
I wasn't lying.

607
00:50:12,884 --> 00:50:15,345
I was mistaken. It was a mistake.

608
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:16,888
So you're still upset with me.

609
00:50:16,972 --> 00:50:19,641
What? I said I'm not upset.

610
00:50:20,642 --> 00:50:22,644
-Then follow me.
-Where?

611
00:50:23,228 --> 00:50:25,147
We did only one of the things you said.

612
00:50:32,112 --> 00:50:33,488
There are a lot of stars.

613
00:50:34,322 --> 00:50:35,449
I know.

614
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:43,790
I'm jealous.
You can see them again tomorrow.

615
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:46,084
It will be different tomorrow.

616
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:50,297
-Won't they be any stars tomorrow?
-You won't be here.

617
00:51:14,196 --> 00:51:17,866
Before the publication event
for Lee Yeon-gyeong's book,

618
00:51:17,949 --> 00:51:20,327
we will hold a digital calligraphy event.

619
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:24,790
We will select five book covers from
Metaphor Publishing House's collection

620
00:51:24,873 --> 00:51:26,416
and make smartphone wallpapers

621
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:28,960
with the phrases they want
written by calligraphers.

622
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:31,046
Did you find a calligrapher yet?

623
00:51:31,129 --> 00:51:33,465
Yes. We have Calligrapher Jang Seo-yeon,

624
00:51:33,548 --> 00:51:36,218
who's worked with us before.

625
00:51:36,718 --> 00:51:39,221
Good. It's late.
You should go get some rest.

626
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:42,307
All right, then.

627
00:51:51,566 --> 00:51:53,193
Aren't you going to rest, Jun-su?

628
00:51:55,237 --> 00:51:58,573
You treat me like a friend
the very moment I tell you to rest.

629
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:00,659
Isn't that sad?

630
00:52:00,742 --> 00:52:04,037
We were friends in college,
but you're my boss now.

631
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:07,332
Nothing beats having a rich family.

632
00:52:07,415 --> 00:52:08,875
That's why I pay you a lot.

633
00:52:10,252 --> 00:52:13,505
Gosh, I'm going to get a drink.
Can I get you anything?

634
00:52:13,588 --> 00:52:15,340
Some tea would be great.

635
00:52:16,716 --> 00:52:18,927
Jun-su.

636
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:22,347
The only options you have
at this hour are alcohol or alcohol.

637
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:24,474
-What's your problem?
-Alcohol!

638
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:27,185
-Pardon?
-I'd love some alcohol.

639
00:52:28,728 --> 00:52:30,063
-Mr. Min.
-Yes?

640
00:52:30,146 --> 00:52:31,606
You're on business now.

641
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:34,276
Oh, I forgot.

642
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:36,403
I'll be right back, Mr. On.

643
00:52:37,028 --> 00:52:39,573
Mr. Han, things are going well
because you're working hard.

644
00:52:39,656 --> 00:52:40,782
Keep up the good work.

645
00:52:41,575 --> 00:52:43,410
I could use some alcohol.

646
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:58,300
SEE YOU AGAIN
WOO-YEON CALLIGRAPHY

647
00:53:03,805 --> 00:53:07,058
WOO-YEON CALLIGRAPHY

648
00:53:12,606 --> 00:53:14,816
NONE OF US WAS SWAYED,
SO I'M NOT AN OBSTACLE

649
00:53:15,942 --> 00:53:17,903
WATER FLOWS WITHOUT KNOWING WHY

650
00:53:17,986 --> 00:53:20,655
THOSE WHO'VE BEEN HURT CAN'T
BE STRONG BECAUSE OF CRACKS

651
00:53:20,739 --> 00:53:22,490
YOU ARE MY BEAUTIFUL NIGHTMARE

652
00:53:26,828 --> 00:53:28,663
YOU CAME LIKE A RAIN SHOWER AND A FEVER,

653
00:53:28,747 --> 00:53:31,374
SO I SUFFERED FROM YOU FOR YEARS

654
00:53:52,687 --> 00:53:54,981
You don't have any friends, do you?

655
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:57,150
-I do.
-Like who?

656
00:53:59,653 --> 00:54:00,487
Gyeong Woo-yeon.

657
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:02,030
Hello, Woo-yeon.

658
00:54:02,113 --> 00:54:03,531
Hello, Woo-yeon.

659
00:54:04,532 --> 00:54:07,077
Good. I'm glad that you feel better.

660
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:08,328
Gyeong Woo-yeon?

661
00:54:10,664 --> 00:54:13,083
To remember you by. I missed you.

662
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:16,378
It will be different tomorrow.
You won't be here.

663
00:54:39,275 --> 00:54:40,735
Did you throw out my pills?

664
00:54:40,819 --> 00:54:43,863
Why would I throw out your pills?
How could I?

665
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:47,617
You cleaned my room. The sleeping pills
on the bedside table.

666
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:48,994
What are you talking about?

667
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:56,084
What is this?

668
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:02,424
You seem to know what I'm talking about.

669
00:55:03,008 --> 00:55:04,300
Were they yours?

670
00:55:04,384 --> 00:55:06,970
I have a meeting tomorrow.
What am I supposed to do?

671
00:55:07,053 --> 00:55:10,181
I'm still jet-lagged.
Everything's ruined because of you.

672
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:35,915
-Were you sleeping?
-I thought I told you I can't sleep.

673
00:55:36,916 --> 00:55:38,043
This is for you.

674
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:41,004
-What's that?
-Things to help you sleep.

675
00:55:41,087 --> 00:55:42,797
-I brought some…
-Come in.

676
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:45,925
I'm just here to give you this.

677
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:48,553
Why do you do things
that are only good for yourself?

678
00:55:48,636 --> 00:55:50,805
-What?
-While you

679
00:55:50,889 --> 00:55:52,265
got to see my pretty face,

680
00:55:52,348 --> 00:55:54,517
I have to lay awake
staring at the ceiling.

681
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:56,436
I'm bored and the ceiling isn't pretty.

682
00:55:59,355 --> 00:56:01,649
Were those really just sleeping pills?

683
00:56:03,443 --> 00:56:05,987
First, about the sleeping position.

684
00:56:06,571 --> 00:56:10,492
Your sleeping position can change
depending on the size of your pillow.

685
00:56:10,575 --> 00:56:13,536
It's quite high. You should
lie straight on your back. Go ahead.

686
00:56:15,246 --> 00:56:18,249
Pick between a sleeping-inducing
video and a past life experience.

687
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:19,375
A sleep-inducing video.

688
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:22,295
I was of noble birth in my past life.

689
00:56:22,378 --> 00:56:23,713
What?

690
00:56:24,964 --> 00:56:26,674
I told you to lie on your back.

691
00:56:26,758 --> 00:56:27,926
I'm comfortable like this.

692
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:30,678
That's why you can't sleep.

693
00:56:31,763 --> 00:56:32,764
Here.

694
00:56:32,847 --> 00:56:35,100
Hold it for me. It's perfect now.

695
00:56:36,184 --> 00:56:37,727
I don't want to move an inch.

696
00:56:38,853 --> 00:56:39,979
Am I a tablet holder?

697
00:56:41,022 --> 00:56:42,440
My sleeping pills.

698
00:56:42,982 --> 00:56:44,734
My small and precious sleeping pills.

699
00:56:48,363 --> 00:56:49,656
Is this good?

700
00:56:51,157 --> 00:56:52,408
It's too far.

701
00:56:53,535 --> 00:56:54,577
It's still too far.

702
00:57:01,876 --> 00:57:02,877
Good now?

703
00:57:25,692 --> 00:57:27,318
She fell asleep first.

704
00:57:50,842 --> 00:57:52,469
You said you couldn't sleep.

705
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:56,491
Didn't you know how busy a judge is
when you married me?

706
00:58:56,574 --> 00:58:58,743
I didn't get married to be lonely.

707
00:58:59,285 --> 00:59:01,412
I didn't get married to be miserable.

708
00:59:01,496 --> 00:59:05,208
You being sensitive like this
exhausts me, you know that?

709
00:59:07,252 --> 00:59:08,920
I want a divorce.

710
00:59:09,003 --> 00:59:11,506
Fine! Let's get a divorce!

711
00:59:36,823 --> 00:59:38,950
He only cares
about himself falling asleep.

712
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:42,245
What about me?

713
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:49,335
Darn, where did I drop it now?

714
00:59:52,171 --> 00:59:55,633
-What?
-I think I dropped my earring here.

715
00:59:56,676 --> 00:59:57,510
Come in.

716
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:09,897
Did you close the door last night?

717
01:00:09,981 --> 01:00:12,734
Yes. To block the light.

718
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:14,944
So you could sleep better.

719
01:00:15,695 --> 01:00:17,947
You repaid my kindness with a nightmare.

720
01:00:18,031 --> 01:00:21,034
-What?
-I sleep with my door open.

721
01:00:21,117 --> 01:00:22,285
Why?

722
01:00:22,952 --> 01:00:24,203
I don't like closed doors.

723
01:00:29,250 --> 01:00:32,086
I can't find it.
I must have dropped it somewhere else.

724
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:44,474
I'll look for your earring later.

725
01:00:44,557 --> 01:00:48,269
It's okay. I have a drop by somewhere,
so I'll go straight to the airport.

726
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:51,439
Isn't it a night flight?
Maybe later today…

727
01:00:51,522 --> 01:00:54,025
Don't bother. It's fine.

728
01:00:55,902 --> 01:00:58,112
Take care. Stay healthy.

729
01:00:59,739 --> 01:01:01,824
And what's next? A farewell?

730
01:01:01,908 --> 01:01:05,161
-You talk as if we'll never meet again.
-We have no reason to.

731
01:01:06,287 --> 01:01:07,413
Woo-yeon.

732
01:01:08,623 --> 01:01:10,667
Thank you for everything, Woo-yeon.

733
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:12,335
Thank you, sir.

734
01:01:12,418 --> 01:01:14,170
I'm the one who should thank you.

735
01:01:15,713 --> 01:01:17,715
Woo-yeon, this is the map
to Cafe Metaphor.

736
01:01:17,799 --> 01:01:19,592
Oh, thank you.

737
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:22,303
Why do you always go to bookstores
and book cafes?

738
01:01:22,387 --> 01:01:24,097
That's what I do to relax.

739
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:25,682
I'll miss you.

740
01:01:26,474 --> 01:01:27,892
Thank you. Take care.

741
01:01:32,313 --> 01:01:33,815
-What?
-What?

742
01:01:34,649 --> 01:01:37,652
You never know how we'll meet again.
You can't treat me like this.

743
01:01:37,735 --> 01:01:39,487
We won't meet again ever.

744
01:01:40,905 --> 01:01:43,741
Thank you for everything
you've done for me. Bye.

745
01:02:10,977 --> 01:02:13,312
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

746
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:21,404
Are you crazy?

747
01:02:21,487 --> 01:02:24,407
Why did you throw yourself
at me because of something like that?

748
01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:26,325
I was just trying to save you.

749
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:28,870
I never asked you to.
Why would put others before you like that?

750
01:02:28,953 --> 01:02:31,831
What if something happens to you?
What if you get hurt?

751
01:02:31,914 --> 01:02:33,583
No one will take responsibility.

752
01:02:33,666 --> 01:02:36,252
Don't meddle in other people's lives.
There's no need.

753
01:02:37,503 --> 01:02:41,007
Take care of yourself before others.

754
01:02:49,182 --> 01:02:51,309
Do you think I did that
because I wanted to?

755
01:02:51,893 --> 01:02:53,603
Did I throw myself because I wanted to?

756
01:02:53,686 --> 01:02:56,063
I just did it without thinking
because I was worried.

757
01:02:56,814 --> 01:02:59,859
I knew you were a mean selfish jerk,

758
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:02,195
but you're just unbelievable.

759
01:03:04,238 --> 01:03:07,950
Fine. Good luck
with your damn selfish life.

760
01:03:09,243 --> 01:03:10,369
You jerk.

761
01:03:38,773 --> 01:03:39,941
Next.

762
01:03:52,411 --> 01:03:53,746
That jerk.

763
01:04:03,798 --> 01:04:06,300
Hello, may I ask you something?

764
01:04:06,384 --> 01:04:07,635
Do you know where Cafe Metaphor is?

765
01:04:08,219 --> 01:04:09,929
CAFE METAPHOR

766
01:04:11,097 --> 01:04:13,182
I'm CEO On Jun-su
of Metaphor Publishing House.

767
01:04:15,351 --> 01:04:16,894
I didn't know you'd come.

768
01:04:18,062 --> 01:04:20,648
You've refused to meet with us
many times before.

769
01:04:21,607 --> 01:04:23,150
You've come a long way to see me.

770
01:04:23,734 --> 01:04:25,570
So what brings you to Jeju Island?

771
01:04:26,153 --> 01:04:29,657
It'd be too trite if I told you
that I came here to meet you.

772
01:04:30,616 --> 01:04:34,245
I came for something else, but I wanted
to see you while I was here.

773
01:04:34,912 --> 01:04:36,372
I've read your email.

774
01:04:36,455 --> 01:04:39,041
You wanted to make
a calligraphy photo book of Seoul.

775
01:04:39,125 --> 01:04:40,251
Why does it have to be Seoul?

776
01:04:40,334 --> 01:04:43,212
We recently published
a Seoul-themed novel collection.

777
01:04:43,296 --> 01:04:45,339
And there was a comment that impressed me.

778
01:04:45,423 --> 01:04:48,050
"Seoul is such a cold
and competitive city,

779
01:04:48,134 --> 01:04:50,887
but there's something pretty
about it, which is comforting."

780
01:04:51,637 --> 01:04:53,431
And I wanted to show the pretty part.

781
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:55,266
That sounds nice.

782
01:04:57,018 --> 01:04:58,811
I'm afraid I can't do that.

783
01:05:00,605 --> 01:05:01,981
May I ask why?

784
01:05:02,607 --> 01:05:04,400
I don't think I can find

785
01:05:04,984 --> 01:05:07,361
the side of Seoul
that's not cold or competitive.

786
01:05:17,622 --> 01:05:21,417
CAFE METAPHOR

787
01:05:34,305 --> 01:05:36,766
-We meet again.
-Hello.

788
01:05:37,808 --> 01:05:39,268
I guess you like books.

789
01:05:40,645 --> 01:05:41,687
I do like books.

790
01:05:42,605 --> 01:05:44,815
-Well, then.
-I liked your postcard.

791
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:48,444
Did you write the phrases
on your social media yourself?

792
01:05:49,278 --> 01:05:51,030
Well, yes.

793
01:05:51,113 --> 01:05:52,448
There are copyright issues,

794
01:05:52,531 --> 01:05:55,534
and I thought it would
be more sincere that way.

795
01:05:55,618 --> 01:05:57,453
It's like my journal.

796
01:05:58,746 --> 01:06:00,831
I bet it's the prettiest journal
in the world.

797
01:06:02,750 --> 01:06:05,419
I liked the phrases
as well as your calligraphy.

798
01:06:07,505 --> 01:06:09,006
Thank you for saying that.

799
01:06:09,090 --> 01:06:11,384
I didn't do anything
to deserve your gratitude.

800
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:15,721
Actually, I've been feeling
rather down lately.

801
01:06:16,263 --> 01:06:18,140
But what you just told me cheered me up.

802
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:21,268
I guess I love my job.

803
01:06:21,852 --> 01:06:25,564
Things will get even harder.
The more you like it, the harder it gets.

804
01:06:26,524 --> 01:06:29,068
But I hope you will keep it up.

805
01:06:29,819 --> 01:06:30,903
Bye, then.

806
01:06:58,931 --> 01:07:03,019
That jerk.
Even that stranger was nice to me.

807
01:07:04,895 --> 01:07:05,980
Am I the jerk?

808
01:07:10,526 --> 01:07:11,569
What?

809
01:07:13,779 --> 01:07:16,032
What took you so long? I've been waiting.

810
01:07:17,408 --> 01:07:18,993
I guess you felt bad.

811
01:07:20,077 --> 01:07:21,746
Go ahead and apologize.

812
01:07:21,829 --> 01:07:23,539
For what?

813
01:07:24,915 --> 01:07:26,167
Really?

814
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:28,169
"I'm sorry that I yelled at you.

815
01:07:28,252 --> 01:07:30,421
I'm sorry I was ungrateful."
Can't you say that?

816
01:07:30,504 --> 01:07:31,964
Why would I say such a thing?

817
01:07:33,215 --> 01:07:35,885
I'm not sorry or thankful to you.

818
01:07:35,968 --> 01:07:38,054
If I feel sorry or thankful,

819
01:07:38,137 --> 01:07:39,555
you will be like that again.

820
01:07:40,431 --> 01:07:43,309
You'll continue to do that.
You'll put yourself in danger again

821
01:07:43,392 --> 01:07:44,810
without caring about yourself.

822
01:07:44,894 --> 01:07:47,521
Do you think I'm a fool? Am I an idiot?

823
01:07:48,773 --> 01:07:50,483
I don't do that to just anyone.

824
01:07:50,566 --> 01:07:53,402
Whoever it is you do it for,
just don't do it.

825
01:07:55,863 --> 01:07:56,906
And…

826
01:07:58,699 --> 01:07:59,658
I'm thirsty.

827
01:08:03,454 --> 01:08:04,580
I'm thirsty.

828
01:08:17,843 --> 01:08:20,346
It's grazed. It'll leave a scar.

829
01:08:21,055 --> 01:08:22,389
I'm okay…

830
01:08:34,401 --> 01:08:37,738
Darn, I wouldn't have gotten hurt
if it weren't for you.

831
01:08:37,822 --> 01:08:39,073
Are you going to hog that?

832
01:08:46,247 --> 01:08:47,832
Hey, you fool.

833
01:08:48,999 --> 01:08:50,000
Give me that.

834
01:08:52,211 --> 01:08:54,171
-I'll do it.
-Don't apply it on the scar.

835
01:08:54,255 --> 01:08:55,631
Apply it around the sacr.

836
01:08:55,714 --> 01:08:57,800
To prevent a secondary infection.

837
01:09:23,701 --> 01:09:26,620
-This is apple juice.
-Yes, it's apple juice.

838
01:09:32,168 --> 01:09:35,004
-Is it a token of apology?
-It's just juice.

839
01:09:41,051 --> 01:09:42,261
What time is your flight?

840
01:09:42,344 --> 01:09:44,513
Nine in the evening.

841
01:09:44,597 --> 01:09:46,557
-Are you really leaving tonight?
-Yes.

842
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:49,351
I'm leaving tonight, and I'm busy.

843
01:09:49,435 --> 01:09:51,187
I'm handing out postcards at bookstores.

844
01:09:52,396 --> 01:09:53,522
Shall we get busy together?

845
01:09:55,774 --> 01:09:57,610
These are samples.

846
01:09:57,693 --> 01:09:59,236
If you get any orders,

847
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:02,364
please send me a message
on my social media. Thank you.

848
01:10:05,117 --> 01:10:06,911
WIND BLOWS TO PASS THROUGH

849
01:10:06,994 --> 01:10:08,871
SEE YOU AGAIN

850
01:10:09,455 --> 01:10:11,665
Hello, I'm Calligrapher Gyeong Woo-yeon.

851
01:10:11,749 --> 01:10:14,418
This is a postcard I made.

852
01:10:14,501 --> 01:10:17,171
Can you put it on display there?

853
01:10:17,254 --> 01:10:19,089
-Okay. Leave them here.
-Thank you.

854
01:10:23,802 --> 01:10:26,263
SEE YOU AGAIN

855
01:10:33,938 --> 01:10:35,981
-Thank you.
-Bye.

856
01:11:15,688 --> 01:11:17,898
People still use compasses?

857
01:11:17,982 --> 01:11:20,067
There are always people who get lost.

858
01:11:20,818 --> 01:11:22,361
I guess you're right.

859
01:11:22,444 --> 01:11:24,446
Do you have more postcards?

860
01:11:24,530 --> 01:11:26,198
I'm done handing them out.

861
01:11:27,199 --> 01:11:30,411
I went to so many places. I wonder
how many of them will contact me.

862
01:11:31,996 --> 01:11:34,581
-Will any of them contact me?
-They will.

863
01:11:35,708 --> 01:11:37,167
You're just saying that.

864
01:11:37,251 --> 01:11:39,461
Are you a twisted doughnut?
Why are you so twisted?

865
01:11:40,462 --> 01:11:42,298
A doughnut is sweet at least.

866
01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:45,175
My life is bitter.

867
01:11:57,730 --> 01:11:59,815
What's this bubble tea for?

868
01:11:59,898 --> 01:12:01,942
You said it's bitter.
So I got you something sweet.

869
01:12:14,413 --> 01:12:15,247
Here.

870
01:12:19,501 --> 01:12:22,087
-So that I don't get lost?
-It's okay to get lost.

871
01:12:22,963 --> 01:12:24,423
You like superstitions.

872
01:12:25,174 --> 01:12:26,633
You can keep it as a talisman.

873
01:12:33,766 --> 01:12:36,810
-A talisman?
-That's what makes you feel safe.

874
01:12:38,437 --> 01:12:40,064
You can use that to feel safe.

875
01:12:40,147 --> 01:12:41,732
It's okay to get lost.

876
01:12:42,441 --> 01:12:43,984
It will tell you where to go.

877
01:12:46,528 --> 01:12:49,114
Why do you keep giving me things
like my grandma?

878
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:52,409
Because I'm glad to see you. I was bored.

879
01:13:00,250 --> 01:13:02,127
Why are you so bored all the time?

880
01:13:03,504 --> 01:13:05,214
I get bored often.

881
01:13:08,509 --> 01:13:10,052
Visit again later, Woo-yeon.

882
01:13:10,844 --> 01:13:12,346
I had fun with you.

883
01:13:15,933 --> 01:13:17,101
I see.

884
01:13:26,777 --> 01:13:27,694
Why?

885
01:13:28,278 --> 01:13:29,905
You keep giving me sweet things,

886
01:13:31,990 --> 01:13:33,951
so I keep forgetting
that my life is bitter.

887
01:13:44,837 --> 01:13:46,713
I like you very much

888
01:13:46,797 --> 01:13:48,090
and I've

889
01:13:49,383 --> 01:13:50,592
liked you for a long time.

890
01:13:50,676 --> 01:13:53,971
I'm sorry. I just see you as my friend.

891
01:13:54,847 --> 01:13:58,517
Whenever I come back,
no matter how long I'm gone,

892
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:00,227
I always want to see you

893
01:14:01,228 --> 01:14:02,229
as a friend.

894
01:14:45,063 --> 01:14:46,523
Let's end it here

895
01:14:47,691 --> 01:14:51,069
and never see each other again.

896
01:14:55,365 --> 01:14:57,826
You push me away like that all the time.

897
01:15:00,454 --> 01:15:02,206
I've always had bad relationships.

898
01:15:02,789 --> 01:15:05,792
I just dated anyone even though
I didn't have feelings for them.

899
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:12,591
Since I started liking you,
I couldn't like anyone else.

900
01:15:13,759 --> 01:15:15,886
I don't even know
if you're a prince or a witch,

901
01:15:16,887 --> 01:15:19,181
but I've always been
haunted by you like a curse.

902
01:15:22,017 --> 01:15:23,685
It's too hard for me.

903
01:15:30,234 --> 01:15:32,027
I really want to put an end to it.

904
01:15:35,697 --> 01:15:37,282
That's your business.

905
01:15:40,077 --> 01:15:43,121
-What?
-I said I want us to stay friends.

906
01:15:43,205 --> 01:15:44,790
I said I want to keep seeing you.

907
01:15:45,499 --> 01:15:48,627
I let you have your way three years ago,
so it's your turn to do so.

908
01:15:51,046 --> 01:15:52,756
You only care about your feelings.

909
01:15:52,839 --> 01:15:56,051
Bad guys always care
only about themselves.

910
01:15:57,719 --> 01:15:59,054
You told me

911
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:01,640
to take care of myself before others.

912
01:16:02,724 --> 01:16:06,186
Whether it's a curse or something else,

913
01:16:07,229 --> 01:16:08,730
I'm ending everything here today.

914
01:16:08,814 --> 01:16:10,399
How?

915
01:16:10,941 --> 01:16:13,610
Whether it's a curse, me,
or something else?

916
01:16:15,946 --> 01:16:19,866
There's only one simple way
to lift a curse.

917
01:16:26,957 --> 01:16:28,125
A kiss.

918
01:16:49,855 --> 01:16:51,023
The curse

919
01:16:53,108 --> 01:16:54,192
is lifted now.

920
01:17:25,766 --> 01:17:28,060
There's a flower breeze
when there are no flowers.

921
01:17:28,143 --> 01:17:30,395
A flower breeze? What's that?

922
01:17:30,479 --> 01:17:32,856
A breeze that blows
when flowers are about to bloom.

923
01:17:35,233 --> 01:17:36,109
There's a flower.

924
01:17:39,488 --> 01:17:41,782
Here's the prettiest flower in the world.

925
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:46,787
You're a breeze.
You just go around everywhere.

926
01:17:46,870 --> 01:17:49,665
Then I'll be a flower breeze.
It sounds pretty.

927
01:17:52,417 --> 01:17:54,419
Now that I think of it, it's so mean.

928
01:17:54,503 --> 01:17:56,713
Why does the breeze blow
and drop all the petals?

929
01:17:57,464 --> 01:18:00,759
It doesn't come to drop the petals.
It probably just came to see the flowers.

930
01:18:24,825 --> 01:18:26,118
I said I won't see him again.

931
01:18:26,201 --> 01:18:29,371
If it was that easy to lift the curse,
it wouldn't have taken ten years.

932
01:18:29,454 --> 01:18:31,415
It's lifted anyway.

933
01:18:32,249 --> 01:18:35,293
-You haven't aged at all.
-Does Woo-yeon know you're here?

934
01:18:35,377 --> 01:18:37,629
Don't you go see her.
Don't even go near her.

935
01:18:37,713 --> 01:18:38,630
Woo-yeon.

936
01:18:38,714 --> 01:18:42,426
-Get off me. What are you doing?
-Be quiet. A pervert is following you.

937
01:18:42,509 --> 01:18:44,553
I'm CEO On Jun-su
of Metaphor Publishing House.

938
01:18:44,636 --> 01:18:46,930
-What?
-I told you I like books.

939
01:18:47,013 --> 01:18:48,765
We're preparing a calligraphy photo book.

940
01:18:48,849 --> 01:18:49,933
I want you to do it.

941
01:18:50,016 --> 01:18:51,685
Hello, Woo-yeon.

942
01:18:51,768 --> 01:18:53,478
Why did you ignore me when I said hi?

943
01:18:53,562 --> 01:18:55,105
Why are you so upset?

944
01:18:55,188 --> 01:18:57,107
You rejected me. Twice.

945
01:18:57,607 --> 01:18:59,735
-Let's not meet again.
-No, we'll meet again.

946
01:18:59,818 --> 01:19:01,987
I've decided to keep seeing you.

947
01:19:02,070 --> 01:19:07,075
