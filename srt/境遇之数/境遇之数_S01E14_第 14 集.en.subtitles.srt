1
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:51,384
So get away from my unhappy life.

2
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:53,803
What?

3
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,015
Let's

4
00:00:58,016 --> 00:00:59,976
break up.

5
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:02,187
What do you mean?

6
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:05,690
How can we break up? That's nonsense.

7
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:08,401
That makes the most sense to me.

8
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:14,866
My situation

9
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:19,287
keeps hurting you.

10
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:23,750
And you keep apologizing to me
when you did nothing wrong.

11
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:27,879
It's not my fault either,
but I keep feeling sorry.

12
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:30,715
That's what makes me upset.

13
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,093
If I don't like my boyfriend,

14
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:35,845
it will ruin my relationship.

15
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,059
But if I don't like myself,

16
00:01:43,728 --> 00:01:45,480
I will be ruining my life.

17
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:51,778
So…

18
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:56,241
Let's break up, Hyeon-jae.

19
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:04,374
No.

20
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:07,669
I can't.

21
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:15,260
You always let me get my way.

22
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,389
So do it this time too.

23
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:51,022
Wear these shoes

24
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:54,859
and go to a nice place
and meet a nice person

25
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:58,529
so I can't even think
about going back to you.

26
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:01,699
So I can't even dare to miss you.

27
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:06,955
Meet someone really nice.

28
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,204
What?

29
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,497
It's your brother.

30
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:51,541
Did you study hard?

31
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:53,126
Will you stop worrying about me?

32
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:57,255
Then you should grow up quickly.

33
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:06,014
No. You should grow up slowly.

34
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,850
I'm an adult,

35
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:11,102
so you take your time.

36
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:13,896
Right.

37
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:24,198
Do you want me to push you?

38
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,456
No.

39
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,335
You're supposed
to ride a swing on your own.

40
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,823
Why do you think
Pinocchio's nose got longer?

41
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:07,241
Because he lied.

42
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:10,495
No. I mean,
why did it have to be his nose?

43
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:12,246
There are other parts of the body.

44
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:15,750
Like his arms, legs, or tongue.

45
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:18,628
I don't know.

46
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,840
-So do you want this?
-Yes.

47
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,345
Buy me one.

48
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:34,852
At least you could use Pinocchio's nose
to hit others legally.

49
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:39,190
Wouldn't it be better to break it off
and swing it around?

50
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:04,674
If you have something to say, say it.
Why are you standing there like that?

51
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:06,843
Me?

52
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:09,428
You've been drinking a lot of water.

53
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,738
-Mom.
-What?

54
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:32,702
I'm planning to go on a trip.

55
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,829
Where?

56
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:36,330
Here and there.

57
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:37,582
Are you going far away?

58
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:42,086
Around the world.

59
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:45,423
Travel around the world?

60
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:49,343
That'll take a long time.
What about your work?

61
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:50,803
And how will you pay for that?

62
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:53,598
It's not like I work in an office,

63
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:55,475
so it wouldn't be a problem.

64
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:59,353
And I saved up some money
to open my own workshop.

65
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:00,271
I can use that.

66
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,983
Did he ask you to join him?

67
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:05,818
No.

68
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:11,574
It's true that I'm going with him.

69
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:18,331
It's not just because he asked me.

70
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:29,133
I gave it a lot of thought
while working on the photo book.

71
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:34,430
I love my job as a calligrapher,

72
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:38,726
but I still want to write.

73
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:45,858
I've always wanted to travel
around the world someday,

74
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:47,610
so this is a good chance.

75
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:52,156
I'm thinking of writing a travel essay
once I come back.

76
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,787
Do what you want.

77
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:00,373
What?

78
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:03,084
You're not opposing?

79
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:07,713
Why would I go against it
when I can't live your life for you?

80
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:11,884
Why are you being so cool?

81
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,263
You never listened to me anyway.

82
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:20,768
All the times I didn't listen to you
is finally paying off.

83
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,189
It's not like I'm always right.

84
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:27,692
Come to think of it,

85
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:31,279
I've always been against things
you wanted to do.

86
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,908
You are doing just fine,

87
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:37,285
but I brought you down

88
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:40,580
under the guise
of being concerned for you.

89
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:47,628
I know you were just worried.

90
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:51,966
If I were you,
I would've said the same thing.

91
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,804
I really liked your book.

92
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:59,557
You're doing really well. Thank you.

93
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:03,144
I'm good because I'm your daughter.

94
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:07,690
Make sure to use protection.

95
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,526
What?

96
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:18,242
Mom, I don't want to have
an open conversation with you like that.

97
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:26,167
What?

98
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:29,879
Gosh, Woo-yeon. You are gambling
your life on love.

99
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:32,632
It's not like I'm just tagging along.

100
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:35,926
I'm thinking of writing
a travel essay when I'm back.

101
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,220
I'll keep uploading my work
on social media.

102
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:40,640
So you have plans.

103
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:42,600
I see. I'm glad to hear that.

104
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:45,269
I'm done talking.

105
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:47,355
You two said you had
something to talk about.

106
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:50,399
I have really big news, so I'll go last.

107
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:51,567
You go first.

108
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:59,200
I broke up with Hyeon-jae.

109
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,085
You don't have to be stiff like that.
It feels awkward.

110
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:12,213
I was thinking of the right words to say.

111
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:14,131
You don't have to be like that.

112
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:17,510
I don't want you to feel
uncomfortable as well.

113
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:20,304
-Do you want us to console you?
-Yes.

114
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:24,433
I broke up with him, so I'm not sure
if I deserve any consolation.

115
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:27,895
You don't need to earn consolation.
If you need it, you just get it.

116
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,606
But I'm too ashamed to be consoled.

117
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:32,316
I'll console you anyway.

118
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:35,903
Cry if you want.

119
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:38,531
Right. Go ahead and cry.

120
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:44,120
Get off me. It's hot.

121
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:46,205
-No, I don't want to.
-Me neither.

122
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:52,002
What about you, Jin-ju?
You had something to say.

123
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:55,256
-Me?
-Yes.

124
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:03,264
It's nothing.

125
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:05,683
What?

126
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,271
Why did she break up with you?

127
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:18,279
I don't know.

128
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:21,449
Why didn't you stop her
if you knew you'd suffer?

129
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:24,452
I don't know why we should break up,

130
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,620
but I do know well

131
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:31,709
why I shouldn't cling to her.

132
00:12:58,652 --> 00:12:59,904
She seems fine.

133
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:16,795
Why do you keep coming here every night?

134
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:32,770
Yeong-hui and Hyeon-jae broke up.

135
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,647
I heard that too.

136
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:36,982
Did you hear that from Hyeon-jae?

137
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:38,150
Yes.

138
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,737
How would we break up later?

139
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:46,200
Why are you thinking
about breaking up already?

140
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:47,743
I'm just saying.

141
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:50,746
As I saw Yeong-hui and Hyeon-jae,

142
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:53,374
I realized nothing lasts forever
in this world.

143
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:57,711
We might end up breaking up.

144
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:02,383
If you have someone else
in your future instead of me,

145
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:03,342
you should see him.

146
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:08,264
But…

147
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:12,935
I don't think I can do that.

148
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:19,525
You're always in my future.
I don't think there's anyone else.

149
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:24,697
So if we break up by any chance,

150
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,408
it will be you who will leave, not me.

151
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:28,909
That's not true.

152
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,328
Do you want to make a bet?

153
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:34,248
The one who wants to break up first
has to grant the other's wish.

154
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:36,959
What use would that be after breaking up?

155
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,669
So let's not break up.

156
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,504
Okay.

157
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:48,345
How is the re-cover design

158
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:51,432
for Metaphor's 20th Anniversary
World Literature Series going?

159
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:54,560
We have the draft ready,
so we're looking for a calligrapher.

160
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:57,980
We can ask Ms. Gyeong Woo-yeon.

161
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:01,275
Her work is expressive,
and her book is being well received.

162
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:06,155
I called her already,
but she's not available.

163
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:08,657
She's going on a trip with her boyfriend
for a while.

164
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,045
What's the matter?

165
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:23,422
Are you all right?

166
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:26,008
No, I'm not.

167
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:29,136
I should be okay, but I'm not.
So I'm disappointed

168
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:31,472
in myself, which is not okay.

169
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:34,058
Are you going to meet Ms. Gyeong?

170
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,437
If I go, will she see me?

171
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:42,900
There's something you're good at.

172
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,611
Making excuses to see her.

173
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:49,615
I can't think of any good excuses.

174
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:52,159
It has to be good this time.

175
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:55,287
Everyday Life to You, Trip to Me.

176
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:56,830
We're reprinting the book.

177
00:15:57,539 --> 00:16:00,000
Under Article 9, Clause 2
of the publication contract,

178
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:01,627
we must notify her of the reprint.

179
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:04,797
Apparently, Ms. Jung Ga-eun is

180
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:07,758
having a meeting with her this afternoon.

181
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:21,313
We didn't know we'd be reprinting
your book so fast.

182
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:22,398
Congratulations.

183
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:24,858
It's too bad that you didn't know. I did.

184
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:27,277
Thanks for congratulating me.

185
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:31,198
Did you meet Ms. Gyeong too?

186
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:33,742
She's meeting with someone else now.

187
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:36,745
-Who?
-Our CEO.

188
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:41,166
Why is he seeing her?

189
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:45,087
He said he'd meet with her personally.

190
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,467
Where are they meeting?

191
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,345
There's a standard publication contract.

192
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,764
Under Article 9, Clause 2,

193
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,850
we must notify you of the reprint.

194
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:02,146
I'm here to congratulate you on it
and say hello.

195
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:03,856
Have a safe trip.

196
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:07,192
I wanted to tell you that in person.

197
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:13,574
I was worried when I heard
you rejected our offer.

198
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:17,745
I'm glad that I'm not the reason
why you rejected it.

199
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:23,083
If you had to reject it because of me,

200
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:26,795
I'd be taking an opportunity
away from you.

201
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,589
When I see you,

202
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:31,759
you look really composed and calm.

203
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:34,553
I have much to learn from you.

204
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:37,681
You seem like a real adult.

205
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,308
I'm not, really.

206
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:44,688
I'm just trying hard to hold back
so I won't make you uncomfortable.

207
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:54,990
When you are back from your trip
after some time,

208
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:57,159
and if you are okay with it,

209
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,037
I want to stay friends with you.

210
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:04,500
As if I've always been your friend,

211
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,502
and all I've done is comfort you.

212
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:08,796
I'm sure I can do that.

213
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,215
Do you not have any friends?

214
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:12,883
Do you want a friend?

215
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:15,719
Then buy me a meal first.

216
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,387
How did you know I was here?

217
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:18,972
By coincidence.

218
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:22,476
Why do you like him?

219
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,479
Because I'm pretty.

220
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,209
Were you jealous earlier?

221
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,461
No.

222
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:51,880
Then what was it? Do you like Mr. On?

223
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,173
I like you.

224
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,680
My boyfriend is really cool.

225
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:02,683
Sure. You want guys
to be cool with everything.

226
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,189
Did you ever

227
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:12,234
get upset with me?

228
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:15,154
I've never been upset with you.

229
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:17,698
I like everything about you.

230
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:19,616
What about you?

231
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:24,371
How can I not be upset when I'm in love?

232
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:28,417
I get more upset because I'm in love,
and I get hurt because I'm in love.

233
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:32,379
But I try to understand everything
because I'm in love.

234
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:35,716
Can't you tell me?

235
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:40,637
I don't want to. You figure it out.

236
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:43,432
Okay.

237
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:45,392
I'll figure it out myself.

238
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:47,269
I'll get the right answers

239
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:49,438
and adjust myself to you.

240
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:04,494
Do you want to drink more?

241
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:06,121
I'm done drinking.

242
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:07,789
I'll drink this, then.

243
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:14,046
Take me home if I get drunk.
Even better if you take me with you.

244
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:16,215
Will you be okay with my parents?

245
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:21,220
Come to think of it,
I should sleep at my place.

246
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:22,763
In my house, in my bed.

247
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:43,533
Gosh. Oh, no.

248
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:44,993
What's wrong?

249
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,120
What's wrong, Woo-yeon? What happened?

250
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:49,164
What's going on?

251
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,207
Stay away!

252
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:07,015
I said I don't want you to get hurt.

253
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:24,616
Jin-ju and Sang-hyeok are dating.

254
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:26,868
I know it too well.

255
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:28,996
I saw it myself,

256
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:31,290
and you said it like 18 times.

257
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,584
It's just too shocking.

258
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:36,712
Why those two?

259
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:40,632
Let's stop talking about other couples
and talk about us.

260
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:43,427
-What about us?
-When should I meet your parents?

261
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:45,721
Why would you meet my parents?

262
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:48,140
-Don't they know you're going with me?
-They know.

263
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:50,392
Then I should go talk to them.

264
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:52,436
They must be worried about
sending you away.

265
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:55,272
Do we really have to do that?

266
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:58,358
I need to win the favor
of my future parents-in-law.

267
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:02,237
Your future parents-in-law?
It's not like we're getting married.

268
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:07,743
Aren't you going to marry me?

269
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:12,039
I mean, marriage is still something
in the far future for us.

270
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:14,374
It's okay to date without getting married,

271
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:17,961
but I want to stay with you
for the rest of my life anyway.

272
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:21,590
Let's meet them this weekend.

273
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:23,425
Sure.

274
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:50,285
Hello? Son, is something wrong?

275
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:52,704
No, not really.

276
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:54,915
I'm just calling you.

277
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:59,795
Hello? Why aren't you talking?

278
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:00,837
I'm just happy.

279
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:03,840
I'm glad you called me
when nothing's going on.

280
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:05,717
This is the first time.

281
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:09,304
Do you have time this Sunday?

282
00:23:09,387 --> 00:23:11,389
Of course I do.

283
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:13,016
Even if I don't, I will make time.

284
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:19,856
Then I'll see you on Sunday, Mom.

285
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:44,214
Hello?

286
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:47,551
Don't be surprised
and listen carefully to me.

287
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:51,304
Su just called
and asked to meet on Sunday.

288
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:53,640
Really? That's great.

289
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:56,601
Where should we go?
Shall I pick you up at home?

290
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:57,769
Why would you do that?

291
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:00,730
You said Su wants to meet up.

292
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:02,732
I know. So why would you?

293
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:06,194
-Didn't he invite me?
-No.

294
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:12,993
-I will ask him, though.
-That'll make me more miserable.

295
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:14,661
Should I not ask, then?

296
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:17,914
You could still ask him.

297
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:20,167
Okay.

298
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:29,843
Why would he leave me out?

299
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:32,971
Darn it.

300
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:38,727
SOJU

301
00:25:19,392 --> 00:25:22,979
I'm sorry. I was going
to grab my stuff and leave.

302
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:26,107
I thought you wouldn't throw these away.

303
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:29,444
I prayed for the first time,

304
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:32,239
and it worked.

305
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:37,702
If my next prayer works again,

306
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:41,331
I should start going to church.

307
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:52,050
Can't we get back together even if I beg?

308
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:54,803
Why would you beg
when you did nothing wrong?

309
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:56,638
If I did nothing wrong,

310
00:25:58,515 --> 00:25:59,557
why are you leaving me?

311
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:01,142
I told you.

312
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:05,188
My situation keeps hurting you.

313
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:07,274
I tried to understand.

314
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:10,360
You said it's hard on you, so I tried hard

315
00:26:10,443 --> 00:26:12,070
to break up with you.

316
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:15,031
But I don't know why we have to break up.

317
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:18,076
I don't understand you.

318
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:21,162
Will you leave me
when I go through hard times?

319
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:27,836
Yes, I will.

320
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:35,760
Even though we dated for ten years,

321
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:38,930
you can't understand me.

322
00:26:58,325 --> 00:27:00,160
I'll ask for the last time.

323
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:05,415
I won't

324
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:08,335
hold onto you ever again.

325
00:27:12,255 --> 00:27:13,631
Do you still want to break up?

326
00:27:18,636 --> 00:27:19,679
Yes.

327
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:22,223
I do.

328
00:27:31,649 --> 00:27:32,776
Okay.

329
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:36,738
Let's break up.

330
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:18,530
We're going to all of them?

331
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:20,281
Gosh, it'll be really tough.

332
00:28:20,907 --> 00:28:23,660
Not all of them,
but it'll still be a tight schedule.

333
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:25,829
It will be fun, though.

334
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:34,087
This one is good.

335
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:40,009
No. The bed is too big.

336
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:41,636
I want to sleep right next to you.

337
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:46,182
This place looks nice.

338
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:48,226
-What?
-A single bed.

339
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:03,116
My mom told you
to come by 6 p.m. tomorrow.

340
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:04,659
Okay. I won't be late.

341
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:06,494
Go in.

342
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:09,456
I can't if you don't let go.

343
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:10,582
I don't want to.

344
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:18,465
We don't have to be apart anymore.

345
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:21,301
That's right.

346
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:23,511
We're leaving soon.

347
00:29:40,653 --> 00:29:41,738
LEE SU

348
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:04,761
GYEONG WOO

349
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:18,441
WOO-YEON'S SU

350
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:29,661
GYEONG WOO-YEON'S SU

351
00:30:35,124 --> 00:30:37,335
PRODUCER CHOI JEONG-HYEON

352
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:43,007
Sorry for calling you out on a Sunday.

353
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:46,386
It's okay. So why did you want to see me?

354
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:49,222
The main character of our next drama

355
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:50,515
is a calligrapher.

356
00:30:50,598 --> 00:30:52,433
I thought you were a movie producer.

357
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:54,853
We make both movies and dramas.

358
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:58,022
Let me cut to the chase.

359
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:01,818
We'd like you to do the drama title
and be the body double for the actress.

360
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:07,866
I'm sorry but I can't

361
00:31:08,491 --> 00:31:09,659
for personal reasons.

362
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:13,872
If this is about the last time,
I apologize again.

363
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:18,751
I strongly recommended you this time,
so it won't happen again.

364
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:22,171
It's true I'm still
a little upset about it,

365
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:24,799
but I have other reasons.

366
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:27,594
-I'm going to travel--
-I know I may sound cold,

367
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:30,179
but opportunities don't wait.

368
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:37,312
We are a little short on time,
so we'd like your definite answer.

369
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,331
-Yes?
-Su, where are you?

370
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:58,291
I'm out for something.

371
00:31:58,374 --> 00:32:00,919
-Alone?
-No. I'm…

372
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:02,045
Son.

373
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:04,631
Oh, are you with your mom?

374
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:06,132
Yes. Why?

375
00:32:08,509 --> 00:32:10,386
Nothing. I'll see you later.

376
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:11,930
Okay.

377
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:15,683
You startled me.

378
00:32:16,392 --> 00:32:17,936
Your girlfriend?

379
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:21,981
You punk. I didn't know
you'd talk like that to your girlfriend.

380
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:27,028
So what should I get?

381
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:34,452
Buy this, and it's over.

382
00:32:35,536 --> 00:32:39,332
This is what I bought when I went to meet
your mom's family to ask their permission.

383
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:42,251
Gosh, I got so drunk that day.

384
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:45,463
I won't buy it.

385
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:48,967
-Why not?
-Grandpa doesn't like you.

386
00:32:52,845 --> 00:32:55,556
I'm meeting my girlfriend's parents.
Can you recommend one?

387
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,059
-All right.
-That punk doesn't know anything.

388
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:02,271
He does. My dad doesn't like you.

389
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:16,703
Check on my place
and run my car from time to time.

390
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:19,497
You can't order us around
without paying us.

391
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:22,792
If I pay you, you're a butler.
If I don't, you're a parent.

392
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:24,544
It's your choice.

393
00:33:24,627 --> 00:33:27,088
Oh, dear.

394
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:30,883
But I'd like you to be a parent.

395
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:36,222
-Thank you for today.
-What's with you today?

396
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:38,349
I won't hate you anymore.

397
00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:43,229
I have someone who cares for me now.

398
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:52,739
I booked a restaurant for you.
Enjoy your dinner.

399
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:56,034
Thank you, son. We will enjoy it.

400
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:58,119
I'll buy you a meal
when I return your card.

401
00:33:58,202 --> 00:34:00,413
Buy me something expensive.
I'll bring Woo-yeon.

402
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:08,046
Our son grew up really well.

403
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:10,381
I know.

404
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:13,634
He grew up so well
when he had immature parents.

405
00:34:14,677 --> 00:34:15,762
I'm grateful.

406
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:24,604
-Try this.
-Okay.

407
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:28,107
It's good.

408
00:34:33,946 --> 00:34:36,157
Gosh, will you stop? Is something wrong?

409
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,867
Why are you sighing so deeply?

410
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:43,456
Woo-yeon, is something wrong?

411
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:55,384
My daughter and I talked about
old times over some drinks a few days ago.

412
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:57,595
And she said she was hurt

413
00:34:57,678 --> 00:35:00,306
because I was too strict on her
when she was young.

414
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:04,560
I thought I just had to feed
and house her as a parent.

415
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:08,481
But now I regret
not showing more faith in her,

416
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:09,816
comforting her more,

417
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:13,361
and telling her that I loved her.

418
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:15,404
Do you know what I regret most

419
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:17,448
about not being well-educated?

420
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:19,617
What is it?

421
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,536
Acting stupid and unrefined.

422
00:35:22,703 --> 00:35:25,623
I lost my temper, yelled at you,

423
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:28,960
and took out my anger on you.

424
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:32,880
Children

425
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:36,592
deliberately break their parents' hearts,

426
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:39,178
but parents do that without knowing.

427
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:43,683
The wounds in my children's hearts are

428
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:47,270
even deeper than the ones in mine,

429
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:51,566
but I didn't know that.

430
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,778
How many wounds did I leave in your heart?

431
00:35:56,612 --> 00:35:58,156
You didn't leave

432
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:00,491
any wounds in my heart.

433
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:05,163
You're lying.

434
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:07,456
I can think of dozens already.

435
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:10,751
It's really annoying.

436
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:12,545
Remembering all that is why…

437
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,053
I have

438
00:36:21,762 --> 00:36:23,681
shards of broken glass in here.

439
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:29,061
They cut me every time I touch them.

440
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:34,817
But you grabbed them
and stabbed my heart with them.

441
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:38,404
So they hurt you too.

442
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:43,409
You silly thing.

443
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:46,746
You could've just driven a nail
in my heart like the others.

444
00:36:48,122 --> 00:36:49,832
Why did you grab the shards of glass?

445
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:52,293
They tore your hands up too.

446
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:15,983
Why are you hugging me?

447
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:18,319
They all are shards of glass.

448
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,997
It feels like we've gotten closer with Su.
I'm glad.

449
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:31,249
Me too.

450
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:37,380
Oh, right.

451
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:39,715
You liked steak.

452
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:41,842
I like meat.

453
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:50,434
Shall we go to a recital after dinner?

454
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:01,529
PIANIST SON SANG-HO'S SOLO RECITAL

455
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:08,286
You seemed to like that pianist.

456
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:15,334
Is it not him?

457
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:18,504
It's him.

458
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:21,757
I asked

459
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:26,137
-my friend to get this ticket--
-Now that you try to remember,

460
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:28,347
you remember it, right?

461
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:31,517
What?

462
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:39,025
Actually, I had
lingering feelings for you.

463
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:45,656
It's in the past tense.

464
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:48,492
I don't know.
It might be present progressive.

465
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:55,124
But I want to keep it to myself.

466
00:38:57,126 --> 00:38:59,628
I just want to see you
like this once in a while.

467
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:03,299
People of our age are very cowardly.

468
00:39:03,382 --> 00:39:06,677
We know that people's emotions
are scarier than ghosts

469
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:09,472
that might be in our closets.

470
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:21,525
I guess all I can say

471
00:39:23,235 --> 00:39:24,862
is that I'm sorry.

472
00:39:24,945 --> 00:39:28,282
You're not just cowardly. You've grown up.

473
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:34,372
But it took too long.

474
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:36,290
I forgot

475
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:40,002
that there's a time limit

476
00:39:42,588 --> 00:39:43,964
for finding the right answer.

477
00:39:55,142 --> 00:39:58,437
Do you think you can win me over
with something like this?

478
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,232
We don't need stuff like this.

479
00:40:02,024 --> 00:40:03,484
Just be nice to my daughter.

480
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:10,282
Why are we practicing lines like this?

481
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:13,619
-What if he comes empty-handed?
-We can apply them to other situations.

482
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:17,164
So should we talk sternly like this?

483
00:40:17,873 --> 00:40:19,250
Just go.

484
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:21,293
Okay. Let's do it.

485
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:24,046
No, just go bring them in.

486
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,089
All right.

487
00:40:25,881 --> 00:40:27,925
I'll be right back, then.

488
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:37,685
What are you doing out here?

489
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:42,398
Well, Su. The thing is…

490
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:44,650
What are you doing there?

491
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:49,363
-Come on in.
-Yes, sir.

492
00:40:50,322 --> 00:40:51,907
Let's go. They're waiting.

493
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:54,118
Wait.

494
00:40:55,327 --> 00:40:56,495
I have something to say.

495
00:40:57,705 --> 00:40:58,914
Let's talk inside.

496
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:15,681
This is just as we predicted.

497
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:17,183
Good.

498
00:41:22,396 --> 00:41:25,691
Do you think you can win me over
with something like this?

499
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:28,986
We don't need stuff like this.

500
00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:30,821
Just be nice to my daughter.

501
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:34,950
I'll be nice to Woo-yeon

502
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:36,827
and to you as well.

503
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:42,917
Please open it.

504
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,217
If you don't like it, I can exchange it.

505
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:54,345
-The thing is--
-My goodness.

506
00:41:54,428 --> 00:41:56,013
This is really expensive. How…

507
00:41:56,096 --> 00:41:58,098
Gosh, this liquor…

508
00:41:59,391 --> 00:42:00,768
This is very rare.

509
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,145
My goodness.

510
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:07,316
Wait. I have something to say.

511
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:13,072
-Let's eat first.
-Okay.

512
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:23,123
I'm not going.

513
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:30,005
I can't go on the trip.

514
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:52,903
Have you made up your mind?

515
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:08,460
Are you upset?

516
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:12,548
Why would I be upset?

517
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:16,760
I decided it on my own
without consulting you.

518
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:19,638
I'm not upset.

519
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:24,101
I can't give up on my dream either.

520
00:43:24,184 --> 00:43:25,728
How could I be mad at you

521
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,480
and tell you to give up on yours?

522
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:40,451
Should I stay here too?

523
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:54,173
You have to go.

524
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:58,802
Will you be okay while I'm away?

525
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:02,014
How could I be okay?

526
00:44:04,266 --> 00:44:07,436
But I can't achieve your dream for you.

527
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:10,064
And you can't achieve
my dream for me, either.

528
00:44:10,939 --> 00:44:14,443
If one of us gives up, we'll end up
feeling resentment toward the other.

529
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:16,737
That's not what I want.

530
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:26,288
Are you afraid

531
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:29,083
that we might break up?

532
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:32,461
That's not what I'm worried about.

533
00:44:35,714 --> 00:44:36,924
But it's the timing.

534
00:44:47,267 --> 00:44:50,854
I don't believe in the saying,

535
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:53,524
"love is all about timing" anymore.

536
00:44:54,983 --> 00:44:57,653
See? We're together right now.

537
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:09,164
I'll be back soon.

538
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:13,419
Come back soon.

539
00:45:13,502 --> 00:45:15,796
Don't make me wait too long.

540
00:45:37,818 --> 00:45:39,403
Have a safe trip.

541
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:42,990
Take good care of yourself.

542
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:49,204
You might miss your flight.

543
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:53,917
Go on.

544
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:02,468
You go first. Then I'll go inside.

545
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:07,473
Call me when you get there.

546
00:47:05,572 --> 00:47:07,366
I love you, Woo-yeon.

547
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:09,868
I love you too.

548
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:18,377
Su left.

549
00:47:25,968 --> 00:47:27,261
Hello?

550
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:29,137
Even your ear is pretty.

551
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:32,975
Good morning, Woo-yeon.

552
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,311
Good morning, my Su.

553
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:37,563
I want to do it again.

554
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:39,064
Good morning, my Yeon.

555
00:47:39,147 --> 00:47:40,983
Nothing changed.

556
00:47:42,734 --> 00:47:43,777
MY SU

557
00:47:45,237 --> 00:47:49,032
Are you brushing your teeth, my Yeon?
Did you brush them thoroughly?

558
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:50,242
Of course.

559
00:47:51,743 --> 00:47:54,162
I'll call you back when I'm done.

560
00:47:58,125 --> 00:47:59,209
MY SU

561
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:02,838
Hello?

562
00:48:06,925 --> 00:48:08,176
I'm nervous.

563
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:11,054
Don't be nervous. You're always the best.

564
00:48:12,806 --> 00:48:14,391
I love you.

565
00:48:14,474 --> 00:48:15,851
I love you too.

566
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:44,588
LIFE IS A VERITABLE BOOMERANG

567
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:55,766
-What will you do tomorrow?
-I'm taking another flight.

568
00:48:55,849 --> 00:48:57,100
How long is the flight?

569
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:00,395
It will take a while.

570
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:02,606
Several times a day,

571
00:49:02,689 --> 00:49:04,483
-I got calls from Su.
-I'm working.

572
00:49:04,566 --> 00:49:07,277
Look. I did a lot of work.

573
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:10,739
We shared our everyday lives.

574
00:49:10,822 --> 00:49:12,324
You look like Samantha.

575
00:49:12,407 --> 00:49:13,575
Who's Samantha?

576
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:14,993
The AI from the movie Her.

577
00:49:15,077 --> 00:49:18,747
You exist only in my phone,
so you're like an AI.

578
00:49:19,915 --> 00:49:21,958
Hello, I'm Sumantha.

579
00:49:22,918 --> 00:49:24,211
And we were still in love.

580
00:49:25,087 --> 00:49:26,463
I'll leave soon.

581
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:29,800
Woo-yeon, I love you.

582
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:34,429
-I love you too.
-Okay.

583
00:49:35,722 --> 00:49:38,350
We got over all the hardships

584
00:49:39,559 --> 00:49:43,230
and lived happily ever after.

585
00:49:47,734 --> 00:49:49,111
It's a lie.

586
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:54,282
NOVEMBER

587
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:58,078
Time passed slower than I thought.

588
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:00,664
And it's been only two months.

589
00:50:05,085 --> 00:50:06,378
MY SU

590
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:09,881
Hello?

591
00:50:10,882 --> 00:50:13,593
-Did you just get home?
-Yes.

592
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:15,554
What about dinner? Did you eat?

593
00:50:16,596 --> 00:50:19,558
-Not yet.
-Oh, no. You should eat.

594
00:50:19,641 --> 00:50:22,602
I thought you were tired
and went to bed early.

595
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:24,062
I thought you were busy.

596
00:50:25,731 --> 00:50:27,232
I waited for your call.

597
00:50:31,903 --> 00:50:33,196
I'm almost home now.

598
00:50:33,822 --> 00:50:34,990
Okay.

599
00:50:35,073 --> 00:50:36,908
It's hard to call often, right?

600
00:50:39,828 --> 00:50:40,829
I'm a little busy.

601
00:50:40,912 --> 00:50:42,372
You look tired.

602
00:50:42,956 --> 00:50:44,666
You must be tired. Go to bed early.

603
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:47,753
No. I can talk more.

604
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:52,215
You'll be busy tomorrow, right?

605
00:50:53,008 --> 00:50:55,677
He called me several times a day at first,

606
00:50:55,761 --> 00:50:57,345
but it became twice a day,

607
00:50:58,513 --> 00:51:00,891
and sometimes, just once a day.

608
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:05,604
I PASSED OUT AFTER
THE ALL-NIGHT SHOOT, SORRY

609
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:13,278
It's okay.

610
00:51:15,197 --> 00:51:16,698
And sometimes,

611
00:51:17,282 --> 00:51:19,659
we just exchanged short text messages.

612
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:22,120
I miss you.

613
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:24,664
I miss you a lot too.

614
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:26,458
I shouldn't have come.

615
00:51:27,083 --> 00:51:28,627
I should've stayed with you.

616
00:51:29,211 --> 00:51:30,545
You should have.

617
00:51:32,839 --> 00:51:34,174
I'm sorry.

618
00:51:35,509 --> 00:51:36,927
Don't be.

619
00:51:38,386 --> 00:51:39,596
It's okay.

620
00:51:41,556 --> 00:51:44,684
Words of longing
turned into words of resentment.

621
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:47,020
What did you do today?

622
00:51:47,103 --> 00:51:48,438
It's always the same.

623
00:51:50,482 --> 00:51:52,067
What about you?

624
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:53,443
It's the same for me too.

625
00:51:58,615 --> 00:51:59,866
Did something happen?

626
00:52:02,327 --> 00:52:03,453
No.

627
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:05,247
Are you all right?

628
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:10,585
Yes.

629
00:52:12,754 --> 00:52:13,797
I'm fine.

630
00:52:16,258 --> 00:52:18,134
As we ran out of memories to live on,

631
00:52:19,761 --> 00:52:21,096
we stopped

632
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:23,557
talking.

633
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:28,186
Is there something
bothering you these days?

634
00:52:33,066 --> 00:52:34,150
No.

635
00:52:36,194 --> 00:52:37,445
I'm just tired.

636
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:42,492
Okay. Get some rest.

637
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:45,996
Goodnight, Woo-yeon. I love you.

638
00:52:48,957 --> 00:52:50,333
You too.

639
00:53:05,807 --> 00:53:08,602
I love you. Stay with me for a long time.

640
00:53:11,354 --> 00:53:12,856
That depends on how good you are.

641
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:03,782
MY SU

642
00:54:08,328 --> 00:54:09,537
Hello?

643
00:54:10,121 --> 00:54:11,373
What were you doing?

644
00:54:11,957 --> 00:54:13,166
I'm going home.

645
00:54:14,209 --> 00:54:15,335
I see.

646
00:54:21,591 --> 00:54:22,926
I'm getting on a plane soon.

647
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:26,888
I'm going to a remote place.
I might be out of touch for a few days.

648
00:54:28,682 --> 00:54:29,891
It's fine.

649
00:54:31,017 --> 00:54:33,561
I kept saying "It's fine" like a spell,

650
00:54:34,062 --> 00:54:37,524
but I was never fine, even for a moment.

651
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:41,861
Lying became my daily routine.

652
00:54:44,906 --> 00:54:46,241
I have something to say.

653
00:54:47,033 --> 00:54:48,785
Really? What is it?

654
00:54:56,292 --> 00:54:57,502
Let's…

655
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:02,257
stop this.

656
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:09,014
I want to break up.

657
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:12,600
Why?

658
00:55:19,149 --> 00:55:20,233
No reason.

659
00:55:23,486 --> 00:55:24,529
It's just…

660
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:31,619
If we keep doing this,
I will end up hating you.

661
00:55:39,252 --> 00:55:40,795
This is too hard for me.

662
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:47,302
Okay.

663
00:55:48,928 --> 00:55:50,096
Let's break up.

664
00:55:52,682 --> 00:55:53,933
Don't cry.

665
00:55:55,351 --> 00:55:56,770
Don't skip meals.

666
00:55:58,396 --> 00:55:59,773
Sleep well.

667
00:56:05,028 --> 00:56:06,404
Take care.

668
00:56:11,659 --> 00:56:13,828
MY SU

669
00:56:27,717 --> 00:56:30,303
The lies we told piled up,

670
00:56:30,386 --> 00:56:31,763
and we drifted apart.

671
00:56:34,766 --> 00:56:35,934
And eventually,

672
00:56:37,602 --> 00:56:38,937
we broke up.

673
00:57:39,747 --> 00:57:41,708
Why did you walk with me?

674
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:45,086
I didn't want you to be
the only one who's strange here.

675
00:57:47,046 --> 00:57:49,549
Sometimes it can be comforting to know
that there's

676
00:57:50,216 --> 00:57:51,926
another person who's strange like me.

677
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:02,270
You're still good at comforting others.

678
00:58:03,605 --> 00:58:05,356
And I'll keep being like this.

679
00:58:06,691 --> 00:58:09,152
You can come if you need me.

680
00:58:11,571 --> 00:58:12,530
I'm serious.

681
00:58:12,614 --> 00:58:15,325
And you're still good
at making me feel ashamed.

682
00:58:19,037 --> 00:58:21,122
Do you remember what I told you before?

683
00:58:21,706 --> 00:58:23,374
The things you said on the phone

684
00:58:23,958 --> 00:58:27,712
were just like how I was feeling.
That's why I warmed up to you.

685
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:30,507
When I saw you,

686
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:32,717
I kept seeing my old self in you.

687
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:35,428
Maybe

688
00:58:36,054 --> 00:58:37,847
I liked you

689
00:58:38,431 --> 00:58:40,266
to comfort myself.

690
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:47,065
I thought I could be happy

691
00:58:48,274 --> 00:58:50,360
if I saw you living happily.

692
00:58:55,114 --> 00:58:56,866
This is what I want to tell you.

693
00:58:58,034 --> 00:59:00,537
If we run into each other
again like today,

694
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:03,081
and you're holding an umbrella again

695
00:59:03,164 --> 00:59:04,666
even when the rain has stopped,

696
00:59:06,042 --> 00:59:07,961
I can walk with you again.

697
00:59:24,852 --> 00:59:28,898
1 YEAR LATER

698
00:59:42,495 --> 00:59:45,582
WOO-YEON CALLIGRAPHY

699
00:59:45,665 --> 00:59:47,458
WHEN A CYCLE ENDS, ANOTHER CYCLE BEGINS

700
00:59:47,542 --> 00:59:49,419
WHERE THE PAST AND PRESENT COEXIST

701
00:59:49,502 --> 00:59:51,879
WHEN A CYCLE ENDS, ANOTHER CYCLE BEGINS

702
00:59:54,716 --> 00:59:56,342
MAKE A WISH

703
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:57,885
I WISH YOU BEAUTIFUL DAYS

704
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:02,849
You've worked on the titles
of many different dramas and movies.

705
01:00:03,349 --> 01:00:06,728
Was there any project
that was particularly memorable to you?

706
01:00:08,855 --> 01:00:10,648
It wasn't a movie or a drama,

707
01:00:10,732 --> 01:00:13,693
but I did a calligraphy photo book
with Metaphor Publishing House.

708
01:00:14,652 --> 01:00:17,697
It's Everyday Life to You, Trip to Me.

709
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:19,157
The book is memorable to me.

710
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:21,909
Is there a special reason for that?

711
01:00:24,203 --> 01:00:25,455
Before that project,

712
01:00:25,538 --> 01:00:28,416
I wasn't sure if calligraphy was
my job or just an avocation.

713
01:00:28,499 --> 01:00:31,919
But working on that book
assured me that it was my job.

714
01:00:33,087 --> 01:00:36,549
The CEO of Metaphor was the first person
to call me a calligrapher.

715
01:00:37,091 --> 01:00:38,509
It was my first time.

716
01:00:39,927 --> 01:00:41,471
The first is always special.

717
01:00:49,312 --> 01:00:53,149
For calligraphy, it's important
to write with your own emotions.

718
01:00:57,070 --> 01:01:00,239
Ms. Gyeong, what are you going to write?

719
01:01:04,035 --> 01:01:05,286
I don't know.

720
01:01:08,539 --> 01:01:10,291
"First love is

721
01:01:11,292 --> 01:01:12,335
like muddy water?"

722
01:01:12,919 --> 01:01:13,836
What?

723
01:01:16,255 --> 01:01:18,883
I forget about it most of the time,
so I think it's gone.

724
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:21,844
But once I step on it, it rises up again.

725
01:01:23,388 --> 01:01:25,056
I guess it's something like that.

726
01:01:33,439 --> 01:01:35,441
WOO-YEON CALLIGRAPHY

727
01:01:48,746 --> 01:01:49,956
Hello?

728
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:51,207
What were you doing?

729
01:01:52,208 --> 01:01:54,836
I just finished my class,
so I was going to work on my own.

730
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:58,715
Can I stop by for a moment?
I have something to give you.

731
01:02:00,591 --> 01:02:01,884
Okay.

732
01:02:18,025 --> 01:02:20,319
FIRST LOVE IS LIKE MUDDY WATER

733
01:02:38,629 --> 01:02:39,505
Hello.

734
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:42,425
Woo-yeon.

735
01:03:01,652 --> 01:03:02,779
I'm back.

736
01:03:29,013 --> 01:03:30,306
It's about this far.

737
01:03:34,227 --> 01:03:36,020
The reason why Pinocchio's nose grew.

738
01:03:36,938 --> 01:03:39,482
With a longer nose,
he can't face another person.

739
01:03:40,441 --> 01:03:43,444
If you lie, you will grow further away
from the other person.

740
01:03:47,114 --> 01:03:49,867
Don't brush noses with another guy.
I'll get jealous.

741
01:03:55,373 --> 01:03:58,084
Let's stop this.

742
01:03:59,919 --> 01:04:01,379
I want to break up.

743
01:04:11,347 --> 01:04:12,265
Why?

744
01:04:13,975 --> 01:04:15,059
No reason.

745
01:04:16,561 --> 01:04:17,770
It's just…

746
01:04:21,607 --> 01:04:24,610
If we keep doing this,
I will end up hating you.

747
01:04:29,949 --> 01:04:31,576
This is too hard for me.

748
01:04:43,796 --> 01:04:45,089
I lied.

749
01:04:47,049 --> 01:04:48,175
Okay.

750
01:04:49,802 --> 01:04:51,012
Let's break up.

751
01:04:54,515 --> 01:04:55,850
Don't cry.

752
01:04:58,269 --> 01:04:59,687
Don't skip meals.

753
01:05:02,690 --> 01:05:04,066
Sleep well.

754
01:05:10,364 --> 01:05:11,741
Take care.

755
01:05:22,209 --> 01:05:24,086
MY YEON

756
01:05:34,889 --> 01:05:36,557
A lie that put

757
01:05:37,642 --> 01:05:38,768
a great distance between us.

758
01:06:07,922 --> 01:06:11,217
Mom must be happy to see you.

759
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:13,177
You can count on me. I can be a friend,

760
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:14,971
a chair, a rock,

761
01:06:15,054 --> 01:06:17,264
or anything you can lean on.

762
01:06:18,265 --> 01:06:19,600
Oh, right. Su is back.

763
01:06:19,684 --> 01:06:21,435
But why do you seem so indifferent?

764
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:25,314
In only one year, the person who put
love before everything is gone.

765
01:06:25,398 --> 01:06:26,691
Is she really over me?

766
01:06:26,774 --> 01:06:30,319
Why did you let her go so easily
when you'd be hung up on her like this?

767
01:06:30,403 --> 01:06:32,655
Can we go back to
before our breakup for one day?

768
01:06:33,656 --> 01:06:36,075
I thought you were selfish,
but you're just foolish.

769
01:06:36,158 --> 01:06:38,703
Once you let go, it's over.
It's been a long time.

770
01:06:38,786 --> 01:06:41,956
Woo-yeon, I'm holding a photo exhibition
this Saturday. Will you come?

771
01:06:43,582 --> 01:06:47,003
Su, let's stop the acting.
It's over between us.

772
01:06:50,631 --> 01:06:55,636
