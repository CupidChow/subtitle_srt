1
00:00:49,048 --> 00:00:53,428
A very thirsty fox
stumbled upon a vineyard.

2
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:58,058
"I am very lucky to have found
such appetizing grapes."

3
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:02,020
The fox jumped as high as he could
to get the grapes.

4
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:04,481
But the grapes were hanging up too high.

5
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:08,777
After trying to pick the grapes
for a long time, the fox gave up.

6
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,820
The fox turned around and said,

7
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:14,908
"The grapes are probably too sour anyway.

8
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:17,327
That's why they are still
hanging in the trees."

00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:29,506
WOO-YEON CALLIGRAPHY

10
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:00,537
Hello.

11
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:03,706
Woo-yeon.

12
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:21,808
Do you want some tea?

13
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:57,218
Have you been well?

14
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:05,143
LOVE FOR ONE PERSON

15
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:17,030
I cried every night.

16
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:24,412
I even forgot how to fold an umbrella.

17
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:27,874
But you're here asking me

18
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:30,877
if I had been well.

19
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:36,382
Yes.

20
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:42,847
I've been well.

21
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:49,103
What about you?

22
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,441
You've been well.

23
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:56,611
That's good.

24
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:06,746
Time is a remedy.

25
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,126
I've been busy, too.

26
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:16,047
I didn't sleep or eat.

27
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:20,718
I only took photos,

28
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,393
so I could come back to you.

29
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,114
I told you it's in the past now.

30
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:50,790
It's too late.

31
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,423
Woo-yeon.

32
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:10,268
I didn't know you had a visitor.

33
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:15,815
He's leaving.

34
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,031
-If you're done--
-I'm not done.

35
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:26,492
Not even close.

36
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,376
Let's talk later.

37
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:39,047
I have plans tonight.

38
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,095
I'll call you.

39
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:09,911
WOO-YEON CALLIGRAPHY

40
00:06:54,413 --> 00:06:55,581
Thanks.

41
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,712
I came here to give you this.

42
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,173
Was this a bad time?

43
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:06,592
No.

44
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:10,596
What's this?

45
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,182
The merchandise you worked on
for my publishing company.

46
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:15,560
It's for you.

47
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:19,647
I could have picked them up myself.

48
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:22,233
Thank you.

49
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:28,781
Do you want to talk about it?
Or should I change the topic?

50
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:34,370
You don't look like you're in a good mood.
And you seem anxious, too.

51
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:39,459
You always see right through me.

52
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:43,212
I can't fool you.

53
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:47,550
I told you. You and I are similar.

54
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:51,721
Can you change the topic

55
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:55,057
so I can think about something else?

56
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:56,976
Well,

57
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:01,314
the movie you did the calligraphy for
was based on

58
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:03,107
one of our books.

59
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:06,027
So I'm coming to the movie premiere.

60
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:09,405
If you need someone to watch it with,
we can watch it together.

61
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:11,824
Sure.

62
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:16,496
Don't pretend that you're okay
in front of me.

63
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,499
I can see right through that.

64
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,045
Right.

65
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:06,379
CROSSING THE OCEAN BETWEEN YOU AND ME

66
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:10,883
You finished your project pretty early.

67
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,010
You worked
without even sleeping or eating.

68
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:16,722
I have to go back. Back to Woo-yeon.

69
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:19,976
A girl has never been
the purpose of your photos.

70
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:24,564
And I've never regretted
my job before this.

71
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:27,984
Since coming here, I kept thinking,

72
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:32,113
"I shouldn't have come.
I should've stayed with her.

73
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:36,617
I always end up regretting things."
That was all I could think about.

74
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:38,578
Why did you break up with Woo-yeon?

75
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,538
I thought we'd never break up because

76
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:43,291
we went through so much
to be with each other.

77
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:47,878
I'm used to being lonely
as I've been alone for all my life.

78
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:49,839
But she probably wasn't.

79
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:54,051
How could I ask her to wait for me
when it was hard on her?

80
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:59,724
I thought you were selfish,
but you're just foolish.

81
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,603
Once you let go, it's over.
It's been a long time.

82
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:11,569
We're different.

83
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:16,699
She and I are different.

84
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:28,753
CROSSING THE OCEAN BETWEEN YOU AND ME

85
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:56,155
MY YEON

86
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:02,161
MY SU

87
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:09,669
Is she busy?

88
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:26,310
MY YEON

89
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:32,650
MY YEON

90
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,611
She must be asleep.

91
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:04,515
What is this about?

92
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:07,977
The meeting between Woo-yeon and me
was about business.

93
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:10,396
Is that why you called me?

94
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:14,859
Yes. Don't get the wrong idea
because there's nothing going on.

95
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:16,777
Why are you telling me this?

96
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:19,405
I don't want you to misunderstand her
because of me.

97
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:21,824
Isn't my misunderstanding

98
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,785
a chance for you?

99
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,997
I don't want a petty chance.

100
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:43,345
I need

101
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:48,517
every chance I can get.

102
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:57,943
-Hyeon-jae.
-Yes. I'm listening.

103
00:12:58,527 --> 00:12:59,695
Marry Yeong-hui.

104
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:04,074
Don't worry about me.
Just take her with you.

105
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:10,956
If you stay next to her,

106
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:14,376
I will find peace when it's my time to go.

107
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,629
You can't leave yet.

108
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:21,091
Yeong-hui will look so beautiful.
You should stay here to see that.

109
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:28,724
We're going to have an American wedding,
so you'll have to wear a dress.

110
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,726
Which color do you want?

111
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,232
Something bold.

112
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,361
A backless dress.

113
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,324
Sure. You got it.

114
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:24,613
Hyeon-jae.

115
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:39,503
I'm sorry.

116
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,768
I'm sorry.

117
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,376
Woo-yeon, you should go on a blind date.

118
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,545
One of my seniors is a really decent guy.

119
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:24,006
No, I'm good. I'm sick of dating.

120
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:26,425
You're sick of dating? You?

121
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:28,427
Are you still hung up on him?

122
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,095
Will you stay single forever?

123
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:34,683
Oh, right. Su is back.

124
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:39,063
-He's back in Korea?
-Did he call you?

125
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:42,149
He came here.

126
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:46,403
But why do you seem so indifferent?

127
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:48,614
Then should I cry and weep?

128
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:52,785
Right now, my career is my first priority.

129
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:55,537
And I don't want to fall in love again.

130
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,873
I don't want to waste
my energy on that, either.

131
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:03,420
In only one year, the person who put love
before everything

132
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,006
is gone.

133
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:13,681
What are we still doing here?

134
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:18,686
Let's go.

135
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:26,694
I'm full, and the air is cool.
I feel like I'm in heaven.

136
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:29,196
This definitely clears up my mind.

137
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:32,157
I'm happy that you guys are happy.

138
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:33,409
It's rewarding.

139
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:38,539
Thank you so much for staying with me.

140
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:41,291
I love you.

141
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:45,587
I love you, too.

142
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:46,964
Gosh, that's so cringy.

143
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:50,843
Why don't we all just not date
or get married? We should live together

144
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:52,720
for the rest of our lives.

145
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:59,184
Sorry. I'm engaged.

146
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:01,145
Jin-ju.

147
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:03,731
Are you serious?

148
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:05,607
-Hey.
-What's wrong with you?

149
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:09,403
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

150
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:10,446
-Enjoy.
-Sure.

151
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:11,864
-More soju, please.
-Okay.

152
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:13,699
-We're ready to order.
-Okay.

153
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:15,909
-Min-ho, get their order.
-Okay.

154
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:19,830
-Thank you.
-Enjoy.

155
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:22,082
Hello.

156
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:29,840
You have a lot of customers now.

157
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:31,341
My bar is pretty popular now.

158
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:33,969
Sit over there.

159
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:42,352
When did you come back?

160
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:44,313
-Today.
-Why don't you rest, then?

161
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:46,065
Did you come to see me first?

162
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,151
You're not the first.

163
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:51,653
-You're third.
-Who else did you see already?

164
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:55,240
-Woo-yeon.
-I see.

165
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:57,993
-What's with that awkward response?
-You two broke up.

166
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:02,623
But you went to see her
because you still had feelings for her.

167
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:04,750
And seeing you're drinking alone,

168
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:06,960
it didn't go well.

169
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:08,670
You changed a lot over the year.

170
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,339
It's been a whole year.

171
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:14,009
Is a year a long time?

172
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:18,764
Time is one thing,
but circumstances have changed a lot.

173
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,438
I'm getting married.

174
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,154
Hey, my kitty.

175
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:36,824
How's work going, my puppy?

176
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:39,618
I miss you like crazy!

177
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:42,996
How much? Me, too.

178
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:45,999
Did you hear how she got engaged?

179
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,460
Yes. It's like an episode of a sitcom.

180
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:52,840
JIN-JU AND I WILL BE HAPPY TOGETHER

181
00:18:57,427 --> 00:18:58,387
My gosh!

182
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:01,974
-You look so dashing.
-How do I look? Do I look okay?

183
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:05,227
Totally. You look so handsome.
My heart is fluttering.

184
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,687
What happened to your finger?

185
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:10,482
-Oh, this? Dong-sik did this.
-I ought to teach him a lesson.

186
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:13,193
Don't do that. He has
the most power in our family.

187
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:16,446
He only listens to Mom.
He ignores the rest of the family.

188
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,574
Then I must win over Dong-sik, too.

189
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:21,201
Just don't let him see you.
That's the best.

190
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:23,704
Okay.

191
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:25,247
Let's go.

192
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:27,833
Let's go.

193
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:38,427
I know that compared to Jin-ju,
I'm lacking in many ways.

194
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:43,599
But I really

195
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:47,895
love Jin-ju. I love her to bits.

196
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:57,404
I'll try my best to improve on my lacking
qualities as we spend our lives together.

197
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:04,578
It's more than just that.
You and Jin-ju aren't a good match.

198
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:09,333
If you're not a good match,
one of you is bound to leave in the end.

199
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:13,337
And you will be the one who will leave.

200
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,713
Mom.

201
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:20,969
I won't stop you from dating her.

202
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:23,555
But you cannot…

203
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:29,228
My gosh. What's wrong with him today?

204
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:40,239
Dong-sik, good boy. What's wrong?

205
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:42,366
My goodness.

206
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:43,951
Gosh, Dong-sik.

207
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:48,914
Goodness.

208
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:51,583
I get that their dog
doesn't welcome strangers.

209
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:54,836
But how can she accept him because
the dog likes him? It's irrational.

210
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:59,049
She even went to a fortune-teller.
They're a match made in heaven.

211
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:03,804
Okay, puppy. Give me some time.

212
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:06,598
I'll be there soon. Okay.

213
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:09,434
Gosh. They are so in love.

214
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:10,686
Gosh.

215
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,525
What do you want to drink?

216
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,652
Black sugar milk tea.

217
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:21,154
Two cups of black sugar milk tea.

218
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:22,781
-Okay.
-Please use this card.

219
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:23,782
Sure.

220
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,620
It's sweet.

221
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,539
This definitely cheers me up.

222
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:33,125
Sweets are the best when you're down.

223
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:34,835
Am I down?

224
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:38,171
-Why get me a sweet drink?
-To keep your blood sugar up.

225
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:39,798
Putting on an act is the hardest.

226
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:42,759
Is this about you?

227
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:46,430
Yes.

228
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:51,727
-Are you going home?
-No, I'll stop by the hospital first.

229
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:55,647
How's your mom?

230
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:58,025
She's the same.

231
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:10,871
Did Woo-yeon talk about me?

232
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:13,790
No.

233
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:17,961
Is she really over me?

234
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:21,131
Why is dating so hard for you two?

235
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:23,717
Why is everything so hard?

236
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,762
You end up hurting each other
because you're too considerate.

237
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:32,976
I was always alone.

238
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:36,396
So I don't know how to talk to people.

239
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:39,024
I didn't even know I was mean.

240
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:42,611
You never talk about that.

241
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:48,033
I keep regretting it.

242
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:51,703
I feel like I messed up our relationship.

243
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:54,748
But

244
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:58,794
I don't know how to fix this.

245
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:00,796
I feel hopeless.

246
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:05,509
Goodness. You and Woo-yeon
are exactly the same.

247
00:23:06,301 --> 00:23:08,595
Seriously.
You two are always being foolish.

248
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:28,573
Don't look at me. I look awful.

249
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:39,668
Do you want me to only remember your back?

250
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,087
Don't even remember my back.

251
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,756
Don't remember anything.

252
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:54,599
Looking at someone's back is sadder.

253
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:07,112
I made you

254
00:24:08,446 --> 00:24:13,034
look at my back so many times
and made you sad.

255
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:19,958
Right.

256
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:23,712
So show me your face.

257
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:27,716
I don't want to forget your face.

258
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:35,140
Bye.

259
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:55,744
-My puppy!
-You're here!

260
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:00,290
-Did you have fun?
-Yes.

261
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:02,250
-Did you have a good day?
-Of course.

262
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,755
You were here, too.

263
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:08,340
You're not asking why I'm here.

264
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:11,551
Why would I? You're probably here
to drink. This is a bar, after all.

265
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:13,428
And you came to see your friend.

266
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:17,641
What a surprise. I thought
you'd yell at me and kick me out.

267
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:20,060
There's no need.

268
00:25:20,143 --> 00:25:22,395
I don't hate you anymore.

269
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:24,147
Why not?

270
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,900
There's a limit to feelings, too.

271
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:30,946
I hated you so much
that I don't feel a thing anymore.

272
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:33,448
I just think that's who you are.

273
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:35,951
You'll hate me again.

274
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:38,870
I met Woo-yeon today.

275
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:40,330
I'll get her back.

276
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:41,665
Suit yourself.

277
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:45,627
But I didn't have
a direct relationship with you.

278
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:48,338
I built all those feelings
through Woo-yeon.

279
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:51,591
If watching her was hard for me,

280
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:53,843
it'd be worse for her
since she went through it.

281
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:00,892
She said she'd call.

282
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:03,270
She said she would,

283
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:06,398
so she will call me.

284
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:20,578
Are you back here for good?

285
00:26:22,205 --> 00:26:23,248
It depends.

286
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:26,876
You're leaving again?
Your girlfriend must be so sad.

287
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:31,256
You should have brought her today.
I wanted to buy her a meal.

288
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:34,884
Later.

289
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:45,562
It's mine.

290
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:49,774
No. It's all right.

291
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:56,239
Su.

292
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,325
Is there something wrong?

293
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:02,662
No.

294
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:07,625
If something happened
and you're lonely or in pain,

295
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:09,669
can you tell me?

296
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:13,631
You can rely on your parents
whenever you want.

297
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:17,802
I never got to tell you that.

298
00:27:19,095 --> 00:27:20,388
In case you didn't know.

299
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:30,690
I'll tell you if there's anything.

300
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,286
I think

301
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:47,290
something happened
between Su and his girlfriend.

302
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:49,751
Did they break up?

303
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:55,215
Women don't put up with men
who make them feel lonely.

304
00:27:58,051 --> 00:27:59,260
Are you dissing me?

305
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:02,555
What? Do you feel guilty?

306
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:10,522
I thought he took after me,
but he takes after you.

307
00:28:10,605 --> 00:28:12,857
-That upsets me.
-Why are you attacking me?

308
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:17,404
No, forget it. We raised him that way.

309
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,201
Just blame it on me.

310
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:26,413
I was the cause.

311
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:32,544
What?

312
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:37,590
-Did I do something wrong again?
-You keep maturing. It's fascinating.

313
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,927
-That's a compliment, right?
-Yes.

314
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:54,733
We were going to display photos only
from destinations of the airline here.

315
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:57,360
But we wanted to sponsor
your first portrait exhibition.

316
00:28:57,444 --> 00:29:00,363
So it became a bigger project
than we initially planned.

317
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:02,949
I see.

318
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:06,661
PORTRAIT EXHIBITION
AT WORLD SPACE GALLERY, REVISED

319
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:19,215
I sent you the layout.

320
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:22,218
The attached photo is important.

321
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:23,803
Let's display it individually.

322
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:25,054
Okay.

323
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:29,559
Anyway, how did you take
so many photos over one year?

324
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:32,187
It's as if you barely slept.

325
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,938
You're right. I barely slept

326
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:35,899
so I could come back.

327
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:37,525
I see.

328
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:41,571
You're here.

329
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:47,202
She's going to do your interview
for the pamphlet.

330
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:49,370
Hello. I'm Yoon Da-won.

331
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:50,663
Hello, I'm Lee Su.

332
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:54,918
The title of your exhibition
is Door: The End of the World.

333
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:56,836
Why did you choose this title?

334
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:01,007
Well, I felt the Earth was round
when I was traveling

335
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:03,718
because there were ends of countries,
but not of the world.

336
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:07,305
New worlds can unfold, though.

337
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:09,808
Whether it's through doors
of a plane or an airport,

338
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:13,978
we have to open the door
to arrive in a new world.

339
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:15,480
It's the same with people.

340
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:19,651
Everyone has their own world.

341
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:25,281
That means when someone comes
into your life, you meet a new world.

342
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:36,125
I learned that when I open up my heart,
I can see a new world.

343
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,379
That was an unexpected discovery for me.

344
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:45,635
I think the title embraces
both landscapes and people.

345
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:50,431
You're known
for your landscape photography.

346
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:53,726
In your recent exhibition,
we saw a lot of portraits.

347
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:56,437
Tell us what made you
take photos of people now.

348
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:02,527
I had never looked at people with love.

349
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:05,905
I'm cold by nature,

350
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:09,242
but I always thought
that love was a fleeting feeling

351
00:31:09,325 --> 00:31:10,368
like a mirage.

352
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:15,373
But after meeting someone,
I changed my mind.

353
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:20,169
Most of the photos at the exhibition
are of people in love.

354
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:24,257
I realized only recently
that people and their love

355
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:27,218
are charming.

356
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:31,347
What is your favorite photo
you have taken so far?

357
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:33,933
The self-portrait photo.

358
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:38,688
My principle of only taking photos of
the things I love applied to myself, too.

359
00:31:38,771 --> 00:31:41,107
So I had never taken
a photo of myself before.

360
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:46,237
Come to think of it,
I had never truly loved myself.

361
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:50,199
But I was finally ready to love myself,

362
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:52,577
so I had the courage
to take a photo of myself.

363
00:32:49,884 --> 00:32:51,678
While I was lying here,

364
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:56,766
I tried to think of a good thing
I did for you.

365
00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:00,103
But I couldn't think of one.

366
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:05,108
Since I'm not a good mom,
you won't cry a lot.

367
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:07,568
That's good.

368
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:13,491
Mom, don't talk. I know it's hard for you.

369
00:33:20,623 --> 00:33:21,749
I…

370
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:26,629
I was never loved by my mother.

371
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:31,801
So I couldn't love you properly.
And I am sorry.

372
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:35,138
Mom, don't talk.

373
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:39,308
My daughter.

374
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:41,436
Yes?

375
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,229
My beautiful daughter.

376
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:44,397
Yes?

377
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:48,526
I am

378
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:54,198
sorry for bringing you into the world
as my daughter.

379
00:33:56,617 --> 00:33:57,869
I will

380
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:03,541
only be your mom in this life.

381
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:10,423
In your next life,

382
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:15,136
don't be my daughter.

383
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:19,724
Meet a good mom.

384
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,311
And live a life full of love.

385
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:26,939
And let your mom spoil you, too.

386
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:32,737
Meet good parents

387
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,656
and be an immature kid.

388
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:41,412
I couldn't tell you
because I was too ashamed.

389
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:46,959
I love you,

390
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:49,295
my baby.

391
00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:56,886
I love you too, Mom.

392
00:34:58,012 --> 00:35:00,223
I love you, too. Okay?

393
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:11,859
Is Cheol-su coming?

394
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:14,654
I wish I could see him before I go.

395
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:17,573
Mom.

396
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:20,993
Mom, don't go. Please.

397
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:23,955
Mom, stay with me.

398
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:29,877
Mom, you never did anything I asked for.

399
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:33,297
Mom.

400
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:36,300
I won't keep you here for long.

401
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:42,140
Mom, stay here just a bit longer. Please?

402
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:44,267
Please?

403
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:53,317
I'm sorry, my baby.

404
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:54,402
Mom.

405
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:55,570
Mom.

406
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:08,916
I'm good now.

407
00:36:16,632 --> 00:36:17,675
Mom.

408
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:22,096
Mom.

409
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:24,932
Mom.

410
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:30,563
Mom.

411
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:33,691
Mom.

412
00:36:54,795 --> 00:36:55,922
You're here.

413
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:00,051
Thank you for coming.

414
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:02,220
Don't pretend you're okay.

415
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:04,055
She's right. Stop pretending.

416
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:06,599
I'm still older than you.

417
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:16,025
Cry.

418
00:37:16,692 --> 00:37:18,736
We'll cover you. Just cry.

419
00:37:20,112 --> 00:37:21,906
We'll hold you. So cry.

420
00:37:59,068 --> 00:38:01,279
You don't have to wear a mourning dress.

421
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:03,656
I'm an only child,
so I don't have a sister.

422
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:07,034
Now you have a little sister.

423
00:38:07,743 --> 00:38:10,121
I only have two brothers.
I don't have a sister.

424
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:12,540
You got one more little sister.

425
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:16,752
That's reassuring.

426
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:03,943
Mom

427
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:08,531
must be happy to see you.

428
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:06,524
You can cry, Yeong-hui.

429
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:08,817
Will that change anything?

430
00:42:11,987 --> 00:42:13,280
If you don't, it will.

431
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:23,040
If you hold back your tears,
you will become soggy.

432
00:42:23,749 --> 00:42:27,294
And when you become soggy, you'll sink.

433
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:36,178
So you can cry, Yeong-hui.

434
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:40,099
You won't crumble down.

435
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:58,367
If you do, I'll hold you like this.

436
00:43:09,378 --> 00:43:10,713
You can count on me.

437
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:15,384
I can be a friend, a chair, a rock,

438
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:17,386
or some kind of a tree.

439
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:20,889
Anything you can lean on.

440
00:43:55,257 --> 00:43:57,760
Is it because I'm used to
seeing my mom's back?

441
00:43:58,677 --> 00:44:02,598
Like my mom said, is it because
she wasn't a good mom?

442
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:07,519
I was simply forgetting

443
00:44:08,604 --> 00:44:10,606
my mom's death.

444
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:33,754
I can't do this. Pour me a drink.

445
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:36,423
I can't say it sober
because it's making me cringe.

446
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:51,772
Your presence is comforting to me.

447
00:44:58,737 --> 00:44:59,738
I thought

448
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:03,325
if I cried, I would crumble down.

449
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:07,746
I thought if I leaned on others,
it would make me a loser.

450
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:11,083
But I didn't get weak even when I cried

451
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:13,419
because you guys were there for me.

452
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:17,965
I leaned on you as much as I wanted.

453
00:45:18,674 --> 00:45:20,092
I don't feel like a loser.

454
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:54,835
I knew it. I knew you wouldn't cry.

455
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:57,880
I don't think I was there for you.

456
00:45:59,131 --> 00:46:02,426
Why would I take credit for something
they did? I have a conscience.

457
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:07,556
Instead of taking the credit,
let me pour you a drink.

458
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:09,558
How cute.

459
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:12,186
Don't like me. I hate messy drama.

460
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:15,189
Don't worry. I hate you.
I hate you so much.

461
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:17,774
I'd rather have you hate me.

462
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:20,819
At least you won't pretend I don't exist.

463
00:46:31,747 --> 00:46:33,332
Should we raise our glasses?

464
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,714
All right. Let's be happy, Yeong-hui.

465
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:44,218
-Let's be happy.
-Let's be happy.

466
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:45,469
-I love you.
-Be happy.

467
00:46:45,552 --> 00:46:46,512
Me, too.

468
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:48,889
This is making me cringe a bit.

469
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:56,104
Mom, I'm at Tonight with my friends.

470
00:46:58,106 --> 00:47:00,859
Yes. She seems okay.

471
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:07,282
Yes. I'll see you soon.

472
00:47:08,575 --> 00:47:09,660
Okay.

473
00:47:13,705 --> 00:47:14,706
Yeong-hui.

474
00:47:15,457 --> 00:47:16,792
Do you think I'll cry

475
00:47:16,875 --> 00:47:20,045
if I found out you were talking
to your mom on the phone?

476
00:47:20,128 --> 00:47:21,463
I'd hate that even more.

477
00:47:23,423 --> 00:47:25,133
Sorry.

478
00:47:25,217 --> 00:47:26,510
Why do you keep apologizing?

479
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:28,428
Are you Hyeon-jae?

480
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:34,309
I didn't know you'd invite Hyeon-jae, too.

481
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:38,605
I'm grateful for him. I owe him a lot.

482
00:47:41,942 --> 00:47:45,988
Maybe I shouldn't have called Su.
Do you feel uncomfortable?

483
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:48,574
I'm fine. He's your guest.

484
00:47:50,826 --> 00:47:52,703
What are you going to do about Su?

485
00:47:53,328 --> 00:47:56,123
It looks like Su has
a lot of feelings left for you.

486
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:57,833
He kept looking at you.

487
00:48:01,795 --> 00:48:05,340
I don't want to whine on a day like today.

488
00:48:07,426 --> 00:48:09,261
Please whine.

489
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:13,056
I need a distraction to get
my mind off things these days.

490
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:20,272
So what will happen between you two?

491
00:48:29,948 --> 00:48:32,117
I haven't thrown out anything Su gave me.

492
00:48:33,368 --> 00:48:36,580
I keep thinking about our times together
when I look at them.

493
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:41,168
Bad memories, painful feelings,

494
00:48:41,668 --> 00:48:42,919
and the days I cried.

495
00:48:43,003 --> 00:48:44,379
Do you have to?

496
00:48:47,132 --> 00:48:49,885
People feel fear because of memories.

497
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:54,181
Because of that fear, they can be careful.

498
00:48:56,933 --> 00:48:58,435
I need to be careful.

499
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:02,981
So it's like wearing armor.

500
00:49:06,568 --> 00:49:07,653
Well,

501
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:10,781
I guess it is.

502
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:14,826
Aren't I pathetic?

503
00:49:15,994 --> 00:49:17,579
It's your life. No judgment here.

504
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:26,797
Wear the thickest armor you can afford.

505
00:49:27,422 --> 00:49:28,882
Then it's one or the other.

506
00:49:29,883 --> 00:49:33,428
Whether the armor crushes you to death
or you take it off.

507
00:49:41,561 --> 00:49:43,730
I'm happy Yeong-hui seems okay.

508
00:49:44,314 --> 00:49:48,694
I'm not sure if she's really okay
or if she's pretending to be okay.

509
00:49:48,777 --> 00:49:50,987
But I'm glad to see her smile.

510
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:52,155
Right.

511
00:49:54,074 --> 00:49:57,327
By the way, what will happen
with Su and Woo-yeon?

512
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:10,132
Thank you for walking me home.

513
00:50:12,092 --> 00:50:13,051
Go home safely.

514
00:50:16,346 --> 00:50:17,431
Woo-yeon.

515
00:50:24,146 --> 00:50:24,980
Yes?

516
00:50:26,898 --> 00:50:28,358
We need to talk.

517
00:50:32,988 --> 00:50:33,989
Yes.

518
00:50:36,616 --> 00:50:38,201
Let's finish it today.

519
00:50:43,582 --> 00:50:45,125
I was going to start it.

520
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:48,587
But you ended it.

521
00:50:51,465 --> 00:50:54,551
The only thing we can start
is a friendship.

522
00:50:55,802 --> 00:50:57,262
Is that what you want?

523
00:50:57,888 --> 00:51:01,016
I can't be friends with you now.

524
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,522
Then we won't have to see each other.

525
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:12,736
I really hate myself for doing this,

526
00:51:15,363 --> 00:51:18,450
but you have to grant me my wish.

527
00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:20,285
Do you want to make a bet?

528
00:51:20,368 --> 00:51:22,829
The one who wants to break up first
has to grant the other's wish.

529
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:34,049
Fine. I'll keep my promise.

530
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:39,638
What do you want me to do?

531
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:45,769
Can we

532
00:51:47,479 --> 00:51:49,731
go back to before our breakup for one day?

533
00:51:57,948 --> 00:51:59,157
Sure.

534
00:53:04,723 --> 00:53:07,309
What use would that be after breaking up?

535
00:53:07,392 --> 00:53:08,977
So let's not break up.

536
00:53:09,769 --> 00:53:10,812
Okay.

537
00:53:14,316 --> 00:53:15,483
Liar.

538
00:53:17,777 --> 00:53:19,321
You said you wouldn't break up.

539
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:48,141
You're here early.

540
00:53:48,224 --> 00:53:50,101
Yes. I got ready quickly.

541
00:54:43,071 --> 00:54:45,824
Is it not good?
Do you want something else?

542
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:48,576
It's good.

543
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:06,845
LATE-NIGHT FOOD BAR

544
00:55:07,762 --> 00:55:09,389
You should wait for the noodles.

545
00:55:09,472 --> 00:55:11,266
Why are you drinking without any food?

546
00:55:11,766 --> 00:55:13,643
I'm in the mood for alcohol today.

547
00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:14,853
You're awful.

548
00:55:14,936 --> 00:55:17,272
How can you stop coming
just because you broke up?

549
00:55:17,355 --> 00:55:19,774
You broke up with him, not me.

550
00:55:20,608 --> 00:55:21,651
How did you know?

551
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:24,404
Hyeon-jae comes here sometimes.

552
00:55:29,784 --> 00:55:33,079
My gosh. Speak of the devil.

553
00:55:47,552 --> 00:55:50,263
LATE-NIGHT FOOD BAR

554
00:55:51,473 --> 00:55:52,682
My glass is empty, too.

555
00:56:06,988 --> 00:56:09,491
You should've taken it off
a long time ago.

556
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:11,659
Yeong-hui.

557
00:56:14,537 --> 00:56:15,955
I haven't changed.

558
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:19,292
Nothing has changed.

559
00:56:21,586 --> 00:56:24,089
Yes. You're right.

560
00:56:25,924 --> 00:56:27,383
Nothing has changed.

561
00:56:34,015 --> 00:56:35,809
I'm still unfortunate.

562
00:56:36,518 --> 00:56:37,644
And

563
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:42,065
I still don't want to share
my misfortunes with you.

564
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:51,950
You told me

565
00:56:53,618 --> 00:56:55,495
to get away from your misery.

566
00:56:58,081 --> 00:57:00,375
Guess where I live now
after you kicked me out.

567
00:57:06,714 --> 00:57:08,007
I live in my own misery.

568
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:13,054
Can't you

569
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:16,224
invite me back to your misery?

570
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:21,396
My misery

571
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:25,066
hurts too much.

572
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:05,148
Think of me as your ride today.

573
00:58:07,066 --> 00:58:09,402
Why do you keep wanting to be something?

574
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:14,908
I want to do anything I can for you.

575
00:58:15,909 --> 00:58:16,868
Get on my back.

576
00:58:26,252 --> 00:58:27,795
-Come home soon.
-Okay.

577
00:58:31,716 --> 00:58:34,552
My mom showed her back to me often.

578
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:37,805
And what remained of her

579
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:41,392
was her back.

580
00:58:41,935 --> 00:58:44,354
If you're poor,
you should at least be kind.

581
00:58:52,487 --> 00:58:53,738
This is the worst.

582
00:59:01,746 --> 00:59:04,082
I thought
that meant she didn't care about me.

583
00:59:10,588 --> 00:59:12,382
But now I realize

584
00:59:15,009 --> 00:59:17,804
she was trying to give us a better life.

585
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:19,430
I'm going to sleep.

586
00:59:21,474 --> 00:59:22,892
And she wanted to cry alone.

587
00:59:24,644 --> 00:59:28,690
It was the face my mom showed us,
so she could be in pain alone.

588
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:33,152
My princess, what should I get you
on my way home?

589
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:34,362
Snacks.

590
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:38,741
Okay. I'll finish work quickly

591
00:59:38,825 --> 00:59:40,076
and buy snacks for you.

592
00:59:41,703 --> 00:59:43,329
Come home soon.

593
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:44,497
Okay.

594
01:00:07,604 --> 01:00:10,982
People show their backs
so they can carry others.

595
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:17,924
I'm having an exhibition this Saturday.

596
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:23,388
Will you come?

597
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:40,321
Su.

598
01:01:43,741 --> 01:01:45,034
Let's stop the acting.

599
01:01:49,414 --> 01:01:50,873
It's over between us.

600
01:01:55,086 --> 01:01:58,256
Can't we start over?

601
01:02:00,174 --> 01:02:04,053
I'm not someone you can let go
and get back whenever you want to.

602
01:02:05,888 --> 01:02:07,390
It was you who let go of me.

603
01:02:07,473 --> 01:02:09,183
Did I really let go of you?

604
01:02:10,184 --> 01:02:12,061
You used to call me multiple times a day.

605
01:02:12,145 --> 01:02:14,897
But you started calling me twice a day.
Then once a day.

606
01:02:14,981 --> 01:02:17,567
On some days,
we only exchanged short messages.

607
01:02:19,694 --> 01:02:21,320
It was you who changed.

608
01:02:22,989 --> 01:02:24,365
There was a time difference.

609
01:02:26,033 --> 01:02:28,202
When I called
after taking photos all day long,

610
01:02:28,911 --> 01:02:30,413
you were busy with your work.

611
01:02:31,497 --> 01:02:33,875
And when I woke up,
you got ready to go to sleep.

612
01:02:35,334 --> 01:02:37,920
You said it was natural
to talk less because of that.

613
01:02:39,464 --> 01:02:40,923
And you said you were okay.

614
01:02:43,009 --> 01:02:46,262
You said you understood everything.

615
01:02:49,390 --> 01:02:52,685
I had to be understanding
so your indifference hurt me less.

616
01:02:55,563 --> 01:02:57,607
I understood you so I could be loved,

617
01:02:59,275 --> 01:03:00,902
but the distance kept growing.

618
01:03:01,986 --> 01:03:04,238
You let go of me
when I said I wanted to break up.

619
01:03:04,322 --> 01:03:06,657
How could I have stopped you then?

620
01:03:06,741 --> 01:03:08,493
I couldn't fly back to Korea.

621
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:13,539
How could I have stopped you
when it was too hard on you?

622
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:21,714
You should've told me

623
01:03:22,632 --> 01:03:24,175
to be more attentive.

624
01:03:24,258 --> 01:03:26,302
You could've told me this sooner.

625
01:03:36,938 --> 01:03:38,105
Su.

626
01:03:43,069 --> 01:03:45,780
I was anxious
the whole time I was with you.

627
01:03:49,909 --> 01:03:52,578
I questioned myself whether
you truly loved me.

628
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:58,543
I wondered if you mistook
your fleeting jealousy for love.

629
01:04:00,795 --> 01:04:02,296
When people feel anxious,

630
01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:08,469
they can't share what they're feeling

631
01:04:10,805 --> 01:04:12,431
in case they lose their loved ones.

632
01:04:22,775 --> 01:04:25,278
You always doubt me
and make up your mind by yourself.

633
01:04:28,990 --> 01:04:30,950
You love me and leave me on your own.

634
01:04:35,413 --> 01:04:37,498
I thought we were in love.

635
01:04:41,544 --> 01:04:43,087
It was still one-sided love.

636
01:04:50,011 --> 01:04:51,679
Your lack of trust held you back,

637
01:04:53,347 --> 01:04:55,099
and I held back because I was sorry.

638
01:05:00,688 --> 01:05:02,481
It ended because we both held back.

639
01:05:13,367 --> 01:05:14,327
Right.

640
01:05:23,002 --> 01:05:24,587
That's not the right way to love.

641
01:05:30,259 --> 01:05:32,136
Don't pine over a lost cause.

642
01:05:33,179 --> 01:05:34,889
Let's end this for good now.

643
01:05:41,145 --> 01:05:42,521
Don't skip your meals.

644
01:05:43,856 --> 01:05:45,524
Sleep well.

645
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:48,778
Take care.

646
01:06:39,620 --> 01:06:40,705
You're back.

647
01:06:41,497 --> 01:06:45,334
I thought you wouldn't have
any food at home, so I stopped by.

648
01:06:50,548 --> 01:06:51,590
Su.

649
01:06:52,883 --> 01:06:54,135
What's wrong?

650
01:06:56,220 --> 01:06:58,681
I thought we'd be together again
once I came back.

651
01:07:10,526 --> 01:07:11,819
But I was wrong again.

652
01:07:30,755 --> 01:07:32,715
Everyone shows their backs for a reason.

653
01:07:34,216 --> 01:07:35,760
And I realized that reason

654
01:07:37,011 --> 01:07:38,763
too late.

655
01:07:41,766 --> 01:07:43,476
No one noticed

656
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:46,979
the fox's wounds
and the effort the fox put in.

657
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:51,484
If the fox had fallen one more time,
the fox would have died.

658
01:07:52,485 --> 01:07:55,738
So the fox turned away to survive.

659
01:08:19,595 --> 01:08:21,388
I'm sorry.

660
01:08:21,472 --> 01:08:22,973
Don't follow me or call me again.

661
01:08:23,682 --> 01:08:25,935
-Did you fight again?
-Just break up with him.

662
01:08:26,018 --> 01:08:28,395
You don't fight to fix each other.
It's to adjust.

663
01:08:28,479 --> 01:08:30,147
Couples aren't perfect from the start.

664
01:08:30,231 --> 01:08:32,733
If I make someone my soul mate,
he's my soul mate.

665
01:08:32,817 --> 01:08:35,569
Did she come?
It looked like you were waiting for her.

666
01:08:35,653 --> 01:08:39,323
She won't come. I can't cling to her
because I know how she feels.

667
01:08:39,406 --> 01:08:42,368
Su changed a lot after meeting you.

668
01:08:42,451 --> 01:08:43,786
I wanted to thank you.

669
01:08:43,869 --> 01:08:47,748
Do you think I affected him that much?

670
01:08:49,041 --> 01:08:51,544
I wish Woo-yeon would at least hate me.

671
01:08:51,627 --> 01:08:54,463
I want her to think about me
one more time, even if it's hate.

672
01:08:55,464 --> 01:08:56,340
I hate you.

673
01:08:57,383 --> 01:08:59,093
You're awful.

674
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:05,724
