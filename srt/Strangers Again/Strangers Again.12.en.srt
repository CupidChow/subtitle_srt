You called him over?

171

I heard from my church's deacon that you two seem to be dating again.

What can I do?

I knew you'd never tell me the truth, so...

I called him over and confirmed it.

It was last week or the week before that.

Mom, how could you—

181

You should've called me over and talked to me.

Why would you call him and—

I just told him to break up with you.

332
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,180
Mr. Goo?

333
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:37,720
Y-Yes. The thing is...

I'm being sued by my own mother.

That is giving me a lot of stress.

00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:50,340
Gosh, you must've been stressed severely.

337
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:53,230
Will the symptom get better if I take medicine?

338
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:54,310
That's possible.

339
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:57,380
Should I prescribe you some tranquilizers?

340
00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:00,140
Yes, and also, regarding that...

341
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:04,240
I'd like to get a letter of opinion.

342

What? A countercomplaint?

343
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:14,260
I filed for five billion won, and he filed for ten billion won?

Please go to General Ward.

They said her brain was fine, according to the CT.

378
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:22,210
But it looks like some people don't recover consciousness for a long time.

379
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:28,240
So, if she doesn't wake up after six hours...

380
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,900
they need to do another MRI and

- I don't know, either.

If she has it, they said it might be more serious.

After six hours... When will that be?

386

10:00.

387
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:48,260
She collapsed around 4:00.

let go of Eun Byeol early, Mom.

492
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:35,230
I'm really...

493
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:39,320
I'm really sorry about that, Mom.

494
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:43,890
I thought you'd know even if I didn't tell you.

495
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:49,430
But you didn't seem to know...

496
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:54,540
I'm sorry.

497
00:36:56,900 --> 00:37:02,110
Eun Byeol... wasn't...

498
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:09,140
Mom! Mom...

499
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:12,000
It's not your fault...

500
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:18,130
that Eun Byeol... left this world early.

501

You idiot.

502
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:29,430
Why would you... think it's... your fault, like an idiot?

503
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,520
Mom, are you okay?

504
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:39,130
Mom, how many fingers am I holding up?

505
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:50,810
I thought... you wouldn't come even if I died.

Hey, what about your mother?

522
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:07,320
She was discharged yesterday. She's fine now.

523
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:10,310
Did she withdraw her complaint? The disowning complaint.

524
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:13,050
Well, she'll need to submit the withdrawal soon.

Hurry up and get it done.

526

Anyhow, you don't know what will happen tomorrow.

529

So I think it'd be better to get it done quickly.

530

I got it. I'll have it withdrawn today right away.

Let me postpone indefinitely my quitting the firm.

537
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:02,830
I think I was a little... carried away

538
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:05,870
by emotion when I told you back then.

539
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:09,430
- You don't need to leave the firm.
- Sorry?

540

Didn't you hear?

541
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:14,340
Ha Ra will be leaving the firm.

558

Why? Because there are four seas.

Where did my baby go?

Is it your goal to become a better you each and every day?

00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:56,830
Please cut it out.

570

Your parents are overjoyed, too, aren't they?

574
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:09,070
Hey, don't even mention it.

00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:35,300
A beloved daughter-in-law!

584
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:37,470
Everything is sailing smoothly.

590

591
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,290
With a man whose head is full of flowers...

592
00:43:59,290 --> 00:44:02,060
I need to give birth and raise the child.

593
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:08,140
You don't need to be like that.

594
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:10,960
Just say you're happy if you are.

595

All of this might look great to you since you want to marry...

596

but well? I'm not really sure.

Sometimes, I keep thinking

598
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:22,580
if it's okay for me to go this way

599
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:25,500
or if this is right.

00:44:31,610 --> 00:44:34,940
Ha Ra, can we talk for a minute?

602
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:41,400
I heard... you're going to leave the firm.

603
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,170
Oh, y-yes.

604
00:44:43,170 --> 00:44:45,160
You heard?

605
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:47,130
It was decided yesterday.

606
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:51,600
Can I ask you why you're leaving?

607
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,270
Because you said, you'll leave.

608
00:44:56,300 --> 00:45:00,000
CEO Seo said since you don't really have a place to go to,

609
00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:03,200
why don't I think about leaving instead?

610
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:07,200
I already had an offer at the time, so I just went in for the interview.

611
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:11,560
Luckily, things worked out well.

612
00:45:12,790 --> 00:45:16,680
That man is really no help at all.

613
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:20,150
- What?
- No, nothing.

614
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:22,440
If, by any chance,

615
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:25,550
it's entirely because of me, you don't need to leave.

616
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:29,600
I thought about leaving for only a moment

617
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:31,850
because you might be uncomfortable.

618
00:45:31,850 --> 00:45:34,910
But you didn't really seem that way,

619
00:45:34,910 --> 00:45:38,130
so I decided again not to leave.

620
00:45:38,130 --> 00:45:39,810
So, if you're doing this because of me,

621
00:45:39,810 --> 00:45:42,030
we can just keep working together like now.

622
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:44,720
I-If you want to.

623
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,340
Well...

624
00:45:49,370 --> 00:45:52,690
But when I think about it,

625
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:57,500
it's a little awkward for you and I to be working together like this indefinitely.

626
00:45:57,540 --> 00:45:59,470
I don't know when, but

627
00:45:59,470 --> 00:46:03,060
we'll both start dating again, probably.

628
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:07,310
If I say I work in the same office as my ex-husband, who'd be happy about it?

629
00:46:07,310 --> 00:46:08,570
Isn't that true?

630
00:46:11,110 --> 00:46:14,220
That's true. You have a point.

631
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:23,500
Also, I do want to tread... the deeper waters now.

632
00:46:24,910 --> 00:46:27,990
My world has been too small so far.

633
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:34,630
- You'll root for me, right?
- Huh? Yes.

634
00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:36,650
Of course. I will.

635
00:46:36,650 --> 00:46:38,330

636

00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:05,110
Gosh, I also have plans tomorrow.

653
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:08,290
What about the day after tomorrow?

654
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:31,880
♫ Still filling my day to its fullest ♫

655
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:37,920
♫ I keep repeating your name ♫

656
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:47,580
♫ On the street where we walked hand in hand ♫

657
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:55,500
♫ I stay alone and think of you ♫

658
00:49:55,500 --> 00:50:03,500
♫ Can't have it ♫

659
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:09,800
♫ The warmth of that day ♫

660
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:13,780
♫ Close your eyes and look through them ♫

661
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:18,210
♫ and put it in them ♫

662
00:50:18,210 --> 00:50:22,530
♫ Dazzlingly shining ♫

663
00:50:22,530 --> 00:50:25,670
♫ I see you and me ♫

664
00:50:25,670 --> 00:50:29,540
♫ When the morning comes ♫

665
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:38,000
♫ I know it's a dream that will disappear ♫

666
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:44,990
♫ Then we say goodbye ♫

667
00:50:44,990 --> 00:50:47,470
- You came early.
- You, too, Mom.

668
00:50:47,470 --> 00:50:50,710
Thinking about a date with my daughter at a good place,

669
00:50:50,710 --> 00:50:53,240
I got ready quickly out of excitement.

670
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:54,530
What's this?

671
00:50:54,530 --> 00:50:57,570
Your pickup lines are getting better after you started dating.

672

- Let's eat delicious stuff.
- Okay, okay.

674
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:39,330
Welcome. Did you make an appointment?

675
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:42,340
Yes. It's Goo Eun Beom.

676
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:44,900
Eun Beom, one second, please.

677
00:51:44,910 --> 00:51:48,770
But why are you suddenly buying me an expensive meal

678
00:51:48,770 --> 00:51:51,410
at a place like this when there's no occasion?

679
00:51:51,410 --> 00:51:54,690
Well, I don't know. What could it be?

680
00:51:54,690 --> 00:51:57,020
Anything come to mind?

681
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:13,150
Is this your first time getting counseling?

682
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:17,470
Y-Yes.

683
00:52:17,470 --> 00:52:19,910
What made you come?

684
00:52:19,910 --> 00:52:22,890
Because my heart was in distress.

685
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:27,460
What could have made you distressed?

686
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:35,610
There's a woman...

687
00:52:36,850 --> 00:52:40,630
I broke up with more than about five times...

688
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:46,130
and she is now really trying to become

689
00:52:46,130 --> 00:52:48,470
strangers with me.

690
00:52:51,790 --> 00:52:54,710
It's my ex-wife, whom I divorced.

691
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:00,730
I'm sorry, Mom.

692
00:53:00,730 --> 00:53:02,730
I can't go on blind dates.

693
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:07,510
I gave it a lot of thought...

694
00:53:07,510 --> 00:53:10,640
I've lost a lot of hair because of Eun Beom

695
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:12,160
I still...

696
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:15,300
think I'll break up with him.

697
00:53:17,590 --> 00:53:21,370
Who could I date with such feelings?

698
00:53:21,370 --> 00:53:23,250
Perhaps...

699
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:29,050
it might be that I... just want to love...

700
00:53:32,830 --> 00:53:37,830
not... marry or date.

701
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:45,020
But I still can't figure out what love is.

702
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:57,020
Although I might just... wander around aimlessly and confused

703
00:53:57,020 --> 00:53:59,500
about everything in life,

704
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:02,590
ending up unmarried without any children...

705
00:54:02,590 --> 00:54:05,950
and eventually, die a lonely death alone...

706
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:12,820
I can't help it.

707
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:18,850
I can't do it anymore when I don't know what love is.

708
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:21,840
I'm sorry.

709
00:54:25,390 --> 00:54:27,380
It's okay.

00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:31,040
It's okay, Ha Ra.

711
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:34,170
I must've given you a really hard time, Ha Ra.

712
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:38,130
Because... I had a lot of hopes and wishes...

713
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:43,440
Regardless of... what kind of life you live,

714
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:48,690
I'm going to trust you and cheer for you.

715
00:54:48,690 --> 00:54:52,240
So, Ha Ra... it's okay.

716
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:54,710
Wander around a little more...

717
00:54:54,710 --> 00:54:56,720
until you find the answer.

718
00:54:57,900 --> 00:55:00,120
You can do that.

719
00:55:03,260 --> 00:55:05,300
What you need to know clearly is that...

720
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:09,300
my heart, when I say that, is trembling in fear.

721
00:55:16,410 --> 00:55:21,380
Still, since I love you... I know I have to...

722
00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:24,800
say this as your mother.

723
00:55:28,190 --> 00:55:31,310
I'm sorry for telling you this too late, Honey.

724
00:55:32,730 --> 00:55:35,960
Although I don't really know, either,

725
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:40,030
if love means these things that I do for you...

726
00:55:40,030 --> 00:55:43,650
love is a really hard thing.

727
00:55:43,650 --> 00:55:47,730
So do it when... you're ready.

- Gosh, preparing all this...
- My goodness.

743
00:57:33,090 --> 00:57:34,880
As you live together,

744
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:38,920
you'll find yourself getting sick of each other, disappointed in each other,

745
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:44,070
and things you just can't understand about each other constantly.

746
00:57:44,070 --> 00:57:47,780
Just like our clients.

747
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:50,660
However, if you keep trying to avoid

748
00:57:50,660 --> 00:57:53,190
and evade those things,

749
00:57:53,190 --> 00:57:55,750
your married life gets rocky.

750
00:57:55,750 --> 00:57:59,570
Just like our clients.

751
00:58:01,790 --> 00:58:05,260
As you two probably know already,

752
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:09,080
what I particularly want to tell two divorce lawyers

753
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:12,260
facing marriage is...

754
00:58:12,260 --> 00:58:14,790
a quote from the literary giant Shakespeare,

755
00:58:14,790 --> 00:58:18,260
who's way smarter than I am.

756
00:58:19,460 --> 00:58:21,410
If you can't avoid it,

757
00:58:21,410 --> 00:58:24,460
you might as well embrace it.

758
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:30,400
If you do that, you'll probably have to hug each other quite often.

759
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:36,100
And in the end, you'll have to love each other.

760
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:39,690
Since you two are doing this marriage thing,

761
00:58:39,690 --> 00:58:43,150
which is a hard and complicated choice to make,

762

in this day and age where one

763

I sincerely congratulate you two on becoming a married couple,

You're still having a proper wedding after giving birth to Sunny, right?

Not sure. If we're still living together, then, maybe?

When did you meet Jay? Tell me about it.

Wasn't this expensive?

I'm sorry. This is the best I can do.

776
00:59:29,590 --> 00:59:32,850
CEO Hong did all of it. CEO Seo doesn't know anything.

I'm sorry.

Those two did all the work.

782

It looks great on you.

How did you know my size to prepare this?

785
00:59:50,390 --> 00:59:52,570
- Those two did all the work.
- Gosh, it's tiring.

786
00:59:52,570 --> 00:59:55,340
It's a battlefield. A war.

01:00:13,300 --> 01:00:15,110
I got it.

794
01:00:15,110 --> 01:00:18,070
- Let us not meet at the court.
- Let's not do that.

I'll take off first.

803

Are you doing well?

You seem to be.

805
01:00:45,930 --> 01:00:47,520
Of course, I'm doing well.

806
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:50,080
What's a reason not to be?

807
01:00:53,410 --> 01:00:54,540
Where are you going?

808

To go play with them.

811
01:01:07,190 --> 01:01:08,820

01:01:14,180 --> 01:01:16,040
It's here.

814
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:24,930
~Thank you to all the subbers~

815
01:01:24,930 --> 01:01:29,930
~Thank you for watching~

816
01:01:29,930 --> 01:01:34,930
~Hope you enjoyed~

817

818
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:43,020
I'll be off now.

819
01:01:43,020 --> 01:01:44,890
See you next time.

820
01:01:47,670 --> 01:01:49,470
When?

821
01:01:49,470 --> 01:01:51,220
Not sure.

822
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:54,000
At court?

823
01:01:57,560 --> 01:01:59,880
Can I ask you one thing?

824
01:02:04,820 --> 01:02:08,190
What I really want to ask is...

825
01:02:09,540 --> 01:02:14,190
- Can we really...
- ...become strangers again?

826
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:16,480
That's what I want to know, too.

827
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:20,810
♫ At the sound of dawn coming ♫

828
01:02:23,150 --> 01:02:27,540
♫ I finally had realized ♫

829
01:02:29,510 --> 01:02:34,400
♫ Among my hidden pains ♫

830
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:42,200
♫ Another me was in there ♫

831
01:02:42,210 --> 01:02:49,050
[Thank you for watching Strangers Again.]
♫ The light from the window ♫

832
01:02:49,100 --> 01:02:55,400
♫ My heart that was in darkness ♫

833
01:02:55,420 --> 01:03:00,450
♫ Shines a new hope into it ♫

834
01:03:00,450 --> 01:03:07,190
♫ Everything is so radiant ♫

835
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:16,160
♫ All the times we spent together ♫

836
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:21,190
♫ Becomes a strength for me ♫

837
01:03:21,190 --> 01:03:26,400
♫ All of the happy memories ♫

838
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:34,180
♫ My way, at the same place ♫

839
01:03:34,180 --> 01:03:39,420
♫ Able to smile brightly ♫

840
01:03:39,420 --> 01:03:41,780
♫ My way ♫

841
01:03:41,780 --> 01:03:45,600
