Although it's clearly a fact that adultery was committed,

82
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,410
you'll be found guilty of libel if you tell anyone?

Yes.

You'd think you wouldn't be guilty of libel

00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:43,180
since the other person clearly committed the adultery,

86
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:46,400

factual defamation exists.
(Defamation of character by speaking the truth.)

88

Isn't the law a bit ridiculous in this case?

The concerned party is very angry because of the spouse's affair.

Exactly. The unfaithful person didn't do anything right.

So why does the other person have to endure everything?

94
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,270
Seriously. If that's the case,

95
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:10,110
then you can't do anything even if everyone commits adultery.

People who commit adultery generally

98

- F*** them up.

- Why, yes.
- How, exactly?

106
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:36,480
Against your spouse, file a divorce with maximum alimony.

107
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,210
And file a claim for damages against the affair partner.

108

- Whoa, it's more complicated than I thought.

Could it be that all the other places rejected his case?

00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:24,010
Bada means sea.

328
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:25,800
Jinjoo means pearl.

329
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,350
Sea-pearl.
(Sounds like "f***" in Korean)

330
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:31,840
That's right. He is that Bada-Jinjoo.

331
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,290
According to what I heard,

332
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:36,670
the two of them dated for a long time before marrying.

333
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:40,390
- Is that true?
- As far as I know for about 10 years?

334
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:43,090
- They were a campus couple in college.
- 10 years?

335
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:46,440
Gosh, I don't know if I should be saying this.

336
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:48,930
From what I know,

337
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:51,890
Attorney Goo followed her around, begging her to date him.

338
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:54,920
Whoa... How long did they live together?

339
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,440
Was it three years? I think it was even less than three years.

340
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,630
Amazing.

341
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:02,690
He even followed her around that much.

342
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:04,300
He's such a bad guy.

343
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,890
- Hey, Ha Ra.
- If you come here one more time,

344
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:09,520
I'll knock out all your teeth and make popcorn with them.

345
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,300
Get lost while I'm being nice.

346
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:14,100
Hey, wait!

347
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,980
Then I can't pay you alimony.

348
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,620
I have no source of income.

349
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:19,840
Is that okay for you?

350
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,010
Three million won per month wasn't a small amount.

351
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:24,040
I paid it every month, never a day late.

352
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,520
Yes.

353
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,860
That's your way of apologizing.

354
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:30,060
Calling it even with money.

355
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,810
Exactly.

356
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:36,930
Can't you recognize my sincerity now?

357
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:38,560
Wait.

358
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:42,020
- I don't even expect your forgiveness.
- Forgiveness?

359
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:44,060
Forgiveness?

360
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,800
Try paying 30 million, not three million won, until you die.

361
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,100
See if I'd forgive you.

362
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,700
He couldn't have... been that hurt, could he?

363
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,040
Why do you care? He's not even yours anymore.

364
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,380
Who cares if he gets hurt?

365
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:20,610
Gosh, I really can't understand CEO Seo.

366
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:22,740
His betrayal knows no bounds.

367
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:26,250
How could he bring him in without even a word to you?

368
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:33,700
Could he have something on CEO Seo?

369
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:40,170
- Unni, I think... he wants to try getting back with me.
- What?

370
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:43,200
CEO Seo called me in earlier before I got off work.

371
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,610
And then he said...

372
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:49,320
Hey, Attorney Oh.

373
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:52,970
In my opinion, I think he's done a lot of reflecting.

374
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:54,640
Did you call me in to say that?

375
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,110
- I feel sorry for him. He's going that far.
- CEO Seo!

376
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:02,630
Ha Ra, can't you just give him one more chance?

377
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:09,980
Please take him back again.

378
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:11,530
Please?

379
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:15,120
Gosh, this is nuts.

380
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,080
This fogey, seriously...

381
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,810
He has seriously gone mad, hasn't he?

382
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:24,170
Hey!

383
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:27,050
You can't. Okay?

384
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:29,650
Once a cheater, always a cheater. You know this.

385
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:31,020
You think I'm crazy?

386
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:33,920
There are things I see and learn from this line of work.

387
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:36,570
That's right.

388
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:39,890
You can't change someone. That's the truth.

389
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:41,490
Don't worry.

390
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:43,990
I'll never take him back in.

391
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:46,340
I'm not some pushover.

392
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,730
You're already a pushover.

393
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:53,130
You've become a pushover.

394
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:55,400
Gosh, my alcohol's about to go bad.

395
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,200
Let's stop talking about Goo Eun Beom now.

396
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,470
Just don't take him back in, right?

397
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:02,830
Right. You're right.

398
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:07,120
That's that, and to our left...

399
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:09,770
What do you think about them?

400
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:14,220
When did you even notice them?

401
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,400
Weren't you having a serious talk with me?

402
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,970
You think it's impossible to scan men while having a serious talk?

403
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:22,320
I can do everything.

404
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,850
Come on, look. Aren't they cute?

405
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:26,120
What do you say?

406
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,100
We're feeling down anyway...

407
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,820
Shall we join them?

408
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:33,580
I can't help but feel like I'm being used.

409
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,930
It's all in your head.

410
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:39,610
Kissing is the best for the forced collection of dopamine.

411
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:41,580
A deep kiss.

412
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:46,240
You're sober, right?

413
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,050
No, I don't want to. I can't.

414
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:49,340
You're an actor, aren't you?

415
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:50,640
Of course, I'd do it if it was acting.

416
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,610
But why do I have to go all the way there to act and shit?

417
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:54,810
Exactly.

418
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:57,010
You can just do it with gusto like a drama.

419
00:23:57,010 --> 00:24:00,010
"I still love you. I'll never break up with you."

420
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:01,650
Like that.

421
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:06,120
Why are you suddenly telling me to change my words?

422
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:11,300
At this point, we lack valid physical evidence to convince the judge right now.

423
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:14,400
If things go wrong, we might end up losing.

424
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,550
That's what other law firms also said, isn't that so?

425
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:21,640
So, it's hard to make this a winning case because

426
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:24,260
Na Soo Yeon's responsibility hasn't been proven.

427
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:27,300
Fortunately, since we also don't have the responsibility.

428
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:31,940
Even if they file a suit, it isn't easy for them to win, either.

429
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:34,700
If Na Soo Yeon's affair is certain,

430
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:38,400
the one who's more urgent for a divorce is them, not us.

431
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:43,920
But is there a reason to give your opponent what they want?

432
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,300
[Be Want Law Firm]
Sorry?

433
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:55,260
My client doesn't want the divorce, I said.

434
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:58,540
What is she saying? That's not what you said.

435
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:00,480
You're the one who first brought up divorce.

436
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,300
I said it out of anger. I didn't mean it.

437
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,880
I still love you.

438
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:21,530
I understand.

439
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:23,760
Then we'll file a suit on our end.

440
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,140
Seeking agreement or adjustment will be difficult anyway.

441
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:29,330
Asking to proceed to trial right away would be better, right?

442
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:33,180
The responsible spouse is filing for a divorce?

443
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:36,860
I guess you're trying to appeal to a non-fault divorce by proving it,
[Non-fault Divorce: A system that permits divorce even if neither party is "at fault'. If the marital relationship has in fact been irreparably broken.]

444
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:38,070
but wouldn't that be in vain?
[Non-fault Divorce: A system that permits divorce even if neither party is "at fault'. If the marital relationship has in fact been irreparably broken.]

445
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:40,720
Recently, there was a precedence where the responsible spouse
[Non-fault Divorce: A system that permits divorce even if neither party is "at fault'. If the marital relationship has in fact been irreparably broken.]

446
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,420
has no right to divorce even after proving a there was no fault in the marriage.

447
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:47,810
I guess you didn't get to check yet?

448
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:49,800
Why are we the responsible spouse?

449
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,850
Rather, responsibility for the breakdown of marriage is on Han Do Woon,

450
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:55,220
not Na Soo Yeon.

451
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:04,660
Whoa, things are getting interesting.

452
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:08,210
I got a call from a colleague a couple of days ago for the first time in forever.

453
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:10,330
Asking whether our firm is on this case or not.

454
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:13,800
As expected, it's drawing attention because it's a celebrity lawsuit.

455
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:18,950
CEO Seo, you came to this meeting instead of going to your tango lesson today.

456
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:20,560
Seriously...

457
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:23,110
even my dance teacher grabs me, saying

458
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:25,380
"Na Soo Yeon would never do that" and

459
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:28,700
asking if Han Do Woon has morbid jealousy.
(Also known as "delusional jealousy")

460
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:33,860
So, I said I'll look into it for sure.

461
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:37,160
Attorney Oh, doesn't that guy have morbid jealousy
(Also known as "delusional jealousy")

462
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:40,520
and has caused things to come this far because of delusions?

463
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,810
Are you really sure she cheated on him?

464
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:44,880
CEO Seo, what are you saying?

465
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,240
Is this our first time seeing this? The last straw strategy?

466
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,910
The media's going at it because it seems entertaining.

467
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:52,070
Morbid jealousy, my foot.

468
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:54,570
If they had proof, they'd have quietly submitted it to the court

469
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:56,290
instead of letting the media know.

470
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:58,910
And there's no decisive evidence for adultery yet?

471
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:02,640
I guess she prepared for a lawsuit for a long time.

472
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,150
There's nothing more.

473
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:06,600
Han Do Woon talked about hiring a private detective, but

474
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:10,410
I stopped him saying things would be harder for us if things backfired.

475
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:13,150
For now, we requested fact-checks on Na Soo Yeon's

476
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:15,400
financial transactions and travel history.

477
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,570
I'm sure we'll get something—

478
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,570
What's this?

479
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:23,190
- Did you call him in again, CEO Seo?
- No.

480
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:24,810
It wasn't me.

481
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:27,020
Why did you come? I said I was out of options now.

482
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:30,950
Hey... Han Do Woon's morbid jealousy, is that true?

483
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:32,700
No, it—

484
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:35,850
No, it isn't.

485
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:38,090
Did you come to ask that?

486
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,320
Then you were blindsided.

The other party requested a psychiatrist as a witness.

[Witness Request Form]
Does this make sense to you?

489
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:51,590
That you forgot about a psychiatric treatment because it's been too long?

490
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:53,220
I went about twice. That's all.

491
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:55,400
I went for insomnia because I couldn't sleep.

492
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,830
But you said you were struggling because of your ex-wife.

493

That's because my emotions back then—

494

Do Woon,

495

people will say whatever they want to say to make their point.

496
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:06,980
You should've told me about this.

497
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:11,170
So you're telling an actor to say he saw a therapist to a lawyer he met for the first time.

498
00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:14,700
"Hello, I'm actor Han Do Woon. I've been seeing a therapist lately.

499
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:17,610
That doesn't matter, right?" Like that?

500
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:20,220
Will you take responsibility if it gets leaked? Huh?

501
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:23,600
Come on, Brother. Please calm down.

502
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,220
It was leaked, though?

503
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:29,110
I can't take responsibility even if I want to. They've got all the information.

That's what I'm saying.

Is there a cause to apply for postponement?

515

I'll need to start thinking about it now.

already got a plan with the psychiatrist.

Because there's no loophole.

541
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:13,310
You'll create a loophole that isn't there for me?

542

- Did you prescribe him the medicine?
- No, I didn't.

I can't prescribe the medicine right away.

I need to consult the patient first.

594

In that case, what could be the cause of his insomnia?

595
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:08,000
Perhaps, was it because of Han Do Woon's circumstances back then?

596
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
It was caused by his ex-wife's adultery and

597
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,280
and he had gotten worse at the time of his visit.

598

Is that so? Then, why do you think his insomnia worsened?

599

His relationship with the person who cheated on him was over.

600

At the time, I heard he was seeing someone new.

601
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:30,850
If he couldn't reach her

602
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:34,180
or away from her too long, he felt anxious.

603
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:37,910
I think his insomnia worsened because of that.

604
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:42,030
Why would he get insomnia for not being able to reach someone?

00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:47,880
Is it even possible... to be pimping for your ex-wife?

640
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:50,850
Of course, it's easier to get back together.

641
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:55,200
You still love Ha Ra, don't you?

642
00:36:56,370 --> 00:36:58,020
You must be learning how to read minds.

643
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:00,160
Hey, it's obvious.

644
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:03,640
I've been a divorce lawyer for 30 years now!

645
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:07,370
In my opinion, you two are not over each other yet.

646
00:37:07,370 --> 00:37:12,830
Well, to put it in other words... hate is also love.

647
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:14,990
Hotter than love, actually.

648
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,400
Do you know what Ha Ra said if she'd lost this case?

649
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:28,510
She said she'd apply for a restraining order from the court.

650
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:31,780
Last night, I wrote a note saying I won't come near her if she loses

651
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:33,600
and even put my fingerprint on it.

652
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:37,020
She said she'll submit it as evidence when she's applying for it later.

653
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,300
- What are you doing?
- Hey...

654
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:45,450
What if she intentionally loses to get rid of you?

655
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:49,040
Geez! Write this after it's over.

656
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,690
When she wins.

657
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:02,900
How did your marriage life with Han Do Woon affect your work, Plaintiff?

658
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:09,400
Ms. Na Soo Yeon?

659
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:13,440
Ms. Na Soo Yeon!

660
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:18,200
Communication is important between actors,

661
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:22,400
but it became hard to maintain a relationship with my partnering actors.

662
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:27,070
Obviously, the atmosphere on the set couldn't have been good.

663
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:31,320
It wasn't easy to focus on acting as time passed by.

664
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,230
Did you talk to the defendant about how your work was affected

665
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:36,520
and implored for his understanding?

666
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,640
Even if I tried...

667
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:42,410
nothing changed.

668
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:46,050
Ultimately, I ended up concealing and giving excuses.

669
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:50,290
And then, we'd fight and scream without fail.

670
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:55,080
I understand. That will be all.

671
00:38:56,890 --> 00:39:00,570
Defendant's Representative, will you pass on the counter-examination again?

672
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:04,570
No, I'll proceed with a counter-examination.

673
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:18,080
Plaintiff, how did you find out the defendant had psychiatric treatment history?

674
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:20,090
I heard it from the defendant.

675
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:22,520
When did you hear about that fact from him?

676
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:26,150
It was about three to four months after I met him.

677
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:28,290
He said his insomnia was severe,

678
00:39:28,290 --> 00:39:31,580
so I suggested he try going again.

679
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:34,600
Since it's not a bad thing to see a therapist.

680
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:38,530
By chance, did you also recommend a hospital to him?

681
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:41,330
No, he looked into it himself.

682
00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:45,120
Saying he needs to be careful since he's an actor.

683
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:49,360
As he was getting psychiatric treatments,

684
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:53,290
did Han Do Woon's symptoms seem to improve?

685
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:57,010
No. He became busy with work,

686
00:39:57,010 --> 00:40:00,200
so he went to the hospital less often.

687
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:03,200
His symptoms were still the same.

688
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:07,700
Then, why did you decide to marry him?

689
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:11,530
If his mental health was concerning enough to recommend psychiatric treatment,

690
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:13,240
why not just break up?

691
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:15,780
Why would you decide to marry him?

692
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:18,360
It's like jumping into a fire with hay on your back.

693
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:27,790
Because...

694
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:31,020
I loved him.

695
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:38,430
I thought he would... get better if I tried hard.

696
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:50,460
You really did love him a lot, huh?

697
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:51,570
What is it?

698
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:54,170
That method you thought of.

699
00:40:55,610 --> 00:40:58,250
Admit to...

700
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:00,490
morbid jealousy.

701
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:01,730
Wh-What?

702
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:03,370
I said, admit to morbid jealousy.

703
00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:07,910
Admit to morbid jealousy and make the morbid jealousy frame powerless.

704
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:13,370
After that, you'll move the frame from morbid jealousy...

705
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:15,340
to change of heart.

706
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:23,400
Now then, let's summarize.

707
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:27,400
Defendant Han Do Woon was a poor man suffering from morbid jealousy,

708
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:30,660
captivated by trauma from the past, before and after marriage.

709
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:33,290
In short, nothing about him had changed.

710
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:37,760
But you are the one who changed.

711
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:43,200
So, the real cause of this divorce isn't Han Do Woon's morbid jealousy,

712
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,740
but your change of heart.

713
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:47,770
That's the real reason, right?

714
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,140
What is she saying?

715
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:55,780
Does that mean she's to blame?

716
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:58,020
I object, Your Honor.

717
00:41:58,020 --> 00:42:00,880
Defendant's Representative is describing her opinion instead of questioning.

718
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:04,890
I admit. I'll change to questioning instead of describing.

719
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:12,800
What's the reason for the change of your sacrificial and beautiful love that wanted

720
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:16,000
to embrace everything about your loved one?

721
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:21,310
Perhaps, you found a new person after being emotionally drained because of

722
00:42:21,310 --> 00:42:24,440
endless doubts from your beloved husband.

723
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,400
Is that the reason?

Ms. Na Soo Yeon, please answer.

Don't answer.

That will be all.

What do you think about the controversy regarding adultery—

731
00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:02,720
Is it true you were already lovers?

All right. Verdict.

736
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:14,020
Although there's difficulty in

737
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:18,700
maintaining the marriage because one in the married couple displays symptoms of illness,

when recovery is a possibility—

There's a duty to fully devote yourself to your spouse's recovery.

741
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:32,560
Without such proper endeavors, you may not file for divorce

We won't accept conditions other than those mentioned in the prenuptial agreement.
