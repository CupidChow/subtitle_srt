00:10:32,014 --> 00:10:33,134
Bring me the file.

165
00:10:33,134 --> 00:10:34,994
Okay.

166
00:10:34,994 --> 00:10:36,864
Like this...

167
00:10:36,864 --> 00:10:39,584
She stabbed him once and froze.

168
00:10:39,584 --> 00:10:41,644
Then someone just arrived at the elevator, and...

169
00:10:41,644 --> 00:10:44,394
started screaming like this, so...

170
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:46,164
she ran away because she was startled.

171
00:10:46,164 --> 00:10:48,424
- She ran away?
- Yes.

172
00:10:48,424 --> 00:10:52,634
The evidence, the witness, and the black boxes were all there at the scene anyway,

173
00:10:52,634 --> 00:10:54,944
She should've turned herself in instead of running.

174
00:10:54,944 --> 00:10:56,034
You can't understand, can you?

175
00:10:56,034 --> 00:10:58,144
She was arrested not too far from the scene?

176
00:10:58,144 --> 00:10:59,454
Yes.

177
00:10:59,454 --> 00:11:03,164
She couldn't deny it because of the victim's blood on her clothes.

178
00:11:03,164 --> 00:11:07,274
The guy was taken to the hospital, but since the wound wasn't deep,

179
00:11:07,274 --> 00:11:10,534
it doesn't seem life-threatening.

180
00:11:10,534 --> 00:11:12,224
Yes.

181
00:11:13,184 --> 00:11:15,324
What the heck? This is anti-climatic.

182
00:11:15,324 --> 00:11:17,524
Hey, it's not even a question of pleading guilty or not.

183
00:11:17,524 --> 00:11:19,674
It's either attempted murder or assault with a deadly weapon.

184
00:11:19,674 --> 00:11:22,884
But we'll claim there was no murderous intent.

185
00:11:22,884 --> 00:11:26,054
In that case, it's a first offense...

186
00:11:26,054 --> 00:11:28,764
the criminal motivation will be taken into account.

187
00:11:28,764 --> 00:11:31,724
After showing enough signs of remorse and...

188
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:34,534
convince the victim to settle on an agreement...

189
00:11:34,534 --> 00:11:37,384
it'll be anywhere from a mere probation

190
00:11:37,384 --> 00:11:40,214
to three or four years, at most.

191
00:11:40,214 --> 00:11:43,534
You get the picture just from reading the statement.

192
00:11:43,534 --> 00:11:44,994
Gosh, how disappointing.

193
00:11:44,994 --> 00:11:47,324
- I'm not doing it.
- Huh?

194
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,634
Should there have been more of it?

195
00:11:50,634 --> 00:11:53,184
- Of what?
- Blood.

196
00:11:53,184 --> 00:11:55,514
I'm not doing it. Get out.

197
00:11:59,324 --> 00:12:01,714
How ridiculous.

198
00:12:08,414 --> 00:12:10,124
What are you doing? Pack your clothes.

199
00:12:10,124 --> 00:12:11,324
Just for the time being.

200
00:12:11,324 --> 00:12:14,404
I'm not getting a divorce. I told you over the phone.

201
00:12:14,404 --> 00:12:17,164
Why won't you get a divorce?

202
00:12:17,164 --> 00:12:18,524
Are you crazy?

203
00:12:18,524 --> 00:12:21,314
You want to live under the same roof as that brute?

204
00:12:21,314 --> 00:12:23,484
There's a limit to how nice you can be.

205
00:12:23,484 --> 00:12:28,394
You're not being nice here you're being foolish!

206
00:12:28,394 --> 00:12:29,844
Are you afraid of the aunts?

207
00:12:29,844 --> 00:12:32,774
- You don't need to worry about them—
- It's not like that.

208
00:12:32,774 --> 00:12:35,634
Your aunts are telling me to break up with him.

209
00:12:35,634 --> 00:12:39,614
They said they'll give me everything, the house, and the car.

210
00:12:39,614 --> 00:12:41,354
That's good to hear.

211
00:12:41,354 --> 00:12:43,554
Just take them and break up, nice and neat.

212
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:46,064
What's the problem?

213
00:12:46,064 --> 00:12:47,534
Someone once said this.

214
00:12:47,534 --> 00:12:50,654
Breaking up with someone who had an affair...

215
00:12:50,654 --> 00:12:54,424
is basically blessing the two of them with happiness.

216
00:12:57,884 --> 00:13:03,314
Are you telling me to die a lonely death while watching the two of them live happily?

217
00:13:04,644 --> 00:13:07,764
I... I absolutely won't.

218
00:13:07,764 --> 00:13:10,534
I'm going to keep him by my side until I die.

219
00:13:10,534 --> 00:13:14,234
So you can just act like nothing's wrong.

220
00:13:14,234 --> 00:13:17,044
Do you think that's possible?

221
00:13:29,664 --> 00:13:31,534
All right.

222
00:13:33,564 --> 00:13:36,244
As you said, keep Dad by your side until you die.

223
00:13:36,244 --> 00:13:38,374
That's fine, then.

224
00:13:39,434 --> 00:13:40,694
But...

225
00:13:41,504 --> 00:13:44,434
don't contact me even if you two die!

226
00:13:44,434 --> 00:13:47,534
- Ha Ra...
- Don't you dare follow me!

227
00:13:50,804 --> 00:13:52,944
Ha Ra!

228
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:07,734
And then...

229
00:14:07,734 --> 00:14:12,674
I got over 10 missed calls from my mom.

230
00:14:12,674 --> 00:14:13,924
But I didn't answer a single call.

231
00:14:13,924 --> 00:14:17,204
Hey, even so, you're her child. That's being too harsh—

232
00:14:17,204 --> 00:14:18,974
Shut up and listen.

233
00:14:20,304 --> 00:14:24,434
Do you know how absurd my dad is?

234
00:14:24,434 --> 00:14:28,234
That man said he'll... sue her for...

235
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:33,254
defamation because she put up posters at his school.

236
00:14:33,254 --> 00:14:35,494
So I said this.

237
00:14:35,494 --> 00:14:38,004
Defamation?

238
00:14:38,714 --> 00:14:42,064
Who are you going to ask to do it?

239
00:14:42,064 --> 00:14:45,024
Because I'm too busy.

240
00:14:45,024 --> 00:14:49,074
I need to help my mom with her divorce...

241
00:14:58,084 --> 00:14:59,884
Laugh.

242
00:15:06,004 --> 00:15:08,144
Gosh, I'm about to lose it.

243
00:15:08,144 --> 00:15:11,394
How do you come up with lines like that?

244
00:15:12,424 --> 00:15:15,254
Just laugh only.

245
00:15:15,254 --> 00:15:17,394
Don't overreact.

246
00:15:34,464 --> 00:15:35,984
Oh, my gosh.

247
00:15:35,984 --> 00:15:37,804
You don't look human.

248
00:15:37,804 --> 00:15:39,954
Look who's talking.

249
00:15:46,574 --> 00:15:49,774
Man, I'm in trouble.

250
00:15:49,774 --> 00:15:51,964
I think I have a terminal illness.

251
00:15:51,964 --> 00:15:55,614
- My hangover is lasting three days.
- Stop drinking.

252
00:15:55,614 --> 00:15:57,534
Your body is protesting now.

253
00:15:57,534 --> 00:15:59,754
Asking you to spare its life.

254
00:16:00,394 --> 00:16:02,874
What about you? Who did you drink that much with last night?

255
00:16:02,874 --> 00:16:04,084
With Goo Eun Beom.

256
00:16:04,084 --> 00:16:06,214
Are you best friends or something?

257
00:16:06,214 --> 00:16:08,684
You drank that much with your ex-husband, not even a boyfriend?

258
00:16:08,684 --> 00:16:11,134
I had my reasons.

259
00:16:14,574 --> 00:16:16,544
We'll talk later.

260
00:16:21,894 --> 00:16:23,194
[Dear Mother]
Okay.

261
00:16:23,194 --> 00:16:25,634
I'll get a divorce, as you said.

262
00:16:25,634 --> 00:16:27,344
What do I need to prepare?

263
00:16:27,344 --> 00:16:29,534
Oh, my god...

264
00:16:31,524 --> 00:16:32,874
All of a sudden?

265
00:16:32,874 --> 00:16:35,704
She thought about it all night, not even sleeping.

266
00:16:35,704 --> 00:16:38,124
And she thinks getting a divorce is right after all.

267
00:16:39,464 --> 00:16:40,524
Thank you.

268
00:16:40,524 --> 00:16:41,464
So what?

269
00:16:41,464 --> 00:16:43,254
What do you mean, "so what?"

270
00:16:43,254 --> 00:16:46,024
I told her to prepare the documents.

271
00:16:46,024 --> 00:16:49,544
Did she tell your father? That she wants a divorce?

272
00:16:49,544 --> 00:16:51,594
She asked me to tell him.

273
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:54,594
Since she thinks she'll get a soft heart.

274
00:16:58,764 --> 00:17:02,574
You don't think... Dad will file a lawsuit, do you?

275
00:17:02,574 --> 00:17:05,584
He wouldn't get that low, would he?

276
00:17:05,584 --> 00:17:07,434
No way.

277
00:17:10,934 --> 00:17:12,984
You're busy, right?

278
00:17:12,984 --> 00:17:16,254
I complained too much to a busy guy.

279
00:17:16,254 --> 00:17:18,174
My head was just too clustered.

280
00:17:18,174 --> 00:17:21,064
This... Kim Ga Eun's case...

281
00:17:21,064 --> 00:17:23,654
will most likely get handed over to the prosecution this week.

282
00:17:23,654 --> 00:17:27,174
So I need to prepare the written opinion as soon as possible.

283
00:17:27,174 --> 00:17:28,924
Right...

284
00:17:28,924 --> 00:17:31,994
Hey, you took that case yourself?

285
00:17:31,994 --> 00:17:33,934
It happened that way.

286
00:17:33,934 --> 00:17:36,194
What happened to the man who got stabbed? Is he alive?

287
00:17:36,194 --> 00:17:38,724
- He's not dead, is he?
- He's alive.

288
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:41,144
She couldn't even stab him that deeply.

289
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:43,644
Oh, thank god.

290
00:17:46,064 --> 00:17:47,454
I'm sorry for that.

291
00:17:47,454 --> 00:17:49,334
Forget it.

292
00:17:50,394 --> 00:17:52,034
It's fine!

293
00:17:52,034 --> 00:17:55,834
Well, you were begging me to take it.

294
00:17:55,834 --> 00:17:58,134
I get to make money, so it's fine.

295
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,504
Thank you.

296
00:18:29,604 --> 00:18:31,924
Gosh, seriously...

297
00:19:13,044 --> 00:19:16,054
You're not planning to... file a lawsuit

298
00:19:16,054 --> 00:19:18,184
when your daughter is a lawyer, are you?

299
00:19:18,184 --> 00:19:20,344
Organize your documents and end it with an agreed divorce.

300
00:19:20,344 --> 00:19:22,814
I roughly organized the list of assets.

301
00:19:22,814 --> 00:19:25,314
Let me know if anything's missing.

302
00:19:30,574 --> 00:19:32,414
Don't look at me like that!

303
00:19:32,414 --> 00:19:34,434
You saw this coming.

304
00:19:34,434 --> 00:19:37,124
Did you think we'd keep living with you?

305
00:19:42,064 --> 00:19:44,774
Stop acting like you're the victim.

306
00:19:44,774 --> 00:19:48,544
Mom is the victim, not you...

307
00:19:48,544 --> 00:19:50,544
It's Mom and me.

308
00:19:50,544 --> 00:19:52,414
Got that?

309
00:20:05,114 --> 00:20:06,194
Ha Ra.

310
00:20:06,194 --> 00:20:07,434
Dad—

311
00:20:07,434 --> 00:20:09,664
Are you out of your mind?

312
00:20:10,764 --> 00:20:12,794
Ha Ra, please.

313
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:14,884
What's wrong with you?

314
00:20:15,484 --> 00:20:18,804
Get up. Get up—

315
00:20:18,804 --> 00:20:20,774
People are staring.

316
00:20:20,774 --> 00:20:22,064
Please...

317
00:20:22,064 --> 00:20:23,984
Get up. Get

318
00:20:23,984 --> 00:20:25,594
Ha Ra.

319
00:20:29,634 --> 00:20:30,754
Ha Ra...

320
00:20:30,754 --> 00:20:33,944
Gosh, I'm going nuts.

321
00:20:45,924 --> 00:20:48,274
That's really insane.

322
00:20:48,274 --> 00:20:50,964
Gosh, how's he so alike?

323
00:20:50,964 --> 00:20:53,134
My second stepdad was just like that.

324
00:20:53,134 --> 00:20:56,634
The second one, not the first one.

325
00:20:56,634 --> 00:20:59,514
He knelt before mom, clinging to her in tears...

326
00:20:59,514 --> 00:21:02,784
and acted like he was the victim, but...

327
00:21:04,094 --> 00:21:07,034
he was actually hiding his assets.

328
00:21:12,634 --> 00:21:17,534
Of course, Mom's attorney went and got a hold of all of them.

329
00:21:19,484 --> 00:21:20,764
Honey...

330
00:21:20,764 --> 00:21:23,304
you can't be getting soft-hearted. Okay?

331
00:21:23,304 --> 00:21:28,364
Don't be fooled by that and you need to push through like a serpent.

332
00:21:28,364 --> 00:21:30,524
You think he seems regretful, right?

333
00:21:30,524 --> 00:21:32,944
Nope. He'll never regret it.

334
00:21:32,944 --> 00:21:37,114
Even at that moment, a person thinks about how to make it out alive.

335
00:21:42,974 --> 00:21:44,634
Hey, Goo Eun Beom!

336
00:21:44,634 --> 00:21:48,034
Wow, have you been well?

337
00:21:48,034 --> 00:21:50,414
Yes, doing okay.

338
00:21:50,414 --> 00:21:51,874
Who knew we'd meet like this?

339
00:21:51,874 --> 00:21:52,744
I know.

340
00:21:52,744 --> 00:21:54,864
You never hit me up, not even once.

341
00:21:54,864 --> 00:21:58,134
We're not that close, are we?

342
00:21:58,134 --> 00:21:59,834
No, what I'm saying is...

343
00:21:59,834 --> 00:22:01,454
I'm the prosecutor in charge.

344
00:22:01,454 --> 00:22:03,334
Don't people usually give you a call?

345
00:22:03,334 --> 00:22:06,244
You're really something else.

346
00:22:07,734 --> 00:22:09,734
You don't still think...

347
00:22:09,734 --> 00:22:13,504
I have feelings for Oh Ha Ra, do you?

348
00:22:15,034 --> 00:22:17,684
I heard about your divorce.

349
00:22:17,684 --> 00:22:20,184
Hey, I have something called a conscience.

350
00:22:20,184 --> 00:22:23,314
I have no intention of pursuing my colleague's ex-wife.

351
00:22:23,314 --> 00:22:24,394
All right, all right.

352
00:22:24,394 --> 00:22:28,144
If our old history makes you uncomfortable, I'll go ahead.

353
00:22:28,144 --> 00:22:30,024
Jin Won...

354
00:22:30,634 --> 00:22:31,974
Yes.

355
00:22:31,974 --> 00:22:34,374
I usually don't take criminal cases, so...

356
00:22:34,374 --> 00:22:38,144
I didn't know I had to say hi to the public trial prosecutor separately.

357
00:22:38,144 --> 00:22:40,454
- Had I known, I would've done it first thing.
- Hey!

358
00:22:40,454 --> 00:22:42,874
I'm not the type to shy away from things like that.

359
00:22:42,874 --> 00:22:44,944
You know as well as I do.

360
00:22:46,104 --> 00:22:48,614
Oh, hey, that's right.

361
00:22:48,614 --> 00:22:50,874
Hey, I should've sold Ha Ra's name. Right?

362
00:22:50,874 --> 00:22:55,294
I had totally forgotten how you were trying so hard to get her.

363
00:22:55,294 --> 00:22:59,614
I remembered because you said it yourself.

364
00:23:00,934 --> 00:23:06,454
Hey, I would've introduced you to her only if Ha Ra didn't have a boyfriend.

365
00:23:08,034 --> 00:23:09,524
You know, feelings are always...

366
00:23:09,524 --> 00:23:13,994
coming and going, or going and coming, aren't they?

367
00:23:16,474 --> 00:23:18,384
Aren't you going?

368
00:23:23,824 --> 00:23:25,524
That punk...

369
00:23:27,234 --> 00:23:32,664
Defendant Kim Ga Eun... thoroughly planned to murder the victim, Kim Eui Cheol,

370
00:23:32,664 --> 00:23:34,914
when he didn't change his mind

371
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:38,704
rather than regretting her shameful act of adultery.

372
00:23:38,704 --> 00:23:43,984
This kind of behavior... is a critically grave crime that shakes the fundamentals of society.

373
00:23:43,984 --> 00:23:48,484
She also has a grave responsibility for destroying a family.

374
00:23:48,484 --> 00:23:51,294
As such, the prosecution is hereby bringing

375
00:23:51,294 --> 00:23:54,364
an indictment on this case to the said defendant.

376
00:23:56,294 --> 00:23:57,324
Defendant?

377
00:23:57,324 --> 00:23:59,674
Do you admit the prosecution's indictment cause?

378
00:23:59,674 --> 00:24:03,774
No, the defendant did not plan to murder the victim.

379
00:24:03,774 --> 00:24:05,654
Thus it was not attempted murder.

380
00:24:05,654 --> 00:24:07,884
We claim assault with a deadly weapon.

381
00:24:07,884 --> 00:24:11,644
Also, you did write a good indictment, but it's a bit long.

382
00:24:11,644 --> 00:24:15,884
I didn't think you'd read all this here, but you did, which surprised me.

383
00:24:15,884 --> 00:24:19,914
From now on, please summarize what's been submitted through text.

384

Please submit your evidence.

00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:33,904
I'll be proceeding with the trial, Attorney.

This is the list of evidence.

We admit to the first three and deny the rest.

What?

393
00:24:58,334 --> 00:25:02,104
- You can't use your phone during the trial.
- H-He died, Your Honor.

Yes, Mom. Do you have time today?

399
00:25:35,314 --> 00:25:38,884
I finished filling out the application to divorce by agreement.

400
00:25:38,884 --> 00:25:42,074
I just need your and Dad's signature stamps on it.

401
00:25:42,724 --> 00:25:45,774
Oh, what about tomorrow?

402

Should I go on the weekend?

403
00:25:50,384 --> 00:25:54,994
No... I'm not rushing you right now—

404
00:25:56,354 --> 00:25:58,834
Okay. Okay!

405
00:25:58,854 --> 00:26:00,324
Yeah.

406
00:26:09,864 --> 00:26:11,394
I'm going offsite.

407
00:26:11,394 --> 00:26:13,734
Okay, take care.

408
00:26:22,274 --> 00:26:24,914
Attorney Oh! Do you need something copied?

409
00:26:24,914 --> 00:26:29,384
O-Oh, no, Mr. Seong. It's just a single copy, so I can do it.

All right, Attorney Goo.

412
00:26:40,994 --> 00:26:43,274
Just one copy of the death certificate?

413
00:26:43,274 --> 00:26:46,354
Okay.

414
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:50,264
Why? What death certificate?

415
00:26:50,264 --> 00:26:52,834
You know the case Attorney Goo took?

416
00:26:52,834 --> 00:26:56,864
The victim who was stabbed died just now.

417
00:26:56,864 --> 00:26:58,534
What?

418
00:27:01,864 --> 00:27:04,054
What? Who died?

419
00:27:04,054 --> 00:27:05,664
Kim Eui Cheol.

420
00:27:05,664 --> 00:27:08,004
Wait, that's so sudden.

421
00:27:08,534 --> 00:27:13,734
Attorney Oh, then, Attorney Goo's trial is now doomed, isn't it?

422
00:27:26,984 --> 00:27:30,634
The prosecution applied to change the indictment.

423
00:27:30,634 --> 00:27:33,754
You're about to be indicted for murder now.

Why did Kim Eui Cheol all of a sudden...

425
00:27:38,354 --> 00:27:40,494
They said his life wasn't threatened...

426
00:27:40,494 --> 00:27:43,504
and he was in a stable condition, for sure.

427
00:27:46,514 --> 00:27:50,374
Did he have a chronic illness or something?

428
00:27:50,374 --> 00:27:52,444
I wished for him to die.

429
00:27:52,444 --> 00:27:54,744
So I'm glad.

430
00:27:54,744 --> 00:27:57,764
Is that something... you should say right now?

431
00:27:57,764 --> 00:27:59,614
Before going to him...

432
00:27:59,614 --> 00:28:02,254
I thought about it every day.

433
00:28:02,714 --> 00:28:04,634
"Should I just kill him?

434
00:28:04,634 --> 00:28:07,944
I won't need to suffer like this, then."

435
00:28:07,944 --> 00:28:10,454
After stabbing him...

436
00:28:12,044 --> 00:28:13,754
"I should've thrust deeper."

437

Kim Ga Eun...

438
00:28:14,994 --> 00:28:16,424
I'm saying I wanted to kill him.

439
00:28:16,424 --> 00:28:17,934
Kim Ga Eun, come to your senses.

440
00:28:17,934 --> 00:28:20,494
The sentence for murder is twice as much as attempted murder.

441
00:28:20,494 --> 00:28:22,364
You might end up dying in the cells.

442
00:28:22,364 --> 00:28:25,194
Do you understand what the situation is?

443
00:28:25,194 --> 00:28:27,994
Before his death, it was not easy to prove intentional murder.

444
00:28:27,994 --> 00:28:30,154
After his death, on the other hand...

445
00:28:30,154 --> 00:28:34,334
it's hard to prove the crime to be accidental!

446
00:28:41,604 --> 00:28:43,854
I'm not even asking you to pray for Kim Eui Cheol.

447
00:28:43,854 --> 00:28:48,034
However, a person died. In this case...

448
00:28:50,164 --> 00:28:53,404
you shouldn't be like this, should you?

449
00:28:57,854 --> 00:29:00,324
She's totally a psychopath.

450
00:29:00,324 --> 00:29:02,724
He was still her child's father, so how could she be so indifferent?

451
00:29:02,724 --> 00:29:04,534
Does it make sense that she wanted to kill him?

452
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:08,124
She wouldn't have stabbed someone if she was mundane.

453
00:29:10,434 --> 00:29:14,304
Things are getting more bloody now, so... does it interest you?

454
00:29:14,304 --> 00:29:16,984
Do you want to take the case now, CEO Seo?

455
00:29:17,934 --> 00:29:20,234
I don't really like that judge.

456
00:29:20,234 --> 00:29:23,084
She looks like my ex-wife's friend.

457
00:29:23,084 --> 00:29:25,964
What a petty reason you give.

458
00:29:25,964 --> 00:29:29,494
Your wife is the one who abandoned you, so why hate the judge?

459
00:29:29,494 --> 00:29:31,114
Even if she looks like her friend.

460
00:29:31,114 --> 00:29:35,164
Hey, she didn't abandon me. We graduated from marriage under the agreement.

461
00:29:35,164 --> 00:29:37,414
- Yeah, yeah.
- Huh? Hey!

462
00:29:37,414 --> 00:29:39,934
Why are you dumping your case on me?

463
00:29:39,934 --> 00:29:42,154
You little...

464
00:29:42,154 --> 00:29:46,804
Well... you're not taking it anyway. Also, I'm not dumping it.

465
00:29:46,804 --> 00:29:48,574
I really can't do this.

466
00:29:48,574 --> 00:29:50,874
How do I defend someone who says she wanted to kill?

467
00:29:50,874 --> 00:29:53,254
Don't do it if you don't want to!

468
00:29:53,254 --> 00:29:56,194
You can still sign to resign as her attorney.

469
00:29:57,814 --> 00:30:01,744
If I quit, CEO Hong is sure to tell me off.

"Even if you don't like the person...

471
00:30:06,004 --> 00:30:08,714
she still has a right to be defended."

472
00:30:13,324 --> 00:30:15,504
It's a criminal case.

473
00:30:15,504 --> 00:30:17,954
I can't force it on you.

474
00:30:17,954 --> 00:30:21,394
As you said, if she really doesn't show any sign of remorse,

475
00:30:21,394 --> 00:30:24,334
you might end up living in guilt for the rest of your life.

476
00:30:24,334 --> 00:30:27,354
Wondering if you had helped a criminal let loose.

477
00:30:27,354 --> 00:30:32,034
Well... I can't be responsible for that much.

478
00:30:32,884 --> 00:30:36,324
If you want to resign, you can think about it.

479
00:30:38,454 --> 00:30:40,014
Come in.

Oh, okay.

00:30:45,364 --> 00:30:46,434
- Who is it?
- Her daughter.

483
00:30:46,434 --> 00:30:47,524
- What?
- The daughter.

484
00:30:47,524 --> 00:30:50,434
Daughter?

485
00:30:50,434 --> 00:30:52,354
She had a daughter?

486
00:30:53,154 --> 00:30:55,724
- Attorney Goo is here.
- Okay.

487
00:30:55,724 --> 00:30:57,884

488
00:30:57,884 --> 00:30:59,074
Hello.

489
00:30:59,074 --> 00:31:00,734
Nice to meet you.

490
00:31:06,124 --> 00:31:07,414
Who is it?

491
00:31:07,414 --> 00:31:08,774
She's the daughter.

492
00:31:08,774 --> 00:31:10,474
Sorry?

493
00:31:13,944 --> 00:31:16,564
She's Kim Ga Eun's daughter.

494
00:31:18,204 --> 00:31:22,864
You want to... be your mom's sentencing witness?

495
00:31:22,864 --> 00:31:26,604
Yes. I searched the internet and read that

496
00:31:26,604 --> 00:31:29,344
these things can be grounds for lighter sentencing.

497
00:31:29,344 --> 00:31:33,384
Could it be that... even such witnesses won't help in Mom's case?

498
00:31:33,384 --> 00:31:35,494
No, not at all.

499
00:31:35,494 --> 00:31:40,494
Well... I'm worried because you're a minor.

500
00:31:40,494 --> 00:31:42,164
Minors can't do it?

501
00:31:42,164 --> 00:31:44,524
It's not like that, but...

502
00:31:46,254 --> 00:31:50,364
your heart may be... hurt because of the issue...

503
00:31:51,204 --> 00:31:53,674
of your mom and dad.

504
00:31:57,854 --> 00:32:00,824
I'm sorry about your father.

505
00:32:00,824 --> 00:32:03,184
My mother isn't...

506
00:32:04,144 --> 00:32:07,134
someone who'd kill Father.

507
00:32:08,454 --> 00:32:10,774
She told me not to hate him,

508
00:32:11,524 --> 00:32:13,834
that he didn't abandon me,

509
00:32:13,834 --> 00:32:16,084
that he still

510
00:32:16,084 --> 00:32:19,824
thinks about me. She said that every day.

511
00:32:26,334 --> 00:32:28,484
That's why I came.

512
00:32:29,004 --> 00:32:30,724
I think no one, besides me,

513
00:32:30,724 --> 00:32:34,234
would be on Mom's side...

514
00:32:46,044 --> 00:32:48,274
How are things here?

515
00:32:50,164 --> 00:32:56,304
I'd rather... die than defend you.

516
00:32:56,304 --> 00:32:58,444
I was the one who wanted to take your case,

517
00:32:58,444 --> 00:33:01,564
but I feel that this is wrong.

518
00:33:01,564 --> 00:33:03,974
The person you stabbed died.

519
00:33:03,974 --> 00:33:07,284
Whether intentional or accidental.

520
00:33:07,884 --> 00:33:10,134
You came to tell me that?

521
00:33:10,134 --> 00:33:11,444
No.

522
00:33:11,444 --> 00:33:14,064
I wanted to hear the truth.

523
00:33:14,064 --> 00:33:18,724
Because you're also someone's daughter... and a mother.

524
00:33:19,734 --> 00:33:24,674
Also... this will be the last time.

525
00:33:24,674 --> 00:33:27,754
Tell me honestly what you were thinking

526
00:33:27,754 --> 00:33:31,734
and feeling when you stabbed Kim Eui Cheol, please.

527
00:33:31,734 --> 00:33:36,804
That way... I think I can make up my mind.

528
00:33:39,354 --> 00:33:41,784
Did you really want to kill him?

529
00:33:42,504 --> 00:33:45,504
So badly that you'd give up...

530
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:48,244
on your family and look away?

531
00:33:50,224 --> 00:33:52,394
I...

532
00:33:53,124 --> 00:33:55,784
Young Bi came to see me.

533
00:33:55,784 --> 00:33:58,844
Saying her mom's not that kind of a person...

534
00:33:59,334 --> 00:34:03,734
That her mother told her not to hate her father.

535
00:34:04,364 --> 00:34:06,734
But why did you stab him?

536
00:34:17,574 --> 00:34:19,584
That's not it.

537
00:34:20,934 --> 00:34:24,294
I didn't plan on doing that at first.

538
00:34:24,944 --> 00:34:29,664
Because that man... kept saying...

539
00:34:30,524 --> 00:34:33,364
he won't let Young Bi be...

540
00:34:33,364 --> 00:34:35,014
I got angry.

541
00:34:35,014 --> 00:34:37,604
I wanted to show him.

542
00:34:37,604 --> 00:34:42,724
I had to show him how I'll protect my own child.

543
00:34:43,204 --> 00:34:46,714
I really... didn't plan to do that.

544
00:34:46,714 --> 00:34:48,924
It's the truth, Attorney Goo.

545
00:34:48,924 --> 00:34:51,854
I didn't plan on killing him.

546
00:35:03,304 --> 00:35:06,214
Why are you telling me this now?

547
00:35:08,224 --> 00:35:10,904
Had you been honest from the start...

548
00:35:10,904 --> 00:35:12,944
Young Bi will...

549
00:35:14,404 --> 00:35:17,114
find out then.

550
00:35:18,224 --> 00:35:22,394
About what threats her dad made.

551
00:35:22,394 --> 00:35:25,154
I couldn't let her know that.

552
00:35:25,714 --> 00:35:29,544
That's the only thing. I really didn't want to kill him.

553
00:36:16,054 --> 00:36:17,934
Knock, knock.

554
00:36:23,634 --> 00:36:29,774
I heard... you're defending Kim Ga Eun because of her daughter?

555
00:36:29,784 --> 00:36:31,714
Everyone at the office knows already.

556
00:36:31,714 --> 00:36:35,634
Well... it is what it is.

557
00:36:35,634 --> 00:36:37,514
She's really something else.

558
00:36:37,514 --> 00:36:41,084
She looked these things up on the internet and came?

559
00:36:41,084 --> 00:36:43,444
She's a really smart kid.

560
00:36:43,444 --> 00:36:44,600
How old is she?

561
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,630
15 years old.

562
00:36:48,444 --> 00:36:53,934
She's probably at the height of her adolescent years... but she matured too much.

563
00:36:57,394 --> 00:37:01,774
Would that Oh Ro Ra girl also be as mature?

564
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:12,054
What... happened to your parents' divorce?

565
00:37:12,054 --> 00:37:15,224
Mom's saying one thing today and another tomorrow.

566
00:37:15,224 --> 00:37:18,264
Her mind paces every day.

567
00:37:18,854 --> 00:37:21,564
Would divorce be easy?

568
00:37:21,564 --> 00:37:23,744
It's only easy to say.

569
00:37:29,224 --> 00:37:33,794
I guess my mom... doesn't find divorce easy, either.

570
00:37:33,794 --> 00:37:36,204
I mean, what's so hard about it?

571
00:37:37,494 --> 00:37:41,194
How can she live with him when her back must be bleeding?

572
00:37:41,194 --> 00:37:43,714
I mean, that's true, but...

573
00:37:43,714 --> 00:37:48,754
I guess Mom finds it hard to make up her mind since Dad keeps clinging to her.

574
00:37:48,754 --> 00:37:53,324
I told you. He even knelt in front of me.

575
00:37:53,324 --> 00:37:55,174
Is kneeling down such a hard thing?

576
00:37:55,174 --> 00:37:59,334
The media makes it look like such a grand gesture,

577
00:37:59,334 --> 00:38:01,614
but it's not really that hard.

578
00:38:01,614 --> 00:38:05,024
A person will go even lower should there be a need for it.

579
00:38:05,024 --> 00:38:07,534
You know, the thing with crocodile tears and all.

580
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:11,414
Why don't you convince your mom and come out of that house?

581
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:13,914
She can live at your house.

582
00:38:13,914 --> 00:38:16,054
Mom doesn't want to.

583
00:38:19,144 --> 00:38:22,024
Let's stop. There's no answer to this anyway.

584
00:38:22,024 --> 00:38:25,384
Okay, well, it's your family's matter anyway.

585
00:38:34,504 --> 00:38:38,234
Are you... displeased?

586
00:38:38,234 --> 00:38:40,634
That my mom and dad aren't getting a divorce?

587
00:38:40,634 --> 00:38:43,834
What do you mean?

588
00:38:43,834 --> 00:38:46,904
I mean... I'm telling you honestly how I feel.

589
00:38:46,904 --> 00:38:49,364
How complicated I feel...

590
00:38:49,364 --> 00:38:51,534
but why do I feel like you're interrogating me?

591
00:38:51,534 --> 00:38:55,084
Me? Interrogating you?

592
00:38:55,084 --> 00:38:58,504
Never mind. Let's quit it.

593
00:39:05,184 --> 00:39:09,904
Is he saying my mom needs to divorce three times because his mom did?

594
00:39:09,904 --> 00:39:12,924
He keeps treating my mom like a fool for not divorcing.

595
00:39:12,924 --> 00:39:14,964
I'm sure he didn't treat her like a fool.

596
00:39:14,964 --> 00:39:17,074
He probably was just stating his opinion.

597
00:39:17,074 --> 00:39:18,904
No, he wasn't—

598
00:39:18,904 --> 00:39:20,734
You can tell just by looking at his face.

599
00:39:20,734 --> 00:39:21,954
It was written on his face.

600
00:39:21,954 --> 00:39:25,474
"Whoa, this family is hopeless."

601
00:39:27,664 --> 00:39:30,004
Hey...

602
00:39:30,004 --> 00:39:31,984
Just 10 minutes, please!

603
00:39:31,984 --> 00:39:34,984
Listen to me for just five minutes!

604
00:39:34,984 --> 00:39:38,474
Gosh, my chest is about to explode from frustration!

605
00:39:38,474 --> 00:39:40,854
Hey, I need to draft the written statement by today.

606
00:39:40,854 --> 00:39:42,844
The trial is only two days away.

607
00:39:42,844 --> 00:39:46,094
I'm listening, so just go ahead.

608
00:39:46,794 --> 00:39:49,884
Hey, Jae Gyeom is calling me.

609
00:39:49,884 --> 00:39:51,334
Answer it. Answer the call.

610
00:39:51,334 --> 00:39:53,434
Why is he calling me now?

611
00:39:53,434 --> 00:39:55,174
On speaker.

612
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,604
[Min Jae Gyeom]

613
00:39:58,604 --> 00:40:00,994
- Yes, Jae Gyeom.
- Where are you, Hyung?

614
00:40:00,994 --> 00:40:03,804
I'm so frustrated. Can you buy me a drink?

615
00:40:03,804 --> 00:40:05,204
Drink?

616
00:40:05,204 --> 00:40:08,454
I'm a little busy right now, so I'm at the office.

617
00:40:08,454 --> 00:40:10,024
I'm not done with work yet.

618
00:40:10,024 --> 00:40:13,624
Oh, really? I'm nearby, so I'll go to your office.

619
00:40:13,624 --> 00:40:15,144
You don't need to buy me a drink.

620
00:40:15,144 --> 00:40:18,554
Please just hear me out for 30 minutes.

621
00:40:21,534 --> 00:40:22,994
I don't think I can.

622
00:40:22,994 --> 00:40:25,254
When do you finish, then?

623
00:40:25,254 --> 00:40:28,224
Well, one second, please...

624
00:40:30,364 --> 00:40:31,644
I think I'll be here all night.

625
00:40:31,644 --> 00:40:33,414
It's because I'm really upset.

626
00:40:33,414 --> 00:40:35,944
I won't take too much of your time, okay?

627
00:40:37,454 --> 00:40:41,634
Or are you with someone right now?

628
00:40:41,634 --> 00:40:44,104
No, I'm all alone.

629
00:40:44,104 --> 00:40:47,314
I'll be there soon, so please lend me a few minutes.

630
00:40:47,314 --> 00:40:48,494
I'll be there soon!

631
00:40:48,494 --> 00:40:50,394
[Eun Beom]

632
00:40:50,934 --> 00:40:55,934
Hey... So why would you lie and say you're sleeping at home?

633
00:40:55,934 --> 00:40:58,844
Should I tell him I came to snitch on him to you, then?

634
00:40:58,844 --> 00:41:00,724
Whatever. I'm going.

635
00:41:00,724 --> 00:41:02,754
I'll be off.

636
00:41:25,824 --> 00:41:27,724
Ha Ra...

637
00:41:33,194 --> 00:41:34,344
Jae Gyeom...

638
00:41:34,344 --> 00:41:36,384
What are you doing here?

639
00:41:36,384 --> 00:41:38,014
Well...

640
00:41:38,764 --> 00:41:42,394
- I forgot something here, so...
- Forget it.

641
00:41:43,394 --> 00:41:45,884
Let's talk for a minute.

642
00:42:07,884 --> 00:42:12,214
Why don't you quit working there... and move to another office?

643
00:42:15,114 --> 00:42:16,984
Why? You don't want to?

644
00:42:16,984 --> 00:42:21,194
- Jae Gyeom, nothing happened between—
- I know.

645
00:42:22,554 --> 00:42:25,444
But things could happen in the future, causing me to misunderstand.

646
00:42:25,444 --> 00:42:27,304
It would never.

647
00:42:27,304 --> 00:42:29,194
Never...

648
00:42:30,384 --> 00:42:33,124
How can you guarantee that?

649
00:42:33,124 --> 00:42:34,634
He...

650
00:42:34,634 --> 00:42:38,194
- He really has no feelings—
- But you do.

651
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:43,600
Those feelings... When will you finally be over them?

Looking at the location and depth of the wound, please tell us your

I can't say for sure, but you can say his chances of death would be slim.

What could have been Kim Eui Cheol's cause of death, then?

696
00:47:17,634 --> 00:47:19,490
I wrote it in my opinion letter,

697
00:47:19,490 --> 00:47:22,790
but he had a chronic abdominal aortic aneurysm.

698
00:47:22,794 --> 00:47:25,444
With the size of his aneurysm,

699
00:47:25,444 --> 00:47:27,824
he has to be careful about elevated blood pressure.

700
00:47:27,824 --> 00:47:32,924
It looks like his blood pressure rose when he was stabbed, and his aortic aneurysm ruptured.

his death is totally unrelated to the injury caused by Defendant Kim Ga Eun.

703

[Prosecutor's Seat]
Objection, Your Honor.

704
00:47:41,964 --> 00:47:46,324
Can't you say his aortic aneurysm was ruptured because he was stabbed?

705
00:47:46,324 --> 00:47:48,704
If he didn't cheat on his wife,

he wouldn't have been stabbed.

Defendant Representative, please ask your question again.

00:48:09,454 --> 00:48:11,244
Okay, I'll ask her again.

712
00:48:11,244 --> 00:48:15,434
Could the victim's wound, without taking the aortic aneurysm into account,

713
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:18,684
be a critical wound, in a doctor's opinion?

714
00:48:18,684 --> 00:48:21,064
Given that there are no chronic illnesses,

715
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:24,884
I don't think it was critical enough to cause death.

716
00:48:34,644 --> 00:48:36,444
That's all.

717
00:48:43,384 --> 00:48:45,394
Since this case doesn't...

concern a couple whose married status has been established,

719
00:48:48,514 --> 00:48:50,824
it's hard to make the usual comparisons. However...

720
00:48:50,824 --> 00:48:54,024
I heard scenes of murders between family members have a distinct

721
00:48:54,024 --> 00:48:56,534
difference from those of regular murders?

722
00:48:56,534 --> 00:48:58,574
- Yes.
- What's the difference?

723
00:48:58,574 --> 00:49:03,024
Generally, when a spouse stabs the other spouse in the spur of a fight,

724
00:49:03,024 --> 00:49:04,754
most of them turn themselves in.

725
00:49:04,754 --> 00:49:06,334
Oh, is that so?

726
00:49:06,334 --> 00:49:09,634
Does that mean it's rare to see one run away?

727
00:49:09,634 --> 00:49:11,164
It almost never happens.

728
00:49:11,164 --> 00:49:15,544
It's actually more common for the stabber to call the police or the ambulance out of shock.

729
00:49:15,544 --> 00:49:18,354
Oh, is that so?

730
00:49:18,354 --> 00:49:23,204
In that case... why would Kim Ga Eun have chosen to run away?

731

Objection, Your Honor.

733
00:49:26,444 --> 00:49:30,194
It isn't right to ask the detective why the suspect ran away and not the person.

734
00:49:30,194 --> 00:49:33,744
I'm asking only about a veteran detective's statistical knowledge.

Okay, please go on.

738
00:49:45,644 --> 00:49:49,534
The first reason is when this isn't a first offense...

739
00:49:49,534 --> 00:49:52,324
meaning they can't be caught since they're on probation.

740
00:49:52,324 --> 00:49:54,434
The other reason is when...

741
00:49:55,254 --> 00:49:57,404
they didn't intend to stab only once.

00:56:08,484 --> 00:56:10,914
There's a difference now.

814
00:56:10,914 --> 00:56:14,124
I'm asking if you can accept

815
00:56:14,124 --> 00:56:17,444
even his child from an affair and forgive him.

816
00:56:25,784 --> 00:56:27,754
If you can't, you should stamp it today—

817
00:56:27,754 --> 00:56:29,814
Okay, I understand.

818
00:56:35,434 --> 00:56:37,354
I understand.

819
00:56:37,354 --> 00:56:39,364
I won't complain about that.

820
00:56:39,364 --> 00:56:40,994
That's it, right?

821
00:56:44,174 --> 00:56:46,754
H-Honey...

822
00:56:51,084 --> 00:56:55,354
Honey, thank you. Thank you so much.

823
00:56:55,354 --> 00:56:57,924
- Thank you so much, Honey!
- Get off.

824
00:57:18,444 --> 00:57:21,194
Wait... s-she's...

825
00:57:30,344 --> 00:57:32,214
Y-You...

826
00:57:32,214 --> 00:57:34,864
I had a fight with Mom and left home.

827
00:57:34,864 --> 00:57:37,294
Please raise me, Dad.

828
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:44,044
Ro Ra, let's talk outside. Okay?

829
00:57:44,044 --> 00:57:45,794
Come on. Come outside with Dad and—

830
00:57:45,794 --> 00:57:47,554
Dad.

831
00:57:53,064 --> 00:57:55,244
Go and tend to Mom.

832
00:57:58,614 --> 00:58:00,864
You come and talk with me.

833
00:58:07,694 --> 00:58:08,954
Where's your house?

834
00:58:08,954 --> 00:58:10,764
Let's talk on the way. I'll take you home.

835
00:58:10,764 --> 00:58:12,594
I'm not going home.

836
00:58:12,594 --> 00:58:15,594
- I'm going to live here.
- How dare you...

837
00:58:16,424 --> 00:58:18,384
choose to live at my house?

838
00:58:18,384 --> 00:58:19,794
That's absurd.

839
00:58:19,794 --> 00:58:21,674
Are you the owner of that house?

840
00:58:21,674 --> 00:58:23,474
It's my dad's house.

841
00:58:23,474 --> 00:58:25,874
Acting high and mighty with my dad's house...

842
00:58:25,874 --> 00:58:27,814
You're not the only daughter.

843
00:58:27,814 --> 00:58:29,724
I'm also Dad's daughter!

844
00:58:29,724 --> 00:58:33,154
I also have a right to live at my dad's house.

845
00:58:33,154 --> 00:58:34,424
No, you don't.

846
00:58:34,424 --> 00:58:37,284
You don't have a right.

847
00:58:37,964 --> 00:58:43,074
This isn't my dad's house, but my parents' house.

848
00:58:43,074 --> 00:58:47,344
Although Dad bought the house decades ago in his name,

849
00:58:47,344 --> 00:58:50,354
my mom's contribution as a homemaker over the last few decades

850
00:58:50,354 --> 00:58:53,124
will also be recognized after divorcing.

851
00:58:53,124 --> 00:58:56,484
You don't even know the law but dare to argue about rights.

852
00:58:56,484 --> 00:58:58,014
You're a really funny brat.

853
00:58:58,014 --> 00:59:01,014
I'm not a brat! I'm 16 years old!

854
00:59:01,014 --> 00:59:03,144
Oh, how great for you.

855
00:59:03,144 --> 00:59:05,314
16-years-old? Do you have an 8th-grade illness?
(Slang for teenage angst, bad attitude)

856
00:59:05,314 --> 00:59:08,244
I'm not in 8th grade. I'm in 9th grade!

857
00:59:08,244 --> 00:59:09,734
This auntie, seriously...

858
00:59:09,734 --> 00:59:12,284
What, "auntie?" This little brat, seriously. Hey...

859
00:59:12,284 --> 00:59:15,514
Do you want to be sued for defamation by a lawyer—

860
00:59:23,304 --> 00:59:25,194
Mom...

861
00:59:25,194 --> 00:59:27,214
M-Mom...

862
00:59:43,834 --> 00:59:48,834
I can't believe the world I lived in was such a weak layer of thin ice.

863
00:59:49,864 --> 00:59:52,594
I was never able to realize it.

864
00:59:53,524 --> 00:59:57,004
More so than ever, names such as family

865
00:59:57,004 --> 00:59:59,234
and relationships...

866
00:59:59,234 --> 01:00:02,084
all feel like an illusion.

867
01:00:02,084 --> 01:00:04,334
In a moment like this...

868
01:00:04,334 --> 01:00:08,154
if someone would hold my hand and walk...

869
01:00:08,154 --> 01:00:10,164
how nice would it be?

870
01:00:54,854 --> 01:00:58,784
However, that hand will also...

871
01:00:59,644 --> 01:01:02,444
be a mere illusion in the end.

872
01:01:32,104 --> 01:01:35,314
[Oh Ha Ra]

873
01:01:36,274 --> 01:01:37,864
Yes.

874
01:01:38,954 --> 01:01:40,214
Where are you?

875
01:01:40,214 --> 01:01:42,024
Mom's house.

876
01:01:42,024 --> 01:01:43,584
What now?

877
01:01:48,314 --> 01:01:49,914
Hello?

878
01:01:52,484 --> 01:01:54,304
Eun Beom...

879
01:01:57,724 --> 01:01:59,600
- What's wrong with you?
- Hey...

880
01:02:06,664 --> 01:02:09,124
I really want to die.

881
01:02:10,664 --> 01:02:12,274
Where are you right now?

882
01:03:25,624 --> 01:03:27,654
♫ I'm not okay ♫

883
01:03:27,654 --> 01:03:29,504
No matter how I think, Goo isn't right.

884
01:03:29,504 --> 01:03:31,414
- Ha Ra...
- Gosh, I must've gone mad.

885
01:03:31,414 --> 01:03:35,624
It's because Oh Ha Ra the fool likes him!

886
01:03:36,604 --> 01:03:39,824
Attorney Goo said you can't come in, Attorney Oh.

887
01:03:39,824 --> 01:03:41,064
Only me?

888
01:03:41,064 --> 01:03:43,344
Ha Ra, am I easy prey to you?

889
01:03:43,344 --> 01:03:45,784
-Don't you loath me?
- Of course, I do!

890
01:03:45,784 --> 01:03:47,364
- Good morning.
- I'm sure both families'...

891
01:03:47,364 --> 01:03:51,874
paradoxical feelings were opposing each other.

892
01:03:51,874 --> 01:03:54,524
I love you, Goo Eun Beom. Do you want to get back together with me?

893
01:03:54,524 --> 01:03:58,674
