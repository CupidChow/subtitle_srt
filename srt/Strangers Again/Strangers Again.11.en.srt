yawning every second, although we're exhausted.

102
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:34,620
But they themselves complained all night and messed up the mood.

103
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:40,160
Now, they even want to show us a dogfight as the finale.

104
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:44,450
This is too funny for me.

105
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:50,320
Isn't the fact that humans can be this selfish and childish,

106
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,650
so cute and funny?

107
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:56,330
Is it only me? CEO Hong, is it only me who finds it cute?

108

It's cute only to me, huh?

109
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:04,840
Is that why I want to just crash everything and

111

You'll grab a taxi, too, right, Attorney Oh?

128
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:10,150
Well, I have to stop by somewhere.

129

It's here. Guys, hurry! The cab is here.

Where are you?

135
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:52,430
Why did you leave first?

136
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,310
Hello?

137
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:57,910
- Yes.
- I asked you a question.

138
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:01,430
You could've let me know. I thought we were going together.

139
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:03,620
I just wasn't feeling it.

140
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:06,110
Did something unpleasant happen to you today?

141
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:08,270
You seemed okay until lunch earlier.

142
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:10,470
Why are you doing this suddenly?

143
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:13,000
Hello.

144
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,580
Yes.

145
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,880
Why aren't you saying anything?

146
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,640
I'm asking why you're bent out of shape again.

147
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:22,050
What do you mean why?

148
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:26,610
You know I'm always fickle like I have bipolar disorder. Just let it be.

149
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:28,280
What?

150
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:36,320
Gosh, did he eat twisted donuts with the alcohol?

151
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,030
Hey, why are you throwing shade at me after getting cynical on your own?

152
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:42,140
You get cynical on your own,

153
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:44,360
then you're sarcastic with me when I'm clueless.

154

You don't even tell me when I ask you why.

Why do you ruin my mood, too?

Today's company dinner was also uneasy for me... in many ways.

Forget it.

159

Let's stop talking. Hang up.

160
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:07,410
Think about it again,

161
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:09,570
and if you feel like apologizing...

162
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:12,330
leave me a text or whatever.

163
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:42,740
What's this? I told you to leave me a text.

00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:55,310
I thought it'd be better to tell you this in person.

166
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:01,720
Let's end things here.

167
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,110
Let's wrap it up.

168
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:16,670
Why?

169
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:20,770
You don't want to give up having kids.

170
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:26,430
That's... it?

171
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:32,050
I know you weren't happy during today's company dinner.

172
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:35,140
Since we were all congratulating Senior Kang's sudden pregnancy...

173
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:38,920
putting candles on a cake and all of that...

174
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:41,350
You were feeling uneasy.

175
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:43,250
And jealous.

176
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:47,110
In the meantime, your mother is telling you to break up with me.

177
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:51,540
- What do you—
- You must've been thinking about breaking up with me, too.

178
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:55,050
In the end, the issue is about who will be the bad guy.

179
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:58,170
I'll just take that role.

180
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:00,270
It has been my specialty.

181
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:01,700
- I'm really—
- It's okay.

182
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,680
It's okay and...

183
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,710
No one did anything wrong, and there's no victim or offender.

184
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:12,600
Our ideologies and values just didn't match. Right?

185
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,340
I won't resent you, so don't resent me, either.

186
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,910
Well...

187
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:20,250
you probably wouldn't anyway.

188
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:26,290
You're actually... thankful to me... aren't you?

189
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,450
Yeah.

190
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,170
I'm really...

191
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,190
so thankful.

192
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,380
For not...

193
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:46,250
letting me get stuck with a nutcase like you...

194
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,610
I'm so, so thankful.

195
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:04,150
Go. Don't just watch me.

196
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:11,250
I said, get lost!

197
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:19,240
♫ With small lips that whispered eternity ♫

198
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:25,190
♫ At those harsh words I spit out ♫

199
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:34,600
♫ I'm afraid all the memories of the past will fade ♫

200
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:39,320
If I didn't tell him to get lost, would he not have gone?

201
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:42,420
Wait, no.

202
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:45,450
The twisted donut must've been the problem.

203
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:49,510
I shouldn't have said the twisted donut part.

204
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:54,740
♫ By your side ♫

205
00:14:54,740 --> 00:15:00,160
Could it have decisively hurt his pride when I just hung up on him,

206
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,660
saying I don't want to talk?

207
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:07,040
♫ Put in it, dazzling ♫

208
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,320
That's possible since he has a strong pride.

209
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,420
♫ See you and me ♫

210
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:17,090
You must've been thinking about breaking up with me, too.

211
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:20,460
In the end, the issue is about who will be the bad guy.

212
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:23,830
I'll just take that role.

213
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:27,910
♫ We at that time ♫

214
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:32,530
Why did he escalate the situation that much just for getting mad at him?

215
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:34,810
Is this really the end?

216
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:37,110
So meaninglessly?

217
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:47,380
We got back after breaking up so many times.

218
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:50,340
Some breakups were part of a fight...

219
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:54,590
and some others were complete ends.

220
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,790
Today's thing... Is it part of a fight...

221
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:04,300
or... is this really the end?

222
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:11,900
♫ I will send you, in the last hours ♫

223
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:17,850
♫ I'll say hello, then ♫

224
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:20,330
Hey, I'm going to give up on this guy.

225
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:24,570
♫ Goodbye ♫

226
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:40,620
Well, we had a small quarrel, but... we made up quickly.

227
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,460
What the heck?

228
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,980
I thought something had happened when I saw your text.

229
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:48,510
Well... Did you sleep early last night?

230
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:49,470
Yes.

231
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:51,320
Were you with Goo?

232
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,220
N-No.

233
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:59,270
Why was Goo so unhappy last night? Did something happen?

234
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:01,090
Well...

235
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:05,750
He said something happened.

236
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:11,740
He said he was already upset and rammed you and CEO Seo for annoying him.

237
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:16,010
You know how it is. He goes off the rails sometimes when he's upset.

238
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:18,020
Don't worry about it.

239
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:22,290
Objective speaking, he's the weirdest one in our office.

240
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:24,180
Isn't he?

241
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:27,550
But you're even weirder for liking that weird guy.

242
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:29,220
Do you agree?

243
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:33,580
Oh, my client's here. See you later.

244
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:09,750
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

245
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,360
Hey, hurry up and call the insurance.

246
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,250
Be quiet and stay put.

247
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:15,390
By chance, are you going to call your insurance?

248
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:18,290
Of course. Wouldn't I?

249
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:20,650
Oh, well...

250
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:27,740
A buddy I know runs a great auto repair shop.

251
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:30,530
Could you allow me to get it fixed there?

252
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:33,800
Hey. Are you talking about Min Seong?

253
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,930
Oh, be quiet. Please just stay put!

254
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:40,260
Hey! You still keep in touch with that guy?

255
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:43,590
I clearly said it's over for us if you contact him one more time, didn't I?

256
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:45,980
- I need go—
- Just shut up!

257
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:49,680
Now is not the time for this!

258
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,360
What?

259
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:56,760
Hey, forget it. Let's just get a divorce.

260
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,320
What the hell do you think of me?

261
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:02,110
Get a divorce. Fuck this!

262
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:08,310
Hey, let's get a divorce. Sure! Get a divorce!

263
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:29,370
I-I'm sorry.

264
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,460
So, you got a case in the middle of that?

265
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:38,500
Yes. I gave him my card for the insurance.

266
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:42,420
Since it says divorce lawyer, he was asking me this and that.

267
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:45,100
So I just told him to come to the office.

268
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,050
Whoa, that's really absurd.

269
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:49,480
Having to do a divorce consulting for the other party...

270
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,720
But do you know what's really absurd?

271
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,650
He said... this is their third divorce.

272
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:59,920
At what age did you get married?

273
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,510
You seem really young.

274
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,820
- When I was 21.
- I see.

275
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,500
Your wife is the same age?

276
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,710
Yes.

277
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:11,030
We met at work.

278
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:18,780
Well, then, when was your first divorce?

279
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:22,440
When I was 22 years old.

280
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:26,700
That means you got divorced after a year of getting married.

281
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,800
Why?

282
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,300
Well, she cheated on me while I was in the army.

283
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:37,690
I came close to almost killing her, then.

284
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:49,420
Then how did you...get back together with her?

285
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:52,200
It just happened that way.

286
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,200
Since I was divorced...

287
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,390
it wasn't easy to find someone else.

288
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:59,480
And how do I put this?

289
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:02,740
When you're apart, you don't really get into fights.

290
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:06,640
You only remember the good stuff...

291
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:10,520
and it feels like there's no one as good as her.

292
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,990
That's what happened.

293
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:17,470
I'm also most comfortable with her.

294
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:20,850
That's actually the biggest reason.

295
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:22,730
That's true.

296
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,100
I understand.

297
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,690
All right, then...

298
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:35,240
When did the... second divorce happen?

299
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,910
That was...

300
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:42,280
Well, let me see... When was it? Well...

301
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:45,810
Oh, that's when I was 25 years old.

302
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:52,300
How long did it last the second time until you got divorced?

303
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,960
We lived together for quite a while at that time.

304
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,140
A little more than two years.

305
00:21:57,140 --> 00:22:02,200
I see. What happened this time, then?

306
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:06,620
Well, we got into a fight because she found out I lied.

307
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:09,220
What kind of a lie?

308
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:14,740
I went somewhere I shouldn't go to...

309
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:20,300
with a close buddy of mine and got caught.

310
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:25,370
Somewhere you shouldn't go?

311
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:29,410
His wife went to a gynecologist for a checkup...

312
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:30,760
and they found bacteria.

313
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,720
Whoa...

314
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,900
How could he?

315
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:37,470
Anyhow, he barely got his wife's forgiveness by begging

316
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:40,550
and blaming his close buddy for convincing him to go.

317
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:44,790
But under the condition of cutting ties with that buddy.

318
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:48,450
I see. But he got caught because of the car accident, huh?

319
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:51,370
Well, anyhow, you can't change what happened in the past.

320
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,800
So is the husband saying he doesn't want to divorce?

321
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,590
- Does he want you to stop it?
- No.

322
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:58,100
The husband also wants a divorce.

323
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:01,380
They fought too often and saw each other's lows.

324
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:05,020
They've lost all affection for each other.

325
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:09,100
Wait! He can just file one by agreement. Why would he come to us?

326
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:11,120
Because they can't agree on custody.

327
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,640
What?

328
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,760
Wait! They have a kid, too?

329
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:20,260
They married when they were young because they got pregnant.

330
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:21,910
Whoa, they're all over the place.

331
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:24,860
So it's a child custody case, right? Are there any other issues?

332
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:29,160
No, there isn't. They just need to agree on custody.

333
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,180
But I don't think it'll be easy.

334
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:34,760
Do they both want custody?

335
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:37,360
Who took the child in their last divorce?

336
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,770
The mother did.

337
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:41,350
However, she doesn't want to this time.

338
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:42,940
Then the father could take the child.

339
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:46,500
The father doesn't want to raise the child, either.

340
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:52,670
So, it's not that they're trying to take the child.

341
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:56,250
They can't come to an agreement because they're tossing the child on the other.

342
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:59,880
That's so irresponsible, getting pregnant before marrying.

343
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,720
What did the child do wrong?

344
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:04,510
Gosh, that poor thing.

345
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:10,050
I don't think it's a matter of getting pregnant before marrying.

346
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:13,620
Shouldn't we end it by saying they're irresponsible parents?

347
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:18,730
You're embarrassing a similar baby-out-of-wedlock couple here.

348
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:20,980
Oh, my. My goodness, I'm sorry.

349
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,820
Oh, my goodness. I ran my mouth without thinking.

350
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:25,700
Gosh, it's okay. I'm completely fine.

351
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,590
Not at all.

352
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:33,290
Wh-What's this?

353
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:36,380
Wow, you're so good at origami.

354
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:43,970
Why would she blame having baby-out-of-wedlock?

355
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:45,150
Isn't she so ridiculous?

356
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:48,550
It was just a slip of the tongue. It wasn't intentional.

357
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:51,780
But Kwon Si Wook is also ridiculous.

358
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:55,090
What does he mean it's okay? Didn't he see my face?

359
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:57,680
It's all good as long as you live happily ever after.

360
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:00,630
Why be so sensitive about everything?

361
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:03,400
Feel better. Okay?

362
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:08,940
Goodness, let's just go get some food.

363

It'd be better to eat just by ourselves today, right?

364
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:19,270
There could be a round two if we eat together.

365
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:20,770
Gosh, it's fine.

366
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:23,460
That would really make me a sensitive person.

367

- Okay, I'm coming!

You said you wanted to eat meat. I ordered four different kinds of fried chicken.

Whatever.

380
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:04,630
I heard that judge is such a peculiar one.

381
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:07,870
Seriously! He's just like the homeroom teacher back in high school.

Should I try talking to him in the afternoon?

Otherwise, you just need to do it.

Huh?

395

We... wrapped things up.

We couldn't agree about being DINK.

398
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:53,140
So we agreed to end things here.

It's fine. You did well.

Yes. It was the right decision.

I know. I said you did well.

405
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:25,390
Honestly, I was so worried you might give up on having kids

406
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:28,580
because of Goo Eun Beom and do as he says.

407

That's not right. You have your own idea of a family, too.

You did?

411
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:47,890
Well, it was more or less a mutual agreement.

412
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:49,790
He did bring it up, but...

413
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:52,310
I also thought it was for the better.

414

So they can't transfer ownership on their own.

It's an assumed name?

434
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:09,070
This is how you do this. Since there's an estimated power of registration,

435
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:10,630
you can first prove it's in an assumed name...

00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:20,330
I think Sunny is easier to call.

489
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:23,460
Kwon Sun... Kwon Sunny... Yes.

490
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:25,070
Kwon Sunny is easier, right?

491
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:26,610
Hey.

492
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:31,800
Who said you can use Kwon?

493
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,970
If you raise the child,

494
00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:44,550
Ga Ram will give you 700,000 per month as child support.

495
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:47,790
Of course, he'll also diligently do visitation twice per month.

496
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:49,880
Never mind that.

497
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,670
I'm not raising the child.

498
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:53,270
Tell him to raise the child.

499
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:56,920
If Ga Ram has to raise the child...

500
00:34:56,920 --> 00:35:00,330
you'll have to pay child support, Mi Hyang.

501
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:01,740
You know that, right?

502
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:03,540
Yes.

503
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:08,040
However, I'm highly likely to make less money than him.

504
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:11,440
So I won't have to pay much for child support.

505
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,410
Well, according to your income.

506
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:18,680
Even if he sues me, I don't have a penny right now.

507
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:21,030
So I heard he's more likely to get custody.

508
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:22,920
Am I right?

509
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:27,040
If he's ordered to raise the child through a suit,

510
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,490
Ga Ram said he doesn't have the confidence to raise the child.

511
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:32,240
What the heck does he want to do, then?

512
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,650
If he's ordered to raise the child,

513
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:39,710
Ga Ram said... he might end up sending the child to an orphanage.

514
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:42,430
Will you be okay with that?

515
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:46,840
It's not like the child was raised in an orphanage.

516
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:51,350
It'll be very hard to get used to an unfamiliar environment suddenly.

517
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:55,350
Are you really okay with the child...

518
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:57,610
getting sent to an orphanage?

519
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:05,770
That crazy bastard's the one who's doing that!

520
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:10,650
So...

521
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,250
it can't be helped.

522
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:16,770
I'm not saying this because I'm Ga Ram's attorney.

523
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:22,000
Since the child currently has a better emotional rapport with the mother...

524
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,300
wouldn't it be better for you to raise the child, Mi Hyang?

525
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:28,880
While getting child support.

526
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:31,650
Well...

527
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:36,610
By the way, Attorney Oh...

528
00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:39,560
can I ask you one thing, then?

529
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:45,340
He has a woman, doesn't he?

530
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:50,110
He's having an affair, isn't he?

531
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:54,700
I-I'm not sure.

532
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:57,030
That's why he's trying so hard to get a divorce and

533
00:36:57,030 --> 00:37:00,160
doing everything not to raise his own child.

534
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:09,370
He has a woman, right?

535
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:17,220
Mi Hyang... do you really...

536
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:21,270
intend to get a divorce, by any chance?

537
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:24,410
Did you do it in the spur of the moment?

538
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:28,160
You don't really want to get a divorce, do you?

539
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,800
Yes, Ga Ram.

540
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,760
Are you free to talk for a minute?

541
00:37:58,490 --> 00:38:01,960
Oh, I just had...

542
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:06,750
one thing I wanted to confirm.

543
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:09,620
Ga Ram...

544
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:14,160
are you dead set on getting a divorce right now?

545
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:21,760
I'm asking because I feel sorry for the child.

546
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:25,210
Is divorce really the only answer?

547
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:28,640
Don't ever tell him...

548
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:32,530
that I feel that way.

549
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:36,360
If the two of you have room for reconciliation...

550
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:40,100
wouldn't it be best for you to make up?

551
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:43,670
- Please think about it one more—
- It's not like this is just a fight.

552
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:46,200
She's saying she wants a divorce, so why would we make up?

553
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:50,290
I mean... since you have a child—
- Please just proceed on to the trial.

554
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:53,810
You can stop caring about the child. He's not even yours.

555
00:38:55,730 --> 00:38:57,310
Okay.

556
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:01,090
Okay, I got it. Sure.

557
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:03,650
Take care.

558
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:09,440
Gosh, why does she like a man like him?

559
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:14,630
Gosh, I just can't understand.

560
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:24,650
Excuse me, Attorney Oh.

561
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:27,000
Was that lady earlier...

562
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,650
the wife of the man getting his third divorce?

563
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:32,930
Yes. But why?

564
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:35,010
W-Well, it's nothing.

565
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:38,930
How old is she? She seemed to be pretty young.

566
00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:40,180
He said she's his ideal type.

567
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:43,070
When he saw her on the first floor, he thought about getting her number.

568
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:46,800
N-No, no! When did I ever say I was thinking of getting her number?

569
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,040
What's wrong with you?

570
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:51,510
That's really not it, okay?

571
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:53,380
She got divorced three times...

572
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:55,410
I'm not crazy!

573
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:07,630
Mr. Seong, that was a mistake just now, wasn't it?

574
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:10,870
I think Attorney Oh is really mad.

575
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:12,980
Why? What did I do?

576
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:14,650
How can you say such a biased statement

577
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:17,460
about divorce to a divorce lawyer who got a divorce?

578
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:20,190
I was just saying—

579
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:22,180
I can understand getting divorced once.

580
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:25,530
- But three times?
- Huh? What about you?

581
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:28,350
You got rejected 12 times in a row on blind dates.

582
00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:30,320
- What—
- Gosh!

583
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,320
Wait, that's—

584
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:37,930
Help me with this before you go!

585
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,430
[To Kim Ga Ram]
We'll proceed to the trial.

586
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:53,900
But Mi Hyang...

587
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:58,180
one of the workers in our office said you're his ideal type...

588
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:00,660
and that he fell for you at first sight.

589
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:03,910
Do you want to grab dinner with him after the trial?

590
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:06,450
He's a really fine young man—

591
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:13,650
Fine single man.

592
00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:23,970
[Client Kim Ga Ram]

593
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:31,480
[Client Kim Ga Ram]

594
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:42,130
- Yes, hello—
- Attorney Oh, what's this text?

595
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:47,490
Yes, Ga Ram. Oh... my goodness.

596
00:41:47,490 --> 00:41:50,240
That was sent to you?

597
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,150
Aigoo, silly me.

598
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:54,320
What the heck is this shit?

599
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:58,540
I mean, you'll be strangers after the trial. Why get so mad?

600
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:02,300
Whether we become strangers or not, does this situation make sense logically?

601
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:05,860
Also, the divorce suit isn't even over yet—

602
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:07,850
Well, okay.

603
00:42:07,850 --> 00:42:11,100
If you don't like it that much, we'll have to call it off.

604
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:12,680
Or go on with it secretly.

605
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,070
Have you gone mad, seriously?

606
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:18,070
Okay, okay. It's a joke.

607
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:21,470
Don't get too furious and hang up now. Okay.

608
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:24,510
Okay, take care. Yes.

609
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:29,770
Hey, who the heck was that yelling at you?

610
00:42:29,770 --> 00:42:33,560
- And why would you smile at that?
- There's a reason.

611
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:37,780
A cute client who's in first-dimensional love.

612
00:42:38,770 --> 00:42:41,720
What's the matter? Do you want to go get dinner already?

613
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,730
No.

614
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:51,870
I think I'll have to call off this marriage.

615
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:55,490
Whoa, I'm really sick of this.

616
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:56,940
What is it now?

617
00:42:56,940 --> 00:43:01,780
She keeps making threats, saying she'll call off the marriage or not give birth.

618
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:03,920
What do I do about this?

619
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,580
I'm about to lose it and go nuts.

620
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:07,540
Hey, just let her do it her way.

621
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:10,200
What's a last name when you're giving up your career?

622
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:13,230
- What's in a last name?
- Don't you know I'm the fifth-generation only son?

623
00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:14,880
This is a great last name I've got.

624
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:18,190
Do you know how much effort my dad put into giving birth to me?

625
00:43:18,190 --> 00:43:21,430
You don't know anything to be judging a noble last name.

626
00:43:21,430 --> 00:43:23,890
I think Senior Kang is good at making choices.

627
00:43:23,890 --> 00:43:25,620
CEO Seo, this is really too much, isn't it?

628
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:27,340
What will they say if I tell my family about this?

629
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:31,560
Won't I get disowned? My dad will faint from the shock and—

630
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:35,000
Head of Family Act was repealed a long time ago.

631
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,220
Why worry about getting disowned?

632
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:40,300
If you keep saying such ignorant things as a divorce lawyer...

633
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:44,700
you'll be disowned by the Divorce Lawyer Association.

634
00:43:47,310 --> 00:43:49,680
Gosh, I haven't had gukbap in forever.

635
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:53,390
CEO Seo, you don't understand what my family is like. My fam—

636
00:43:58,210 --> 00:43:59,650
Let's go somewhere else.

637
00:43:59,650 --> 00:44:02,040
They already made themselves at home.

638
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:06,030
S-She... She's t-trying to drink alcohol—

639
00:44:06,030 --> 00:44:07,780
Has she gone mad? See what I mean?

640
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:10,510
She's completely reckless these days!

641
00:44:12,790 --> 00:44:16,940
Goodness. What bad timing.

642
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:19,690
Noona, have you gone mad?

643
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:21,650
Are you trying to drink alcohol?

644
00:44:21,650 --> 00:44:23,900
- You really are crazy.
- Hey, this place has non-alcohol—

645
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:26,100
Hey, why do you care?

646
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:28,610
You eat everything you want and do as you please.

647
00:44:28,610 --> 00:44:30,120
Okay, I won't drink, either. Let's go.

648
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:32,090
[Client Kim Ga Ram]
Let go. I don't want to.

649
00:44:32,090 --> 00:44:34,040
Please, let's go. Let's talk on the way.

650
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:35,970
Stop grabbing me!

651
00:44:35,970 --> 00:44:37,790
Hey, Si Wook...

652
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:41,880
You can answer your phone.

653
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:45,670
Even if it says non-alcohol and all, you need to look into it carefully.

654
00:44:45,670 --> 00:44:47,280
Gosh, seriously...

655
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,090
- Yes, Ga Ram.
- Let's go. Come on. Let go.

656
00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:51,470
- Sorry?
- Don't do this.

657
00:44:51,470 --> 00:44:53,160
You fought with Mi Hyang?

658
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:56,150
I said stop forcing me with your strength!

659
00:45:00,350 --> 00:45:03,930
Oh my god! Mommy!

660
00:45:12,310 --> 00:45:14,600
Si Wook!

661
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:24,510
Wait, Ga Ram... what happened—

662
00:45:31,090 --> 00:45:34,190
This is all your fault, Attorney Oh.

663
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:36,570
It's because you told me...

664
00:45:36,570 --> 00:45:41,030
you're going to introduce her to someone.

665
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:43,190
I only went to...

666
00:45:44,170 --> 00:45:48,610
warn her I won't let her be if she meets someone else.

667
00:45:48,610 --> 00:45:52,000
If only she had just answered me...

668
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:58,350
Seriously...

669
00:46:28,970 --> 00:46:33,270
I'm sorry. It's not even your fault.

670
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:40,170
We have such an ill fate, seriously.

671
00:46:42,510 --> 00:46:45,400
We should've broken up a long time ago.

672
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:48,610
Why did I keep getting back together with her?

673
00:47:07,390 --> 00:47:10,170
We have such an ill fate, seriously.

674
00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:13,190
We should've broken up a long time ago.

675
00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:16,260
Why did I keep getting back together with her?

676
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:22,210
- I'm sorry.
- What are you sorry for?

677
00:47:22,210 --> 00:47:24,640
I'm just sorry for everything!

678
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:28,820
You're really... completely ignorant to my feelings.

679
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:31,390
Forget it! Let's stop it.

680
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:34,710
Stop what? I'm saying I'm sorry and apologizing!

681
00:47:34,710 --> 00:47:36,630
I said forget it!

682
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:42,470
Let's... get a divorce.

683
00:47:42,470 --> 00:47:45,350
What are you saying?

684
00:47:49,250 --> 00:47:52,820
I'm seeing someone else. I'm sorry.

685
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:57,420
Let's just end things here.

686
00:47:57,420 --> 00:47:59,850
Let's wrap it up.

687
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:17,380
Hello?

688
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:19,780
Oh. Where are you?

689
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:22,600
I'm on my way after meeting Ga Ram.

690
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:25,550
Oh, that's good. You can talk, right?

691
00:48:25,550 --> 00:48:28,320
I called to let you know since you might be curious.

692
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:30,390
They said Si Wook's fine.

693
00:48:30,390 --> 00:48:32,830
His neck ligament is a little stretched, but that's about—

694
00:48:32,830 --> 00:48:34,610
I'm glad.

695
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:37,790
I'm really glad.

696
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:42,760
Are you okay? You don't sound too good.

697
00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:50,540
Hello?

698
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:54,340
Hello?

699
00:48:56,470 --> 00:48:58,290
Eun Beom...

700
00:49:01,210 --> 00:49:03,770
Don't call me anymore.

701
00:49:05,230 --> 00:49:10,330
Also... stop treating me well.

702
00:49:10,330 --> 00:49:13,740
Don't go along with it when I play the baby.

703
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:18,470
I hope you'll also... stop worrying about me now.

704
00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:21,990
Whenever you do that...

705
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:24,840
I waver.

706
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:31,940
I'm really going to...

707
00:49:31,940 --> 00:49:34,960
try to get over you now.

708
00:49:38,150 --> 00:49:42,910
I think people who keep breaking up and making up...

709
00:49:42,910 --> 00:49:46,110
are just not meant to be.

710
00:49:46,830 --> 00:49:52,040
I... thought we'll be able to start anew again,

711
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:57,440
even if we keep breaking up and making up.

712
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:00,460
But I don't think that's true.

713
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:03,160
I thought wrong. Don't you think?

714
00:50:04,180 --> 00:50:05,810
In this world...

715
00:50:05,810 --> 00:50:09,750
there are couples who are just fundamentally not meant to be. Right?

716
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:15,770
Relationships that have... obvious endings.

717
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:23,560
Sorry for calling you all this time.

718
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:25,760
Sorry for making you uncomfortable.

719
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:27,490
And...

720
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:32,300
thank you.

721
00:50:39,810 --> 00:50:41,320
For what?

722
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:45,430
Everything.

723
00:50:52,910 --> 00:50:56,310
Thanks for creating great memories for me.

724
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:02,230
Not all of our memories were great,

725
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:05,160
but...

726
00:51:06,850 --> 00:51:09,400
the moments we spent together...

727
00:51:10,430 --> 00:51:12,450
were happy for me.

728
00:51:19,830 --> 00:51:21,630
Eun Beom,

729
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:25,160
thank you.

730
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:28,720
Let's live happily.

731
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,370
Both of us.

732
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:38,060
♫ I finally had realized ♫

733
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:39,960
I'm going to hang up first.

734
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:42,860
♫ Among my hidden pains ♫

735
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:44,780
Goodbye.

736
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:51,590
♫ Another me was in there ♫

737
00:51:53,030 --> 00:51:57,990
♫ The light from the window ♫

738
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:03,180
♫ My heart that was in darkness ♫

739
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:05,170
Hey, get on.

740
00:52:05,170 --> 00:52:06,790
Gosh. Seriously.

741
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:10,960
♫ Shines a new hope into it ♫

742
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:17,670
♫ Everything is so radiant ♫

743
00:52:19,690 --> 00:52:21,430
Let's see each other.

744
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:24,550
- Right now?
- No. Again.

745
00:52:24,550 --> 00:52:26,760
Really?

746
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:31,710
♫ Becomes a strength for me ♫

747
00:52:31,710 --> 00:52:35,710
♫ All of the happy memories ♫

748
00:52:35,710 --> 00:52:36,990
Feels like we're cutting class.

749
00:52:36,990 --> 00:52:40,330
♫ My way ♫

750
00:52:40,330 --> 00:52:42,610
I think I can eat tteokbokki every day if I have to.

751
00:52:42,610 --> 00:52:44,730
I guess I'll have to make it every day, then.

752
00:52:44,730 --> 00:52:46,330
Come on.

753
00:52:49,870 --> 00:52:59,420
♫ My way, I walk on my way ♫

754
00:53:22,540 --> 00:53:24,590
Thank you.

755
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:27,910
We should talk first.

756
00:53:27,910 --> 00:53:30,200
Talk about what?

757
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:32,440
- We need to talk.
- Let's hurry up.

758
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:35,290
I'm sleepy, exhausted, and just want to go to sleep.

759
00:53:35,290 --> 00:53:37,190
Gosh.

760
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:42,470
Let's go.

761
00:53:42,470 --> 00:53:44,580
Si Wook,

762
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:47,650
- let's just—
- No.

763
00:53:47,650 --> 00:53:49,070
No.

764
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:51,620
Okay? Don't.

765
00:53:51,620 --> 00:53:53,350
Being stubborn won't solve anything.

766
00:53:53,350 --> 00:53:55,630
No, no.

767
00:53:55,630 --> 00:53:58,310
I'm not being stubborn. I'll do better.

768
00:53:58,310 --> 00:54:01,510
I'll be a good man. That'll do.

769
00:54:02,580 --> 00:54:04,820
It's difficult for you, too.

770
00:54:06,690 --> 00:54:08,880
- Let's just—
- Please.

771
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:13,050
I'm doing this again. Sorry.

772
00:54:18,290 --> 00:54:20,670
You know it, too.

773
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:23,980
Noona...

774
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:25,790
What are you—

775
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:29,560
As I rolled down those stairs earlier,

776
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:32,060
do you know what I thought during that split second?

777
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:34,600
I felt hopeless, thinking Sunny might become fatherless.

778
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:36,380
I don't care what happens to me, but

779
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:39,510
thinking you becoming a widow and Sunny becoming fatherless...

780
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:40,990
Gosh, I really...

781
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:44,850
"I should've had a billion-won life insurance." That's all I thought about.

782
00:54:44,850 --> 00:54:48,520
"If I don't die, I should get a billion-won life insurance."

783
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:51,080
That's the only thought I had.

784
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:53,080
And that...

785
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:55,800
I should never argue with you again.

786
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:57,560
That's what I thought.

787
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:04,520
Let's not fight, okay? We love each other.

788
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:06,790
Let's not be like that.

789
00:55:06,790 --> 00:55:09,390
Sure, Goo Eun Beom was right.

790
00:55:09,390 --> 00:55:11,130
What's in a last name?

791
00:55:11,130 --> 00:55:13,550
What's in a last name when you're...

792
00:55:13,550 --> 00:55:15,560
risking your life to give birth?

793
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:18,000
That's not what I need to protect with my pride.

794
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:20,860
I'll give that up.

795
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:26,060
However, there's one thing you need to know.

796
00:55:26,060 --> 00:55:28,710
I might really get disowned.

797
00:55:28,710 --> 00:55:31,140
I'll try telling my family about it if you're okay with it.

798
00:55:31,140 --> 00:55:33,380
But I'll be shot down 100%, and I'll get disowned.

799
00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:37,390
Also, my family was going to provide support when I got married.

800
00:55:37,390 --> 00:55:38,990
But I'll probably lose that, too.

801
00:55:38,990 --> 00:55:42,130
To be honest, I don't have much in my savings.

802
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:44,090
But if you say you don't care about those things,

803
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:46,500
I'll call my family right now.

804
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:48,180
You're okay, right?

805
00:55:53,130 --> 00:55:55,180
Wait a second.

806
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:59,000
Try telling them and...

807
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,480
if they say no, just forget about it.

808
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:03,380
I'll give it up.

809
00:56:04,370 --> 00:56:06,340
Whether you can...

810
00:56:07,750 --> 00:56:11,290
give it up or not was more important for me.

811
00:56:14,790 --> 00:56:16,700
I love you.

812
00:56:18,630 --> 00:56:20,520
- Me, too.
- No...

813
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:23,110
Tell me you love me.

814
00:56:23,110 --> 00:56:25,200
I love you, too.

815
00:56:35,060 --> 00:56:37,570
Mi Hyang agreed to raise the child in the end.

816
00:56:37,570 --> 00:56:39,680
We submitted the divorce agreement yesterday.

817
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:41,520
I'm glad.

818
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:44,590
They won't get back for the fourth time, will they?

819
00:56:44,590 --> 00:56:47,420
What if they come back next year to get another divorce?

820
00:56:47,420 --> 00:56:50,540
I told Mi Hyang this.

821
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:54,160
It could be because she's never met another person.

822
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:56,810
She married when she was too young and

823
00:56:56,810 --> 00:56:59,290
only dated that person, so...

824
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:03,400
that world might feel like everything to her.

825
00:57:06,610 --> 00:57:09,790
So try to have a serious relationship with someone else

826
00:57:09,790 --> 00:57:12,310
and broaden her perspectives.

827
00:57:12,310 --> 00:57:15,590
Whoa, that's quite a statement.

828
00:57:15,590 --> 00:57:19,500
You should've told her to heed what you say since it's from a divorce lawyer who got divorced.

829
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:22,190
I'm not sure. Even if I lecture her all day,

830
00:57:22,190 --> 00:57:23,450
she needs to feel it firsthand.

831
00:57:23,450 --> 00:57:25,740
That's right. She needs to experience it herself.

832
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:28,150
Doesn't this apply to all of us?

833
00:57:28,150 --> 00:57:31,820
Where's this friendly fire coming from all of a sudden?

834
00:57:31,820 --> 00:57:35,900
Anyhow, could you do wedding parties with your neck in that shape?

835
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:37,500
I can take it off after a few days.

836
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:39,940
Also, wedding preparations are sailing smoothly!

837
00:57:39,940 --> 00:57:42,420
- What's sailing smoothly?
- Explain more in detail. What did you get done?

838
00:57:42,420 --> 00:57:44,490
Are you really making any preparations?

839
00:57:44,490 --> 00:57:46,980
- He's saying no to everything.
- To everything?

840
00:57:54,890 --> 00:57:58,350
- What?
- You're going to quit working here?

841
00:57:58,350 --> 00:57:59,910
Yes.

842
00:57:59,910 --> 00:58:01,450
Where are you going to go?

843
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:04,260
- Anywhere.
- Why, all of a sudden?

844
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:06,550
You don't even have a place to go to.

845
00:58:06,550 --> 00:58:07,980
I have my reason.

846
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:10,250
What is this reason you speak of?

847

848
00:58:15,210 --> 00:58:18,600
Your complete medical examination result is fine.

849
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:22,960
It seems highly likely to be a psychogenic disease.

850
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:26,230
Have you been under a lot of stress lately?

851
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:38,530
Don't ask about it. Please... just understand.

852
00:58:41,650 --> 00:58:43,760
I'll pack everything...

853
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:46,820
by the end of this month. Okay?

854
00:58:48,250 --> 00:58:52,380
By any chance... did Ha Ra dump you?

855
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,320
In the first place, I know you...

856
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:59,690
came in here with an ulterior motive.

857
00:58:59,690 --> 00:59:02,810
You seem to be cutting your tail off and running away because it didn't work out again.

858
00:59:02,810 --> 00:59:04,980
Just like three years ago.

859
00:59:09,830 --> 00:59:12,450
It's because of Ha Ra, isn't it?

♫ It didn't feel like much ♫

861
00:59:36,860 --> 00:59:40,250
Congratulations!

862
00:59:40,250 --> 00:59:41,950
That's right. Your families are meeting today.

863
00:59:41,950 --> 00:59:43,530
Yes. Let's talk tomorrow.

864
00:59:43,530 --> 00:59:46,370
I keep thinking if it's okay for me to go this way.

865
00:59:46,370 --> 00:59:49,620
There's no paradise on the run.

866
00:59:49,620 --> 00:59:53,050
If you can't avoid it, you might as well embrace it.

867
00:59:53,050 --> 00:59:54,940
They said your mother collapsed!

868
00:59:54,940 --> 00:59:57,980
Don't regret it and say everything you want to say to your mother right now.

869
00:59:57,980 --> 01:00:00,800
Why are you so good to me?

870
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:04,480
Why don't you leave the office instead of Eun Beom?
