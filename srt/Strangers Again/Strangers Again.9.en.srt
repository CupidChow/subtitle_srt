Gosh. I mean, what's his story?

171
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:48,880
Well... I feel uncomfortable telling you at the moment.

172
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:51,920
What is it? Tell me.

173
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,660
What? They're getting a divorce because...

174
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,930
the wife got an abortion without telling him?

175
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:06,740
The cousin is saying she can't do that

176
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:09,650
without even talking to him about it.

177
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:15,900
But his shock is understandable since they're a married couple.

178
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:18,960
Family planning is an important issue for a couple.

179
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,610
But it's a little vague.

180
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,190
They're actually DINK.

181
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:24,370
DINK? (Dual Income, No Kids)

182
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:26,910
They agreed not to have children before getting married.

183
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:29,550
So she thought there was no need to tell him

184
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:32,670
and went ahead without consulting him.

185
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:34,720
Well, I guess...

186
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:37,480
that's understandable.

187
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,290
Huh?

188
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:44,380
I wonder if it's because I'm his cousin, but I understand his position better.

189
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:47,250
However, Goo Eun Beom said he could understand the wife's position.

190
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,690
Because he's not his cousin?

191
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:53,770
That's probably not it.

192
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:57,450
Do you know why he's siding with the wife?

193
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:59,940
He said if he happens to get married again,

194
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,800
he wants to live as a DINK.

195
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,690
DINK?

196
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:06,600
- Why?
- That's what I asked him.

197
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,930
Why don't you want to have children?

198
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:12,900
Well, why do you want to have children?

199
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,430
They're cute.

200
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:17,830
My baby. A mini-me between you and me.

201
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:21,880
Isn't it a human's natural instinct to want offspring?

202
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:23,990
Yes, they're cute.

203
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:27,130
But... your body wears out, your money vanishes,

204
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:29,050
my time, and life will be gone...

205
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:30,080
It's hard.

206
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:34,080
Isn't it more of an instinct for a human to want to avoid something tough?

207
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,670
It won't be hard if they take after me.

208
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:39,400
It'll be very tough if they take after me.

209
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:45,840
That's right. Yes, that's right...

210
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,600
Really?

211
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,170
That's what you think, too?

212
00:15:56,730 --> 00:16:00,600
What I mean is... even if I was married,

213
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,300
it still wouldn't be an easy decision.

214
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,010
Having to exchange my ambition

215
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:09,250
and the career for someone I don't even love yet

216
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,710
is honestly unimaginable.

217
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:14,590
I think I'm already in love.

218
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:16,260
If you want to have children,

219
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:19,970
don't you have to rethink dating Goo Eun Beom?

220
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:23,510
Well, for now, we'll talk about it and

221
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:25,100
find the compromising point.

222
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:28,560
Is it up for compromise? It's yes or no.

223
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:33,320
I mean... since it was hard to get back together,

224
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,590
we shouldn't jump to conclusions and

225
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:39,110
make a careful decision. So, he says.

226
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:43,000
He's saying he'll convince you.

227
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,450
Gosh, Oh Ha Ra. You're about to be a DINK just because of a man.

228
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:50,070
No, never!

229
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:51,910
I'm...

230
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:55,200
going to convince him.

231
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,000
- Kang Bi Chwi?
- Yes?

232
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,790
Please go into Exam Room 7.

233
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:03,940
I'll be back. Let's talk later.

234
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:19,650
Do you see that small dot in the lower left corner?

235
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:24,550
Which dot are you talking about?

236
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:26,800
Here, this one.

237
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,630
Do you see it?

238
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:30,240
Yes.

239
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,860
It's nicely implanted into your uterus.

240
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:51,170
Yes, it must've been tough on you, too, Sister-in-law.

241
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:52,910
Yeah.

242
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:58,380
So, are you also thinking about divorcing Jeong Soo?

243
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,120
Oh, I see.

244
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:05,160
Yeah, I understand what you mean.

245
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,240
Yeah.

246
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:12,360
Okay, Sister-in-law. Let's talk again later.

247
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,910
Okay, take care.

248
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:22,100
What did she say? Is it confirmed?

249
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:25,190
Yeah. She said something's been nicely done.

250
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:29,180
Yeah... I guess she means I'm pregnant.

251
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:33,070
Let's go.

252
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:44,500
So what will she do?

253
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,180
Will she divorce him?

254
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:47,850
Sister-in-law said she's not going to do it.

255
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:51,080
She's asking what the problem is when they agreed to live as a DINK.

256
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:55,400
Come on. They're a married couple. Of course, this is problematic.

257
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,280
How can she just do that to a baby they created together?

258
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,460
And he also had a vasectomy done.

259
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:03,030
If she still got pregnant with a baby, then

260
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:04,950
this is miraculous.

261
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:06,250
How could she just—

262
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:09,360
Just? Just?

263
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,040
Just?

264
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:21,630
How would you know if she just erased the baby, or erased the baby in heartbreak?

265
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:24,250
- Did you see her?
- No, what I'm saying—

266
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:29,660
In your eyes, is a wife some baby carrier, not human? Huh?

267
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:33,200
It's something she needed to experience firsthand with her body.

268
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,040
Do you think there was an absence of pain and emotion?

269
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,410
Well—

270
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:39,890
- What's with you? Let me speak.
- (Just shut up.)

271
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:41,530
Just let them be.

272
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:43,370
I was just getting sleepy.

273
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:45,760
CEO Seo, is this entertaining to you?

274
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,240
Yes, it got me wide awake.

275
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,930
Okay, listen. A married couple—

276
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:53,720
Everyone, be quiet. If you don't want to leave.

277
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:56,790
I want to leave.

278
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:59,910
I just need to keep talking if I want to leave?

279
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:01,830
Then...

280
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,640
leave through here.

281
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:13,130
I'll let you leave whether I have to fold, crumple, or break you.

282
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:14,930
Okay?

283
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:32,960
Eat up. You're not having an affair, are you?

284
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:39,450
According to Hyo Jeong, she said she smells a woman's perfume on you or something.

285
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:41,710
That's just nonsense.

286
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:44,230
You really aren't?

287
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:46,880
You know Hyo Jeong also has a lawyer cousin, right?

288
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,770
I think she's getting advice from her as well.

289
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:52,990
If you want to win, you have to be honest with me.

290
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:55,950
- I swear I am not!
- Then...

291
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:58,140
why do you want to divorce her?

292
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:02,110
You two married against the severe opposition of your parents because you were so in love.

293
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:06,910
You should be able to forgive an event like this one, then.

294
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:13,620
I can't help wanting to have a child.

295
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:20,000
Actually, I've been so jealous of my friends who have a child.

296
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,090
I agreed to be a DINK because of Hyo Jeong.

297
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:23,980
I didn't want to be one in the first place.

298
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:26,360
Wait, then...

299
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:32,490
you pretended to be a DINK because you liked Hyo Jeong, although you wanted a child?

300
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:41,700
When she said she had an abortion...

301
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,530
I thought the sky had fallen.

302
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:53,890
I don't think...

303
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:58,480
I'll ever forget this.

304
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:05,970
So you want to get a divorce and go on your separate ways?

305
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:20,450
Let's just give up the lawsuit and convince Hyo Jeong.

306
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:21,660
Why?

307
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:25,540
In my opinion, Hyo Jeong can't even be found responsible because

308
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:28,280
of your agreement before marriage.

309
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,790
Even if you win at court,

310
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:35,020
you'll just waste time when Hyo Jeong appeals.

311
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:43,130
You... said you want a baby.

312
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:47,460
You need to divorce as soon as possible and remarry.

313
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:57,230
I'll get going, then. Cheer up.

314
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:17,160
- What do you mean?
- Getting rejected every day.

315
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,870
- Mr. Seong!
- I was a car.
(Same sound as "Getting rejected every day")

316
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:20,870
Mr. Seong—

317
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:22,910
Is that funny?

318
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:25,130
Yes. Use one of these on a blind date!

319
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:27,540
It's big news! I finally found out!

320
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:28,920
About what?

321
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,890
The ones dating in our office.

322
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:33,170
- We really had one?
- Yes.

323
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:34,920
Who is it?

324
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:54,250
What's this awkward kindness?

325
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:56,140
I just had a coupon.

326
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:59,460
It was about to expire. Don't misunderstand.

327
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:03,130
Thank you.

328
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,980
- By the way, what we talked about during the meeting earlier...
- Sorry?

329
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:09,530
About the DINK couple, you know.

330
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:14,130
You seemed to have a misunderstanding about me because of that.

331
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:17,020
A misunderstanding? What kind?

332
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:21,990
I wasn't... saying I don't feel bad for the lady at all.

333
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:25,280
I meant it would've been less tough for them both

334
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,810
if she had told her husband.

335
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,070
You seemed to have a deep misunderstanding about me.

336
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:35,730
Okay.

337
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:37,350
What?

338
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:40,410
I said I got it. I'll clear up the misunderstanding.

339
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,940
Do you have something else to say?

340
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:49,830
No, I don't. That's it.

341
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,870
Are you feeling sick, by the way?

342
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,260
Just not feeling well.

343
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,260
Hey...

344
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:02,380
It's just a hangover.

345
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:04,500
Drink less, seriously.

346
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:07,200
- Take care.
- Okay.

347
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:11,470
Gosh, he scared me.

348
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:13,750
I almost lost the baby.
(A Korean saying that means she was startled)

349
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:16,770
[Prescription from Bareun OB/GYN]

350
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:22,250
- It's no joke, right?
- Yes.

351
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:23,620
I had a feeling.

352
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:24,570
You had a feeling?

353
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:26,760
Yes, I have a good sense.

354
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:29,340
You should've told us sooner.

355
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:33,300
I had a feeling, but I was waiting to find solid proof.

356
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:36,440
- You're a careful one.
- Then, do you know this?

357
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,140
Okay. Keep this a secret.

358
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,840
Really?

359
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,250
- This is all to be kept a secret.
- Of course.

360
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:48,990
What's wrong?

361
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:56,470
Why are you locking the door?

362
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:09,080
What is it?

363
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:12,850
Like someone who's about to do something naughty...

364
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:14,520
What are you up to?

365
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,690
Making me excited.

366
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:18,110
What are you getting excited about?

367
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:22,700
Also... what naughty thing?

368
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:26,740
Something like...

369
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:29,850
an inappropriate act that you probably...

370
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:32,890
shouldn't do in an office?

371
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:37,520
What could be such an act?

372
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:45,960
Something like this?

373
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:59,590
He has such a thick skull!

374
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:03,480
Come follow me out.

375
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:07,620
Pack your bag when you come!

376
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,370
Okay!

377
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:16,110
Please leave it on my desk.

378
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:30,450
You're here?

379
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:34,870
Gosh, what do we do now?

380
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:39,820
Let's go for a change of pace.

381
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:43,630
It feels like we're cutting class.

382
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:45,810
What about your car?

383
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:47,670
We'll need to get on one.

384
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:57,320
Two people, please.

385
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,330
Do you remember?

386
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:14,900
Should I read a book or something?

387
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:20,330
Where are we going, by the way?

388
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:24,280
Let's just go for now. Wherever it may be.

389
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:26,970
Let's go.

390
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:29,760
Let's go! Let's go!

391
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,480
Let's go!

392
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:36,420
Tteokbokki!

393
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:39,400
Eat everything you want to eat.

394
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,790
You can eat everything here.

395
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,770
A lingerie store?

396
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:48,560
Forget lace. Let's go with the animal print.

397
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:52,600
You can wear these when you come over.

398
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,160
Sure. Pajamas.

399
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:58,480
Will they look nice?

400
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,870
Cow print... or burgundy?

401
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:19,460
What if... I get pregnant?

402
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:21,420
Why would you get pregnant?

403
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:22,970
We'll use contraceptives.

404
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:26,640
Even if you're careful... you can end up pregnant.

405
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,180
Come on.

406
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:31,840
Did you ever see me making a mistake?

407
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:40,190
A mistake?

408
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:46,320
Why would the fruit of our love...

409
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,580
be called a mistake?

410
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:54,670
Why would the fruit of love...

411
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:56,720
be a baby?

412
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,170
The fruit of love is happiness.

413
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:13,350
Are you doing this on purpose by chance?

414
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:15,290
If we come home, set the mood right...

415
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:17,810
and you suddenly do this, then you think

416
00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:21,040
I'd just agree to have a baby and just do it?

417
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,590
Is that what you think?

418
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:24,820
No, I'm not.

419
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:26,180
I'm just worried about it.

420
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:28,880
What do you think of me?

421
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:33,870
Forget it. Forget it, then.

422
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:39,180
Forget it. I'm not doing it, either.

423
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:51,230
We can just have the baby if I get pregnant. Gosh...

424
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,200
Ha Ra,

425
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,040
say it one more time.

426
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,490
Say what?

427
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:12,060
"We can just have the baby if I get pregnant."

428
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,400
Hearing that...

429
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:19,410
makes my head cool down...

430
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:22,440
helping me relax a bit.

431
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:28,200
Don't even kiss me!

432
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:50,700
Think about spending the rest of our lives by ourselves.

433
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,430
Won't you be bored?

434
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:53,910
You think you'd be bored?

435
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:55,800
Just being with me?

436
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,670
One Americano, please.

437
00:31:57,670 --> 00:32:00,550
I'd like a box of vanilla and chocolate.

438
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:03,820
Sometimes, we need the crowded mood.

439
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:07,110
On holidays, like New Year's and Thanksgiving, with everyone.

440
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:10,750
Crowded mood is just a clash of meaningless noises.

441
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:14,930
Holiday Syndrome was created because of those clashes.

442
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:18,740
Our country's birth rate is the lowest among OECD countries.

443
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:21,590
Our country's about to fall because of selfish people like you.

444
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:24,140
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

445
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:28,450
Giving birth to raise the birth rate is...

446
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:31,410
indeed an irresponsible behavior.

447
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:34,310
Not irresponsible. It's infinitely responsible.

448
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:36,510
Is eros the only form of love?

449
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:37,860
Infinite responsibility?

450
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:40,710
Are you talking about infinite meddling,

451
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:43,660
infinite nagging, or infinite sacrifices?

452
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:48,810
Hey! Isn't it a high-level emotion a person should experience once in their life?

453
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:50,750
Unconditional love!

454
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:53,430
Another name for pushovers is parents.

455
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:56,580
Do you consider your mom a pushover?

456
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,420
Oh. Yeah.

457
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:03,970
I wonder when my mom's going to fix her will.

458
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:06,660
Secure a safe distance, please...

459
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:12,990
Just saying.

460
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:15,870
That doesn't make sense.

461
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:21,490
I came in a cab today.

462
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:25,250
So what?

463
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,440
I'm just letting you know.

464
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:43,460
This isn't about being right or wrong.

465
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:45,670
It's just a matter of difference.

466
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:48,130
Of course, it'd be shocking for you, but

467
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:52,320
how can two different people be happy while living together?

468
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,990
It'll be better for you to go your separate ways now.

469
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:03,850
In fact, getting divorced by agreement with alimony isn't a bad deal.

470
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:07,980
If you go to trial, the alimony could be taken out altogether.

471
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:10,160
Think about it carefully.

472
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:15,590
I also don't want to go to trial.

473
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:19,050
Just apologize for saying that.

474
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:21,370
- Then I'll break up with you.
- What...

475
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:23,330
That you wasted your time because of me.

476
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:25,820
That you shouldn't have married me.

477
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,850
Do you really think that way?

478
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:41,660
I'm sorry.

479
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:45,810
I got carried away by my emotions.

480
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:48,620
I don't actually think that way.

481
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:55,840
I was still happy being with you.

482
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:22,550
Mom.

483
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:26,160
Do you want me to have a baby, no matter what?

484
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:31,570
You know, everyone's having a fuss about it.

485
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:34,830
It just makes me rethink.

486
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:36,990
Do I have to have a baby?

487
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:38,290
Aren't you going to marry?

488
00:35:38,290 --> 00:35:40,420
No... Even if you marry—

489
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:42,490
Why would you marry, then?

490
00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:44,810
Just live alone.

491
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:51,100
You want to live with your loved one but you might not want a baby.

492
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:53,790
Are you seeing someone lately?

493
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:55,950
When you were talking to Auntie two days ago,

494
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:58,910
you were with someone, I heard.

495
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:01,280
She said you seem to be dating someone.

496
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,820
Did the guy say he doesn't want a baby?

497
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:05,040
No, not at all.

498
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,230
Oh, my... My goodness, look at you.

499
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:09,370
I guess it's true.

500
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:13,660
Well, it's not... exactly like that...

501
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:16,530
We're just having talks...

502
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:17,840
about living like that...

503
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,380
You can't!

504
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:21,480
Break up with a guy like that!

505
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,320
He's a selfish one.

506
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:27,320
He just doesn't want responsibility. No need to know more.

507
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:30,920
What does he do, by the way?

508
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:33,900
Oh, my. Oh, my goodness. Look at the time...

509
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,390
I should get going. I'm going, Mom.

510
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:37,430
Seriously...

511
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:40,390
- I'm busy. So busy.
- Gosh, you...

512
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:42,100
You do have someone.

513
00:36:58,790 --> 00:37:02,640
Did you tell her you're seeing me again?

514
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,500
I didn't.

515
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:07,840
Are you worried?

516
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:48,970
Did he come back to me?

517
00:39:54,290 --> 00:39:56,370
We're back together again.

518
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:17,240
Huh?

519
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:21,970
Huh?

520
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:43,650
I got backstabbed by Hyo Jeong.

521
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:46,420
She changed the lease from yearly to monthly behind your back

522
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:50,660
and left 2,000 won out of 200 million won security deposit?

523
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:51,750
Yes.

524
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:53,890
She also took all the electronics and furniture that were dowries?

525
00:40:53,890 --> 00:40:56,090
That's what I'm saying.

526
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:00,100
Is she allowed to do this, though?

527
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:06,790
Tell him to consider it alimony.

528
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:10,710
Since he harmed my body and heart... as he pleases.

529
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:11,780
Wait...

530
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:16,220
Didn't we agree last time to break up nicely without trouble?

531
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:21,690
Were you buying time to pocket all the assets?

532
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:23,220
How can you backstab like this?

533
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:25,380
Backstab?

534
00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:29,020
Lee Jeong Soo backstabbed me first!

535
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,850
What? Vasectomy reversal?

536
00:41:31,850 --> 00:41:33,420
Oh, my!

537
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:35,320
What in the world, seriously?

538
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,540
Wait! So the baby wasn't conceived by miracle,

539
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:41,060
but because he undid it without letting the wife know?

540
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:44,210
Gosh, that's really scary.

541
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:46,140
Isn't that almost a crime?

542
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:48,260
Honestly, when I heard this,

543
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:50,530
I knew something was off.

544
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:52,420
It's such a slim chance.

545
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:54,420
She wouldn't be getting pregnant like that.

546
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:58,270
Why didn't you say anything earlier? You kept quiet before.

547
00:41:58,270 --> 00:42:01,870
I don't speak up unless I'm certain about something.

548
00:42:01,870 --> 00:42:06,210
I'm not the type to run my mouth first like you.

549
00:42:06,210 --> 00:42:07,690
Whoa! You're eating squid.

550
00:42:07,690 --> 00:42:11,120
I heard you became a vegetarian, but you keep eating squid.

551
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:14,940
I was a lacto-ovo vegetarian...

552
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:16,700
Lacto... Lacto, what?

553
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,830
Lacto-ovo vegetarian.

554
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:21,510
They still eat eggs and dairy.

555
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:25,220
But I switched to pescetarianism because it was too hard.

556
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:28,320
Anyhow, is it something you can just change like that?

557
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,540
Gosh, why do you care?

558
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:33,740
Did you help with my vegetarianism or something?

559
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:35,610
It's already hard as it is.

560
00:42:35,610 --> 00:42:38,960
I'm just asking. Why are you getting mad?

561
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:45,250
- What's wrong with her?
- What's wrong?

562
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:46,390
She ate this.

563
00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:47,910
What's that? What's wrong with her?

564
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:50,460
Is she feeling sick?

565
00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:55,830
- Gastritis!
- Gastritis?

566
00:42:55,830 --> 00:42:57,330
It's gastritis...

567
00:42:57,330 --> 00:43:00,450
Does severe gastritis cause vomiting?

568
00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:02,130
Eat up, please.

569
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:04,850
Excuse me. I'm going to the restroom.

570
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:09,800
Are you okay?

571
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:14,400
Yes.

572
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:17,690
Your face is looking pale.

573
00:43:17,690 --> 00:43:19,170
I heard you have gastritis.

574
00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:21,740
Was that medicine from last time for gastritis and not hangovers?

575
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:23,980
It's not like that. Don't mind me.

576
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:26,570
I can't even worry about you?

577
00:43:32,570 --> 00:43:34,890
Why would you worry about me?

578
00:43:34,890 --> 00:43:37,050
Did I ask you to worry about me?

579
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:39,130
You just stay still.

580
00:43:39,130 --> 00:43:42,090
You staying still is helping me.

581
00:43:47,670 --> 00:43:50,300
Treating me like a sworn foe...

582
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:57,930
Is the sister-in-law also appointing a lawyer?

583
00:43:57,930 --> 00:43:59,540
She already did.

584
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:01,800
She has a cousin who's a lawyer.

585
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:07,250
We talked on the phone earlier, and it seems we might go to trial.

586
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:09,130
You'll go to trial if you must.

587
00:44:09,130 --> 00:44:12,260
You can't give the entire 200 million won as alimony.

588
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:13,640
That's true.

589
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:16,720
By the way, which firm does her lawyer work at?

590
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,480
It's Moon and Jin.

591
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:19,860
Attorney Goh Eun.

592
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:23,040
Moon and Jin's Goh Eun?

593
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:27,580
There's a fight waiting to happen.

594
00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:32,810
My name is Oh Ha Ra.

595
00:44:32,810 --> 00:44:34,560
Please take a seat.

596
00:44:35,510 --> 00:44:39,250
You were at Pacific before you were scouted here. Right?

597
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:41,770
One of our employees said he knows you.

598
00:44:41,770 --> 00:44:43,840
- His name is Seong Chan Young—
- I'm not sure.

599
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:46,190
I don't have an interest in anything besides work.

600
00:44:46,190 --> 00:44:48,740
So I don't really remember people.

601
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:51,310
I see.

602
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:53,900
Please suggest your agreement.

603
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:56,670
We're done with ours, but

604
00:44:56,670 --> 00:45:00,390
let's hear what you brought first.

605
00:45:00,390 --> 00:45:04,420
Let's try to come up with a conclusion today since we're both busy.

606
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:05,920
Sure, let's do that.

607
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:09,150
This is our agreement proposal.

608
00:45:27,570 --> 00:45:28,920
Ye Seul, I totally saw you shopping.

609
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:31,030
I'm not!

610
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:44,060
Are you feeling sick, by the way?

611
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:46,410
Just not feeling well.

612
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:47,380
Hey...

613
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:49,840
It's a hangover.

614
00:46:03,570 --> 00:46:06,250
[Bareun OB/GYN]

615
00:46:14,350 --> 00:46:18,080
Unwanted pregnancy is the same as bodily harm.

616
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:23,530
You know that stealthing, secretly removing contraceptives during sex,

617
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:26,760
is starting to be put into the law as sexual assault abroad. Right?

618
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:30,400
- However, in Korea—
- There is no clear law, but

619
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,560
congress is putting in efforts to pass the law and

620
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:35,790
the Supreme Court is also acknowledging its cause.

621
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:39,650
In the case of Hyo Jeong, she suffered so much emotional damage

622
00:46:39,650 --> 00:46:42,810
that it's more than possible to prove PTSD.

623
00:46:42,810 --> 00:46:44,530
Do you want to go on an all-out war

624
00:46:44,530 --> 00:46:46,690
on divorce, civil, and criminal

625
00:46:46,690 --> 00:46:50,570
the triple lawsuit fronts?

626
00:46:50,570 --> 00:46:54,470
Or will you end it with an alimony of 200 million won?

627
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:17,430
Even if you file a separate civil lawsuit...

628
00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:20,690
there will be no profit because the alimony part will overlap.

629
00:47:20,690 --> 00:47:23,320
Even if you file a criminal lawsuit,

630
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:26,490
it isn't easy to get pregnancy itself as bodily harm.

631
00:47:26,490 --> 00:47:28,710
They're a couple in a marriage, and

632
00:47:28,710 --> 00:47:31,940
there was no assault or blackmailing, nor was it unwanted intercourse.

633
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:35,370
What crime are you going to identify it as?

634
00:47:35,370 --> 00:47:38,000
Punishments for unwanted pregnancy caused by

635
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,000
stealthing or sexual assault, of course,

636
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,930
should be legalized for higher severity.

637
00:47:43,930 --> 00:47:47,410
But at the current state, punishing this as bodily harm...

638
00:47:47,410 --> 00:47:50,180
would be too much to ask for when you

639
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:54,320
look at its relevance with other laws and

640
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:56,450
its balance with the rest of the legal system.

641
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:00,760
Whether it's too much or not...

642
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:02,740
let us take it to court, then.

643
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:03,810
Are you done talking?

644
00:48:03,810 --> 00:48:06,350
I'm sure we're not the only ones at a loss if this goes to court.

645
00:48:06,350 --> 00:48:09,210
We can go and find out.

646
00:48:18,790 --> 00:48:20,300
[My son]

647
00:48:23,630 --> 00:48:26,160
You can take it. It's okay.

648
00:48:27,710 --> 00:48:29,990
I apologize. One moment, please.

649
00:48:33,070 --> 00:48:34,760
Yes, Son.

650
00:48:35,670 --> 00:48:37,790
I'm working right now. What is it?

651
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:42,400
What were you doing?

652
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:49,990
Hey...

653
00:48:49,990 --> 00:48:51,830
Did Attorney Kang go somewhere? She's not in her room.

654
00:48:51,830 --> 00:48:54,040
Oh, Attorney Kang took the day off.

655
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:55,620
She said she was not feeling well at all.

656
00:48:55,620 --> 00:48:57,220
Is that so?

657
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:09,490
I apologize. My son got hurt.

658
00:49:09,490 --> 00:49:10,710
Oh my, I'm sorry.

Shouldn't you go to him, then?

660
00:49:13,410 --> 00:49:14,810
It's okay.

661
00:49:14,810 --> 00:49:16,530
Thank you.

662
00:49:17,350 --> 00:49:19,560
Where were we again?

663
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:22,120
Excuse me...

664
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:24,530
I'm just...

665
00:49:24,530 --> 00:49:27,270
I'm just asking you this.

666
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:31,760
Have you ever regretted having a child?

667
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:33,810
I mean...

668
00:49:33,810 --> 00:49:35,210
If you work here,

669
00:49:35,210 --> 00:49:38,560
I'm sure there's a lot of competition and a heavy workload.

670
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:42,630
I was just wondering if it's not too tough for you.

671
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:49,430
Of course, I regretted it.

672
00:49:49,430 --> 00:49:52,750
It's indeed hard for me.

673
00:49:52,750 --> 00:49:56,460
However... no one told me...

674
00:49:56,460 --> 00:50:01,430
I don't have to marry or give birth...

675
00:50:01,430 --> 00:50:03,590
10 years ago.

676
00:50:03,590 --> 00:50:06,660
I thought it was natural to just do those things.

677
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:12,000
Had I known what this is like...

678
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:15,250
in its entirety at first...

679
00:50:15,250 --> 00:50:17,940
I wouldn't have made this mistake.

680
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:21,410
A mistake, you say?

681
00:50:21,410 --> 00:50:23,430
Let's say it was...

682
00:50:23,430 --> 00:50:26,900
the most beautiful mistake in my life.

683
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:29,600
One you'll never make had you known about it.

684
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:36,850
Have you ever suggested...

685
00:50:36,850 --> 00:50:40,860
to Sister-in-law to have a baby, by any chance?

686
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:43,680
Of course not.

687
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:47,330
What I think is my opinion.

688
00:50:47,330 --> 00:50:51,780
Hyo Jeong has the right to live the life she wants.

689
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:54,060
As far as the issue of giving birth...

690
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:58,790
it's not like there's a set answer about what's better.

691
00:51:04,470 --> 00:51:06,050
Shall we get back to work now?

692
00:51:06,050 --> 00:51:09,130
I need to get off work early, so there's not much time.

693
00:51:09,130 --> 00:51:12,710
We don't have much time, and we said what we needed to say.

694
00:51:12,710 --> 00:51:15,980
Shall we conclude things now?

695
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:18,650
Then the conclusion is...

696
00:51:18,650 --> 00:51:21,130
Let's just go to trial.

697
00:51:21,130 --> 00:51:22,790
No matter how I look at it,

698
00:51:22,790 --> 00:51:27,230
I don't think Jeong Soo will be sentenced to pay up 200 million won.

699
00:51:30,470 --> 00:51:32,560
It was a pleasure to meet you.

700
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:35,030
Let us meet at court.

701
00:51:45,350 --> 00:51:47,610
What a nice view.

702
00:52:14,030 --> 00:52:17,540
I have about 30 more minutes.

703
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:19,810
Will 30 minutes be enough?

704
00:52:19,810 --> 00:52:23,210
You and Sister-in-law's stances seemed pretty firm.

705
00:52:23,210 --> 00:52:24,890
Let's redo the negotiation.

706
00:52:24,890 --> 00:52:27,570
It might end faster than you think.

707
00:52:29,340 --> 00:52:30,960
Let's go.

708
00:52:35,430 --> 00:52:40,150
[50 million won, signed Han Go Eun]

709
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,250
How did you bring it down to 50 million won from 200 million won?

710
00:52:45,250 --> 00:52:48,030
That amount was too much in the first place.

711
00:52:49,850 --> 00:52:51,390
Anyhow, thank you, Sis.

712
00:52:51,390 --> 00:52:55,100
Although... 50 million won isn't a small amount, either,

713
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:58,620
but since you say this is the minimum...

714
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:05,300
Hey, that 50 million won is the minimum consequence for

715
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:08,610
trying to satisfy your greed by betraying someone you loved.

716
00:53:08,610 --> 00:53:10,700
Don't even think much of it.

717
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:12,740
Thank goodness it wasn't put into law yet.

718
00:53:12,740 --> 00:53:16,800
If you were found guilty of stealthing, you'd be sued for criminal law violation right away!

719
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:18,000
Do you understand?

720
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,650
Okay, I got it.

721
00:53:20,650 --> 00:53:23,130
I'll get going now.

722
00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:28,690
Lee Jeong Soo.

723
00:53:28,690 --> 00:53:30,170
Yes?

724
00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:36,150
You might... forget about this after time passes,

725
00:53:36,150 --> 00:53:38,460
but Hyo Jeong will never be able to forget.

726
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:43,090
Sincerely apologize to Hyo Jeong.

727
00:53:46,290 --> 00:53:49,710
Okay. I'll make sure to do that.

728
00:53:49,710 --> 00:53:52,210
I'm going to call her and check.

729
00:53:53,670 --> 00:53:55,410
I'll be off.

730
00:54:09,170 --> 00:54:12,700
Those two were really in love with each other.

731
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:16,060
They barely got married against everyone's opposition.

732
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:20,270
I can't believe they fell apart in pieces like this.

733
00:54:20,270 --> 00:54:23,450
Isn't it because they were DINK?

734
00:54:23,450 --> 00:54:24,810
Come on, that can't be.

735
00:54:24,810 --> 00:54:27,100
Do people with children never divorce?

736
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:31,480
That's not it, but how easy is it to divorce without a child?

737
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:34,760
A man and woman are done soon after the love cools down.

738
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:38,280
Look at those two. Gosh, the guy was saying he'll

739
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:41,010
give up having a baby and love her only when he was in love.

740
00:54:41,010 --> 00:54:42,780
After his love cooled down,

741
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:46,880
he changed his heart right away and betrayed her.

742
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:50,010
Using a child as glue for two people not to break up...

743
00:54:50,010 --> 00:54:51,870
that's a terrible thing to do to a child.

744
00:54:51,870 --> 00:54:53,920
Isn't everyone becoming a miserable existence?

745
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:56,360
There are also families who live well.

746
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:57,940
- Not divorcing.
- I see.

747
00:54:57,940 --> 00:55:02,460
Couples who live in hell but endure it for the child?

748
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:05,220
There are many, indeed.

749
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:08,130
- Sorry for coming late.
- Hello.

750
00:55:08,130 --> 00:55:10,300
A person can be late sometimes. I'm not sorry.

751
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:13,840
Whoa... CEOs... a matching outfit?

752
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:16,220
Whoa, how did you know?

753
00:55:16,220 --> 00:55:19,580
You're the keenest after you started working here, Ms. Jeon.

754
00:55:19,580 --> 00:55:23,030
Be careful. I've got a better lead than you think.

755
00:55:23,030 --> 00:55:26,470
Stop being silly, and let's start the meeting.

756
00:55:26,470 --> 00:55:30,250
- Okay.
- Whoa, you're keen.

757
00:55:42,010 --> 00:55:44,420
Yes, I'll count on that.

758
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:57,800
Gosh, you scared me.

759
00:55:57,800 --> 00:55:59,360
Let's have a word.

760
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:02,210
Go ahead.

761
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:05,320
You're pregnant, Noona.

762
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:08,620
The meds you were taking were for morning sickness.

763
00:56:12,430 --> 00:56:14,350
Is it my baby?

764
00:56:17,750 --> 00:56:19,600
What the heck. No.

765
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:22,530
I think it is, considering the time frame.

766
00:56:22,530 --> 00:56:24,680
- I said it isn't.
- Are you saying...

767
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:27,040
you slept with another man at that time?

768
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:30,930
Is that right?

769
00:56:34,590 --> 00:56:35,870
Why do you care?

770
00:56:35,870 --> 00:56:37,410
- Answer me.
- Why should I?

771
00:56:37,410 --> 00:56:40,720
No matter how I think about it, I think it's my baby.

772
00:56:43,510 --> 00:56:46,580
It isn't. I said it isn't. It really isn't.

773
00:56:46,580 --> 00:56:48,580
Did you sleep with another man?

774
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:51,630
Just answer that question.

775
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,410
- Let's just say I did—
- Tell me clearly!

776
00:57:01,410 --> 00:57:03,190
If you say you did, I won't ask anymore.

777
00:57:03,190 --> 00:57:06,950
I won't bother you anymore. Just answer that.

778
00:57:10,450 --> 00:57:12,840
Yes, I slept with another man.

779
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:14,380
That's a lie.

780
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:18,790
If you slept with another man, you wouldn't answer me so willingly like this.

781
00:57:18,790 --> 00:57:22,000
You'd beat me up, go crazy, saying you'll sue me for defamation.

782
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,290
You'd tell me to mind my own business. I'd be half dead already.

783
00:57:25,290 --> 00:57:27,500
You answer me so nicely...

784
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:30,350
because you're lying to me.

785
00:57:30,350 --> 00:57:34,750
I'm right, aren't I? This is why you're so annoyed and on the edge

786
00:57:34,750 --> 00:57:37,560
whenever you saw me lately, isn't it?

787
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:41,620
Hey...

788
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:43,420
It must've been so hard alone.

789
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:46,860
You should've told me sooner.

790
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:11,280
All right. It is your baby. Yes.

791
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:13,390
What are you going to do?

792
00:58:13,390 --> 00:58:15,230
I'll take responsibility.

793
00:58:17,790 --> 00:58:19,580
Take responsibility for what?

794
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:21,580
I'll take responsibility.

795
00:58:24,710 --> 00:58:27,240
- You...
- Let's get married.

796
00:58:37,090 --> 00:58:40,330
You seemed to be in a bad mood all day today.

797
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:45,410
There's Jeong Soo's thing and...

798
00:58:48,210 --> 00:58:52,100
I think I'll need to make up my mind now.

799
00:58:54,940 --> 00:58:56,480
Did you?

800
00:59:00,250 --> 00:59:03,550
Hey, why are you so serious? It's making me nervous.

801
00:59:04,460 --> 00:59:06,270
You're nervous?

802
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:10,500
I'm not confident.

803
00:59:11,580 --> 00:59:13,050
Why?

804
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:18,060
It feels like...

805
00:59:18,060 --> 00:59:21,050
I'm making you do something you shouldn't.

806
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:27,200
Shall we give it some more thought, then?

807
00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:34,560
I'm less sure the more I think about it.

808
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:41,080
Will I be able to... be happy even if I don't have a child?

809
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:47,820
Will we...

810
00:59:49,690 --> 00:59:55,140
be able to be happy... even when we have a child, Ha Ra?

811
01:00:15,370 --> 01:00:17,970
Wait! Who do we have here?

812
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:22,830
Mom...

813
01:00:25,710 --> 01:00:28,450
She was the lady...

814
01:00:29,620 --> 01:00:31,750
you said you're seeing?

815
01:00:57,620 --> 01:00:59,670
♫ It didn't feel like much ♫

816
01:00:59,670 --> 01:01:01,810
How can we get married?

817
01:01:01,810 --> 01:01:02,930
What is this?

818
01:01:02,930 --> 01:01:04,680
Do we have to give up the child?

819
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:07,590
For Mother, she used the means she could use.

820
01:01:07,590 --> 01:01:10,790
Promise me before you go. Say you'll break up with Ha Ra today.

821
01:01:10,790 --> 01:01:11,960
I'm sorry.

822
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:14,760
Unni, you know, Eun Beom and I...

823
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:17,580
Don't you have a final resort that can turn the tables here?

824
01:01:17,580 --> 01:01:19,450
The one who loves more should just go for it.

825
01:01:19,450 --> 01:01:21,050
I'm really sorry, but...

826
01:01:21,050 --> 01:01:23,360
could you quit working here, Si Wook?

827
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:26,570
To be honest, there's one more thing I didn't tell you.

828
01:01:26,570 --> 01:01:30,830
