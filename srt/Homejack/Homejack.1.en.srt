1
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:52,578
<i>The news this morning.</i>

2
00:00:52,653 --> 00:00:56,852
<i>In the recent series of murders...</i>

3
00:00:56,924 --> 00:00:59,484
<i>we have just heard of a new victim.</i>

4
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:05,488
<i>Itsuko Yama, 27, living in Shindo-shi...</i>

5
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:09,264
<i>has been found murdered at her home.</i>

6
00:01:09,303 --> 00:01:13,832
<i>Ms. Yamada hadn't shown up</i>
<i>at her job for three days.</i>

7
00:01:13,874 --> 00:01:17,868
Hey, Shindo-shi,
that's really close to here.

8
00:01:17,945 --> 00:01:19,277
That's right.

9
00:01:19,346 --> 00:01:20,905
<i>...was lying on the floor...</i>

10
00:01:20,981 --> 00:01:23,541
Is it safe?

11
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:29,412
During my business trip
you could stay with my folks.

12
00:01:29,456 --> 00:01:31,425
I'll call Mom.

13
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:33,017
I'll be fine.

14
00:01:33,894 --> 00:01:37,353
But we just moved in here.

15
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:40,993
You don't know any
neighbors who could help.

16
00:01:41,068 --> 00:01:45,938
<i>The murderer is now</i>
<i>nicknamed Jack the Ripper.</i>

17
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,801
It would be an excellent opportunity...

18
00:01:49,843 --> 00:01:52,938
for you to learn from Mom's cooking.

19
00:01:53,013 --> 00:01:55,482
I'll just stay locked indoors.

20
00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:57,848
I bought a good lock online.

21
00:01:57,918 --> 00:02:00,979
It'll be delivered today
so I'll be fine.

22
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:04,786
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

23
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:08,260
Still, even on another occasion...

24
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:10,820
please learn from my mom's cooking.

25
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:13,332
I'm saying that for you.

26
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:18,430
Oh, look at the clock!
Don't be late for work.

27
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,275
Hurry.

28
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:34,819
Have a good day.

29
00:02:34,855 --> 00:02:37,586
Take good care of yourself.

30
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:41,618
Please, think about my request.

31
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:44,291
Sure, I will.

32
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:47,233
Alright then, have a good day.

33
00:03:25,272 --> 00:03:26,535
Yes.

34
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,682
Hey, hey, it's me.

35
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:44,191
It's me.

36
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,284
Mr. Kawamura.

37
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:47,827
I scared you?

38
00:03:47,861 --> 00:03:51,889
Come on, I told you not
to come to my place.

39
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,763
You told me your husband
would go on a trip.

40
00:03:55,836 --> 00:03:59,398
So I thought I'd pay
you a surprise visit.

41
00:03:59,473 --> 00:04:03,706
But you have to work today.

42
00:04:03,777 --> 00:04:05,769
I changed my shift.

43
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:11,383
No.

44
00:04:13,153 --> 00:04:16,590
You like that, right?

45
00:04:24,965 --> 00:04:27,935
Come on, show me your face.

46
00:04:27,968 --> 00:04:31,132
Please don't film me.

47
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:34,140
Don't hide your face.

48
00:04:34,174 --> 00:04:35,802
No.

49
00:04:35,876 --> 00:04:37,868
Show your face, come on.

50
00:04:40,147 --> 00:04:41,479
Please stop.

51
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,353
This will be a good
memento of our love.

52
00:04:53,927 --> 00:04:55,759
No, please.

53
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:00,764
Come on, admit that doing it here...

54
00:05:00,834 --> 00:05:04,862
in your husband's bed,
turns you on.

55
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,870
Stop it.

56
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:14,880
Natsuko, you love sex, right?

57
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:19,976
And since your husband
is no fun in bed...

58
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:22,422
You told some yourself.

59
00:05:26,193 --> 00:05:29,027
Uh? What?

60
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:30,791
Why are you crying?

61
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:32,322
Natsuko.

62
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:40,173
You don't enjoy it with me either?

63
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,903
I didn't say that.

64
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:48,679
I love you, Natsuko!

65
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,758
Yes.

66
00:06:42,936 --> 00:06:48,034
It's a package for Natsuko Ogawa.

67
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,475
- That's me.
- There you are.

68
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:57,347
If you could sign this for me...
Here's a pen.

69
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:58,946
Right here.

70
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:20,062
What's that?

71
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:21,836
It's a lock.

72
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,901
It's not safe lately...

73
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:26,072
I thought I should get a better lock.

74
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:29,378
Wow, I didn't know you
had the skills for that.

75
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:33,443
Hey, you can't be
half naked in the lobby!

76
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,217
It's hard to set up.

77
00:07:36,256 --> 00:07:39,192
It's kind of complex too.
I'll install it for you.

78
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:41,694
But it's well explained.

79
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:43,855
No way, it's a hassle.

80
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:48,368
Anyway, get inside! We don't
want the neighbors to see you.

81
00:07:57,377 --> 00:07:59,278
It won't work...

82
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:03,249
It's not suited for this type of door.

83
00:08:32,412 --> 00:08:36,679
Don't be silly, you can't sleep here.

84
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:48,160
And I'm worried about
that Jack the Ripper.

85
00:08:49,796 --> 00:08:54,029
If anything happened
to you, I couldn't...

86
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,568
Enough now.

87
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:05,642
Alright I'll leave, but only
after you give me a blowjob.

88
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:07,140
OK?

89
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:12,485
OK, but then you'll leave.

90
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,043
Yes.

91
00:09:46,653 --> 00:09:48,315
That feels good.

92
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:27,324
Goodbye.

93
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,794
See you.

94
00:10:46,913 --> 00:10:49,075
Sorry to come so late.

95
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:53,712
I delivered a package today
and I forgot to give you something.

96
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:55,186
Yes.

97
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:07,562
What is it?

98
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:08,757
Don't shout!

99
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:13,804
I have boosted this taser.

100
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,867
You don't wanna taste this.

101
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,811
Help me!

102
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:43,097
You're back.

103
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:54,407
Listen...

104
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,042
If you let me have my way,
I won't kill you.

105
00:11:58,117 --> 00:12:01,281
The reason I killed all the others...

106
00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:03,313
is because they resisted.

107
00:12:10,363 --> 00:12:13,128
I have a good nose.

108
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:17,763
I can smell the hunger
for sex on your skin.

109
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:25,841
You're craving it...

110
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:29,713
although you just had sex
with that man.

111
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:32,251
He didn't satisfy you.

112
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:41,693
I'm sure you'll love it.

113
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:53,138
Even women who hate me
end up loving it.

114
00:12:53,206 --> 00:12:57,337
They love the shape of my dick.

115
00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:00,209
You want to try it?

116
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:21,027
I told you...

117
00:13:25,071 --> 00:13:26,801
You don't like it?

118
00:13:26,873 --> 00:13:30,002
Then how come you're so wet?

119
00:13:30,677 --> 00:13:33,010
You don't want it but
you're loving it anyway.

120
00:13:49,462 --> 00:13:52,159
You came?

121
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:54,826
I'll come inside of you.

122
00:14:29,135 --> 00:14:31,866
Sorry, I forgot my phone.

123
00:14:31,938 --> 00:14:33,930
Have you seen it?

124
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:46,012
Excuse me...

125
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:48,487
Who are you?

126
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:44,711
<i>I'll be back in two days at noon.</i>
<i>I love you.</i>

127
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:50,683
<i>I love you too.</i>
<i>I miss you, darling.</i>

128
00:15:57,623 --> 00:16:00,354
What is that? Hey?

129
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,658
Shut up.

130
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:08,667
Can't you see I'm eating?
Be quiet.

131
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:11,367
Who are you?

132
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,573
I'm asking you.

133
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,577
I could return the question.

134
00:16:18,611 --> 00:16:20,170
Huh?

135
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,282
You're not her husband.

136
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:24,682
So what?

137
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:27,714
What is this lady to you?

138
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:29,016
A love affair?

139
00:16:29,055 --> 00:16:30,580
You're her lover?

140
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:38,163
How about a lover who
can't satisfy his lady?

141
00:16:38,231 --> 00:16:40,826
You're quite useless.

142
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:44,469
What do you want?

143
00:16:44,537 --> 00:16:46,472
What do you know about me?

144
00:16:46,539 --> 00:16:48,474
Aren't you the lover?

145
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:50,601
- Well...
- You're fucking her?

146
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:53,771
I do but... What the...

147
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:57,305
Why do you say she isn't satisfied?

148
00:16:57,383 --> 00:16:59,579
She sure ain't satisfied!

149
00:16:59,619 --> 00:17:05,183
Just a while ago she went
absolutely crazy on my dick.

150
00:17:06,292 --> 00:17:08,761
Eh?

151
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:13,232
You fucked her?
You fucked Natsuko?

152
00:17:13,266 --> 00:17:15,258
None of your business.

153
00:17:15,301 --> 00:17:18,203
- But it is!
- How so?

154
00:17:18,671 --> 00:17:22,369
Well, who are you anyway?

155
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:26,302
You are an intruder yourself!

156
00:17:26,345 --> 00:17:27,870
You and me both.

157
00:17:27,947 --> 00:17:29,973
I'm not like you.

158
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,915
I'm not sure.

159
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:36,217
If you do her, why can't I?

160
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:40,852
In respect to her husband,
we're both scoundrels.

161
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:47,290
No way... Are you Jack the Ripper?

162
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:50,596
Who knows.

163
00:17:53,673 --> 00:17:58,976
Are you going to kill us both?

164
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:03,147
If you do as I say...

165
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:06,579
I won't kill you.

166
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:31,801
Does it hurt?

167
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:36,749
If you don't do as I say, I'll kill you.

168
00:18:38,651 --> 00:18:41,211
Mr. Kawamura, why?

169
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:46,521
He came back because
he forgot his phone.

170
00:18:56,002 --> 00:18:57,732
What do you want?

171
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:59,636
Let me see it.

172
00:18:59,672 --> 00:19:00,935
Eh?

173
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:01,941
See what?

174
00:19:02,008 --> 00:19:03,567
You know what.

175
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:08,172
I want to see you two lovebirds do it.

176
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:10,182
We can't do that.

177
00:19:10,216 --> 00:19:12,082
You're mad.

178
00:19:12,852 --> 00:19:13,979
Stop.

179
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:18,758
I didn't give you a choice guys.

180
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:22,159
Alright! Alright then.

181
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:31,803
The lady always offers
you satisfaction, right?

182
00:19:31,871 --> 00:19:35,967
You pretend you forgot your phone...

183
00:19:36,042 --> 00:19:40,036
and you come back for more.

184
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:43,174
If you can't make her come...

185
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:45,377
I'll kill you.

186
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:00,492
How much longer can you hold back?

187
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,867
Wait! No!

188
00:20:03,903 --> 00:20:05,667
Stop that!

189
00:20:05,738 --> 00:20:08,867
You make these little cries...

190
00:20:08,908 --> 00:20:14,108
and you fake it with your
husband and your lover.

191
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:15,876
In that manner...

192
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:21,580
you've always been
pretending to be satisfied.

193
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:27,220
A fine, hungry woman like you,
stuck with worthless partners.

194
00:20:27,293 --> 00:20:31,287
You've been waiting...

195
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:33,832
I'm going to satisfy you.

196
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:36,869
Stop! Please don't!

197
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:43,031
No! Stop!

198
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:50,445
You know how it is about sex...

199
00:20:50,483 --> 00:20:54,352
If you don't do it with
love and all your heart...

200
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:57,185
you betray your own feelings.

201
00:21:02,795 --> 00:21:03,922
No!

202
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:14,204
Please let me go!

203
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,701
Please let me go.

204
00:21:57,249 --> 00:21:59,241
You know...

205
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:04,656
A women's lips have this
special quality.

206
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:10,723
They may not look particularly
strong...

207
00:22:10,796 --> 00:22:16,167
but once you're inside, it's quite tight.

208
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:23,235
Deep down, it's also very sensitive.

209
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:32,178
Have you heard about
the morning-after pill?

210
00:22:32,251 --> 00:22:34,686
If you take it within 3 days...

211
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,748
it has a 90%+ contraceptive efficiency.

212
00:22:43,462 --> 00:22:50,335
The magic drug that lets you
get back to your old life.

213
00:22:50,402 --> 00:22:55,670
If you're a good girl,
and you listen to me...

214
00:22:55,741 --> 00:22:58,267
you can have it...

215
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:01,803
and resume your married routine.

216
00:23:02,648 --> 00:23:05,709
But if you ever...

217
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:08,777
try to betray me...

218
00:23:08,854 --> 00:23:11,653
if you rebel against me...

219
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:17,925
you two won't get back
to life as usual.

220
00:23:19,832 --> 00:23:22,131
So tell me...

221
00:23:22,201 --> 00:23:24,727
now...

222
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:28,571
which is it gonna be?

223
00:23:28,641 --> 00:23:31,975
We're going to have fun.

224
00:23:43,055 --> 00:23:47,493
<i>But, there's no risk of you</i>
<i>getting an extinct species.</i>

225
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:50,927
<i>What is with that</i>
<i>familiar tone all of a sudden?</i>

226
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:53,290
<i>- I don't have a weapon.</i>
<i>- Right, you don't.</i>

227
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:54,798
<i>No, I don't.</i>

228
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:57,530
<i>Ouch! That hurts!</i>

229
00:23:57,603 --> 00:23:59,799
<i>I hate violence! Ouch!</i>

230
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:06,375
We have to escape somehow.

231
00:24:06,412 --> 00:24:11,043
But if we endure patiently...

232
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:15,179
until my husband returns,
he'll let us go.

233
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:21,091
He may be brutal,
but we'd better obey.

234
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:24,119
Why would we do that?

235
00:24:24,163 --> 00:24:28,931
If he catches us trying to escape,
he'll definitely kill us.

236
00:24:29,001 --> 00:24:32,130
Did you really enjoy sex with him?

237
00:24:33,205 --> 00:24:35,140
How can you be so insensitive?

238
00:24:35,207 --> 00:24:37,574
I was raped twice!

239
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:39,510
And he'll do it again...

240
00:24:39,545 --> 00:24:44,449
But you're enjoying doing it
with that crazy asshole!

241
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:48,377
You're horrible.

242
00:24:52,858 --> 00:24:58,024
You don't come like that with me.

243
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:32,793
<i>This will be a good</i>
<i>memento of our love.</i>

244
00:25:32,831 --> 00:25:35,266
You bet.

245
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,292
<i>No, please.</i>

246
00:27:02,554 --> 00:27:04,523
Slip into this.

247
00:27:05,057 --> 00:27:06,047
No.

248
00:27:08,827 --> 00:27:13,561
You know what happens
to disobedient girls?

249
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:16,550
You'll suck this...

250
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:19,057
as if it was my dick.

251
00:29:40,746 --> 00:29:42,214
Nice.

252
00:29:43,649 --> 00:29:45,641
So nice.

253
00:29:50,756 --> 00:29:52,748
It's so good.

254
00:29:57,029 --> 00:29:59,157
So good.

255
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:02,031
Nice.

256
00:30:08,573 --> 00:30:10,064
Nice.

257
00:30:10,442 --> 00:30:12,570
So nice.

258
00:30:31,563 --> 00:30:33,225
Nice.

259
00:30:46,044 --> 00:30:47,774
It feels good.

260
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:29,281
Asshole!

261
00:31:59,951 --> 00:32:01,351
Please don't!

262
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,882
I'm coming again.

263
00:32:03,955 --> 00:32:06,322
You can come many times.

264
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:10,596
I'm filming all your naughty poses.

265
00:32:15,167 --> 00:32:17,602
No!

266
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:50,428
Your skin is moist all over.

267
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:54,736
Let me come inside you.

268
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,635
Very nice.

269
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:27,605
You're lying there like dead.

270
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:42,145
You're afraid to show it?

271
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:44,986
You don't need to hold back.

272
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:49,654
Release it and you'll feel great.

273
00:34:24,796 --> 00:34:26,059
Wait!

274
00:34:30,969 --> 00:34:32,562
Wait! Wait!

275
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:48,909
Where did you hide it?

276
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,381
Hide what?

277
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:59,147
The pills have disappeared.

278
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:00,453
I didn't...

279
00:36:00,525 --> 00:36:03,085
And that phone was on the floor.

280
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:04,993
I didn't do it.

281
00:36:20,145 --> 00:36:21,773
Over there.

282
00:36:40,432 --> 00:36:43,834
You're really worthless.

283
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:11,087
They have no veggies.

284
00:37:11,129 --> 00:37:15,965
That's the most important food.

285
00:37:16,034 --> 00:37:21,473
The quality of what you eat supports
the productivity of your day.

286
00:37:21,506 --> 00:37:25,876
Your body needs good nutrients
in the morning.

287
00:37:25,944 --> 00:37:30,211
That's where all your energy
comes from.

288
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:33,082
First, eggs and bacon.

289
00:37:33,151 --> 00:37:36,144
Animal fats are good...

290
00:37:37,489 --> 00:37:40,118
when eaten in the morning.

291
00:37:40,158 --> 00:37:42,127
At night they're just added fat.

292
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:48,031
The calories of breakfast
are the energy of the day.

293
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:56,334
Orange juice, that's sugar.

294
00:37:56,374 --> 00:37:59,310
When derived from fruits,
it's called fructose.

295
00:37:59,344 --> 00:38:01,609
It quickly feeds the brain.

296
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:04,239
It's also calories.

297
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:23,101
Toast has this great smell...

298
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:27,799
but please buy a baguette next time.

299
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:34,374
It has to be well balanced...

300
00:38:34,445 --> 00:38:38,143
but eating with pleasure
is important.

301
00:38:42,821 --> 00:38:45,313
Let's eat, guys.

302
00:38:57,769 --> 00:38:59,203
You're not eating?

303
00:38:59,237 --> 00:39:01,229
How can we?

304
00:39:02,574 --> 00:39:04,202
We're tied.

305
00:39:10,148 --> 00:39:15,712
Well, I heard this story...

306
00:39:16,955 --> 00:39:20,756
There was a religious
initiation rite...

307
00:39:20,792 --> 00:39:23,853
and the believers had
their hands tied.

308
00:39:23,928 --> 00:39:27,092
They gave them soup and spoons.

309
00:39:27,165 --> 00:39:31,535
But they could only lick it like dogs.

310
00:39:31,603 --> 00:39:34,129
How did they manage to eat?

311
00:39:34,172 --> 00:39:36,073
Do you know?

312
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:42,178
They took the spoon in their teeth...

313
00:39:42,247 --> 00:39:45,274
and offered soup to the next person..

314
00:39:49,287 --> 00:39:55,625
That's a beautiful parable
to illustrate kindness to strangers.

315
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:59,961
But it's simpler to use one's hands.

316
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:33,156
The same goes for sex.

317
00:40:33,231 --> 00:40:38,295
It has to be offered to one's partner.

318
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:42,329
This is our duty.

319
00:40:45,209 --> 00:40:49,772
You see, she was so ecstatic
last night...

320
00:40:49,814 --> 00:40:53,251
she even pissed herself a little.

321
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:05,127
<i>And now the news.</i>

322
00:41:05,196 --> 00:41:09,531
<i>There has been a new</i>
<i>murder in the recent series.</i>

323
00:41:09,567 --> 00:41:14,562
<i>Last night, in Hatashi,</i>
<i>the dead body of an employee</i>

324
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:19,009
<i>was discovered in his delivery truck.</i>

325
00:41:19,077 --> 00:41:22,275
<i>He was already dead.</i>

326
00:41:23,581 --> 00:41:27,348
<i>The man had bled out</i>
<i>from stab wounds.</i>

327
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:31,081
No way, is that...

328
00:41:31,122 --> 00:41:35,059
one of your murders?

329
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:44,226
Alright...

330
00:41:44,268 --> 00:41:48,069
How about a little digestive fuck?

331
00:42:07,258 --> 00:42:11,889
You stole my pills yesterday.

332
00:42:11,929 --> 00:42:14,990
Did you ask him to do it?

333
00:42:15,633 --> 00:42:17,727
She didn't.

334
00:42:18,503 --> 00:42:20,836
I don't know anything about it.

335
00:42:20,872 --> 00:42:23,432
So it was your decision.

336
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:25,500
Not at all...

337
00:42:25,576 --> 00:42:29,911
Right, I remember now!
She asked me to take them.

338
00:42:29,947 --> 00:42:31,779
What are you saying?

339
00:42:31,849 --> 00:42:34,717
I was reluctant...

340
00:42:34,786 --> 00:42:37,051
Mr. Kawamura, why are you...

341
00:42:37,121 --> 00:42:38,282
Is that right?

342
00:42:38,356 --> 00:42:40,484
He's lying!

343
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:42,220
It doesn't matter.

344
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:47,157
Anyway, you guys tried
to abuse my trust.

345
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:50,292
I'll teach you a lesson.

346
00:43:14,025 --> 00:43:15,357
Don't!

347
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:21,358
Please, don't!

348
00:43:21,566 --> 00:43:23,000
No!

349
00:43:25,636 --> 00:43:26,831
Don't!

350
00:43:39,383 --> 00:43:41,181
I hope that this punishment...

351
00:43:41,252 --> 00:43:43,915
will teach you to
not steal from me.

352
00:43:43,988 --> 00:43:45,980
I didn't do it!

353
00:43:46,023 --> 00:43:51,155
You too deserve punishment.

354
00:43:51,329 --> 00:43:52,957
Don't!

355
00:44:11,015 --> 00:44:13,484
No! No!

356
00:44:19,123 --> 00:44:21,888
It's a mixture of pain and pleasure.

357
00:44:21,959 --> 00:44:24,724
Like salt on a watermelon.

358
00:44:44,649 --> 00:44:48,347
Women often want to fuck
when they get beaten up.

359
00:44:48,386 --> 00:44:50,617
It's a solid defensive mechanism.

360
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:52,247
It's nice.

361
00:44:52,323 --> 00:44:55,657
It's even better than yesterday, right?

362
00:45:26,624 --> 00:45:28,058
No, don't!

363
00:46:06,964 --> 00:46:08,489
Yes.

364
00:46:08,566 --> 00:46:10,558
It's the police.

365
00:46:15,273 --> 00:46:16,901
Please wait.

366
00:46:16,974 --> 00:46:18,966
I'll get dressed.

367
00:46:39,764 --> 00:46:41,960
I'm coming soon.

368
00:46:59,684 --> 00:47:02,017
Are you the lady's husband?

369
00:47:02,086 --> 00:47:03,384
Yes.

370
00:47:03,454 --> 00:47:07,824
May I have your name please?

371
00:47:20,404 --> 00:47:24,705
I'm Takeshi, Takeshi Ogawa.

372
00:47:27,478 --> 00:47:30,038
You're not working today?

373
00:47:30,114 --> 00:47:33,175
I'm home today.

374
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:35,617
I have a day off.

375
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:38,451
- You work in an office?
- Yes.

376
00:47:39,323 --> 00:47:44,091
A delivery employee was killed
close to here yesterday.

377
00:47:44,161 --> 00:47:46,858
Yes, I saw it on the news.

378
00:47:46,897 --> 00:47:48,593
Is that right?

379
00:47:50,368 --> 00:47:52,928
You may also know...

380
00:47:53,003 --> 00:47:56,064
that there's been a series of murders.

381
00:47:56,107 --> 00:47:58,702
Where's your wife today?

382
00:47:58,776 --> 00:48:02,178
She's out working today.

383
00:48:02,246 --> 00:48:04,181
Is that right?

384
00:48:04,248 --> 00:48:07,218
The murderer took the
employee's uniform.

385
00:48:07,251 --> 00:48:12,315
He may use it to enter people's home.

386
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:14,325
That's scary.

387
00:48:14,358 --> 00:48:17,817
Please tell that to your spouse.

388
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:20,763
I'll do that.
Thank you for your vigilance.

389
00:48:20,831 --> 00:48:22,823
Thank you, sir.

390
00:48:50,861 --> 00:48:53,831
You've been a good girl.

391
00:48:54,565 --> 00:48:55,498
Right?

392
00:49:01,338 --> 00:49:03,569
I'll go shopping.

393
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:05,599
Wait a little longer.

394
00:49:22,126 --> 00:49:25,426
You should cook lunch.

395
00:49:41,879 --> 00:49:44,371
Don't do anything stupid.

396
00:49:44,415 --> 00:49:47,112
You heard the news.

397
00:49:47,151 --> 00:49:49,848
Those I killed...

398
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:53,755
tried something stupid.

399
00:50:45,476 --> 00:50:46,842
Be careful.

400
00:51:08,032 --> 00:51:10,627
You're already so wet.

401
00:51:10,668 --> 00:51:12,796
You make me so horny.

402
00:51:15,139 --> 00:51:20,203
Excuse me, I need to go
to the bathroom.

403
00:51:20,277 --> 00:51:23,076
I won't let you.

404
00:51:27,518 --> 00:51:29,680
I'm gonna pee.

405
00:51:29,787 --> 00:51:31,312
Hold it.

406
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:40,796
No, stop.

407
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:57,380
You can pee right here.

408
00:51:57,448 --> 00:52:00,748
You weren't that
embarrassed last time.

409
00:52:05,255 --> 00:52:06,848
It's coming out.

410
00:52:13,831 --> 00:52:15,800
Amazing!

411
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:18,560
This is so nice.

412
00:53:35,312 --> 00:53:37,110
That was good.

413
00:53:37,147 --> 00:53:38,638
Eh?

414
00:53:40,384 --> 00:53:42,444
I said it was good.

415
00:53:48,258 --> 00:53:50,022
What now?

416
00:53:51,161 --> 00:53:56,099
Was your mom a good cook?

417
00:53:56,133 --> 00:53:59,228
Why would you ask that?

418
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:02,103
Never mind.

419
00:54:02,139 --> 00:54:04,074
Thank you.

420
00:54:04,108 --> 00:54:06,100
For what?

421
00:54:07,578 --> 00:54:09,809
You appreciated my cooking.

422
00:54:11,548 --> 00:54:14,245
Because your husband doesn't?

423
00:54:17,354 --> 00:54:18,720
I see.

424
00:54:31,368 --> 00:54:35,328
After lunch we'll have
our last bit of fun.

425
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:38,375
And then you'll go?

426
00:54:38,408 --> 00:54:39,933
Right.

427
00:54:40,277 --> 00:54:44,180
But I'll stay until late at night.

428
00:54:44,581 --> 00:54:46,982
I'll go out when it's dark.

429
00:54:47,785 --> 00:54:51,278
Say, could I go to the bathroom?

430
00:54:51,355 --> 00:54:53,256
You do it here.

431
00:54:53,323 --> 00:54:55,315
It's number two.

432
00:54:56,326 --> 00:54:59,558
That would be harder to clean up.

433
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:03,158
Please, I've been such a good girl.

434
00:55:03,267 --> 00:55:05,361
Fine.

435
00:55:06,503 --> 00:55:08,028
However...

436
00:55:29,893 --> 00:55:32,226
What's wrong?

437
00:55:33,030 --> 00:55:34,498
I can't.

438
00:55:34,865 --> 00:55:36,493
Why?

439
00:55:38,068 --> 00:55:40,333
You're watching me.

440
00:55:40,370 --> 00:55:42,362
You're ashamed?

441
00:55:44,274 --> 00:55:46,675
Everybody shits.

442
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:48,679
Why be ashamed?

443
00:55:48,712 --> 00:55:52,114
Usually, it's a private matter.

444
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:54,981
Yes, usually.

445
00:55:55,052 --> 00:56:00,116
But today, I'll be there to watch.

446
00:56:01,925 --> 00:56:06,454
Please, share your secret with me.

447
00:56:23,814 --> 00:56:26,306
Don't do that.

448
00:56:26,917 --> 00:56:29,614
The smell of privacy.

449
00:56:29,686 --> 00:56:34,647
Sharing secrets is
nothing to be ashamed of.

450
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:58,579
Such a good girl.

451
00:57:13,964 --> 00:57:15,956
Let's stick it in.

452
00:57:40,991 --> 00:57:43,426
Not in that hole.

453
00:57:48,231 --> 00:57:51,099
Is it your first time?

454
00:57:54,871 --> 00:57:58,137
I'm all the way in.
You feel it?

455
00:58:00,844 --> 00:58:02,710
Does it hurt?

456
00:58:06,116 --> 00:58:09,678
You feel only pain?

457
00:58:14,825 --> 00:58:16,589
Now I'll move.

458
00:58:36,146 --> 00:58:38,047
OK...

459
00:58:38,081 --> 00:58:41,245
We'll see if you've
learned something.

460
00:58:52,062 --> 00:58:54,554
First, you suck his dick.

461
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:45,378
It won't be long now.

462
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:08,892
Natsuko-san.

463
01:01:08,965 --> 01:01:10,763
It's good.

464
01:02:29,613 --> 01:02:33,516
It's my first threesome!

465
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:37,782
It's a rare opportunity
in a man's life! It's great!

466
01:02:38,154 --> 01:02:40,919
It's great! I love it!

467
01:03:56,566 --> 01:03:58,694
You won't take it?

468
01:04:01,004 --> 01:04:04,133
You don't want your old life back?

469
01:04:12,816 --> 01:04:15,411
What's your husband's blood type?

470
01:04:15,485 --> 01:04:17,420
It's A.

471
01:04:17,487 --> 01:04:19,888
Same as me.

472
01:04:19,956 --> 01:04:21,891
How about him?

473
01:04:21,958 --> 01:04:25,486
He's also A.

474
01:04:25,762 --> 01:04:31,565
So you could have our kid
and nobody would know.

475
01:04:32,168 --> 01:04:34,797
That would be a shared secret.

476
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:36,339
Right.

477
01:04:36,873 --> 01:04:39,638
Shared by three.

478
01:04:41,578 --> 01:04:43,570
Please.

479
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:46,647
Kiss me.

480
01:04:54,924 --> 01:04:57,655
I'm not really good at kissing.

481
01:05:21,117 --> 01:05:24,019
Come inside me!

482
01:05:24,053 --> 01:05:26,852
Flood me with your cum!

483
01:05:27,657 --> 01:05:31,355
You could even kill me now...

484
01:06:34,824 --> 01:06:38,886
<i>I'll be back at 11,</i>
<i>1 hour ahead of schedule.</i>

485
01:06:39,796 --> 01:06:42,527
Mr. Kawamura, wake up!

486
01:06:42,799 --> 01:06:44,529
Natsuko...

487
01:06:45,268 --> 01:06:47,999
Where is he?

488
01:06:48,037 --> 01:06:50,666
I think he's gone now.

489
01:06:51,374 --> 01:06:52,933
For real?

490
01:06:53,009 --> 01:06:56,502
Quick! Get dressed!

491
01:06:56,579 --> 01:06:58,707
My husband will be here soon!

492
01:06:58,748 --> 01:07:00,182
Seriously?

493
01:07:03,887 --> 01:07:05,253
I'll leave it here.

494
01:07:29,946 --> 01:07:31,380
Quick.

495
01:08:12,689 --> 01:08:17,525
<i>Take the first pill today</i>
<i>and the second tomorrow.</i>

496
01:08:35,578 --> 01:08:37,103
I'm back.

497
01:08:37,180 --> 01:08:39,172
Welcome back.

498
01:08:40,316 --> 01:08:41,716
Thank you.

499
01:08:48,558 --> 01:08:51,619
<i>And now the news.</i>

500
01:08:51,694 --> 01:08:54,163
<i>In the series of murders...</i>

501
01:08:54,230 --> 01:08:58,395
<i>a new victim has been found.</i>

502
01:08:59,102 --> 01:09:02,129
<i>Last night, Nanami Suzuki, 21...</i>

503
01:09:02,171 --> 01:09:05,073
<i>a student</i>
<i>living in Kuroda-shi...</i>

504
01:09:05,141 --> 01:09:09,511
<i>has been found murdered in her home.</i>

505
01:09:09,579 --> 01:09:12,947
See that, Natsuko? He killed again.

506
01:09:13,583 --> 01:09:16,917
<i>The victim had been stabbed</i>
<i>in the same way.</i>

507
01:09:16,986 --> 01:09:20,548
What are the police doing?

508
01:09:22,592 --> 01:09:26,552
Oh, my mom said she's visiting tonight.

509
01:09:26,629 --> 01:09:28,291
Great.

510
01:09:28,931 --> 01:09:31,628
I'll go to the market then.

511
01:09:35,638 --> 01:09:37,470
Be careful please.

512
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:42,740
That man...

513
01:09:42,779 --> 01:09:45,977
Was he really Jack the Ripper?

514
01:09:46,049 --> 01:09:52,546
He killed the old me
and gave me a rebirth.

515
01:10:19,782 --> 01:10:23,219
You did insert it this morning, right?

516
01:10:24,454 --> 01:10:28,289
Do you like your new toy?

517
01:10:29,125 --> 01:10:32,220
Yes, it feels good.

518
01:10:32,295 --> 01:10:33,957
Good.

519
01:10:34,030 --> 01:10:38,331
Now take a photo of it
under your skirt and send it to me.

520
01:11:25,448 --> 01:11:31,513
And in my knew life
I am fully satisfied.
