1
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:12,340
I didn't expect to arrive so late.

2
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:14,680
It's fine.

3
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:18,890
We won't make it.

4
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:22,920
Mr. Yoshimura was supposed
to help me with my research.

5
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,860
Hold him we'd be there at noon.

6
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:27,870
- Really?
-Yes

7
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:33,840
That's because we had
to wait at that diner.

8
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:38,370
Your seafood fried rice
arrived quickly...

9
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:42,400
but my fish set took
more than 20 min.

10
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,440
We should have started earlier.

11
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:52,050
Everything is slower in the countryside.

12
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:56,120
You could have seen it coming.

13
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:57,360
Eh?

14
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:03,160
You mean it's my fault
because I ordered fish?

15
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,900
I didn't chose the right dish?

16
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:10,480
That's not what I said.

17
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:16,810
It took you ages to drop
Mayu at your mom's.

18
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:22,150
Women are such chatterboxes.

19
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:25,620
And now it's my fault.

20
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:28,920
It's very kind of her
to take take care of her.

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,460
I couldn't just drop Mayu
and say bye-bye. That's rude.

22
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:37,090
Fine, forget I said anything.

23
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:43,100
I'm just pointing to what
our time was spent on.

24
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:49,410
Shouldn't you call him?

25
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,420
Alright, I get it.

26
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:04,420
Hello, Mr. Yoshimura, it's Kawatsu.

27
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:07,530
We're going to be late.

28
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:13,470
If we arrive later tonight, could
you still come and help me?

29
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:22,070
There you have it.

30
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,550
I missed this place.

31
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,450
When was the last time?

32
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:08,590
Mayu wasn't yet in kindergarten.

33
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:10,560
Probably 8 years ago.

34
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,620
That long ago?

35
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,070
I see.

36
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,710
Certainly, I hadn't spoken
with Uncle in two years.

37
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:21,870
What did you tell him?

38
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:24,970
That I left the college
to write a book...

39
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,980
and we'd like to use the villa.

40
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:29,380
He gladly agreed to let us.

41
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,250
What's this?

42
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:33,750
Don't touch it.

43
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:34,780
Hey.

44
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,960
Why are you always so snoopy?

45
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,860
Hold you not to touch it.

46
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,260
That's because...

47
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:50,860
I wanted to surprise you.

48
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,900
I'm sorry.

49
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:56,370
You've ruined the occasion.

50
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:58,340
<i>Not</i> at <i>all...</i>

51
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:01,280
I'm so happy. thank you.

52
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:05,850
Let's hurry, I want to use them.

53
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,140
So tired.

54
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:57,000
Having to drive all the
way was exhausting.

55
00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:01,440
I offered to drive half the way.

56
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:07,910
No, I really wanted you to rest.

57
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:10,880
That's the purpose of this stay.

58
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:54,980
How about a barbecue tonight?

59
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:27,420
Say...

60
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:31,760
You remember our last barbecue?

61
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:34,760
It was great.

62
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:39,030
You got drunk and threw up on the cover.

63
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,830
Hey, easy now.

64
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:45,140
That was 8 years ago.

65
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,740
It was an accident.

66
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:52,550
Aunty is still mad about her cover.

67
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:56,820
We're offering her this new cover.

68
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:01,060
It was a bargain, but good quality.

69
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:03,460
You recommended the shop.

70
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,020
You don't have to tell me.

71
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:09,040
You'll tell her when
you bring it to her.

72
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:12,730
You didn't tell her about it?

73
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:16,840
I'm not telling her
you bought it on bargain.

74
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:22,180
But still it's a good quality cover.

75
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,780
It's fine.

76
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:31,450
It's in the past, we can
laugh about it now...

77
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:36,390
and it becomes good family memories.

78
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,260
Need to take a leek.

79
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,340
You have to sit down.

80
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:53,370
I got it.

81
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,800
What the hell.

82
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,300
And now we have a whole week

83
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:47,320
just for the two of us.

84
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:04,080
Ks, hello.

85
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:08,280
Hey, Mom, what's up?

86
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:12,580
Hold you there's no
cell phone signal here.

87
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:15,890
What? Is she alright?

88
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:18,660
Too bad.

89
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:23,360
I'm sorry, could you
take her to the hospital?

90
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,730
Right.

91
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:27,970
I'll be there soon.

92
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:29,510
<i>Yes.</i>

93
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:32,110
What is it?

94
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:34,670
Mayu had a sudden belly <i>ache...</i>

95
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:37,340
and even a bit of fever.

96
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:40,480
Was it something she ate?

97
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:45,250
Sorry, I need you
to take me to the station.

98
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:47,590
- You're going back?
- ks.

99
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,960
You need the car here.

100
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,260
And the train is faster.

101
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,470
Darn.

102
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:04,470
You were so looking
forward to this week off.

103
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:07,810
I'll be fine.

104
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:12,380
All the fresh food
we bought will go to waste.

105
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:17,020
Maybe Mayu will soon get well.

106
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:19,720
You'll come back.

107
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:19,580
Sorry to arrive so late.

108
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:33,060
Please, drink.

109
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:46,850
Do you remember in Tokyo recently...

110
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:49,940
that serial killer
nicknamed Jack-the-Ripper?

111
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:55,150
Ah, that murderer who was
breaking into houses.

112
00:11:55,220 --> 00:12:00,920
He was raping women and
then stabbing them.

113
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,450
That was awful.

114
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:09,940
I think he even killed a couple of men.

115
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,470
<i>So...</i>

116
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:15,400
to be on the safe side...

117
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,740
I thought you could meet this officer.

118
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:23,010
<i>Wh...</i> what do you mean?

119
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:30,050
You mean that this murderer
is operating in the area?

120
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:33,420
We aren't sure yet.

121
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:36,960
The truth is, even in this village...

122
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,990
there were two very similar cases.

123
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:43,060
Is that right?

124
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:45,730
That is so scary.

125
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:51,110
Even in the countryside you
have to lock the doors.

126
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:53,170
I will.

127
00:12:55,250 --> 00:13:00,410
But I feel safer knowing that
you're watching, officer.

128
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:04,460
At least you didn't come here.

129
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,520
Believing that I am that
Jack-the-Ripper.

130
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:17,560
Weren't you supposed
to come with your wife.

131
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:23,070
Her mother just called in
saying that our daughter is sick.

132
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:25,940
She had to take a train home.

133
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,950
I see.

134
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,950
You must be worried.

135
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,970
<i>Yes.</i>

136
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:36,550
I also came to tell you.

137
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:39,620
Tonight it's going to start raining.

138
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:44,100
When it rains here, the
roads are very difficult.

139
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:49,160
Don't forget to check
the weather report.

140
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,760
Alright then, I will.

141
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:57,840
Anyway, I'll call you tomorrow afternoon.

142
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,440
Ah, thank you sir.

143
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:27,240
What?

144
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,530
I thought we had internet.

145
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:32,570
What the hell?

146
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,370
Maybe the Ethernet plug?

147
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:47,350
How about now?

148
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:54,230
Ah, still not working.

149
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,300
Really now.

150
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,010
Hello.

151
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:14,210
Ah, it's you dear.

152
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,250
Ah, Mayumi.

153
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,160
So, how is she?

154
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:20,850
It's a mild appendicitis.

155
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,190
An appendicitis.

156
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:25,250
Her appendix is inflamed.

157
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,560
I see.

158
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,830
Does she need surgery?

159
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:35,360
It's not serious, maybe drugs will do.

160
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,000
I see.

161
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:41,710
The do: said it could
be caused by stress.

162
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:43,770
By stress?

163
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:48,890
You know how she was affected
by your conduct.

164
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,090
Yeah, right.

165
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:56,460
She's going through a rough time.

166
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,490
I want to stay with her.

167
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,520
I see.

168
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:05,140
I'm sorry, you'll have
to manage without me.

169
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:09,640
You know, we wanted
to mend our marriage.

170
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:14,640
It's not the right time
to discuss this.

171
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:19,180
Come on, you wanted it too.

172
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:21,810
I thought it was important.

173
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,820
Come on.

174
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,050
<i>Surely...</i>

175
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:29,800
we have no choice but to move on.

176
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,490
Right.

177
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:34,060
Gotta go.

178
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:38,500
Hello? Hello?

179
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:06,750
Mayumi?

180
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,330
Ah? What happened?

181
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:15,030
Excuse us.

182
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:18,090
You're the only house
with the lights on.

183
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:21,440
<i>We lost our way...</i>

184
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:25,240
and we have no cell phone signal.

185
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,610
Could we use your land line?

186
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:30,620
Would that be a bother?

187
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:34,210
Sure, please come inside.

188
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,310
Excuse us.

189
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:40,360
Thank you.

190
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:47,360
Ah, a heater.

191
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,430
You may sit down.

192
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:53,460
Thank you, sir.

193
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:59,870
Don't you need to dry your coats?

194
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,670
Let me have it.

195
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,710
Thank you, sir.

196
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:13,780
It's completely soaked.

197
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:19,590
You feel better?

198
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:31,340
Please, have a towel.

199
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:34,010
Thank you so much.

200
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,650
The phone is over there.

201
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,160
Thank you sir, I'll call.

202
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,310
Hello.

203
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:05,770
We're from the hiking club.

204
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:07,810
Right.

205
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:10,110
Are they back already?

206
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:14,550
Good, thank you so much.

207
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:19,290
Could you give me your address?

208
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,430
Right away.

209
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:29,630
Here it is.

210
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,840
It's In Fukazawa village...

211
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:36,170
Sorry, the screen went black.

212
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,280
- There you are.
- Thank you sir.

213
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:46,380
In Fukazawa village, house number 711.

214
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:49,650
Right, we're so grateful.

215
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:53,060
Thank you very much, goodbye.

216
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:58,060
You've been so helpful.

217
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:01,430
They are coming to pick us up at 10.

218
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:03,460
That's good news.

219
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:08,900
The area doesn't have phone signal.

220
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:12,380
That phone is only good
to give me the time.

221
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:16,510
Excuse me.

222
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:20,880
We're sorry to impose.

223
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:25,650
Would you let us stay
until they arrive?

224
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:28,130
Sure, no problem.

225
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:31,860
I'm not throwing two ladies
out into the night.

226
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:34,700
That is so kind of you.

227
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:40,000
My name is Nami Onishi.

228
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:42,010
I'm Mr. Kawatsu.

229
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,010
I'm Yuka Konishi.

230
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:47,280
Ah, you're not sisters?

231
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:50,770
No, we work at the same company...

232
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:54,220
and we both decided
to join the hiking club.

233
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:57,310
We got separated from the group.

234
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,550
That's too bad.

235
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:02,250
At least you are safe.

236
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:05,730
That Jack-the-Ripper from Tokyo...

237
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:09,430
is hiding in the neighborhood.

238
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,030
really?

239
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,100
I'm scared.

240
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:16,940
<i>I'm cold.</i>

241
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,970
Are you OK?

242
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,870
It's so warm.

243
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:26,850
We're finally warming up.

244
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:28,510
You feel better?

245
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,420
It feels great.

246
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:33,460
You have a foam beard.

247
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:36,120
You give me one too?

248
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,960
You do it.

249
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:40,370
You're so cute.

250
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,730
Let me see how cute.

251
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,570
Suits you so well.

252
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,000
It's great.

253
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:48,540
Let me clean your back.

254
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:49,970
- Turn around.
- OK.

255
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:53,480
Oh, that is so nice.

256
00:22:57,650 --> 00:23:00,050
Alright, your turn now.

257
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:03,350
My turn now.

258
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:05,320
- How is it?
- Great.

259
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,160
'Ks, keep going-

260
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:11,260
Does it tickle you here?

261
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:15,230
No it doesn't, you could
keep going forever.

262
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:21,130
It's so warm now.

263
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,970
I feel relaxed.

264
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:26,040
Your tits are showing.

265
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:33,680
Sorry, I didn't dare take
my wife's clothes.

266
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:36,020
I hope mine will suit you.

267
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,380
There.

268
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:41,220
Your hospitality is boundless.

269
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:44,120
Nice shirt.

270
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:46,890
- Is it big?
- Yeah.

271
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:52,900
You manage?

272
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,390
Smells like my dad's.

273
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:15,190
Ah? Was it washed properly?

274
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:18,790
It feels safe.

275
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:22,930
Thank you.

276
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,300
Go ahead.

277
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:34,570
So you are married?

278
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:39,340
We came here from Tokyo...

279
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:41,980
for my research.

280
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:44,150
What research?

281
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:46,160
I'm going to publish a book.

282
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:47,520
Amazing.

283
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,860
You're a writer?

284
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,560
Can I have your autograph?

285
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:53,330
No I'm not a writer.

286
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,530
I write history books.

287
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:58,090
That's still great.

288
00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:01,270
I was a college Professor.

289
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:03,780
Unfortunately, I had to resign.

290
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:08,040
I never spent much time with my wife.

291
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:12,210
We wanted to have
some quality time.

292
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:16,380
So nice of you!
Your wife is so lucky.

293
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:18,520
I can't say <i>that...</i>

294
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:21,990
My wife doesn't see it that way.

295
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:28,730
Most men are inconsiderate
of their wife's feelings.

296
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,830
But you are so considerate.

297
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:34,360
You're a great husband.

298
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:36,380
I'm not sure.

299
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:38,780
Where's is Madam?

300
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:42,280
Our daughter suddenly got <i>sick...</i>

301
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,280
and she had to go take care of her.

302
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,010
You must be worried.

303
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:49,250
It's not that serious.

304
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:52,820
As soon as our daughter
is better, she'll come back.

305
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:56,490
You could get lonely until she comes.

306
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,290
I miss her...

307
00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:04,760
but look, your little adventure
enlivened my loneliness.

308
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:08,570
So kind of you to say that.

309
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,870
We feel less guilty for imposing on you.

310
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:14,210
You are such a good man.

311
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:16,550
I wouldn't say that.

312
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:34,320
- So delicious.
- So delicious.

313
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,370
You have to eat your carrots.

314
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,430
You can have <i>them...</i>

315
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:42,070
There.

316
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:43,700
Oh, come on.

317
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,680
It's good.

318
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:55,310
<i>If you like...</i>

319
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,450
You're being too generous.

320
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:01,050
Cheers!

321
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:03,360
Yuka, you're such a kid.

322
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,960
Forgive her, Professor.

323
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,430
It's fine.

324
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:10,930
Make yourself at home.

325
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,940
Enjoy the beer.

326
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:16,670
You really don't mind us here?

327
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:18,700
Of course not.

328
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:23,810
Alright then, I'll take
you up on your offer.

329
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:32,620
You really seem to enjoy it.

330
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:35,820
So good.

331
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,610
Nami doesn't handle alcohol very well.

332
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:56,620
I'm sorry, I gave her too much.

333
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,780
They're late.

334
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:03,950
There is a storm going on.

335
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:06,120
It seems they won't be coming tonight.

336
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:08,960
Maybe we should go anyway.

337
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,130
Be careful of that
Jack-the-Ripper at night.

338
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:14,830
You'd better stay indoors.

339
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,840
<i>But...</i>

340
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:21,640
Don't be embarrassed.
You can sleep here tonight.

341
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:24,980
Thank you, Professor.

342
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:30,610
Your clothes should be dry by now.

343
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:41,230
Do you think that my tits are showing?

344
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:44,990
Well, I didn't notice anything.

345
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:47,530
- Sorry if I inadvertently...
- Come on...

346
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:52,000
I don't wear a bra.
You know where the nipples are.

347
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:54,130
I'm not sure.

348
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:57,170
<i>Look...</i>

349
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,840
They're here.

350
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:03,350
This is not a good joke.

351
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:06,080
- Are you mad?
- No, I'm not...

352
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:10,180
I'll sleep in my bedroom.

353
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:14,560
I'm sorry I can only
offer you the sofa.

354
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:16,520
Good night.

355
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:39,420
What just happened?

356
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:48,950
Professor.

357
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:53,830
Professor.

358
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,890
I'm so sorry.

359
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,800
Forget about it.

360
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:01,510
But you see...

361
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:05,440
I wasn't joking at all.

362
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:08,170
Professor.

363
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:11,340
Don't do that.

364
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:13,620
But WHY?

365
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:15,790
What do you mean, “Why?“

366
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:18,020
<i>Come on...</i>

367
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:21,990
I'm just a man you met today.

368
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:25,050
- Why?
- Is that wrong?

369
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:28,590
I'm not saying, you can't do that.

370
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:30,900
Well... you can't do that.

371
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:34,070
My nose is sharp...

372
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:38,340
I can smell a man hungry for sex.

373
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:42,040
You do want to have sex
with me, don't you?

374
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:44,480
Even if that was <i>true...</i>

375
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:47,610
obviously, I can't.

376
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:52,980
So I'll do it alone and you just watch.

377
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:43,740
Professor.

378
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:47,610
Professor.

379
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:53,020
Professor.

380
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:56,010
Professor.

381
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,390
Professor.

382
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,200
It feels good!

383
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:26,430
What's that?

384
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:30,000
Why did you tie me up?

385
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:33,600
Enough fooling around.

386
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:35,270
Set me free.

387
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:39,740
Hey, Papa was born the same year.

388
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:41,770
Can I call you 'Papa?

389
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:44,580
Enough, it's not a good joke.

390
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:49,280
So, this Mayumi is your wife?

391
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:53,550
Stop that.

392
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,850
<i>Did you...</i>

393
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:59,330
Professor, it doesn't look good.

394
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:02,930
A man of your status being so naughty...

395
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,060
What? But you assaulted me.

396
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:10,940
How about asking your wife's opinion?

397
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:12,570
<i>She would...</i>

398
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:15,740
Until she comes <i>back...</i>

399
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:17,940
you're gonna do as we tell you.

400
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:21,850
If you don't, we'll send her this.

401
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:26,380
Don't, we're trying to mend our marriage.

402
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:30,520
You mean, your marriage is
in bad shape?

403
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,090
Why is that?

404
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:34,400
That's none of your business.

405
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:38,700
Don't tell us you cheated on her?

406
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:42,570
Did I guess right?

407
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:45,840
A disgraced Professor
who had to resign.

408
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,870
Ain't that great?

409
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,710
What do you want?

410
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,820
Do I have to explain?

411
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:05,460
Don't do that.

412
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,830
It seems you like it.

413
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:15,340
Nami, can you look this way?

414
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:19,340
Yeah, good shot.

415
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:30,080
"Hey"-

416
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:35,400
Can you lick me?

417
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,260
There!

418
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:57,980
Good, you're doing good.

419
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:13,920
This feels good.

420
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,850
You don't mind, right?

421
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:03,010
You came already?

422
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:05,110
Good boy.

423
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:12,920
Who are you?

424
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,390
What do you want?

425
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:17,860
We want your body.

426
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,870
What's that?

427
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:22,960
Hold you. We want to have sex.

428
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,000
That's silly.

429
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:29,600
If you satisfy us, we'll go quietly.

430
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:32,700
Before your wife comes back.

431
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:54,430
Look at this, top quality meat.

432
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:56,130
Let's have a barbecue.

433
00:39:56,170 --> 00:39:57,300
May:

434
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,600
Let's have meat!
Let's have meat!

435
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:09,580
I did it!

436
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:52,960
Look! Top quality charcoal.

437
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:54,960
Can we use it?

438
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,620
He wanted to impress his wife.

439
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:59,690
How impressive.

440
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,480
Indeed.

441
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:31,750
A disobedient Professor.

442
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:01,150
What are you doing?

443
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:06,630
That charcoal was hard to light.

444
00:43:06,930 --> 00:43:10,660
It's because it's long-lasting charcoal.

445
00:43:10,730 --> 00:43:13,530
You think we care?

446
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:15,860
"Tell us, Professor"

447
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:21,640
You told us to enjoy and
make ourselves at home.

448
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:24,200
Make yourselves at home?

449
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:25,730
Now you're going too far.

450
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:28,250
Disgusting raw meat!

451
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:32,280
How come men who are
so bad at cooking...

452
00:43:32,350 --> 00:43:35,810
insist on having barbecues?

453
00:43:38,590 --> 00:43:41,120
Why are you doing all this?

454
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:43,460
I already told you.

455
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:47,130
We want to have sex.

456
00:43:48,370 --> 00:43:51,430
You girls don't have
to go to all that trouble

457
00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:53,630
to find a lay in town.

458
00:43:53,670 --> 00:43:56,570
You really don't get it, do you?

459
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:00,140
“Please stop."

460
00:44:00,210 --> 00:44:01,840
"Let me go"

461
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:04,410
“No, don't do that'!

462
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:10,780
While his mouth says 'no',
his body says 'yes'

463
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:14,280
This is what gives us pleasure.

464
00:44:15,130 --> 00:44:18,060
We're thrill-seekers.

465
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:19,560
You're crazy.

466
00:44:19,630 --> 00:44:21,120
Why?

467
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:24,530
Men want the same thing.

468
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:28,910
A man forces himself on a woman...

469
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:33,340
while she cries and kicks
and begs for mercy.

470
00:44:33,410 --> 00:44:38,150
And he finds it delightful
that she's wet anyway.

471
00:44:38,390 --> 00:44:43,050
Why can't women have
the same kind of fun?

472
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:46,180
I'm not that kind of man.

473
00:44:47,230 --> 00:44:49,790
You like to be forced, then.

474
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:51,060
I don't.

475
00:44:51,130 --> 00:44:52,790
Which are you, then?

476
00:44:52,870 --> 00:44:56,500
Why should I have to choose?

477
00:44:56,540 --> 00:44:58,500
Isn't the world divided between...

478
00:44:58,540 --> 00:45:01,130
those who do and those who are done?

479
00:45:01,170 --> 00:45:04,510
It's not about do or be done.

480
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:08,340
Common people don't think like that.

481
00:45:08,410 --> 00:45:10,350
Common people?

482
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:14,820
Common people get married,
and care for each other.

483
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:20,250
Goodness, you can't be
talking about 'love'?

484
00:45:20,330 --> 00:45:21,990
That's it.

485
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:27,060
You mean, you girls don't
believe in love?

486
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:31,430
When you have good sex,
who cares about love?

487
00:45:31,470 --> 00:45:37,740
Without marriage, how can you
know whose kid it is?

488
00:45:38,150 --> 00:45:39,870
What do you mean?

489
00:45:39,950 --> 00:45:43,380
When the baby is born,
we take good care of it.

490
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:49,050
A poor kid who doesn't
even know its father?

491
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:50,550
Why?

492
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:54,990
Why is he a poor kid if he
doesn't know his father?

493
00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:59,260
A kid needs to grow up with its father.

494
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,370
Look at you, isn't a kid better
off without a father like you?

495
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:06,100
What are you saying?

496
00:46:06,710 --> 00:46:08,870
Give me a break!

497
00:46:09,310 --> 00:46:13,440
You believe you're indispensable
to the growth of a child?

498
00:46:14,610 --> 00:46:18,140
Kids are the fruits of love.

499
00:46:18,790 --> 00:46:21,910
It's irresponsible
to bear kids without love.

500
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:25,450
If love is the fuel necessary
for raising a child...

501
00:46:25,490 --> 00:46:29,490
what happens to the kid if
the couple runs out of fuel?

502
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:34,590
There's nothing more
important than raising a child.

503
00:46:34,670 --> 00:46:38,130
A child is what binds a couple together.

504
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:42,370
So the child is your tool
to hold her hostage?

505
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:44,710
I didn't say that!

506
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:47,580
Those who invented this concept.

507
00:46:47,610 --> 00:46:50,020
Are Western despots who needed it

508
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:54,450
to keep the masses under control
by dividing them into families.

509
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:58,450
Since you're a historian you
probably understand that.

510
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:03,930
Originally, humans are born
to live free of any bonds.

511
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,090
Right?

512
00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:06,600
I agree.

513
00:47:06,670 --> 00:47:12,040
I like to give men pleasure
and I enjoy it too.

514
00:47:12,070 --> 00:47:16,570
Now. you just tried to escape...

515
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:21,750
What should we do with you?

516
00:47:31,690 --> 00:47:34,250
Look how cute this is.

517
00:47:34,330 --> 00:47:35,890
Which one do you like?

518
00:47:35,930 --> 00:47:37,060
Huh?

519
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:39,600
Now, chose a scrunchy.

520
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:42,930
I choose and then what?

521
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,940
You can't decide?

522
00:47:45,010 --> 00:47:47,200
Why should I?

523
00:47:47,270 --> 00:47:49,260
OK, you can wear both.

524
00:47:49,810 --> 00:47:51,710
That's a great idea.

525
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:56,550
Hey, what? Don't do that.

526
00:48:05,990 --> 00:48:09,450
It's cute! It's so cute!

527
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:13,130
This way the blood flow
is held at the base...

528
00:48:13,170 --> 00:48:15,640
and your erection lasts longer.

529
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:19,040
We should have used it the first time.

530
00:48:19,610 --> 00:48:26,980
If I fold it once and then twice,
it doubles the effect.

531
00:48:29,850 --> 00:48:31,480
Ouch! seep!

532
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:34,790
Papa, otherwise you come too quickly!

533
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:36,810
It's no fun for your little girl!

534
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,660
If you tie it for too
long, you risk necrosis.

535
00:48:48,570 --> 00:48:50,000
Right!

536
00:49:17,130 --> 00:49:19,390
Look, like this.

537
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,170
It's amazing!

538
00:49:33,510 --> 00:49:34,980
It's so hard!

539
00:49:35,820 --> 00:49:36,480
<i>No.</i>

540
00:49:36,550 --> 00:49:39,140
Let me go! No!

541
00:49:39,190 --> 00:49:41,120
You'll be fine!

542
00:49:41,150 --> 00:49:44,120
Soon you'll enjoy it.

543
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:45,450
Right?

544
00:49:58,510 --> 00:50:01,100
Help me!

545
00:50:01,370 --> 00:50:03,670
- Help me!
- Shut up!

546
00:50:06,450 --> 00:50:08,380
You keep quiet!

547
00:50:13,190 --> 00:50:15,020
We mean it!

548
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:29,400
Can I help you?

549
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:31,830
<i>Ne you...</i>

550
00:50:31,910 --> 00:50:34,310
I'm Mr. Yoshimura, the Park Ranger.

551
00:50:35,070 --> 00:50:38,140
Is the Professor there?

552
00:50:38,710 --> 00:50:41,880
You are Mr. Yoshimura?

553
00:50:41,950 --> 00:50:44,210
He told me about you.

554
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:46,620
I'm Mayumi, his wife.

555
00:50:46,650 --> 00:50:49,520
Such a young wife.

556
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:52,050
Thank you for the compliment.

557
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:55,120
Do you have business with my husband?

558
00:50:55,800 --> 00:51:00,530
I was supposed to give
him a call today...

559
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:02,630
but the line was busy.

560
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,370
We had an interview today.

561
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:12,670
Right, it seems that the
storm cut off our line.

562
00:51:14,350 --> 00:51:16,680
Where is the Professor?

563
00:51:16,750 --> 00:51:20,580
He went out early this morning.

564
00:51:21,090 --> 00:51:22,750
Are you on your own?

565
00:51:22,790 --> 00:51:26,350
I do not know where he went.

566
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:29,920
Maybe he went to Ehara...

567
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:37,730
But the road to Ehara
got flooded last night.

568
00:51:44,510 --> 00:51:49,470
Help <i>me...</i> Help <i>me...</i> Help <i>me...</i>

569
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:53,990
He took his phone with him,
so you should probably call him.

570
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:55,980
<i>NM see.</i>

571
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:57,620
I'll do that.

572
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:07,060
Excuse me.

573
00:52:09,670 --> 00:52:11,760
His car is still here.

574
00:52:11,810 --> 00:52:16,830
Right, he didn't feel like driving.

575
00:52:16,910 --> 00:52:18,880
He called a taxi

576
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:21,950
He took a taxi this morning.

577
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:23,350
<i>Yes.</i>

578
00:52:23,420 --> 00:52:24,910
I see.

579
00:52:29,690 --> 00:52:32,950
I guess your husband told you...

580
00:52:33,030 --> 00:52:37,120
that there's a murderer
in the neighborhood.

581
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,360
They nicknamed him Jack-the-Ripper.

582
00:52:39,830 --> 00:52:42,800
Ks, he told me about it.

583
00:52:43,670 --> 00:52:47,660
You'd better lock yourself inside.

584
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:50,440
Right, understood.

585
00:52:50,810 --> 00:52:52,970
See you.

586
00:53:06,630 --> 00:53:08,120
I'm back.

587
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:12,430
He made so much noise that
I feared he'd be heard.

588
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:22,830
She gave you pleasure.
You should have been quiet.

589
00:53:23,410 --> 00:53:25,430
How did you drive him away?

590
00:53:25,510 --> 00:53:27,950
I pretended to be the wife.

591
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:30,420
He was surprised I was so young.

592
00:53:30,450 --> 00:53:32,010
Well done.

593
00:53:32,390 --> 00:53:36,450
Such a young wife.
You have to earn her.

594
00:53:36,490 --> 00:53:39,790
- Look at that.
- Ouch! Ouch!

595
00:53:40,230 --> 00:53:43,860
That Mr. Yoshimura seems
to be well endowed.

596
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:46,730
I bet he'd come many times.

597
00:53:46,770 --> 00:53:49,930
Really? Let's do him next!

598
00:53:49,970 --> 00:53:52,440
He warned me about Jack-the-Ripper.

599
00:53:52,470 --> 00:53:54,440
He did?

600
00:53:54,470 --> 00:53:58,780
Soon we'll have to move to another area.

601
00:53:58,850 --> 00:54:03,540
But that Mr. Yoshimura sounds very sexy.

602
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:06,820
We should visit him before we move on.

603
00:54:08,890 --> 00:54:10,410
No way, are you...

604
00:54:13,290 --> 00:54:16,350
Jack-the-Ripper is not a man?

605
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:20,330
He could be a man.

606
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:23,700
Or he could be a woman.

607
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:27,260
He could be just one person.

608
00:54:27,310 --> 00:54:29,740
Or there could be more than one.

609
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:39,240
Nobody knows since all the
potential witnesses have been killed.

610
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:45,920
You're going to kill me?

611
00:54:45,990 --> 00:54:47,790
Be quiet.

612
00:54:51,130 --> 00:54:53,030
Look at him!

613
00:54:54,170 --> 00:54:55,690
You feared for your life?

614
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:57,000
Well done.

615
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:08,040
It's gone purple but it's still fine.

616
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:13,950
Oh Papa, come on.

617
00:55:13,990 --> 00:55:16,460
You're pissing yourself.

618
00:55:33,910 --> 00:55:36,070
He's not hard anymore.

619
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:40,170
Men are so high maintenance.

620
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:44,610
Is that how grateful you are?

621
00:55:44,650 --> 00:55:46,950
What's wrong with it?

622
00:55:47,050 --> 00:55:49,110
What can I do about it?

623
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:55,390
After all, your only redeeming
quality is your erection.

624
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:56,860
Ouch! Ouch!

625
00:55:56,900 --> 00:56:02,500
If you can't get it up, what's
the point of keeping you alive?

626
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:04,930
You become useless.

627
00:56:06,010 --> 00:56:08,910
I beg you! Don't kill me!

628
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:12,470
Look, an expensive wine.

629
00:56:12,550 --> 00:56:14,100
That's <i>the...</i>

630
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:16,110
What is it?

631
00:56:16,180 --> 00:56:20,020
It's from the year 1999.

632
00:56:20,090 --> 00:56:21,490
Let's drink it.

633
00:56:21,550 --> 00:56:26,050
This is the year Mayumi
and I got married.

634
00:56:26,090 --> 00:56:29,530
Now that's great.

635
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:49,180
And when did you get married?

636
00:56:49,220 --> 00:56:52,620
I just told you, in 1999.

637
00:56:52,650 --> 00:56:55,750
What day is the anniversary?

638
00:56:55,790 --> 00:57:00,660
It's In June... I mean in May.

639
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:04,560
Damn, I can't recall the day.

640
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:07,290
You can't even remember that?

641
00:57:07,330 --> 00:57:11,500
If you care that little, what's
the point of the occasion?

642
00:57:11,540 --> 00:57:13,940
Papa, you're a disgrace.

643
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:20,310
Papa, do you remember my birthday?

644
00:57:20,410 --> 00:57:22,610
The hell if I know!

645
00:57:22,650 --> 00:57:24,140
You don't?

646
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:26,150
That's hurtful.

647
00:57:26,220 --> 00:57:29,350
How would I know your birthday?

648
00:57:29,390 --> 00:57:32,920
You don't remember my birthday?

649
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:34,650
That's hurtful?

650
00:57:34,730 --> 00:57:39,190
What terrible father can't
remember his daughter's birthday?

651
00:57:39,270 --> 00:57:43,130
What the hell did I do to you?

652
00:57:43,970 --> 00:57:48,460
I helped you out of kindness.

653
00:57:48,510 --> 00:57:51,970
But forgetting one's
Wedding's anniversary...

654
00:57:52,050 --> 00:57:55,850
How could we sympathize
with a person like you?

655
00:57:55,920 --> 00:58:03,580
You criticize me, but you have no clue
how much a man has to remember.

656
00:58:03,620 --> 00:58:07,750
We don't have the kind of memory
for dates that women have.

657
00:58:07,790 --> 00:58:12,320
You men have such a hard life...

658
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:14,560
I had no clue.

659
00:58:14,630 --> 00:58:18,540
I do everything I can.

660
00:58:18,610 --> 00:58:21,040
I try to make Mayumi happy.

661
00:58:21,070 --> 00:58:23,170
I'm doing my best.

662
00:58:23,810 --> 00:58:25,680
How about this wine?

663
00:58:26,380 --> 00:58:30,280
I wanted to enjoy it here with Mayumi.

664
00:58:30,350 --> 00:58:33,220
But now she's gone.

665
00:58:33,590 --> 00:58:35,950
She had to.

666
00:58:35,990 --> 00:58:39,480
You wanted to warm her up
with the wine.

667
00:58:39,530 --> 00:58:42,090
Please, don't do that!

668
00:58:42,130 --> 00:58:44,890
Mayumi will have to clean up your mess.

669
00:58:44,930 --> 00:58:48,390
No, you'll clean it up!

670
00:58:49,470 --> 00:58:52,530
If your only contribution
is the barbecue...

671
00:58:52,610 --> 00:58:55,010
it's all about your own pleasure.

672
00:58:55,080 --> 00:59:00,210
But this time you'll have to clean up.

673
00:59:00,250 --> 00:59:03,620
What are you talking about?

674
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:08,210
I'm always so careful
to keep everything clean.

675
00:59:08,260 --> 00:59:12,210
You're so careful just because
you don't want to clean?

676
00:59:12,260 --> 00:59:14,590
You're really pathetic.

677
00:59:21,130 --> 00:59:24,300
Look, are they handmade?

678
00:59:24,340 --> 00:59:26,270
Don't touch them.

679
00:59:27,110 --> 00:59:29,080
With your names and <i>all...</i>

680
00:59:29,140 --> 00:59:31,130
Did you make these yourself, Professor?

681
00:59:34,210 --> 00:59:35,810
creepy-

682
01:00:13,220 --> 01:00:14,690
What was that?

683
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:19,420
It will help you regain your
vigor and last all night.

684
01:00:47,020 --> 01:00:48,750
Professor, it feels so good!

685
01:00:48,890 --> 01:00:50,380
It feels so good!

686
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:21,650
Amazing!

687
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:29,250
Professor, it feels so good!

688
01:01:31,870 --> 01:01:33,920
Can you feel it, Professor?

689
01:01:36,340 --> 01:01:37,800
I'm sorry.

690
01:01:38,810 --> 01:01:40,300
I'm sorry.

691
01:01:42,010 --> 01:01:43,500
I'm sorry.

692
01:01:46,910 --> 01:01:48,850
I'm sorry.

693
01:01:51,850 --> 01:01:53,510
I'm sorry.

694
01:01:54,820 --> 01:01:56,020
What?

695
01:01:57,320 --> 01:01:59,690
What are you apologizing for?

696
01:02:01,260 --> 01:02:05,560
I'm sorry that the cover is dirty.

697
01:02:05,630 --> 01:02:08,230
And for what else?

698
01:02:08,300 --> 01:02:12,570
I'm sorry about the anniversary.

699
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:14,510
What anniversary?

700
01:02:16,340 --> 01:02:20,900
I'm sorry I forgot our
wedding anniversary.

701
01:02:21,380 --> 01:02:23,870
There's something else.

702
01:02:30,290 --> 01:02:35,790
I'm sorry I slept with
one of my students!

703
01:02:39,670 --> 01:02:42,660
You finally apologize for it.

704
01:02:42,740 --> 01:02:45,330
Such a good boy.

705
01:02:48,070 --> 01:02:53,040
But your apologies are
not needed anymore.

706
01:02:54,310 --> 01:02:59,880
That was a long time ago.

707
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:14,330
Look, there's still something.

708
01:03:20,370 --> 01:03:21,900
This one goes into your bag.

709
01:03:22,140 --> 01:03:23,070
Alright.

710
01:03:29,020 --> 01:03:31,110
We're all done?

711
01:03:31,180 --> 01:03:32,650
<i>OK.</i>

712
01:03:33,590 --> 01:03:35,210
Let's go then.

713
01:03:57,080 --> 01:03:58,840
Bye-bye.

714
01:04:19,530 --> 01:04:24,230
Oh, I forgot my hair scrunchy
on the Professor.

715
01:04:24,300 --> 01:04:27,040
It's OK, I untied his hands.

716
01:04:27,110 --> 01:04:29,230
He can manage on his own.

717
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:30,740
You're right.

718
01:04:30,810 --> 01:04:33,800
Where should we go next?

719
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:36,280
The weather is getting cold.

720
01:04:36,350 --> 01:04:38,610
I'd like a warmer climate.

721
01:04:38,690 --> 01:04:43,620
I heard it's easier to gain
the trust of Southern people.

722
01:04:43,660 --> 01:04:45,650
Why?

723
01:04:47,290 --> 01:04:50,630
Maybe because the weather is warmer...

724
01:04:50,660 --> 01:04:52,630
so their heart is warmer too.

725
01:04:52,670 --> 01:04:55,100
Whatever.

726
01:05:22,100 --> 01:05:26,560
<i>Harada District Park Ranger</i>

727
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:31,300
Thank you for the ride.

728
01:05:47,220 --> 01:05:53,560
Are you there? You didn't
pick up the phone.

729
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,620
What's that?

730
01:05:58,930 --> 01:06:01,770
Hey? Dear?

731
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:04,930
Dear!

732
01:06:05,270 --> 01:06:07,800
What are you doing?

733
01:06:07,870 --> 01:06:11,140
Now I have to clean up your mess'

734
01:06:11,180 --> 01:06:13,170
Are you crazy?

735
01:07:32,030 --> 01:07:36,050
A man pisses standing up!
