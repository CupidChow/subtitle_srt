1
00:00:09,576 --> 00:00:10,600
Stop!

2
00:00:18,485 --> 00:00:20,477
Don't touch me!

3
00:00:25,292 --> 00:00:26,555
Let me go!

4
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:30,928
You're under arrest.

5
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,594
Enough with the lies!

6
00:00:35,669 --> 00:00:38,434
As I said many times...

7
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:41,236
I don't know about that.

8
00:00:44,344 --> 00:00:46,813
You were close to the crime scene!

9
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,282
There are witnesses who saw you!

10
00:00:50,317 --> 00:00:53,617
You were even caught on camera!

11
00:00:53,654 --> 00:00:55,646
This is you!

12
00:00:56,356 --> 00:00:59,690
He does look like me.

13
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,662
But I don't wear clothes like this.

14
00:01:07,601 --> 00:01:11,003
But you know the sixth victim...

15
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:14,041
Nanami Suzuki.

16
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:16,043
I don't remember.

17
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:20,012
An employee at Ueshida Station...

18
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,050
saw you quarrel with Ms. Suzuki.

19
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:26,281
And two days later she was murdered.

20
00:01:26,353 --> 00:01:30,950
Your fingerprints were on her cell phone.

21
00:01:31,024 --> 00:01:36,827
You can't deny that you
had contact with her.

22
00:01:36,863 --> 00:01:38,798
What?

23
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:41,892
Are you implying that
I am Jack the Ripper?

24
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:44,268
I didn't kill anyone!

25
00:01:44,338 --> 00:01:48,833
I can't recall exactly,
but on the train...

26
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:52,004
a lady was very noisy on her phone...

27
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,811
I was upset, I took it out of her hands.

28
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:59,342
I can't remember what she looked like.

29
00:01:59,386 --> 00:02:01,218
Maybe it was her.

30
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:03,917
So why did you run?

31
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:06,358
I thought you were a debt collectors.

32
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:11,290
I borrowed money from the mafia.

33
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:13,857
Today's the deadline.

34
00:02:14,201 --> 00:02:21,074
Right, maybe you should
arrest those guys.

35
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:36,188
So how did Hayama
lead the interrogation?

36
00:02:36,223 --> 00:02:38,783
Well, to tell you the truth...

37
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:43,286
It's her first assignment and
she still has a lot to learn.

38
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:49,200
But if she arrested the wrong
guy it'll look bad for her.

39
00:02:49,236 --> 00:02:50,295
Right.

40
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:53,497
The chief inspector doesn't really care.

41
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:57,170
But you'll see how
the public reacts to it.

42
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:00,612
Well, there's nothing sure yet.

43
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:04,675
But there has to be a press conference.

44
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:08,587
The director and the chief
will have to speak then.

45
00:03:08,622 --> 00:03:12,787
That's really bad.

46
00:03:12,826 --> 00:03:15,295
There'll be consequences.

47
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:16,762
It's a big case.

48
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:21,666
Don't worry, the director and
the chief will cover for us.

49
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:23,328
You think so?

50
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:28,331
They were right, it was
a mistake to appoint a woman.

51
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:33,474
You think you can do better?

52
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:35,413
I'm sorry.

53
00:03:35,482 --> 00:03:41,183
Even in the police,
we need female officers.

54
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:45,488
But to appoint her inspector
was a bit risky.

55
00:03:46,993 --> 00:03:49,121
Yes, indeed.

56
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:57,233
Figures you'd be here.

57
00:03:57,304 --> 00:03:59,239
An update on the case.

58
00:03:59,306 --> 00:04:02,674
Sure, what is it?

59
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:08,580
Kenichi Shimizu's alibi checks out
in the Nami Suzuki murder case.

60
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:12,609
What? Shimizu is not
our man after all?

61
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:15,486
Oh, come on.

62
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:17,319
Damn.

63
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:23,763
In the series of murders in Kirisaki...

64
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:28,291
they caught a suspect they
thought was Jack the Ripper.

65
00:04:28,335 --> 00:04:30,964
But they caught the wrong guy.

66
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:36,567
What? That murderer
is still on the loose?

67
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,136
That's scar y for women!

68
00:04:39,179 --> 00:04:41,273
He killed 12 women.

69
00:04:41,348 --> 00:04:44,546
He even killed a man.

70
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:47,418
I'll tell you a secret.

71
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:54,019
The police in Arakawa has assigned
a skillful woman to this case.

72
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:57,861
But she's the one who
arrested the wrong guy.

73
00:04:57,931 --> 00:04:59,524
He had an alibi.

74
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:01,534
Ah, too bad.

75
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:06,130
We all wish that she'll keep at it
and find our murderer.

76
00:05:06,273 --> 00:05:07,400
Indeed.

77
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:10,534
Now let's listen to a song.

78
00:05:19,753 --> 00:05:23,246
Inspector Hamada,
you should rest for a week.

79
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:25,418
Stay put and wait for our call.

80
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:27,452
Yes.

81
00:05:29,963 --> 00:05:32,296
I'm sorry I caused you trouble.

82
00:05:34,401 --> 00:05:36,802
Alright guys, dismissed.

83
00:05:54,287 --> 00:06:00,523
When you are successful, they praise
the new female inspector in Arakawa.

84
00:06:00,594 --> 00:06:05,055
And they go on and on about how it
was such a good idea to assign her there.

85
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:09,967
If it goes wrong they're like: "You can't
give responsibility to a woman!"

86
00:06:10,003 --> 00:06:12,234
That's awful.

87
00:06:12,272 --> 00:06:15,765
Well, I made a huge mistake.

88
00:06:19,346 --> 00:06:21,076
I'm sorry...

89
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:25,279
I'm the one who checked his alibi.

90
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:31,189
Come on, I'm just glad
we didn't charge an innocent.

91
00:06:31,925 --> 00:06:35,862
Maybe my desire for success
blinded my judgment.

92
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:38,661
I should have listened to the chief.

93
00:06:40,367 --> 00:06:44,634
But four of the murders
took place in my jurisdiction.

94
00:06:44,671 --> 00:06:46,663
I couldn't let go.

95
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:48,937
I know.

96
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:51,511
I'll take a week off.

97
00:07:11,064 --> 00:07:14,262
Masashi: "Don't over work yourself.
Let's meet tonight."

98
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:24,711
Hello, Masashi.

99
00:07:25,345 --> 00:07:28,008
Right, right.

100
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:30,176
I just finished now.

101
00:07:31,051 --> 00:07:34,385
I'll be free from tomorrow.

102
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:35,652
Eh?

103
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:37,784
Tonight?

104
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:41,184
Alright then.

105
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:46,796
I need to go home first.

106
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:49,301
Can I see you in three hours?

107
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:06,650
Welcome.

108
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:08,678
Thank you.

109
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:17,428
Sorry I couldn't pick up the phone.

110
00:08:17,464 --> 00:08:20,764
It's fine, please sit down.

111
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,827
Wow, it looks delicious.

112
00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:26,930
I wanted to cook for you.

113
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:30,900
Wait, wait!

114
00:08:30,944 --> 00:08:33,106
Let me take a photo first!

115
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,306
A photo?

116
00:08:34,381 --> 00:08:35,679
Hold it.

117
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:39,010
- Like this?
- Right.

118
00:08:39,052 --> 00:08:41,021
Great, let's go.

119
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:43,215
3, 2, 1...

120
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:46,693
Now show the food.

121
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:48,126
- Like this?
- Great.

122
00:08:48,161 --> 00:08:50,528
Great, smile.

123
00:08:50,597 --> 00:08:53,396
Good, and next...

124
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:55,867
hold the fork and the spoon.

125
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:58,267
- What is that for?
- You're cute.

126
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:01,501
Excellent, excellent.

127
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,306
Let's go, smile.

128
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:07,445
One more, smile.

129
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:11,011
You're OK at work?

130
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:12,212
Sure.

131
00:09:12,252 --> 00:09:14,983
I heard about the wrong suspect.

132
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:17,889
Rei, you know about it, right?

133
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:19,186
Right.

134
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,421
You are investigating that case, right?

135
00:09:21,461 --> 00:09:24,295
You know I can't talk about it.

136
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,424
I promise I'll keep it secret.

137
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:27,762
No way.

138
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:29,397
That's so mean.

139
00:09:29,469 --> 00:09:31,768
Come on, how is that mean?

140
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,572
I love it when you laugh.

141
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,846
Masashi.

142
00:09:42,382 --> 00:09:46,046
It's great that you have a week off.

143
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,255
It's not that great.

144
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:51,155
- Really?
- Really.

145
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,322
A lot happened.

146
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:56,453
See...

147
00:09:56,529 --> 00:10:00,193
If you can't talk, I can't help.

148
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:03,997
You're right, forgive me.

149
00:10:04,571 --> 00:10:09,532
For me, just having you here,
makes me happy.

150
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:12,308
Masashi, you're always so kind.

151
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:20,543
I'm trying so hard and
I can't find the murderer.

152
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:22,583
What's wrong?

153
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:26,622
No, it's fine.

154
00:11:02,195 --> 00:11:04,596
You scared me.

155
00:11:04,631 --> 00:11:07,226
I missed you so much.

156
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:09,429
What can I do about it?

157
00:11:09,469 --> 00:11:11,461
I was lonely.

158
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:16,332
Masashi.

159
00:11:34,928 --> 00:11:37,329
Rei, I like you.

160
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:38,528
Rei.

161
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:47,838
Masashi.

162
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:58,602
You are so excited.

163
00:12:58,678 --> 00:13:01,113
It's been so long.

164
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:26,870
No.

165
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,376
Don't, I need to put one on first.

166
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:33,110
- Ah, right.
- Right.

167
00:13:50,897 --> 00:13:52,331
It feels good!

168
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:04,301
I'm holding back.

169
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:07,573
No.

170
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:14,085
I'm gonna come.

171
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:16,816
No, hold back a bit longer.

172
00:14:26,132 --> 00:14:28,624
- Get on top.
- I can't.

173
00:14:28,668 --> 00:14:32,002
If I do, I'm gonna come.

174
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:34,506
Do me from behind.

175
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:46,349
That feels good.

176
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:50,456
That feels good.

177
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:55,426
Masashi! Masashi!

178
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:03,834
I can't.

179
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:07,238
- I'm co...
- Hold it.

180
00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:28,353
You liked it?

181
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:30,621
Sure.

182
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:34,466
I was so excited.

183
00:15:38,738 --> 00:15:41,037
That's right!

184
00:15:42,742 --> 00:15:45,871
I have a present for you.

185
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:49,714
Really? Great, what is it?

186
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,579
Ta-daa.

187
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:58,588
- You painted me.
- Right.

188
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:02,755
I painted you from memory.
It was hard work.

189
00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:05,663
How many times did we have sex...

190
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:08,223
for you to know my body so well?

191
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:13,065
Well your body is amazing,
which made it easy.

192
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:15,836
But don't paint any other nude girl.

193
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:18,207
I wouldn't do that to you.

194
00:16:18,244 --> 00:16:21,612
But in my class, it sometimes happen.

195
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:24,913
You have nude models
in your classes?

196
00:16:24,951 --> 00:16:27,978
Sure, it's an art college.

197
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:31,320
So these girls make you horny?

198
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:33,952
What? Are you kidding me?

199
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:36,860
You're the only one for me.

200
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:47,063
But we just did it.

201
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:49,506
When I touch you...

202
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:52,374
I feel like I'm painting you.

203
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,848
Come on.

204
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:09,556
Masashi.

205
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:13,924
- I love you.
- Me too.

206
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:34,016
How long have you been watching me?

207
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,045
I just woke up.

208
00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:38,649
It's embarrassing.

209
00:17:38,691 --> 00:17:43,254
Aren't you happy that
your lover is watching you?

210
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:45,262
Well...

211
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:53,997
My younger sister is coming today.

212
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,168
- Your sister?
- Right.

213
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:58,404
Chika-chan, she's 19.

214
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:01,505
Her visit was planned long ago.

215
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:04,745
OK, I won't bother you guys.

216
00:18:04,784 --> 00:18:07,015
- I'll leave.
- Not at all.

217
00:18:07,053 --> 00:18:09,284
I want you to meet her.

218
00:18:09,355 --> 00:18:11,984
That's why I told you
to come earlier.

219
00:18:12,058 --> 00:18:13,287
Eh?

220
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:15,726
My sister is looking forward to it too.

221
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,753
You don't mind, right?

222
00:18:18,531 --> 00:18:21,126
Masashi.

223
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:31,909
What could we cook?

224
00:18:31,978 --> 00:18:33,571
I love sea food.

225
00:18:33,646 --> 00:18:34,841
Great idea.

226
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,544
What is Chika-chan's favorite food?

227
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:40,211
Let's do some shopping.

228
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:41,310
Good idea.

229
00:18:41,387 --> 00:18:44,357
I used up most my groceries yesterday.

230
00:18:47,927 --> 00:18:50,123
No more olive oil.

231
00:18:50,196 --> 00:18:51,357
How about champagne?

232
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,023
Sure, let's buy champagne.

233
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:56,331
Great, but your sister will have juice.

234
00:18:56,402 --> 00:18:59,031
Come on, she's not a kid.

235
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:03,907
Impossible, as a police
officer I can't allow that.

236
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,411
Wow, you are serious.

237
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:08,141
'Course I am.

238
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:18,249
Your lock is getting old and rusty.

239
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:19,588
Is it still OK?

240
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:21,253
Yeah, it's fine.

241
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:24,557
You better buy a new one.

242
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:27,190
I'm telling you it's fine.

243
00:19:27,233 --> 00:19:30,032
It is the duty of each citizen...

244
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:33,038
to take care of his own safety.

245
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:34,038
Get it?

246
00:19:34,073 --> 00:19:36,372
Yes, officer.

247
00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:38,935
Get this into your head.

248
00:19:46,252 --> 00:19:47,811
Don't exaggerate.

249
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,845
That time you drank so much.

250
00:19:50,723 --> 00:19:52,555
You're so strong.

251
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:55,891
- I'm not that strong.
- Stronger than me.

252
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:23,122
What?

253
00:20:23,622 --> 00:20:24,885
What is it?

254
00:20:24,924 --> 00:20:28,156
Now the lock seems broken.

255
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:31,927
What?

256
00:20:34,033 --> 00:20:35,501
It's open.

257
00:20:35,668 --> 00:20:37,933
No way.

258
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:08,833
Nothing is missing here.
Over there?

259
00:21:08,901 --> 00:21:10,369
Seems alright.

260
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:12,064
What happened?

261
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,769
It's old and worn.

262
00:21:20,846 --> 00:21:22,974
See, I told you.

263
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:26,212
I'll call the locksmith tomorrow.

264
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,618
Why postpone your safety?

265
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:31,122
I'm safe with a police officer.

266
00:21:32,324 --> 00:21:35,522
If a thief came, you'd arrest him.

267
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:38,393
The point is to have a safe home!

268
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:40,899
Are you listening to me?

269
00:22:25,911 --> 00:22:27,038
It's ready.

270
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:28,912
Amazing.

271
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:32,249
Now we're just waiting
for Chika-chan.

272
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:36,187
How about a shower before she arrives?

273
00:22:36,222 --> 00:22:37,656
Eh?

274
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:40,282
Thank you.

275
00:22:44,797 --> 00:22:46,129
Yes.

276
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:34,639
Masashi!

277
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:38,173
Oh, come on! Again?

278
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:42,618
Don't do that.

279
00:23:44,123 --> 00:23:46,354
No! No!

280
00:23:47,059 --> 00:23:48,925
Help.

281
00:24:30,703 --> 00:24:32,695
Now you're awake.

282
00:24:39,244 --> 00:24:41,304
Ah? You're surprised?

283
00:24:54,293 --> 00:24:57,229
I'll teach you something.

284
00:24:57,296 --> 00:25:00,095
Your password can be read...

285
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:05,126
from your prints on the screen.

286
00:25:06,238 --> 00:25:09,902
If you suspect him of cheating on you...

287
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:19,082
It's seems that you made an arrest today.

288
00:25:19,151 --> 00:25:22,588
Too bad he was the wrong guy, right?

289
00:25:24,656 --> 00:25:27,182
You're a scary cop.

290
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:30,093
You took him on a trip through hell.

291
00:25:32,598 --> 00:25:33,998
However...

292
00:25:42,508 --> 00:25:45,410
I can smell it on you.

293
00:25:45,444 --> 00:25:49,973
You crave sex so much that
it becomes unbearable.

294
00:25:57,423 --> 00:25:59,517
By the way...

295
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:02,858
Your sister is visiting today.

296
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:08,191
She'll be here very soon.

297
00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:12,235
You don't have to worry.

298
00:26:12,271 --> 00:26:14,536
If you do exactly as I say...

299
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:16,667
I'm not going to kill you.

300
00:26:16,708 --> 00:26:20,372
The two of you and Chika-chan.

301
00:26:25,217 --> 00:26:27,243
Hey, it seems she's here already.

302
00:26:42,868 --> 00:26:45,269
Hello, you're Chika-chan, right?

303
00:26:45,337 --> 00:26:46,999
Who are you?

304
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,474
My name is Shimizu.

305
00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:54,002
Masashi and Rei are out shopping.
They told me to welcome you.

306
00:26:54,046 --> 00:26:56,242
Please, come in.

307
00:26:56,515 --> 00:26:57,881
Alright.

308
00:27:12,231 --> 00:27:13,324
Please.

309
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:30,339
And you, Mr. Shimizu?

310
00:27:30,382 --> 00:27:33,011
I'm a friend of them both.

311
00:27:33,085 --> 00:27:35,577
- Is that right?
- Indeed.

312
00:27:35,621 --> 00:27:38,614
They said we could have a drink.

313
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,319
I can't...

314
00:27:43,395 --> 00:27:44,863
You don't drink?

315
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:47,627
I'm only 19.

316
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:50,363
You are so serious.

317
00:28:33,512 --> 00:28:35,913
How come they're so late?

318
00:28:35,981 --> 00:28:41,113
What if that Jack the Ripper
caught them?

319
00:28:42,955 --> 00:28:44,548
Oh, no.

320
00:28:44,623 --> 00:28:47,923
I heard he's been arrested.

321
00:28:47,993 --> 00:28:53,227
In fact, they arrested
the wrong person.

322
00:28:53,265 --> 00:28:55,097
Is that right?

323
00:28:56,235 --> 00:29:00,172
How come you know this,
Mr. Shimizu?

324
00:29:03,642 --> 00:29:04,905
Well you see...

325
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:08,146
your brother's girlfriend...

326
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,443
is an inspector.

327
00:29:10,015 --> 00:29:12,849
Yes, he told me.

328
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:16,616
Rei is in charge of the Jack case.

329
00:29:16,688 --> 00:29:18,680
Is that right?

330
00:29:25,697 --> 00:29:28,292
But now that she made
the wrong arrest...

331
00:29:28,367 --> 00:29:32,168
how do you think
Jack is going to react?

332
00:29:33,338 --> 00:29:34,738
I don't know.

333
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:38,310
Now he's noticed her determination...

334
00:29:38,377 --> 00:29:42,178
and how keen she is
to arrest him.

335
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:44,344
And he's intrigued.

336
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:48,013
Please, don't scare me.

337
00:29:48,053 --> 00:29:51,854
For example,
if Jack came here...

338
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:55,383
he would take them as hostages.

339
00:29:55,761 --> 00:29:57,491
That's terrible.

340
00:29:57,529 --> 00:30:01,625
What if he threatened to kill them both...

341
00:30:01,667 --> 00:30:03,727
unless you get undressed?

342
00:30:03,935 --> 00:30:05,665
What would you do?

343
00:30:05,737 --> 00:30:08,434
I'd have to completely undress?

344
00:30:08,507 --> 00:30:10,169
Yes, I guess so.

345
00:30:10,776 --> 00:30:12,301
I can't say...

346
00:30:12,344 --> 00:30:16,008
Unless it really happens,
I won't know.

347
00:30:16,081 --> 00:30:19,745
What if Jack told you to
have sex with him?

348
00:30:20,352 --> 00:30:21,615
I wouldn't!

349
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:25,090
But he'd threaten to kill
them before your eyes.

350
00:30:26,525 --> 00:30:29,689
That's horrible! How could he...

351
00:30:34,132 --> 00:30:35,691
But say...

352
00:30:36,868 --> 00:30:42,330
How come I see only
three plates on the table?

353
00:30:53,885 --> 00:30:55,649
I need to go to the bathroom.

354
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:15,560
<i>Red light, green light...</i>

355
00:32:23,575 --> 00:32:25,908
Chika-chan.

356
00:32:25,977 --> 00:32:30,278
Sorry, you don't seem
to understand who's in charge.

357
00:32:30,348 --> 00:32:33,182
I'm taking charge of her.

358
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:23,928
I can bring any woman to orgasm.

359
00:33:26,271 --> 00:33:30,106
Even though she's unconscious...

360
00:34:07,979 --> 00:34:10,915
What... What's going on?

361
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:13,350
Good morning.

362
00:34:14,686 --> 00:34:17,315
What do you want from me?

363
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:20,291
Please untie me.

364
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:22,350
I told you.

365
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:24,993
I'm Mr. Shimizu.

366
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:31,593
You should worry about those two.

367
00:34:32,671 --> 00:34:37,132
Their lives depend
on your good behavior.

368
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:39,768
How can it...

369
00:34:39,811 --> 00:34:44,340
You see, your future sister-in-law...

370
00:34:44,382 --> 00:34:49,685
If you don't want Jack to kill her,
you'll have to cooperate.

371
00:34:51,122 --> 00:34:54,854
You mean you're
the real Jack the Ripper?

372
00:34:55,327 --> 00:34:57,091
Who knows?

373
00:34:57,128 --> 00:34:59,097
I could be.

374
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:01,929
But maybe I'm not.

375
00:35:09,374 --> 00:35:10,933
What is it?

376
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:15,603
Nothing... I'm fine.

377
00:35:17,182 --> 00:35:19,549
I'm not releasing you just now.

378
00:35:19,584 --> 00:35:21,576
Is there something you need?

379
00:35:23,755 --> 00:35:25,417
Well...

380
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:29,622
I'd like to go to the bathroom.

381
00:35:30,528 --> 00:35:32,497
Is it number 2?

382
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:33,828
No, it isn't.

383
00:35:33,865 --> 00:35:35,231
Then you can't.

384
00:35:35,266 --> 00:35:37,292
But why?

385
00:35:37,369 --> 00:35:40,897
If it's number 1,
you can do it anywhere.

386
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:43,373
No, I can't do that.

387
00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:46,070
OK, suit yourself.

388
00:35:46,111 --> 00:35:48,080
Please.

389
00:35:48,113 --> 00:35:49,741
I can't hold it.

390
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:56,418
Kneel facing this storage room.

391
00:35:57,255 --> 00:35:59,724
But I can't do that.

392
00:35:59,791 --> 00:36:01,783
Their lives are in the balance.

393
00:36:03,294 --> 00:36:06,230
Come on, don't be like that.

394
00:36:06,297 --> 00:36:09,563
Makes no difference
if you pee there.

395
00:36:09,601 --> 00:36:11,092
Let me go.

396
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,265
No.

397
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:26,548
No, don't.

398
00:36:27,952 --> 00:36:29,352
Don't do that.

399
00:36:37,829 --> 00:36:39,593
What's wrong?

400
00:36:41,132 --> 00:36:42,794
I can't.

401
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:44,165
Why?

402
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:49,564
I can't pee like that.

403
00:36:50,842 --> 00:36:53,835
Alright, alright, I'll help.

404
00:37:16,868 --> 00:37:19,167
Please don't do that.

405
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:26,373
No, don't!

406
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:28,380
Don't do that.

407
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:56,072
What? You came?

408
00:37:57,942 --> 00:38:01,140
You came while
I was drinking your pee?

409
00:38:01,179 --> 00:38:03,444
That's perverted as hell.

410
00:38:03,481 --> 00:38:05,006
I'm not like that.

411
00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:07,041
How are you, then?

412
00:38:10,889 --> 00:38:12,517
What?

413
00:38:13,858 --> 00:38:15,793
It's my turn now.

414
00:38:16,494 --> 00:38:17,792
No way.

415
00:38:22,367 --> 00:38:24,029
Don't do that.

416
00:38:28,339 --> 00:38:30,308
Don't let me feel your teeth.

417
00:38:30,375 --> 00:38:32,435
If you try anything...

418
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:35,480
I'll cut off your brother's dick.

419
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:56,461
Don't forget to clean up
the floor after wards.

420
00:39:38,343 --> 00:39:41,245
Alright, time to eat.

421
00:39:42,814 --> 00:39:46,945
Which of you prepared
yesterday's meal?

422
00:39:47,018 --> 00:39:48,543
Huh?

423
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:54,191
I knew it.

424
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:58,219
It had to be the cooking of a man...

425
00:39:58,296 --> 00:40:01,630
trying to impress his girlfriend.

426
00:40:03,201 --> 00:40:07,332
But you just dulled the
taste of the ingredients.

427
00:40:07,372 --> 00:40:13,039
You destroyed the
vitamins and nutrients.

428
00:40:27,659 --> 00:40:29,753
Food and women are the same.

429
00:40:29,827 --> 00:40:34,265
You have to learn
to express their excellence.

430
00:40:35,233 --> 00:40:38,931
You compare cooking to raping women?

431
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:42,839
Rape is a way to reveal
women's deeper desires.

432
00:40:42,907 --> 00:40:45,604
What you do is unforgivable.

433
00:40:45,643 --> 00:40:49,478
What you did to food and
to this female inspector.

434
00:40:49,547 --> 00:40:51,516
What do you know?

435
00:40:51,549 --> 00:40:53,142
We'll see.

436
00:40:53,217 --> 00:40:57,120
There's just one thing you need to know...

437
00:40:57,155 --> 00:41:01,786
You use way too much olive oil.

438
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,467
What? You're not eating?

439
00:41:53,845 --> 00:41:56,212
Obviously we're handcuffed.

440
00:41:56,247 --> 00:41:58,239
You'll find a way.

441
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:19,132
Rei!

442
00:42:20,605 --> 00:42:23,165
We need to keep our strength.

443
00:42:25,943 --> 00:42:27,275
Alright.

444
00:42:27,311 --> 00:42:30,577
Let's have our dessert.

445
00:42:31,449 --> 00:42:32,439
No!

446
00:42:32,483 --> 00:42:33,746
What are you doing?

447
00:42:33,818 --> 00:42:37,084
You can do whateveryou want to me.

448
00:42:37,155 --> 00:42:38,851
Leave Chika-chan alone.

449
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:44,124
Forgive me, for now
I'd rather do her than you.

450
00:43:10,621 --> 00:43:11,987
Don't do that.

451
00:43:12,123 --> 00:43:13,455
Leave me alone.

452
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:23,532
Leave me alone.

453
00:43:26,671 --> 00:43:28,936
Do you like it that much?

454
00:43:31,409 --> 00:43:34,641
The sister of an artist.

455
00:43:34,979 --> 00:43:38,040
You're so sensitive to brushes.

456
00:43:39,117 --> 00:43:41,586
Stop! Stop doing this!

457
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:44,282
Stop right now!

458
00:43:44,355 --> 00:43:46,950
Don't add this to your crimes!

459
00:44:09,013 --> 00:44:11,482
How about I star t by killing him?

460
00:44:11,516 --> 00:44:13,109
I'll kill him with my fists.

461
00:44:13,251 --> 00:44:16,016
Stop it! Stop it!

462
00:44:16,888 --> 00:44:18,516
I get it.

463
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:22,926
It's OK.

464
00:44:23,261 --> 00:44:25,127
You can have me.

465
00:44:25,363 --> 00:44:29,391
You can do whateveryou want to me,
just stop hitting my brother!

466
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:37,865
You have a great sister.

467
00:44:43,814 --> 00:44:45,544
Tell me...

468
00:44:46,083 --> 00:44:49,110
Are you only trying
to save your brother...

469
00:44:50,154 --> 00:44:54,421
or you want me to tame you?

470
00:44:54,559 --> 00:44:56,460
What?

471
00:44:56,994 --> 00:44:59,657
You liked what I did to you yesterday.

472
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:07,131
How many boyfriends did you have?

473
00:45:08,005 --> 00:45:09,530
Just one.

474
00:45:10,174 --> 00:45:13,941
And he didn't manage to satisfy you.

475
00:45:14,812 --> 00:45:16,974
You don't get it.

476
00:45:17,048 --> 00:45:19,677
We loved each other.

477
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:22,312
Maybe so...

478
00:45:22,353 --> 00:45:27,519
But you wanted something
more rough.

479
00:45:28,292 --> 00:45:33,321
I thought about asking him.

480
00:45:33,664 --> 00:45:38,159
And so, you want something wilder.

481
00:45:39,036 --> 00:45:42,495
You want frantic sex.

482
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:45,503
Didn't you think about it?

483
00:45:56,821 --> 00:45:59,757
You desire this.

484
00:46:03,894 --> 00:46:06,420
Tell me you don't like it.

485
00:46:08,299 --> 00:46:11,428
Let me brush it all over.

486
00:46:11,502 --> 00:46:15,234
You desire it inside you.

487
00:46:15,273 --> 00:46:17,174
No way...

488
00:46:18,509 --> 00:46:20,375
Let go.

489
00:46:20,845 --> 00:46:23,041
Tell me to touch you more.

490
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:25,640
Tell me to fuck you
like an animal.

491
00:46:28,419 --> 00:46:29,887
Say it!

492
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:34,683
Touch me more.

493
00:46:35,226 --> 00:46:37,661
Fuck me like an animal.

494
00:46:38,362 --> 00:46:39,853
I will.

495
00:46:55,446 --> 00:46:58,541
Are you that sensitive?

496
00:47:02,453 --> 00:47:04,945
Let me get a good look.

497
00:47:17,034 --> 00:47:19,936
Amazing, how wet you are.

498
00:47:21,339 --> 00:47:24,707
I can soak that brush with it.

499
00:47:27,278 --> 00:47:28,610
No, don't.

500
00:48:02,213 --> 00:48:04,307
Why are you holding back?

501
00:48:04,348 --> 00:48:06,146
You're obviously loving it.

502
00:48:14,058 --> 00:48:15,856
I'll come in you.

503
00:48:16,627 --> 00:48:19,722
Brother, it hurts.

504
00:48:26,170 --> 00:48:28,503
It hurts! It hurts!

505
00:48:50,394 --> 00:48:53,023
Do you know the day-after pill?

506
00:48:54,832 --> 00:48:57,097
Don't worry.

507
00:48:57,168 --> 00:49:00,935
After we've had our fun, you can
get back to your regular life.

508
00:49:26,764 --> 00:49:28,130
Oh?

509
00:49:30,935 --> 00:49:33,905
I have detained a number
of couples...

510
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:36,600
but it's the first time I see this.

511
00:49:37,274 --> 00:49:39,106
The first time?

512
00:49:39,543 --> 00:49:44,948
People talk about sharing
but no one cares about the others.

513
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:50,785
That's a famous allegory
about heaven and hell.

514
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:53,882
And you showed it to me today.

515
00:50:05,369 --> 00:50:10,364
From today onwards, your
main task will be to have sex.

516
00:50:11,075 --> 00:50:12,600
What are you saying?

517
00:50:12,643 --> 00:50:16,637
You'll have sex to entertain me.

518
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,308
You're kidding.

519
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:20,716
You can refuse if you want.

520
00:50:20,784 --> 00:50:26,951
If you do it you'll be granted
food, a toilet and a shower.

521
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:29,789
If you don't, you'll have nothing.

522
00:50:29,894 --> 00:50:31,123
No way...

523
00:50:31,228 --> 00:50:33,823
Alright, let's star t right away.

524
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:35,992
You'll be rewarded with lunch.

525
00:50:36,066 --> 00:50:39,264
We're not going to do it in front of you.

526
00:50:39,336 --> 00:50:43,899
And I just told you
you're free to refuse.

527
00:50:46,443 --> 00:50:49,936
You still don't understand
who's in charge here.

528
00:50:54,685 --> 00:50:56,677
- Brother.
- Chika.

529
00:50:57,755 --> 00:51:01,123
Masashi, we'll have to do it.

530
00:51:01,191 --> 00:51:02,659
Rei.

531
00:52:00,818 --> 00:52:03,947
Do the same as the female inspector.

532
00:54:21,759 --> 00:54:24,024
Brother...

533
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:26,620
Brother, I'm coming.

534
00:54:26,697 --> 00:54:29,690
No, no, Chika-chan.

535
00:54:29,767 --> 00:54:31,133
I'm coming.

536
00:55:03,534 --> 00:55:05,196
Masashi.

537
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,386
You see...

538
00:55:26,690 --> 00:55:31,594
Acrylic paint contains
poisonous substances.

539
00:55:31,662 --> 00:55:36,100
Molecules synthesized from chromium.

540
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:42,295
When you apply it to the skin...

541
00:55:42,372 --> 00:55:45,103
there is a certain sense of danger...

542
00:55:45,142 --> 00:55:49,102
that enhances the sexual tension.

543
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:09,529
Look, as an artist,
don't you find this beautiful?

544
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:13,761
Huh?

545
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:33,957
What do you think
of this thrilling day?

546
00:56:34,024 --> 00:56:35,959
If that's how you pass the time.

547
00:56:36,026 --> 00:56:39,861
Wouldn't you like to have
sex with the paint on?

548
00:56:39,997 --> 00:56:41,863
Really?

549
00:56:41,932 --> 00:56:46,131
If you agree to it,
I'll let you have a shower.

550
00:56:48,538 --> 00:56:52,236
However, before that...

551
00:56:56,914 --> 00:56:59,247
Let's rock 'n roll!

552
00:57:00,017 --> 00:57:01,508
Come on, guys!

553
00:57:01,585 --> 00:57:03,486
Dance! Dance!

554
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:05,716
Get in the mood!

555
00:57:05,789 --> 00:57:07,781
Dance! Dance!

556
00:57:14,998 --> 00:57:18,332
Doesn't it feel good?

557
00:57:18,368 --> 00:57:21,133
Get in the mood!

558
00:57:28,578 --> 00:57:30,570
It feels great!

559
00:57:30,847 --> 00:57:34,147
It feel so great to dance naked!

560
00:57:36,687 --> 00:57:38,815
Let's go crazy!

561
00:57:43,093 --> 00:57:47,554
Play along, we'll seize
a chance to escape.

562
00:57:50,067 --> 00:57:52,366
Let's rock 'n roll!

563
00:58:46,923 --> 00:58:49,586
Don't try anything.

564
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:05,607
Soon your secret will come out.

565
00:59:05,642 --> 00:59:07,338
What secret?

566
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:10,541
Between you and your brother.

567
00:59:10,614 --> 00:59:13,778
What secret are you talking about?

568
00:59:13,817 --> 00:59:16,912
When you had sex with me...

569
00:59:16,953 --> 00:59:21,186
you called me 'brother' several times.

570
00:59:22,526 --> 00:59:23,585
That is...

571
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:27,119
Did you guys do it?

572
00:59:27,664 --> 00:59:29,030
We didn't.

573
00:59:29,066 --> 00:59:31,058
So what is it?

574
00:59:33,370 --> 00:59:35,305
Tell me.

575
00:59:41,478 --> 00:59:46,212
We are not really siblings.

576
00:59:46,650 --> 00:59:48,209
Oh?

577
00:59:48,952 --> 00:59:51,444
When Masashi was a baby...

578
00:59:51,488 --> 00:59:55,186
his dad remarried with my mom.

579
00:59:56,593 --> 01:00:01,122
But soon he went
and left Masashi with her.

580
01:00:01,198 --> 01:00:06,296
She then remarried with
my dad and they had me.

581
01:00:06,369 --> 01:00:11,103
You mean that you and Masashi...

582
01:00:12,042 --> 01:00:16,377
We're not even blood related.

583
01:01:01,324 --> 01:01:02,257
Don't!

584
01:01:10,066 --> 01:01:11,364
You're interested?

585
01:01:22,779 --> 01:01:24,543
It's big, huh?

586
01:01:25,115 --> 01:01:26,743
You can touch it.

587
01:01:40,864 --> 01:01:45,302
If you continue to stroke it,
it'll feel good.

588
01:02:07,624 --> 01:02:09,650
Sorry I came on you.

589
01:02:19,936 --> 01:02:21,905
Don't you girls...

590
01:02:21,972 --> 01:02:25,431
have a place that feels good too?

591
01:02:27,978 --> 01:02:30,277
Let me see.

592
01:02:41,958 --> 01:02:44,325
But you have nothing there.

593
01:03:08,918 --> 01:03:11,911
Do you like that?

594
01:03:11,988 --> 01:03:13,115
Yes.

595
01:03:18,128 --> 01:03:19,756
I'm back.

596
01:03:21,598 --> 01:03:23,260
Masashi.

597
01:03:24,267 --> 01:03:25,394
Ah.

598
01:03:33,143 --> 01:03:35,874
Even if you're not related by blood...

599
01:03:35,945 --> 01:03:38,676
you are Chika-chan's big brother.

600
01:03:38,748 --> 01:03:40,182
Right.

601
01:03:40,216 --> 01:03:42,185
I can't allow that.

602
01:03:42,218 --> 01:03:44,278
You get it?

603
01:03:44,321 --> 01:03:46,313
But...

604
01:03:56,466 --> 01:03:59,095
It's OK, Mommy will take
care of you.

605
01:03:59,135 --> 01:04:02,230
But don't touch Chika-chan ever again.

606
01:04:02,272 --> 01:04:04,264
You get it?

607
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:06,542
Mom.

608
01:04:09,279 --> 01:04:10,372
Mom.

609
01:04:14,451 --> 01:04:17,114
And from then on...

610
01:04:17,187 --> 01:04:20,885
Mom was always taking care of Masashi.

611
01:04:21,858 --> 01:04:26,489
And he never touched me again.

612
01:04:27,997 --> 01:04:29,260
I see.

613
01:04:30,533 --> 01:04:34,095
I was always there...

614
01:04:34,137 --> 01:04:37,437
lurking behind the door...

615
01:04:37,507 --> 01:04:39,635
watching them doing it.

616
01:04:41,144 --> 01:04:44,046
I couldn't stand it.

617
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:47,209
I was caressing myself.

618
01:04:48,418 --> 01:04:52,651
Because I... because I...

619
01:04:55,458 --> 01:04:57,450
Alright, I get it.

620
01:04:59,629 --> 01:05:03,122
I'm going to free you
from that frustration.

621
01:05:16,679 --> 01:05:17,669
What?

622
01:05:17,714 --> 01:05:20,411
You're going to have
sex with your sister.

623
01:05:20,450 --> 01:05:24,683
If you do that,
I'll let you guys go.

624
01:05:24,721 --> 01:05:26,087
No way.

625
01:05:30,693 --> 01:05:33,185
It's now or never.

626
01:05:33,229 --> 01:05:35,994
You may think that
I'm an aggressor...

627
01:05:36,065 --> 01:05:38,296
But all the things I do...

628
01:05:38,334 --> 01:05:40,860
I do them for a purpose.

629
01:06:54,344 --> 01:06:57,644
That's it! That's good.

630
01:07:02,752 --> 01:07:04,482
What are you doing?

631
01:07:25,942 --> 01:07:27,137
What is this?

632
01:07:29,445 --> 01:07:32,279
I'll take her in exchange.

633
01:07:32,448 --> 01:07:34,076
Stop it!

634
01:07:36,419 --> 01:07:39,287
You thought he could love you...

635
01:07:39,355 --> 01:07:43,417
but 5 years ago he gave
her his heart.

636
01:07:43,493 --> 01:07:44,984
Let him go.

637
01:07:46,863 --> 01:07:48,331
Masashi!

638
01:07:58,608 --> 01:08:01,203
There's nothing to cry about.

639
01:08:01,277 --> 01:08:05,874
I will free your wilder senses.

640
01:08:10,820 --> 01:08:12,379
No, don't.

641
01:08:15,992 --> 01:08:20,327
You'll be able to sense
how horny a man is.

642
01:09:57,827 --> 01:10:01,491
As I said, call my lawyer.

643
01:10:01,531 --> 01:10:05,366
I'm talking only to my lawyer.

644
01:10:09,839 --> 01:10:11,740
Alright.

645
01:10:13,376 --> 01:10:14,503
Then...

646
01:10:16,245 --> 01:10:19,238
The way you raped that girl...

647
01:10:19,749 --> 01:10:21,741
Let's re-enact it.

648
01:10:21,818 --> 01:10:23,309
Eh?

649
01:10:29,125 --> 01:10:32,618
Excuse me, Inspector Hayama.

650
01:10:36,666 --> 01:10:43,197
I can smell it on you.
How much you want me...

651
01:10:44,407 --> 01:10:48,503
Alright, I'll give you a little help.

652
01:10:48,578 --> 01:10:54,882
You are going to assault me.

653
01:10:54,917 --> 01:10:57,580
What are you doing?

654
01:11:00,022 --> 01:11:01,650
Sir? Hey?

655
01:11:06,362 --> 01:11:08,797
Back up! We need back up!

656
01:11:08,865 --> 01:11:10,026
Stop!

657
01:11:11,567 --> 01:11:12,762
Bastard!

658
01:11:15,638 --> 01:11:17,231
Cuff him!

659
01:11:48,371 --> 01:11:50,306
Have you been a good boy?

660
01:11:52,308 --> 01:11:53,674
Come on.

661
01:11:53,976 --> 01:11:55,444
Rei!

662
01:11:55,778 --> 01:11:58,407
I'm begging you!

663
01:11:58,481 --> 01:12:00,074
Stop already!

664
01:12:01,250 --> 01:12:02,718
Rei!

665
01:12:06,889 --> 01:12:13,159
Yes, I turned crazy...
because of that man.
