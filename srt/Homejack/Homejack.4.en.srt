1
00:00:00,467 --> 00:00:03,130
Excellent, that's really cute.

2
00:00:03,203 --> 00:00:05,138
Excellent, keep it up.

3
00:00:05,205 --> 00:00:06,366
So perfect.

4
00:00:06,473 --> 00:00:09,341
Next, with your legs on the couch.

5
00:00:10,143 --> 00:00:13,511
That's it, that's it, so pretty.

6
00:00:14,047 --> 00:00:15,379
Yesss.

7
00:00:15,582 --> 00:00:18,484
Yes, that's it.

8
00:00:18,552 --> 00:00:21,954
Ah, great, beautiful.

9
00:00:22,556 --> 00:00:23,956
Very sexy.

10
00:00:31,665 --> 00:00:33,327
Great meal.

11
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:35,359
Thank you sir.

12
00:00:47,614 --> 00:00:49,845
Thank you sir.

13
00:00:55,222 --> 00:00:58,886
Please go buy eggs.

14
00:00:59,092 --> 00:01:00,424
Yes, Ma'am.

15
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:40,162
Who is it?

16
00:01:40,734 --> 00:01:44,364
Ah, wrong number.

17
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:47,101
Don't lie, it's your ex, right?

18
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,541
What? Are you jealous?

19
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:51,704
Why would I be?

20
00:01:54,181 --> 00:01:56,810
You know that I'm done with her.

21
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:00,810
But you're still married.

22
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:04,221
It's only tedious paperwork now.

23
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:08,423
Let me help you forget your troubles.

24
00:02:20,907 --> 00:02:22,842
Hold me tight.

25
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:24,172
Be careful.

26
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:25,372
Oops, I tripped.

27
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:27,572
- Are you OK?
- It's dangerous.

28
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:28,775
Be careful.

29
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,807
Don't, not now.

30
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:37,481
I'll be fine.

31
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,123
That was scary.

32
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:42,128
Hey, what are you doing?

33
00:02:42,195 --> 00:02:44,027
Just wait, wait.

34
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:45,224
Wait.

35
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:08,679
- Wait a minute.
- What is it?

36
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:18,390
This one seems even
stronger than the other.

37
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:20,093
It's really potent.

38
00:03:23,804 --> 00:03:25,170
What is it?

39
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:27,571
You're taking vitamins for me?

40
00:03:28,742 --> 00:03:31,075
Nope, I'm not.

41
00:03:31,111 --> 00:03:33,740
Come on, you can tell me.

42
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,614
Hey, can you feel it?

43
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,142
Wow, that's awesome!

44
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:42,018
It's already so hard.

45
00:03:42,089 --> 00:03:43,216
You see?

46
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,282
Awesome.

47
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:07,804
You're so strong.

48
00:04:07,848 --> 00:04:09,840
I'm scared.

49
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,662
No, don't.

50
00:04:43,884 --> 00:04:46,285
Let me help you with that.

51
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:15,005
Today we'll do the "sushi roll".

52
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:17,482
What? The "sushi roll"?

53
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:18,951
What is that?

54
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:21,113
Eh? Eh? What is that?

55
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:24,056
No! Hey! Hey!

56
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:26,059
I'm not a sushi roll.

57
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:29,585
There, there.

58
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:31,393
What are you doing?

59
00:05:32,132 --> 00:05:35,227
What? You're scaring me.

60
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:38,238
What is this?

61
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:40,638
What do you want?

62
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:42,370
Wait a minute.

63
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:43,934
I hate that.

64
00:05:49,783 --> 00:05:51,046
Come on.

65
00:05:55,422 --> 00:05:57,118
Beware, it's hard.

66
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:00,957
Ouch.

67
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:04,425
No, don't!

68
00:06:06,633 --> 00:06:10,502
No, wait! You can't do that!

69
00:06:15,609 --> 00:06:16,872
Please, stop.

70
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:21,842
Isn't this wonderful?

71
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:26,718
Yes, it's really good.

72
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:30,484
Wonderful! It's wonderful.

73
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:37,061
Did you do that to your wife?

74
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:39,156
Of course not!

75
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:43,932
She hates surprises, she'd get upset.

76
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:46,963
And now we sleep in separate beds.

77
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:50,375
Eh? In separate beds?

78
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:53,242
She kicked me out because of you.

79
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:57,616
Eh? She's scary.

80
00:06:57,684 --> 00:07:00,381
That's when she became independent...

81
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:04,084
and opened her own café.

82
00:07:04,124 --> 00:07:07,322
I think it's working well.

83
00:07:07,394 --> 00:07:10,125
So she's independent financially.

84
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:12,222
Right.

85
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:15,364
What's this?

86
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:19,533
It's so late already.

87
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:21,165
Who is it?

88
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:23,574
My friend working at Max Magazine.

89
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:28,412
He's even dating my ex.

90
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:31,349
Sorry, I have an appointment.

91
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:34,445
But it could be over in an hour.

92
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:36,854
Sorry, I have to go.

93
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:38,688
And we had a great time.

94
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,055
Indeed.

95
00:07:50,437 --> 00:07:52,770
- Hey.
- Hey.

96
00:07:54,174 --> 00:07:56,268
Right on time.

97
00:07:56,343 --> 00:07:57,811
You have a guest?

98
00:07:57,844 --> 00:08:00,814
We were doing a shooting.

99
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,748
You bet, a "shooting".

100
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,883
My model, Ms. Mika.

101
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:14,258
This is Mr. Mikasa from Max Magazine.

102
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:17,628
- Hi, I'm Mr. Mikasa.
- Hi, I'm Ms. Mika.

103
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:19,632
She poses in magazines.

104
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:21,895
She's 26...

105
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:25,427
and a generous G-size cup.

106
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:29,442
- Have a look.
- Give me a break!

107
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:32,377
Pleased to meet you.

108
00:08:32,412 --> 00:08:34,210
Pleased to...

109
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:36,580
What was that about?

110
00:08:40,153 --> 00:08:41,416
See ya.

111
00:08:41,488 --> 00:08:43,684
You took your phone I hope.

112
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,622
You're dating?

113
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:52,291
We've just met twice.

114
00:08:52,332 --> 00:08:54,892
Don't tell Rieko.

115
00:08:54,968 --> 00:08:58,336
The first time she forgot her phone.

116
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:01,341
So she had a good excuse to come back.

117
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,275
The usual trick.

118
00:09:03,343 --> 00:09:06,040
Rieko was upset
you were not picking up.

119
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:10,447
You're going to marry her,
so what does she care about me?

120
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:17,583
Hey you signed the divorce form.

121
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:20,252
But Rieko has to come pick up her stuff.

122
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:22,558
She must come in person.

123
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:24,921
Right.

124
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:28,025
I'll come with her on Sunday.

125
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:31,038
That's why she called you.

126
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:33,438
What time is good?

127
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:36,704
Well, right after 12.

128
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:38,871
OK, let's make it 1 o'clock.

129
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:42,610
You have peculiar tastes.

130
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:46,416
Marrying such a woman.

131
00:09:46,486 --> 00:09:48,887
But you did marry her.

132
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:51,153
That's why I can advise you.

133
00:09:51,224 --> 00:09:53,056
Thanks, I'll pass.

134
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:58,122
Did you do the 'play' with her?

135
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,823
What 'play' is that?

136
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:03,063
Come on, I told you...

137
00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:08,234
She likes it when you pour
lemon juice on her and lick her.

138
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:11,108
But she didn't ask for it.

139
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:16,878
So you don't like this 'lemon play'?

140
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,885
It's not like that.

141
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:22,821
But since she didn't ask for it...

142
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:26,951
If you don't spice it up,
she'll resent you.

143
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:28,654
She hates dull sex.

144
00:10:28,695 --> 00:10:32,598
We don't need you to worry, thanks.

145
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:36,899
A lemon would spice up
your dull sex life.

146
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,438
Enough with that!

147
00:10:38,505 --> 00:10:41,373
Sorry, let's get to work.

148
00:10:41,441 --> 00:10:43,034
Right.

149
00:10:52,552 --> 00:10:54,145
Welcome.

150
00:11:16,543 --> 00:11:18,444
Would you like to order?

151
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:22,380
A 'morning set' with an American coffee.

152
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:26,648
Sorry, the morning set
is only available until 11.

153
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:31,488
Just an American coffee
will do, then.

154
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:35,962
Could I see the owner?

155
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:39,522
Yes, I'll call her.

156
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:46,605
There's a customer asking for you.

157
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:56,272
Hello, what can I do for you?

158
00:11:56,349 --> 00:11:58,944
It's a great café.

159
00:11:58,985 --> 00:12:01,079
I like the simplicity.

160
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,679
That's very kind.

161
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,588
Do you live near here?

162
00:12:04,624 --> 00:12:08,061
No, a photographer recommended
your place.

163
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:10,062
A photographer?

164
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:12,997
He's taking such good care of me...

165
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:15,331
any way he can.

166
00:12:15,602 --> 00:12:16,900
I see.

167
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,165
He's such a good lover too.

168
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,506
I love his "sushi roll"...

169
00:12:23,543 --> 00:12:25,512
It's so exciting.

170
00:12:25,545 --> 00:12:27,411
Sushi roll?

171
00:12:27,447 --> 00:12:34,354
Since he's 'sado' and I'm 'maso',
we have a good body chemistry.

172
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,049
Are you two dating?

173
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:42,893
Dating? I would rather call it
'sensual dating'.

174
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:47,831
But still I'm wondering...

175
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,597
I wouldn't mind going steady
with him.

176
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:52,229
I see.

177
00:12:52,305 --> 00:12:54,934
That's how it is.

178
00:12:56,676 --> 00:12:59,373
Here is your coffee.

179
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:23,961
It was a pleasure.

180
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:54,695
I thought she'd called you to complain.

181
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:56,827
"Call the owner" she said.

182
00:13:56,903 --> 00:13:58,838
She's my ex's lover.

183
00:13:58,905 --> 00:14:01,340
What? No way.

184
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:03,734
Sorry.

185
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,944
I'll get back to work.

186
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:13,010
I should be the one complaining.

187
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:23,360
Thank you, sir.

188
00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:31,929
Thank you, sir.

189
00:15:22,822 --> 00:15:27,317
But you said you liked me.

190
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:31,797
People often say that
in the heat of the moment.

191
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:33,958
But we just had sex?

192
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,969
Each of us profits.

193
00:15:36,002 --> 00:15:38,767
We scratch each other's back.

194
00:15:38,838 --> 00:15:42,832
But I'm not that kind of woman.

195
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:45,106
Look, someone's coming soon.

196
00:15:45,178 --> 00:15:47,545
A woman is coming?

197
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,173
Someone you don't know.

198
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:50,682
Is she a model too?

199
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:55,416
I'm sure you want to fuck her.

200
00:15:56,222 --> 00:16:00,159
Look, in Max Magazine.

201
00:16:01,761 --> 00:16:04,959
I took those photos.

202
00:16:05,031 --> 00:16:08,832
Isn't that great, I could help you too.

203
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:11,166
Each of us profits.

204
00:16:12,605 --> 00:16:15,837
She's cuter than me.

205
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:17,934
Hey, wait.

206
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:22,381
Hey, look, women have been killed.

207
00:16:22,415 --> 00:16:26,352
He's killing again. It's scary.

208
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:31,050
He could hide anywhere. Be careful.

209
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:40,397
Hey, are you having a photo-shoot?

210
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:41,934
Rika.

211
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:46,598
I forgot something, here it is.

212
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,573
You forgot something again.

213
00:16:48,608 --> 00:16:50,509
How did you get in?

214
00:16:50,543 --> 00:16:52,876
You gave me a spare key.

215
00:16:52,979 --> 00:16:54,208
I didn't.

216
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:57,374
- Sure you did.
- You took it.

217
00:16:58,651 --> 00:17:02,611
What's your relationship with him?

218
00:17:03,923 --> 00:17:07,451
What? What is so funny?

219
00:17:07,927 --> 00:17:09,589
You should know...

220
00:17:09,629 --> 00:17:12,531
girls like you are real easy to come by.

221
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:14,624
Don't make a scene.

222
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,134
You'd lose your job.

223
00:17:16,302 --> 00:17:17,497
Please stop that.

224
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:19,505
You'd better tread carefully.

225
00:17:19,572 --> 00:17:22,007
I rarely come anyway.

226
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,509
Mr. Kamota tricked me.

227
00:17:23,576 --> 00:17:26,671
After all I did, I'm suing you.

228
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,681
Come on, you can't...

229
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,273
Do as you wish.

230
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:31,715
Hey.

231
00:17:31,751 --> 00:17:35,813
A poor girl like you?
No judge would listen.

232
00:17:35,855 --> 00:17:39,986
You'd better go hide
and lick your wounds.

233
00:17:40,026 --> 00:17:42,586
You'd get more than you
can handle in a fight.

234
00:17:42,662 --> 00:17:44,290
What are you saying?

235
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:46,856
Why did you say that?

236
00:17:48,968 --> 00:17:52,029
I wish that Jack the Ripper
kills you all.

237
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:54,096
Ayumi!

238
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:04,535
What are you doing?

239
00:19:04,577 --> 00:19:08,639
Don't tell me that you
are apologizing to her.

240
00:19:08,681 --> 00:19:10,650
'Course I am.

241
00:19:10,683 --> 00:19:15,018
Eh? I didn't peg you as considerate.

242
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:19,081
Lately girls easily sue us.

243
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,992
Because the Olympics are coming.

244
00:19:22,028 --> 00:19:26,966
They think raising hell is funny.

245
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:31,869
What does that have
to do with the Olympics.

246
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:37,069
I'm looking forward
to the end of that commotion.

247
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,238
Done.

248
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:45,780
So you told her I am the monster?

249
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,513
Oh, come on.

250
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:51,523
Will you do that every time
you see me with someone?

251
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:56,918
Maybe then you'd
stop flirting around.

252
00:19:56,962 --> 00:19:58,931
Mr. Kamota.

253
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:04,130
You're scary.
We are not a steady couple.

254
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:07,538
We could be.

255
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:11,167
But I'd embarrass you.

256
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:14,669
Because you're so cute.

257
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:23,120
Tell me, was forgetting your
purse an excuse?

258
00:20:27,493 --> 00:20:29,792
What if it was?

259
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:40,101
Your vitamins.

260
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:42,141
I had some earlier.

261
00:20:42,775 --> 00:20:45,904
So you had sex already.

262
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:52,381
You know you and me
is just about sex.

263
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:53,942
Eh?

264
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,756
They are so soft.

265
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,268
Hey, easy.

266
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:14,970
And then...

267
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:17,373
your round butt.

268
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:21,710
Come on, what are you saying?

269
00:21:21,881 --> 00:21:24,976
Hey, what is it going to be today?

270
00:21:26,418 --> 00:21:28,387
Kitchen sex.

271
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:29,319
Eh?

272
00:21:29,355 --> 00:21:31,688
What is it?

273
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:33,453
Give me your hands.

274
00:21:33,492 --> 00:21:35,688
What is that for?

275
00:21:35,761 --> 00:21:38,697
You seem to be an expert at this.

276
00:21:38,731 --> 00:21:40,222
I am not.

277
00:21:40,266 --> 00:21:44,829
Come on, I don't believe you.

278
00:21:52,444 --> 00:21:55,881
This way, Ms. Rika is well tied.

279
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:58,178
- Get on the table.
- Eh?

280
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:00,185
- Climb up there?
- Yeah.

281
00:22:00,219 --> 00:22:03,553
- Is it safe?
- You'll be fine.

282
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:08,391
Hey, it doesn't look safe.

283
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:12,029
Hey.

284
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:25,009
Hey, wait.

285
00:22:28,981 --> 00:22:29,812
What's this?

286
00:22:29,882 --> 00:22:31,282
Wait.

287
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:37,612
Hey, what? I can't see anything.

288
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:41,350
Oh, no.

289
00:23:11,657 --> 00:23:13,125
No.

290
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,022
Alright.

291
00:23:17,162 --> 00:23:20,394
You're even more excited than last time.

292
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:25,034
Are you gonna be rough again?

293
00:23:25,104 --> 00:23:27,266
Oh, you don't like that?

294
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,880
Good!

295
00:23:37,449 --> 00:23:39,281
I'm coming.

296
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:41,286
I'm coming now.

297
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:44,290
Don't you dare come.

298
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:46,816
Oh, wait.

299
00:24:22,695 --> 00:24:24,561
Wow.

300
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:27,622
You're so hot inside.

301
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:30,693
Hey, you're tightening.

302
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:33,971
That's because...

303
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:36,406
I really like it.

304
00:24:36,442 --> 00:24:40,072
See how you like it?

305
00:24:40,446 --> 00:24:42,278
And for you?

306
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:45,276
It's amazing.

307
00:24:59,732 --> 00:25:01,223
Alright.

308
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:12,570
Very good.

309
00:25:12,644 --> 00:25:15,170
You are so tight.

310
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:17,206
I'm so glad...

311
00:25:17,282 --> 00:25:21,242
but you just did it
with that girl, right?

312
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:24,482
No, I didn't.

313
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:30,587
You did this with your ex?

314
00:25:30,662 --> 00:25:32,324
I didn't.

315
00:25:32,398 --> 00:25:33,832
I told you before...

316
00:25:33,899 --> 00:25:37,768
she was laying there
like a stranded whale.

317
00:25:39,805 --> 00:25:42,104
I saw your wife.

318
00:25:42,141 --> 00:25:44,610
What? You know her?

319
00:25:45,077 --> 00:25:47,478
I went to see her today.

320
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:50,445
Eh? Why?

321
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:53,145
I went to her café.

322
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:55,153
What are you saying?

323
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:58,054
I told her sex was great with you.

324
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:00,059
She turned green.

325
00:26:00,092 --> 00:26:02,721
What?

326
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:07,192
Ah, is that right?

327
00:26:10,536 --> 00:26:12,402
- Eh?
- What?

328
00:26:12,471 --> 00:26:15,236
What's happening there?

329
00:26:15,274 --> 00:26:18,301
- Wait a minute.
- Eh?

330
00:26:18,644 --> 00:26:21,307
- Wait a minute.
- What is it?

331
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:23,679
Are you finished?

332
00:26:24,483 --> 00:26:26,714
Hey, where are you going?

333
00:26:26,752 --> 00:26:29,415
Ah, well, wait a minute.

334
00:26:29,455 --> 00:26:31,253
Who are you?

335
00:26:35,861 --> 00:26:37,659
Mr. Kamota.

336
00:26:37,729 --> 00:26:39,925
What's going on?

337
00:26:39,998 --> 00:26:41,990
Hey?

338
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:47,202
Mr. Kamota, what's going on?

339
00:26:52,578 --> 00:26:54,672
Answer me.

340
00:26:56,949 --> 00:26:59,350
What are you doing?

341
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:25,305
Hey, what just happened?

342
00:27:25,911 --> 00:27:28,176
Just tell me.

343
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:47,522
Hey, what are you doing?

344
00:27:51,537 --> 00:27:54,302
What is this?

345
00:28:18,597 --> 00:28:20,327
Hey, what?

346
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:23,965
Hey, what is it?

347
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:31,510
What happened to you?

348
00:28:33,111 --> 00:28:35,637
Oh no, I can't.

349
00:28:35,681 --> 00:28:38,879
I'm going crazy.

350
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:47,191
What is that?

351
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:49,991
Hey you, what are you doing?

352
00:28:50,028 --> 00:28:52,657
You were quick to wake up.

353
00:28:53,298 --> 00:28:57,497
Hey? What? You're not Mr. Kamota?

354
00:28:57,569 --> 00:29:03,702
I'm the one who unlocks any
woman's sexual potential.

355
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:06,074
Because of the shape of my dick.

356
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:11,609
- Who are you?
- And so...

357
00:29:11,683 --> 00:29:17,748
the sex of a woman
relaxes when she comes...

358
00:29:17,823 --> 00:29:24,229
to open up for the man's seed
and to allow fecundation.

359
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:28,830
That means, you may
enjoy her tightness...

360
00:29:28,867 --> 00:29:32,463
but that also means that
you don't make her come.

361
00:29:33,872 --> 00:29:37,707
And so in this way...

362
00:29:42,381 --> 00:29:43,542
No, don't.

363
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:48,144
And if you keep thrusting deep,
she will keep on coming.

364
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:51,281
No, don't! Don't do that!

365
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:55,587
Help me!

366
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,233
Oh, no...

367
00:30:02,267 --> 00:30:04,259
I'm coming again.

368
00:30:05,771 --> 00:30:08,036
No, no, no, no.

369
00:30:36,034 --> 00:30:39,198
Mr. Kamota, Mr. Kamota?

370
00:30:46,411 --> 00:30:48,175
What the hell is that?

371
00:30:48,213 --> 00:30:50,205
What's going on?

372
00:30:51,116 --> 00:30:52,516
Are you OK?

373
00:30:54,753 --> 00:30:56,619
He hasn't hurt me.

374
00:30:57,489 --> 00:30:59,219
Did he rape you?

375
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:04,253
Fuck.

376
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:06,264
Sorry.

377
00:31:06,331 --> 00:31:08,266
I couldn't help you.

378
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:09,460
Right.

379
00:31:10,669 --> 00:31:13,730
I'll borrow this.

380
00:31:15,607 --> 00:31:20,375
Frozen food is delicious
with Chinese condiment.

381
00:31:21,246 --> 00:31:24,114
For example this frozen fried chicken...

382
00:31:24,149 --> 00:31:28,348
is really good with that
Chinese ragout.

383
00:31:32,023 --> 00:31:34,219
Don't forget the lemon.

384
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:44,635
These are frozen spring-rolls.

385
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:49,130
Of course the eda beans are
not seasoned.

386
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:53,269
If you serve frozen
food without preparation.

387
00:31:53,311 --> 00:31:58,147
It's like a man unskilled at sex.
It makes it tasteless.

388
00:32:09,961 --> 00:32:12,362
And the result is not bad at all.

389
00:32:13,365 --> 00:32:14,856
You want a taste?

390
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:27,345
Good, isn't it?

391
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:38,180
You don't want any?

392
00:32:38,223 --> 00:32:40,749
Maybe it's poisoned.

393
00:32:40,826 --> 00:32:44,422
But I ate it.

394
00:32:44,496 --> 00:32:46,431
Oh?

395
00:32:46,498 --> 00:32:50,959
And yet a woman that
I just raped trusts me.

396
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:54,003
Why do you say it only now?

397
00:32:54,039 --> 00:32:56,008
Say what?

398
00:32:56,041 --> 00:32:58,374
If you believe it's poisoned...

399
00:32:58,443 --> 00:33:01,572
why didn't you stop her before?

400
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:02,944
It's just...

401
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:06,281
You think only when you're
in danger?

402
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:10,813
Obviously, a person knows
what's suited for himself.

403
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:13,658
Really?

404
00:33:13,725 --> 00:33:16,854
"Each man for himself", right?

405
00:33:16,928 --> 00:33:19,193
It's not like that.

406
00:33:19,264 --> 00:33:22,826
I realized it when my turn came.

407
00:33:22,901 --> 00:33:27,862
But you wouldn't realize
it when she ate?

408
00:33:27,939 --> 00:33:32,741
That's exactly the meaning of
"Each man for himself".

409
00:33:32,777 --> 00:33:35,747
Stop twisting my words.

410
00:33:37,215 --> 00:33:39,548
It's alright.

411
00:33:39,618 --> 00:33:42,110
What's your name?

412
00:33:42,153 --> 00:33:43,951
I'm Rika.

413
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:45,581
Family name?

414
00:33:45,657 --> 00:33:47,592
I'm Rika Ichikawa.

415
00:33:47,626 --> 00:33:48,855
Some kind of model?

416
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,155
I am a model.

417
00:33:50,228 --> 00:33:52,390
Not "some kind of".

418
00:33:52,464 --> 00:33:56,026
I see, very interesting.

419
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:58,901
I've always wondered why...

420
00:33:58,937 --> 00:34:02,965
people in the show-business
changed their names.

421
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:05,772
Rika Ichikawa is just perfect.

422
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:09,269
It's just like a stage costume.

423
00:34:09,347 --> 00:34:14,786
I could be Rika Ichikawa,
Yamada or Watanabe.

424
00:34:14,819 --> 00:34:17,345
What is your name?

425
00:34:17,422 --> 00:34:20,358
We're not talking about me.

426
00:34:20,425 --> 00:34:24,760
So it's the same,
you don't use your name.

427
00:34:26,998 --> 00:34:31,129
That's a good explanation, I get it.

428
00:34:32,337 --> 00:34:36,104
I saw you at that café.

429
00:34:36,174 --> 00:34:39,770
I could feel your hopes and desires.

430
00:34:39,811 --> 00:34:45,045
The smell of a woman craving sex.

431
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:48,815
Enough, that's a rape.

432
00:34:48,853 --> 00:34:51,084
You think you can use us?

433
00:34:51,122 --> 00:34:53,182
Do you understand the consequences?

434
00:34:53,224 --> 00:34:56,854
Sure, but she was asking for it.

435
00:34:56,928 --> 00:35:01,696
I'm just a key to unlock women's desire.

436
00:35:02,734 --> 00:35:04,066
No way...

437
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:08,335
Are you Jack the Ripper?

438
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,838
I could be him...

439
00:35:10,909 --> 00:35:13,811
But maybe I'm not.

440
00:35:13,878 --> 00:35:18,339
I heard this Jack the Ripper
could be a woman too.

441
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:20,351
Anyway.

442
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:24,185
If you do as I tell you,
I won't kill you.

443
00:35:24,255 --> 00:35:27,384
That's what Jack always says.

444
00:35:27,459 --> 00:35:29,928
I read it in Max Magazine.

445
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:33,420
I could be a copycat then.

446
00:35:33,498 --> 00:35:38,562
So there are victims who survived him?

447
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:43,770
It can't be, because these people...

448
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:47,745
surely would have reported
him to the authorities.

449
00:35:48,847 --> 00:35:51,078
Who knows?

450
00:36:22,614 --> 00:36:24,913
What is it?

451
00:36:26,418 --> 00:36:29,616
You're enjoying it?

452
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:32,556
I'm enjoying it.

453
00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:36,728
So what?

454
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:40,430
No, I'm gonna go crazy.

455
00:36:40,465 --> 00:36:42,297
Why is that?

456
00:36:44,069 --> 00:36:48,268
Please, fuck me here.

457
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,736
No, I won't.

458
00:36:50,775 --> 00:36:53,370
I can't wait.

459
00:36:53,445 --> 00:36:56,609
Well, I brought you to that point.

460
00:36:56,681 --> 00:36:58,877
How did you do that?

461
00:36:58,917 --> 00:37:01,477
You can guess.

462
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:04,512
Please, fuck me!

463
00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:08,754
If you can't wait,
then you take care of it.

464
00:37:31,015 --> 00:37:32,950
I get it.

465
00:37:34,285 --> 00:37:38,882
You're doing as I say
because you want to live.

466
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:46,421
It's just an act but I'm
willing to play along.

467
00:38:14,859 --> 00:38:17,055
Excellent.

468
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:20,530
You express emotions very well.

469
00:38:20,598 --> 00:38:23,329
A real professional model.

470
00:38:24,769 --> 00:38:26,397
What is it?

471
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:29,407
You think I'm not good.

472
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,433
I don't think that.

473
00:38:33,645 --> 00:38:36,774
You're the first who tells me that.

474
00:38:37,649 --> 00:38:42,553
That's because you're
desperate to please me.

475
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:47,991
This drive makes people
naturally good at sex.

476
00:38:48,793 --> 00:38:50,625
Keep sucking.

477
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,411
You're good.

478
00:39:11,482 --> 00:39:13,417
Can you feel it?

479
00:39:13,551 --> 00:39:17,147
It's real hard when I'm about to come.

480
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:29,294
I have to stop you, or I'll come.

481
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,927
It has to be a reward.

482
00:39:59,364 --> 00:40:04,564
I'm coming! I'm coming!

483
00:40:57,522 --> 00:40:59,047
What are you doing?

484
00:41:03,828 --> 00:41:05,956
You're trying to escape?

485
00:41:28,019 --> 00:41:30,011
Stop!

486
00:41:30,088 --> 00:41:33,422
You're going to kill him!

487
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:40,562
Tell me, would you like
to save him?

488
00:41:40,598 --> 00:41:43,591
He proved he doesn't care
about you.

489
00:41:44,369 --> 00:41:47,828
Alright then,
you owe it to her.

490
00:41:47,872 --> 00:41:50,205
I'll forgive you this time.

491
00:41:55,446 --> 00:41:58,006
Next time you try that...

492
00:41:58,549 --> 00:41:59,949
You understand, right?

493
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:08,790
<i>Rieko Calling</i>

494
00:42:20,438 --> 00:42:22,373
Who is it?

495
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,365
Probably Rieko.

496
00:42:24,776 --> 00:42:26,677
She's supposed to come today...

497
00:42:26,744 --> 00:42:28,610
to pick up her stuff.

498
00:42:28,646 --> 00:42:31,206
She's coming with my friend.

499
00:42:32,517 --> 00:42:34,418
That's our chance.

500
00:42:34,452 --> 00:42:36,444
What chance?

501
00:42:36,654 --> 00:42:38,953
Our chance to escape.

502
00:42:39,023 --> 00:42:43,654
But if he catches them too...

503
00:42:43,728 --> 00:42:47,130
She's coming with your friend.

504
00:42:47,198 --> 00:42:49,929
They can take him on.

505
00:42:50,001 --> 00:42:52,596
We didn't manage.

506
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:54,605
That's because...

507
00:42:54,639 --> 00:42:58,576
I was tied, to begin with.

508
00:42:59,343 --> 00:43:02,973
They don't know that he's Jack.

509
00:43:03,047 --> 00:43:07,007
If they are attacked, they'll lose,
even two against one.

510
00:43:07,685 --> 00:43:10,553
You care so much about your ex?

511
00:43:10,621 --> 00:43:12,180
It's not about that.

512
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:14,725
You can't hide it.

513
00:43:14,759 --> 00:43:18,924
Mr. Kamota, it's obvious
that you still care for her.

514
00:43:18,963 --> 00:43:20,955
Don't be silly.

515
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:24,664
If you're so worried...

516
00:43:24,735 --> 00:43:27,034
tell this man that guests are coming...

517
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:28,971
and that you need to cancel them.

518
00:43:29,006 --> 00:43:31,202
You can't keep that for yourself.

519
00:43:31,843 --> 00:43:34,608
I can't tell him.

520
00:43:34,679 --> 00:43:38,548
It would trigger his interest
in Rieko.

521
00:43:40,218 --> 00:43:42,619
Isn't there a better option?

522
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:47,682
What time do they come?

523
00:43:48,126 --> 00:43:51,119
He said they'd come at 13:00.

524
00:43:52,663 --> 00:43:55,132
I have an idea.

525
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:57,168
We could try it.

526
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:17,154
Say...

527
00:44:17,822 --> 00:44:19,154
What is it?

528
00:44:19,757 --> 00:44:23,353
We have a photo-shoot today.

529
00:44:24,595 --> 00:44:25,927
Don't be stupid...

530
00:44:25,963 --> 00:44:29,627
I'm not letting you go to work.

531
00:44:30,268 --> 00:44:34,171
Please let me cancel.

532
00:44:35,773 --> 00:44:40,507
If I just don't show up,
I might lose my job.

533
00:44:42,947 --> 00:44:45,382
If you say so.

534
00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:54,319
Say...

535
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:59,288
Mr. Kamota introduced them to me.

536
00:44:59,330 --> 00:45:03,199
Their number is on my phone.

537
00:45:13,044 --> 00:45:15,513
My code is 1919.

538
00:45:16,347 --> 00:45:18,680
It's Max Magazine.

539
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:22,312
We need to call Mr. Mikasa.

540
00:45:26,824 --> 00:45:29,521
Don't say anything stupid.

541
00:45:38,803 --> 00:45:42,831
- Hello.
- Hello, Mr. Mikasa?

542
00:45:43,975 --> 00:45:45,238
Who are you?

543
00:45:46,344 --> 00:45:50,645
I'm Rika, the model
Mr. Kamota introduced to you.

544
00:45:51,315 --> 00:45:52,943
Rika...

545
00:45:53,017 --> 00:45:57,455
We met at Mr. Kamota's
place yesterday.

546
00:45:57,488 --> 00:46:01,255
Ah, I remember you...
What is this about?

547
00:46:02,493 --> 00:46:06,692
About today's appointment at 13:00...

548
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:11,134
Something important came
up, we need to cancel.

549
00:46:11,168 --> 00:46:15,697
Really, you guys are so busy, I see.

550
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:16,969
Alright.

551
00:46:17,041 --> 00:46:21,001
I'm sorry to cancel so abruptly.

552
00:46:21,078 --> 00:46:23,013
How about Mr. Kamota?

553
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:25,447
Well...

554
00:46:27,318 --> 00:46:31,813
He's asleep.
He seemed really exhausted.

555
00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:36,492
Tell him to go easy
on "physical exercise".

556
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,188
Bye.

557
00:46:49,607 --> 00:46:51,098
<i>Nerima District, Tokyo</i>

558
00:46:52,176 --> 00:46:54,077
It's that girl.

559
00:46:54,979 --> 00:46:57,505
I took a day off for him today.

560
00:46:58,149 --> 00:47:00,311
It's fine.

561
00:47:00,384 --> 00:47:02,546
We can take a little trip.

562
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:04,987
I'm not letting this go.

563
00:47:05,022 --> 00:47:06,718
I still have the key.

564
00:47:06,757 --> 00:47:10,216
Hey, how about a little surprise.

565
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:13,059
Don't be childish.

566
00:47:13,331 --> 00:47:16,358
He makes us look like idiots.

567
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:37,185
So? Do you like people to watch?

568
00:47:38,356 --> 00:47:39,585
No...

569
00:47:39,623 --> 00:47:41,615
I don't.

570
00:47:44,462 --> 00:47:45,862
Huh?

571
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:52,331
But you seem to enjoy
it down there.

572
00:48:12,957 --> 00:48:16,416
It turns you on when someone
is watching.

573
00:48:16,927 --> 00:48:19,123
It turns me on.

574
00:48:20,264 --> 00:48:23,860
You like it when the man
you love is watching?

575
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:27,432
The man I love?

576
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:31,073
You do love this man.

577
00:48:33,043 --> 00:48:35,069
I don't love him.

578
00:48:35,112 --> 00:48:38,549
You just consider him
a fuck buddy?

579
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:42,212
Yes, and it's the same for him.

580
00:48:54,899 --> 00:48:57,869
Do you like sex that much?

581
00:48:58,536 --> 00:49:01,506
I'm masochistic.

582
00:49:03,073 --> 00:49:07,169
You may pose as masochistic
while being a 'sado'.

583
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:11,211
In my experience, 80%
of women are like that.

584
00:49:11,248 --> 00:49:16,915
If you really are 'maso',
how do you like sex?

585
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:28,322
Is that true?

586
00:49:28,399 --> 00:49:30,231
Yes.

587
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:34,570
That's interesting.

588
00:49:51,422 --> 00:49:55,416
Alright, now you take care of him.

589
00:50:18,549 --> 00:50:20,415
What's that?

590
00:50:20,484 --> 00:50:23,010
You're useless.

591
00:50:23,087 --> 00:50:26,956
I need my usual vitamin
drink to get it on.

592
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:28,583
A drink?

593
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:32,121
It's in the kitchen.

594
00:50:32,596 --> 00:50:34,121
Where?

595
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:44,001
It's there...

596
00:50:44,508 --> 00:50:47,637
The lower cabinet on the right.

597
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:06,190
And also he needs to cover my face.

598
00:51:07,398 --> 00:51:09,128
What is that?

599
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:14,866
Mr. Kamota can't have sex
if a woman looks at him.

600
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:17,002
Oh?

601
00:51:18,709 --> 00:51:20,735
What a weird dude.

602
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:27,548
Rieko.

603
00:51:27,618 --> 00:51:29,280
We can still back off.

604
00:51:29,353 --> 00:51:31,288
Why is that?

605
00:51:31,355 --> 00:51:33,347
Why are you so stubborn?

606
00:51:33,824 --> 00:51:36,885
He can lead his sex life anytime.

607
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:39,556
It's basic courtesy to see me today.

608
00:51:39,630 --> 00:51:42,498
Are you jealous?

609
00:51:42,533 --> 00:51:44,092
That's totally uncalled for.

610
00:51:44,134 --> 00:51:48,469
If you didn't care at all,
you'd give him a break.

611
00:51:48,539 --> 00:51:53,500
It's just that I feel
disrespected and I'm upset.

612
00:51:53,577 --> 00:51:55,569
Is that so?

613
00:51:57,014 --> 00:52:00,644
Anyway, we're here now.

614
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:16,866
Rieko, come on, it's
exactly what we thought.

615
00:52:16,934 --> 00:52:18,095
Let's go.

616
00:52:19,169 --> 00:52:20,637
I'm telling you to stop.

617
00:53:07,518 --> 00:53:10,784
What? What is this?

618
00:53:13,090 --> 00:53:16,060
First time I catch four people.

619
00:53:16,093 --> 00:53:17,584
Who are you?

620
00:53:17,661 --> 00:53:19,857
Maybe he is Jack the Ripper.

621
00:53:19,930 --> 00:53:22,593
You mean, the serial killer?

622
00:53:22,666 --> 00:53:25,226
Who cares.

623
00:53:25,269 --> 00:53:30,207
The rule here is to obey
me in every way.

624
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:32,232
In every way?

625
00:53:33,577 --> 00:53:38,140
If you listen and have sex
with him, he doesn't kill you.

626
00:53:39,650 --> 00:53:41,380
No! No!

627
00:53:41,418 --> 00:53:42,215
Let me go!

628
00:53:42,286 --> 00:53:43,549
Let her go!

629
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:45,088
No!

630
00:53:46,757 --> 00:53:48,248
Don't!

631
00:53:48,325 --> 00:53:51,489
- Stop, please, leave her alone!
- Stop, please, leave her alone!

632
00:53:52,429 --> 00:53:56,332
What's with you two?
You're creeping me out.

633
00:54:10,013 --> 00:54:12,505
What are you...

634
00:54:36,306 --> 00:54:37,569
No.

635
00:54:41,311 --> 00:54:42,745
No, don't!

636
00:54:48,919 --> 00:54:51,081
Why did you quiet down?

637
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:52,950
I didn't.

638
00:54:53,023 --> 00:54:55,219
You so needed this.

639
00:55:04,902 --> 00:55:06,803
You seem to like that.

640
00:55:06,837 --> 00:55:08,533
No, I don't.

641
00:55:10,507 --> 00:55:15,138
And yet you are so wet.

642
00:55:15,245 --> 00:55:17,146
I am not.

643
00:55:17,948 --> 00:55:19,678
Alright.

644
00:55:19,750 --> 00:55:21,946
I'll put it in.

645
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:30,889
No.

646
00:56:04,127 --> 00:56:06,028
I'm coming inside.

647
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:36,784
Alright.

648
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:38,852
You're next.

649
00:56:39,296 --> 00:56:42,425
You guys are still married.

650
00:56:42,466 --> 00:56:44,731
They're about to get divorced.

651
00:56:44,768 --> 00:56:46,066
That's right.

652
00:56:46,136 --> 00:56:47,434
Hey...

653
00:56:47,471 --> 00:56:49,463
Are you the new boyfriend?

654
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:52,109
What is it to you?

655
00:56:52,175 --> 00:56:53,734
Alright.

656
00:56:53,777 --> 00:56:55,769
Hey, you have sex with her.

657
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:58,473
Are you crazy?

658
00:56:58,548 --> 00:57:02,280
It's probably your last chance
to do her.

659
00:57:02,319 --> 00:57:05,221
Do it before he takes her
away from you.

660
00:57:18,035 --> 00:57:19,128
Come on.

661
00:57:32,082 --> 00:57:33,710
Not like that.

662
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:37,585
He needs you to roll her
up in the cover.

663
00:57:37,621 --> 00:57:39,590
So that only her butt sticks out.

664
00:57:39,623 --> 00:57:42,684
He was sad that he never
did it to her.

665
00:57:42,759 --> 00:57:44,387
I see.

666
00:57:44,428 --> 00:57:46,420
That's interesting.

667
00:58:15,425 --> 00:58:16,552
There...

668
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:18,626
Last chance to have sex with her.

669
00:58:26,837 --> 00:58:29,102
How can you?

670
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:31,607
You can do her too.

671
00:58:31,641 --> 00:58:33,667
You want to do it to me?

672
00:58:33,744 --> 00:58:37,272
Or you'd rather have her?

673
00:58:54,865 --> 00:58:56,356
Great!

674
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:57,868
Hang in there!

675
00:58:57,934 --> 00:59:01,427
You can make her come today!

676
00:59:13,350 --> 00:59:16,218
You did a great job.

677
00:59:16,253 --> 00:59:19,621
See, you don't need your vitamin drink.

678
00:59:41,078 --> 00:59:42,637
It's your turn.

679
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:45,405
Considering the circumstances...

680
00:59:45,449 --> 00:59:48,817
she could be pregnant
from either of us.

681
00:59:48,885 --> 00:59:51,980
You don't want to be left out.

682
00:59:59,029 --> 01:00:00,190
I want lemon.

683
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:01,390
What?

684
01:00:02,399 --> 01:00:04,527
Pour lemon on her.

685
01:00:04,568 --> 01:00:06,161
Sure.

686
01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:37,761
- On me too.
- Huh?

687
01:00:48,578 --> 01:00:49,978
Her face.

688
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:52,275
I want to see her face.

689
01:00:52,349 --> 01:00:54,341
So many requests.

690
01:01:24,147 --> 01:01:28,881
Beautiful, a great couple of sex addicts.

691
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:34,415
Turn me around.

692
01:01:35,425 --> 01:01:37,724
Turn me around.

693
01:01:37,928 --> 01:01:39,260
What?

694
01:02:15,498 --> 01:02:16,966
I'm coming.

695
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:46,119
How does it feel?

696
01:02:46,196 --> 01:02:49,758
To receive the sperm
of three men at once.

697
01:02:50,166 --> 01:02:52,260
Isn't that a thrill?

698
01:02:59,743 --> 01:03:01,837
Such a cute face.

699
01:03:34,644 --> 01:03:36,374
What is it?

700
01:03:36,446 --> 01:03:38,574
You can't go?

701
01:03:39,249 --> 01:03:41,275
I'm ashamed.

702
01:03:48,058 --> 01:03:50,391
So you can share...

703
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:52,656
this moment of shame with me.

704
01:04:07,444 --> 01:04:09,413
You see...

705
01:04:09,479 --> 01:04:14,315
You let go of your shame
and you free yourself.

706
01:04:20,623 --> 01:04:22,785
Don't! Don't!

707
01:04:40,510 --> 01:04:43,446
What? What is it?

708
01:04:45,281 --> 01:04:47,512
It's nothing.

709
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:49,542
Just tell me.

710
01:04:53,523 --> 01:04:56,652
Could you kiss me?

711
01:05:23,186 --> 01:05:27,282
I didn't figure you'd
be such a smart woman.

712
01:05:27,357 --> 01:05:29,883
What do you mean?

713
01:05:29,959 --> 01:05:34,329
You are attentive
to the needs of a man...

714
01:05:34,397 --> 01:05:36,389
and easily accommodate his desires.

715
01:05:38,468 --> 01:05:39,458
Eh?

716
01:05:40,136 --> 01:05:44,335
Until today, you were
always faking your feelings.

717
01:05:47,477 --> 01:05:49,412
More or less...

718
01:05:49,479 --> 01:05:52,278
that's the fate of all women.

719
01:05:52,849 --> 01:05:54,977
Same thing for Rieko...

720
01:05:55,018 --> 01:05:57,817
Don't compare me to that woman!

721
01:05:57,887 --> 01:06:00,482
You dislike her type.

722
01:06:00,557 --> 01:06:04,016
She keeps a pretty smile
as if everything was OK.

723
01:06:04,093 --> 01:06:06,028
I hate women like that the most!

724
01:06:06,095 --> 01:06:10,032
When you raped her...

725
01:06:10,099 --> 01:06:12,500
I wanted you to destroy her.

726
01:06:12,569 --> 01:06:17,872
That's why you warned
me they were coming.

727
01:06:18,908 --> 01:06:24,211
You may pose as masochistic
while being a 'sado'.

728
01:06:24,247 --> 01:06:27,012
In my experience, 80%
of women are like that.

729
01:06:28,084 --> 01:06:32,818
If you really are 'maso',
how do you like sex?

730
01:06:36,059 --> 01:06:42,397
In a little while his
wife is coming here.

731
01:06:42,465 --> 01:06:44,400
Is that true?

732
01:06:44,467 --> 01:06:46,459
Yes.

733
01:06:48,905 --> 01:06:50,840
That's interesting.

734
01:06:52,275 --> 01:06:55,871
I thought if you'd rape her,
he'd despise her.

735
01:06:56,446 --> 01:06:59,348
And now I regret what I did.

736
01:06:59,415 --> 01:07:01,577
You pity her now?

737
01:07:01,618 --> 01:07:03,211
Surely not.

738
01:07:03,253 --> 01:07:07,452
But I saw the way you kissed her...

739
01:07:07,490 --> 01:07:09,482
and I hated that.

740
01:07:10,326 --> 01:07:13,455
You're declaring your love
while sitting on the toilet?

741
01:07:16,566 --> 01:07:21,766
But you called her precisely
to avoid her coming.

742
01:07:21,804 --> 01:07:24,296
I was sure she'd want to come anyway.

743
01:07:24,340 --> 01:07:25,672
Oh?

744
01:07:25,708 --> 01:07:28,268
At her bar I saw how
frustrated she was...

745
01:07:28,378 --> 01:07:31,746
at the thought of losing him to me.

746
01:07:31,781 --> 01:07:35,274
And if I was the one calling...

747
01:07:35,318 --> 01:07:38,186
she'd be flustered and
would insist to come.

748
01:07:38,221 --> 01:07:41,555
You women are ferocious.

749
01:08:05,014 --> 01:08:08,246
But if you hadn't warned me...

750
01:08:08,284 --> 01:08:11,379
you would've had a chance
to escape.

751
01:08:11,421 --> 01:08:14,323
But if you escaped...

752
01:08:14,357 --> 01:08:17,953
I would have lost this chance
to have more sex with you.

753
01:08:18,027 --> 01:08:20,656
Are you craving sex that much?

754
01:08:22,332 --> 01:08:26,997
Yes, and I crave only sex.

755
01:08:27,036 --> 01:08:29,062
Is that true?

756
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:33,410
Women who are not content
with sex...

757
01:08:34,477 --> 01:08:37,311
and seeking tenderness,
are ridiculed by men.

758
01:08:39,482 --> 01:08:41,451
You have a good point.

759
01:09:12,448 --> 01:09:15,543
I'm coming! I'm coming!

760
01:09:26,129 --> 01:09:30,066
But that woman is a good lay.

761
01:09:30,133 --> 01:09:33,194
You think she's better than me?

762
01:09:33,269 --> 01:09:35,704
And what if I do?

763
01:09:36,039 --> 01:09:37,337
Eh?

764
01:09:38,307 --> 01:09:41,607
Don't be disappointed.

765
01:09:45,348 --> 01:09:47,317
You were teasing me.

766
01:09:47,383 --> 01:09:51,878
But you, taming that woman...

767
01:09:51,921 --> 01:09:54,390
I'm looking forward to seeing it.

768
01:10:04,534 --> 01:10:06,730
That's great.

769
01:10:11,708 --> 01:10:13,836
Good shot.

770
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:19,205
Excellent.

771
01:10:23,019 --> 01:10:24,612
Good shot.

772
01:10:27,223 --> 01:10:28,555
Great.

773
01:10:30,126 --> 01:10:31,754
So sexy.

774
01:10:42,338 --> 01:10:45,206
We don't have much time left.

775
01:11:03,159 --> 01:11:04,821
What is it?

776
01:11:04,861 --> 01:11:07,524
I'm granting you your wish.

777
01:12:01,951 --> 01:12:04,284
Get up.

778
01:13:23,833 --> 01:13:26,359
Look at me, I'm like a man.

779
01:13:26,435 --> 01:13:27,835
So much fun.

780
01:13:27,870 --> 01:13:30,897
See, this strap-on...

781
01:13:30,973 --> 01:13:32,908
is designed after the shape
of my dick.

782
01:13:32,975 --> 01:13:35,706
It's a unique piece in the world.

783
01:13:35,778 --> 01:13:38,873
With this, you can make
any woman come.

784
01:14:14,450 --> 01:14:18,615
Hey, have you ever done anal?

785
01:14:18,688 --> 01:14:21,123
Let's give it a shot.

786
01:14:27,496 --> 01:14:28,987
Alright.

787
01:15:09,872 --> 01:15:11,363
Go.

788
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:33,236
You betrayed my trust.

789
01:18:35,044 --> 01:18:37,741
This one only has low voltage.

790
01:18:37,780 --> 01:18:41,876
This one's the real deal.

791
01:18:41,951 --> 01:18:46,946
I just wanted to tie you
up for sex.

792
01:18:52,761 --> 01:18:54,389
That's a lie.

793
01:19:07,776 --> 01:19:09,972
What are you doing?

794
01:21:08,897 --> 01:21:11,526
I will dispose of the body.

795
01:21:11,567 --> 01:21:15,231
I leave them to you.

796
01:21:15,270 --> 01:21:18,900
You should enjoy sex with them.

797
01:21:26,348 --> 01:21:28,214
I'm borrowing your car.

798
01:21:28,784 --> 01:21:31,549
It's parked out front, right?
