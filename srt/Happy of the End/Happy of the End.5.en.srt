1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,400
Stay back. Move away. Please, step back.

2
00:00:03,617 --> 00:00:04,940
What? No way!

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:06,620
Please, step back.

4
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:08,060
Haoren's mother had died.

5
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:09,880
Please, step back.

6
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,120
Mom.

7
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,540
From then on,

8
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,660
- his heart went somewhere
- Haoren.

9
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:19,040
and never returned.

10
00:00:19,655 --> 00:00:20,935
(Don't get angry. Don't urinate.)

11
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,940
(Episode 5)

12
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,440
Haoren, you need to eat.

13
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,520
If you don't, you won't last.

14
00:01:10,232 --> 00:01:11,480
I don't want to.

15
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:22,020
- Come on, at least try to…
- Don't touch me.

16
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:31,000
"Happy of the End"

17
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,640
Oh.

18
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,467
I know someone opening a restaurant.

19
00:02:39,475 --> 00:02:41,569
They're looking for staff for the opening.

20
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:44,180
What? Seriously? I want to do that!

21
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,620
For real?

22
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,800
You, working part-time?

23
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,560
Is Keito still that down?

24
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:58,000
His mom jumped off a building, right?

25
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,600
Yeah, that's right.

26
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,960
He was such a mama's boy.

27
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,829
Though, who knows if

28
00:03:08,837 --> 00:03:10,048
she was really his mom.

29
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,040
Isn't it okay either way?

30
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:16,880
Whether she was his real mom or not.

31
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,500
Ha. What's that?

32
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,440
Anyway,

33
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,004
it's time you learned

34
00:03:25,012 --> 00:03:26,387
what hard work feels like!

35
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,760
Make sure you show the spirit of hospitality.

36
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,438
Kashiwagi-kun, right?

37
00:03:37,454 --> 00:03:38,742
You're Kaji's friend.

38
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,860
Yes.

39
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,017
You're tall and presentable,

40
00:03:43,033 --> 00:03:45,236
I'll have you as the face of the floor.

41
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,980
Please handle the window seats.

42
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,120
Yes.

43
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,940
- That big?
- Yeah.

44
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,260
- You're already hungry, right?
- Yeah.

45
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,780
Eating bread would be good.

46
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:59,240
- Dad...
- Excuse me,

47
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,580
here's the wine list.

48
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,020
Big brother.

49
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,820
Let's go.

50
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:10,240
- You two go ahead.
- Yeah.

51
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:11,780
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

52
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,660
Can we cancel the course I reserved?

53
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,660
I'll check.

54
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:26,680
About that... I'm sorry. I...

55
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:29,940
It's fine. It can't be helped.

56
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,120
Hey...

57
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,655
Please don't approach me

58
00:04:33,679 --> 00:04:34,952
if you see me again.

59
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,840
It's bad for my child.

60
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,120
I'm begging you.

61
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,800
- Let go!
- Me and...

62
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,640
you,

63
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,800
what's the difference between us?

64
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,700
Is it bad that I like men?

65
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:55,100
What's so different about us? Tell me!

66
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,560
Don't ever come near us again.

67
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,660
You're disgusting.

68
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,740
Sir, please!

69
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,160
- Really?
- What happened?

70
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,160
- What to do? Are you okay?
- Are you okay?

71
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,041
You got into a fight with

72
00:05:10,066 --> 00:05:11,472
a customer and got fired?

73
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:13,994
What the hell, man?

74
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:16,077
I recommended you for that job.

75
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,580
Sorry.

76
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,260
Ugh, it's a disaster.

77
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,800
My girlfriend broke up with me, too.

78
00:05:24,077 --> 00:05:27,080
Huh? Emika? You guys broke up?

79
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,300
Yeah,

80
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,100
she cheated on me.

81
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:36,119
She's a night girl, right? It happens.

82
00:05:36,144 --> 00:05:37,294
That's just how it is.

83
00:05:38,353 --> 00:05:40,140
You should just forget about her.

84
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,588
Don't let another girl from

85
00:05:41,604 --> 00:05:43,002
the club play you next time.

86
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:49,931
You don't know anything about

87
00:05:49,955 --> 00:05:51,142
normal love, do you?

88
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:53,400
Huh?

89
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,280
You're gay, right?

90
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:56,600
Same with Keito.

91
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,814
You're not like us.

92
00:05:58,822 --> 00:06:00,064
It's not that simple.

93
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,080
Yeah. Sorry.

94
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,840
Aargh!

95
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,340
Haa...

96
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,540
Later.

97
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,960
The chain broke.

98
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,700
That should do it.

99
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:30,760
Next is restocking drinks, right?

100
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,180
Um, Kashiwagi-san…

101
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,160
Can we exchange contact info?

102
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:42,220
- Huh?
- Oh, no, I just...

103
00:07:42,502 --> 00:07:44,440
thought it'd be useful to be in

104
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,380
the group chat for shifts and stuff.

105
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:47,860
Oh,

106
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,040
I don't have a phone...

107
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,020
Oh.

108
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:53,880
Ah...

109
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,820
What to do?

110
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,780
I can do it on my laptop.

111
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,960
So...

112
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,540
Here's my ID.

113
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,680
Mhmm.

114
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,800
Thank you!

115
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,920
I'll go restock the drinks now!

116
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,140
Kashiwagi-kun.

117
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,720
Ah, yes.

118
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,329
We've never done paying

119
00:08:26,353 --> 00:08:27,735
someone daily before.

120
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,880
It messes with our accounting.

121
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,600
Sorry. I'm in a tight spot right now.

122
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,960
Alright, good work today.

123
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,180
I'm home.

124
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,440
Oh?

125
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,780
Haoren. You're awake.

126
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:58,280
- I'm finally hungry.
- Really?

127
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,280
But we don't have any food right now.

128
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,924
Hey, how about we go grab

129
00:09:04,955 --> 00:09:06,760
some food and hang out for a bit?

130
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,620
- I don't feel like hanging out.
- Come on,

131
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,815
get out of the house
every once in a while.

132
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:15,640
- Where are we even going?
- Leave that to me.

133
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,320
We're going away for a while.

134
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,040
Here.

135
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,660
Come on, let's go.

136
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,720
- Hey!
- Yes, yes, yes, hurry, hurry.

137
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,580
Put on your shoes!

138
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,960
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

139
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,000
Where are we?

140
00:09:41,645 --> 00:09:42,805
This is Ueno.

141
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:44,980
You don't know it?

142
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,420
Never been here before.

143
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,740
But I'm hungry.

144
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,500
I figured.

145
00:09:52,627 --> 00:09:54,167
Wait here a sec, okay?

146
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:57,120
Stay right here! Okay?

147
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:59,480
- Yeah, I got it.
- Wait a moment.

148
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,900
Wait right there!

149
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:11,760
Hey!

150
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,920
Dinner's here!

151
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,680
- Oh!
- Here.

152
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,660
That's a lot.

153
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,060
You bought all this?

154
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:23,920
Where'd you get the money?

155
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,160
I got a part-time job today.

156
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,560
Used my pay.

157
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,440
I see.

158
00:10:33,283 --> 00:10:35,340
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

159
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:39,158
I think this is the first time

160
00:10:39,183 --> 00:10:40,623
you've treated me.

161
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,200
Really?

162
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,660
Ah.

163
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,120
Let's go to the park.

164
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,560
I love that park.

165
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:53,600
Come on.

166
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,720
There's more.

167
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:00,800
I'm full!

168
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,580
I can't eat anymore.

169
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,880
We had three days' worth of meals.

170
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,620
I'm glad.

171
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,140
I feel alive again.

172
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,900
Time to clean up.

173
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,780
Maybe I bought too much, huh?

174
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:22,780
Right?

175
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,820
Haoren.

176
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,840
I...

177
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,720
I don't even know if

178
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,900
I'm sad that

179
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,680
my mom died.

180
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,100
There's only one time

181
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,206
I remember my mom protecting me.

182
00:11:51,231 --> 00:11:52,431
Just one time.

183
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,600
But that was that.

184
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,420
What the hell are you doing?

185
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:59,200
You're the worst!

186
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,760
Get out!

187
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,700
Get out now!

188
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,480
- Get out!
- Yes, yes.

189
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,040
I'm sorry,

190
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,780
I'm so sorry.

191
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,820
Haoren, this is where we say goodbye.

192
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,080
Be strong okay, Haoren?

193
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:31,460
In the end, she left me behind

194
00:12:31,485 --> 00:12:33,352
and ran away with some guy.

195
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,999
Even after we met again,

196
00:12:36,007 --> 00:12:38,030
she couldn't remember me.

197
00:12:41,686 --> 00:12:43,240
If she really was my mom...

198
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,840
If she was my real mother, I...

199
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,080
Never mind.

200
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,520
I haven't had enough to drink.

201
00:13:00,051 --> 00:13:01,251
Let's go.

202
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:04,220
Where do you think you're going?

203
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,940
We don't have any more money.

204
00:13:06,747 --> 00:13:08,520
I got this from Chihiro.

205
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,435
Let's drink as we walk.

206
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:12,060
I feel like wandering around for a bit.

207
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,247
It's been a while since

208
00:13:15,271 --> 00:13:16,771
I've been alone with Haoren.

209
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,320
I remembered…

210
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,835
It's only when we're together

211
00:13:21,859 --> 00:13:23,304
that I feel like I can live.

212
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:37,119
What? Why are you suddenly

213
00:13:37,143 --> 00:13:38,663
getting all touchy?

214
00:13:38,787 --> 00:13:39,947
It's gross.

215
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,300
No. I didn't mean to.

216
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:44,140
- You see...
- I know.

217
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:48,560
You can make that kind of face too...

218
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,660
- Hey!
- Ah!

219
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,930
Trash or a moving sex toy,

220
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,020
I wonder which is better?

221
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,480
Obviously, the moving sex toy.

222
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,540
"I am Saigo!"

223
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,800
"Where are you from?"

224
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,920
What's that?

225
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,180
Hmph. Be quiet.

226
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,840
Ha!

227
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,920
Don't force yourself.

228
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,400
Let's keep walking. Come on.

229
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,539
You jerk, I even did that

230
00:14:43,564 --> 00:14:44,859
and that's your reaction?

231
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:55,334
We've really walked a lot.

232
00:14:55,342 --> 00:14:56,942
Covered all of Ueno.

233
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:00,320
- That was pretty funny.
- Huh?

234
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,900
That big-headed guy impression.

235
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,560
You mean Saigo?

236
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,340
"Are you from Choshu?"

237
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:10,320
What's that?

238
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,540
Haa...

239
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:21,620
It's cold.

240
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,640
Yeah, mornings are chilly.

241
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,220
Ah.

242
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:39,839
Open it.

243
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:42,760
This?

244
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,760
It's a present.

245
00:16:22,616 --> 00:16:23,980
Thanks.

246
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,120
It's warm.

247
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:31,760
You've already bought me food too.

248
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,400
I've got no money left.

249
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:39,100
I've gotten so much from you.

250
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:41,380
Consider this a small thanks.

251
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,920
It's not nearly enough, though.

252
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:49,020
It suits you. I'm glad.

253
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,040
Oh.

254
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:56,180
Hey, let's ride one of those!

255
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,680
That's trespassing.

256
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,904
We'll put it back when we're done.

257
00:17:00,929 --> 00:17:01,929
Come on.

258
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:09,762
It's like we have

259
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:10,942
the place to ourselves.

260
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,480
What if we fall in? That'd be bad, huh?

261
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,280
Yeah, so don't fall in.

262
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:16,440
Yeah.

263
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,400
- I'll be careful.
- Yeah.

264
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:25,100
Hey! I said it's dangerous.

265
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,020
This is fun.

266
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,980
I agree.

267
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,160
I'm enjoying this.

268
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,540
I don't think it gets better than this.

269
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,880
Chihiro.

270
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,340
I want to die.

271
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:08,320
I see.

272
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:19,160
Wow!

273
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,220
Wow!

274
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,020
It's fun.

275
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,480
Haoren.

276
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,560
There's gonna be a big truck

277
00:19:05,568 --> 00:19:06,763
coming through here.

278
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,260
It's dangerous.

279
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,260
Leave me here.

280
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,860
I'm going to sleep.

281
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,320
Haa...

282
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,560
Haa...

283
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,380
What are you doing?

284
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,900
I figured I'd take a nap too.

285
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,320
Why?

286
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:38,620
Who knows?

287
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:40,811
Thinking about it is

288
00:19:40,827 --> 00:19:41,967
too much of a hassle.

289
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:44,775
What about you?

290
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:47,640
Huh?

291
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,200
I...

292
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,860
Chihiro.

293
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:01,040
Chihiro, get up!

294
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,580
Hey, Chihiro!

295
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:03,460
Hey!

296
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,560
It's because of you.

297
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,540
Because you're here.

298
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,400
I...

299
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:37,960
I keep thinking maybe if I keep living,

300
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:41,920
I could actually be happy.

301
00:20:45,372 --> 00:20:47,012
It's your fault.

302
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,820
Because of me...

303
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,600
If it's my fault, I don't mind.

304
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,560
If it's my fault, I don't mind.

305
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,200
Just stay with me.

306
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,640
Ouch.

307
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,000
Huh?

308
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,940
Haoren.

309
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,300
You're hurt.

310
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,540
It hurts.

311
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,700
It really hurts.

312
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,340
It hurts.

313
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,660
Chihiro.

314
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,400
It really hurts.

315
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,880
Haoren is back.

316
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,560
It's strange.

317
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:57,677
It feels like we're meeting

318
00:21:57,686 --> 00:21:58,716
for the first time.

319
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:14,140
Hey!

320
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:23,360
You two… you actually came back?

321
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:27,960
People can leave their house for a day.

322
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:30,800
Not you two! You're both NEET!

323
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,300
I couldn't contact you.

324
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:35,360
I thought for sure…

325
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:39,620
Ah...

326
00:22:41,475 --> 00:22:43,975
I'm sorry for saying those awful things.

327
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,529
I was pissed off about the breaking up

328
00:22:46,545 --> 00:22:47,764
and took it out on you.

329
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:49,600
I also

330
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:52,300
think of myself as the same as you guys.

331
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:55,720
I'm sorry.

332
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,238
It's like watching

333
00:23:02,263 --> 00:23:03,996
middle schoolers make up.

334
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:06,660
Uh, yeah.

335
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:11,340
I'm sorry for bothering you too.

336
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,180
Yeah.

337
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,515
Let's go for a drink anyway!

338
00:23:15,523 --> 00:23:17,046
I'll buy you a drink.

339
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,300
- Yeah, I'll go.
- Oh.

340
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,840
What are you talking about?”

341
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,140
No. Well...

342
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,240
Let's talk over a drink.

343
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,480
(Drawing Room)

344
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,500
Mhmm.

345
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,300
- Hey, hurry up already!
- Yeah, yeah.

346
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,000
You guys are slow.

347
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:47,920
Whoa, that sun's bright.

348
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,460
Haa...

349
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,500
Maya-san!

350
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,520
- Goto's gone missing.
- Huh?

351
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,040
He's right here.

352
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:00,720
Ah.

353
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,780
Wait.

354
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:06,820
Maya-san, what are you doing?

355
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:10,140
He's so cocky, I'm going to punish him.

356
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:14,000
- Uh, he's going to die.
- It's fine.

357
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,940
I told him to keep his head up.

358
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,000
Right?

359
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,660
If you hit your head, you're dead.

360
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,880
- Mamiya, let's go.
- Uh, like 20 kilometers per hour?

361
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,520
Idiot. Raise it up.

362
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:32,540
Haa...

363
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,080
Anyway, Mamiya.

364
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,438
Have you found out

365
00:24:36,454 --> 00:24:37,956
where Hayato is moving to?

366
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:39,200
Ah, yes.

367
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:41,840
The one he's living with...

368
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:43,580
Kashiwagi Chihiro.

369
00:24:43,596 --> 00:24:44,924
He had the gas turned on

370
00:24:44,932 --> 00:24:46,212
under that name.

371
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:47,720
Dumb, right?

372
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,020
Great, let's go check it out.

373
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:02,360
(Next episode)

374
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:07,200
Hey, long time no see.

375
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,000
Is that the guy you don't want to meet?

376
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,300
Can you kill someone?

377
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:14,940
"Happy of the End"
