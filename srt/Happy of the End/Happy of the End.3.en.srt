00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:04,520
(Episode 3)

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,659
When I realize it,

3
00:00:07,668 --> 00:00:09,074
I can't help but remember.

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,386
My time with Shunichi still feels like

5
00:00:12,411 --> 00:00:15,097
a thorn stuck deep inside my chest.

6
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,540
I should get going.

7
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:23,300
Why?

8
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,560
Your work's done, isn't it?

9
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:31,120
I have some social meeting.

10
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:46,320
I like you.

11
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,773
But he went and got married

12
00:00:53,782 --> 00:00:55,462
without a second thought.

13
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,740
After that, nothing mattered anymore.

14
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,260
Hey.

15
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:04,920
That person over there, he's my type.

16
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,430
I'd stay away if I were you.

17
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,211
Sleeps around, borrows money

18
00:01:10,243 --> 00:01:11,676
like there's no tomorrow.

19
00:01:11,701 --> 00:01:13,430
Got dumped by

20
00:01:13,455 --> 00:01:15,040
a long-time lover, it seems.

21
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,020
I see…

22
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,140
Poor thing.

23
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,780
Hey...

24
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:34,000
You're Chihiro, right?

25
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,440
Quite the celebrity.

26
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,740
A man-whore with sticky fingers.

27
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,940
I like trash like you.

28
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,380
You'd make the perfect pet.

29
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,260
I'll take you in.

30
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,660
Take me in?

31
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,800
Hey!

32
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,660
Want a drink?

33
00:02:07,128 --> 00:02:09,908
- Sure!
- Alright, hold on.

34
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,960
"Happy of the End"

35
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:21,738
Fresh spring rolls and

36
00:03:21,754 --> 00:03:22,776
lemon grass stir-fry.

37
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,880
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

38
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,221
You know, you're only staying

39
00:03:28,237 --> 00:03:30,104
in that place because of me.

40
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,580
You wouldn't be able to

41
00:03:31,604 --> 00:03:32,948
rent anywhere otherwise.

42
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:36,160
I'm grateful, Matsuki-san.

43
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:38,360
How's Chii-chan doing?

44
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,420
"Chii-chan?"

45
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,373
Kashiwagi Chihiro.

46
00:03:42,632 --> 00:03:44,623
You took him in, right?

47
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:46,800
You're well-informed.

48
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,680
I have ears everywhere.

49
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:51,300
You don't need him anymore, right?

50
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:52,900
Yes.

51
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,494
If he runs away even once,

52
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:56,150
he's no longer fit to be my pet.

53
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,920
But I did like him.

54
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,220
When I'd come home late at night,

55
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,649
he'd be on the balcony,

56
00:04:02,674 --> 00:04:04,194
smoking and crying.

57
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:07,600
I loved that crying sound.

58
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,842
That kid's doomed to be

59
00:04:09,858 --> 00:04:10,881
miserable forever.

60
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,620
You've got an interesting taste.

61
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,640
I know, right?

62
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:19,440
So, why did you get kicked out?

63
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,901
I was cheating all the time,

64
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:25,198
and then I got caught.

65
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,925
Plus, I was blowing Matsuki's money

66
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:29,230
on slot machines.

67
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,540
You're more trashy than trash.

68
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:37,980
But Matsuki didn't really return home.

69
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,136
I was alone in that room all the time,

70
00:04:40,152 --> 00:04:41,495
it made me think too much.

71
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,660
It drove me crazy.

72
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,180
I'm home.

73
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,320
- Welcome back.
- Hey.

74
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,340
What's Kaji doing here?

75
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:04,000
Man, this place is tiny.

76
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,440
I want to sit there.

77
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,260
Hey, what the…?

78
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,080
You're pushy.

79
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,500
Hey, where's my housewarming gift?

80
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,940
Actually, it's my birthday next month.

81
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,160
How about you give me a present?

82
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,920
Then I don't get one either?

83
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,200
Oh yeah? When's your birthday?

84
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,140
- Last week.
- Last week?

85
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,060
Yeah.

86
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,640
So, what do you want?

87
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,820
An electric shaver.

88
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,200
I see.

89
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,060
- You're just gonna listen, that's it?
- Keito didn't get you anything either.

90
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,860
I didn't know.

91
00:05:43,404 --> 00:05:46,124
- How about access to my laptop?
- For real?

92
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,660
That'll be great to kill time. I'm glad.

93
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:51,220
Hey, smoke by the window.

94
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,600
No. You...

95
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,740
- He sat here by himself.
- Yeah.

96
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,160
(Namdaemun)

97
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,640
(Smokeless BBQ, Cold Noodles
Homemade Korean Food)

98
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,180
I'm leaving for real.

99
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:10,440
- Bring some booze and come every day.
- No way!

100
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,760
- I unlocked it.
- Oh.

101
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:18,960
- Don't go looking at weird stuff.
- I won't!

102
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,080
I'll be back late.

103
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:22,980
Okay.

104
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,520
(Shunichi)

105
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,880
(Chihiro, it's been a while.
How are you? Haha)

106
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:39,940
Chihiro, it's been a while.

107
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:41,900
How are you?

108
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,780
Shunichi?

109
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,780
Why?

110
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,680
We'll always be together.

111
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:05,880
(Chihiro, it's been a while.
How are you? Haha)

112
00:07:05,905 --> 00:07:11,345
(I'm doing well)

113
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,520
(Incoming call from Shunichi)

114
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,820
No way! I can't take a call.

115
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,320
Oh.

116
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:37,000
(Missed call)

117
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,320
(Sorry for the sudden call.
I just wanted to hear your voice)

118
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,720
Sorry for the sudden call.

119
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,020
I just wanted to hear your voice.

120
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,220
(I'm glad you're doing well. I'll see you later)

121
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,851
I'm glad you're doing well.

122
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:47,085
I'll see you later.

123
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,860
What the hell was that?

124
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,520
Ugh.

125
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,278
Didn't even log out.

126
00:08:14,303 --> 00:08:15,983
Seriously, what an idiot.

127
00:08:18,095 --> 00:08:20,675
(Sorry for the sudden call.
I just wanted to hear your voice)

128
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,920
(I'm glad you're doing
well. I'll see you later)

129
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,260
Haoren must have come back.

130
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:51,820
(Sorry for the sudden call yesterday)

131
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,820
Sorry for the sudden call yesterday.

132
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:56,640
(It's been a while. I want to see you.
How about a drink?)

133
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,220
It's been a while. I want to see you.

134
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,220
How about a drink?

135
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,688
Don't do it.

136
00:09:10,704 --> 00:09:12,704
He has a rotten smell like me.

137
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,160
No, worse than me.

138
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,300
So what's the deal with this guy?

139
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,880
- Is he gay?
- Bi.

140
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,780
Ah.

141
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,701
So he's playing around with

142
00:09:27,726 --> 00:09:29,241
both guys and girls, huh?

143
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,660
Well, memories always get sugar-coated.

144
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,340
(I'm so happy. Looking forward to it)

145
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,920
(How about tomorrow?
It's Friday after all)

146
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,880
I got it.

147
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,040
Sure.

148
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:05,160
(I got it. Sure)

149
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:09,860
Tomorrow… I wonder if I can ask him

150
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,040
why he got married.

151
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,540
Actually, Shunichi,

152
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:18,320
what does he think of me?

153
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:26,020
- I'm back.
- Hey, welcome back.

154
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,020
Want something to eat?

155
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,680
Lick me instead of eating.

156
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,420
I need release.

157
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:15,840
Ah!

158
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:30,280
What the hell are you doing?

159
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:32,900
Strip.

160
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,220
Turn around.

161
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,900
Move by yourself after you put it in.

162
00:12:22,567 --> 00:12:23,647
It hurts!

163
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,740
Move.

164
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,580
You'll do anything you're told, huh?

165
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,760
You're like a living sex toy…

166
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,640
A living sex toy.

167
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,920
Hey,

168
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,940
I'm getting married.

169
00:12:55,206 --> 00:12:57,020
We can't be together anymore.

170
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,220
I'm sorry.

171
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,355
After everything I've done to you,

172
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:15,730
and you don't say a word?

173
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,180
Don't cry, it's not fair.

174
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,520
Hey, where are you going?

175
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,020
Chihiro!

176
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,100
Let's go.

177
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,360
Yeah.

178
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,260
♪ Meat, meat! Grilling in Shinjuku
with someone else's money ♪

179
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,480
Can't wait,

180
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,700
right?

181
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,600
Ah, sashimi or whatever's fine.

182
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:51,080
Tuna.

183
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,140
- Tuna?
- Yeah.

184
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:54,000
- It's seriously good. Let's go in.
- Yeah.

185
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,160
Oh, that's Chihiro.

186
00:14:58,780 --> 00:14:59,830
He's going to have

187
00:14:59,855 --> 00:15:01,197
a drink with his ex today.

188
00:15:03,439 --> 00:15:06,100
- Now I want sashimi.
- Huh?

189
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,560
Hey! Stop it!

190
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,820
Today's supposed to be about meat!

191
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,120
Meat!

192
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,560
What about the meat?

193
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,080
When I say sashimi, I mean sashimi.

194
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,400
But you said meat, didn't you?

195
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,980
Cheers.

196
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,580
Cheers.

197
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,940
You've lost some weight, haven't you?

198
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,060
- Maybe a little.
- Yeah.

199
00:15:41,548 --> 00:15:42,748
What about you?

200
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,680
Well, I just had a kid recently.

201
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,718
I don't feel like I belong at home.

202
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:49,734
Plus, my wife isn't interested anymore.

203
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,484
I even went to a brothel for

204
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,776
the first time the other day.

205
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,060
It wasn't that great, though.

206
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:05,380
Why did you suddenly get married?

207
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:08,790
Well, there were a

208
00:16:08,815 --> 00:16:10,282
lot of things that happened.

209
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:19,260
But I genuinely loved you, Chihiro.

210
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,100
I was serious.

211
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:28,580
Really?

212
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:30,740
Yeah.

213
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:33,420
So,

214
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:37,420
how about we go to a hotel after this?

215
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,334
About that...

216
00:16:45,709 --> 00:16:48,140
I think...

217
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,000
Chihiro,

218
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,580
is this really bye-bye?

219
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,720
I want to be with you.

220
00:17:13,647 --> 00:17:15,107
Let's go to a hotel.

221
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:17,800
Please.

222
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,460
Yeah.

223
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,020
I...

224
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,354
wasn't loved by Shunichi

225
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:31,890
even a millimeter.

226
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,440
But I just want someone to love me.

227
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,260
Even if it's just pretending.

228
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,460
Because I have…

229
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,520
nothing.

230
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:47,620
Hey.

231
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,480
What the hell are you doing?

232
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,495
Did you come to pick up

233
00:18:00,503 --> 00:18:02,206
the trash you threw away once?

234
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,160
You're so eco-friendly, aren't you?

235
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:09,948
You want to be unhappy piece

236
00:18:09,956 --> 00:18:11,463
of trash for a long time too?

237
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,420
What's with him?

238
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,720
You okay?

239
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,980
Let's go take a shower.

240
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,060
Not going.

241
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,860
I'm not going anywhere with you.

242
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:48,020
When you said we'd be together forever,

243
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,220
even if it was a lie, I was happy.

244
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,040
Goodbye.

245
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:01,800
Ha...

246
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,780
Haoren!

247
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,200
You didn't go take that shower, huh?

248
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,480
Trash or a moving sex toy,

249
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:41,680
I wonder which is better?

250
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,720
Obviously, the moving sex toy.

251
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,040
Yeah, this is good.

252
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,300
Yeah, it's good.

253
00:20:24,371 --> 00:20:26,540
Oh, Kaji!

254
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,000
I left him at the restaurant.

255
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,140
Haa...

256
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:34,020
I really wanted some meat.

257
00:20:36,228 --> 00:20:37,828
Huh? Kaji was there?

258
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,700
Well, whatever.

259
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,100
What's the matter?

260
00:20:42,321 --> 00:20:43,660
Never mind.

261
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:49,060
Hmm? What's this?

262
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,281
Oh, those are the photos I took with

263
00:20:51,305 --> 00:20:52,816
that disposable camera you gave me.

264
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,340
I had them developed.

265
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,660
Oh.

266
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:00,580
Film is really good, isn't it?

267
00:21:01,092 --> 00:21:02,712
Your pictures look good too.

268
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:06,040
Even if you blocked the camera.

269
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,040
It's good, isn't it?

270
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:12,820
You're way too disinterested.

271
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,082
But some of the other photos

272
00:21:16,107 --> 00:21:17,249
are just weird.

273
00:21:17,281 --> 00:21:18,465
They were already on

274
00:21:18,481 --> 00:21:19,738
the film when I got it.

275
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,120
Look at this. Isn't it creepy?

276
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,460
Frogs,

277
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,540
frogs,

278
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:27,380
frogs,

279
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,460
frogs,

280
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:31,520
every single one is a frog.

281
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:43,250
These were taken with

282
00:21:43,282 --> 00:21:44,962
the camera I gave you?

283
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,220
Yeah.

284
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,160
The one I found on the stairs?

285
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,320
That's what you said.

286
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:56,160
I'm going to grab some coffee.

287
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,520
Hey!

288
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:21,740
Damn it.

289
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:32,340
Our trash got messed with too.

290
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,332
Maybe someone is targeting

291
00:22:36,357 --> 00:22:38,037
our room specifically.

292
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,040
What's that?

293
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,340
We're moving out tomorrow.

294
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:44,780
Huh?

295
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,012
What are you talking about?

296
00:22:47,037 --> 00:22:48,557
That's too sudden.

297
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,000
Haa...

298
00:23:17,763 --> 00:23:18,802
Moving in one day

299
00:23:18,818 --> 00:23:19,928
after deciding to move.

300
00:23:19,952 --> 00:23:21,819
This is insane. Seriously.

301
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,760
We did it though.

302
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:26,960
But I'm the only one who did any work!

303
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,640
I packed, borrowed a car from Kaji,

304
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,920
loaded it up, drove, unloaded it.

305
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,940
You really saved us.

306
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,360
This place is still a dump.

307
00:23:38,958 --> 00:23:40,360
And what's up with this room?

308
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,680
It's weird.

309
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:44,820
It used to be a cram school.

310
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:47,031
It was the only place

311
00:23:47,048 --> 00:23:48,728
I could move in today.

312
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:51,620
Why were you in such a rush?

313
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,885
I don't want anyone from

314
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:55,777
my previous job to find me.

315
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,620
Previous?

316
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,580
I'm starving. Let's eat something.

317
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,520
We should celebrate the move.

318
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,740
- What do you want to eat?
- Chinese!

319
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,660
Alright, let's go.

320
00:24:53,840 --> 00:25:00,100
(Omoigawa)

321
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,760
(Next episode)

322
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,860
You're thinking it hurt?

323
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,780
Mom.

324
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:15,120
"Happy of the End"
