1
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,500
Kashiwagi-san!

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,040
Oh, Komori-san, what's up?

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,640
I'm heading home.

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,100
Want to walk together?

5
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:16,380
Ah. Sure.

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,140
Are you headed this way too?

7
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,300
Ah… I have a stop to make on the way!

8
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:24,940
I see.

9
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,760
Well, I'm living with my partner.

10
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,620
Oh… I see.

11
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,540
- Ah.
- I see.

12
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:41,840
Umm...

13
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,639
Hey, isn't that Chihiro-kun?

14
00:00:56,663 --> 00:00:57,936
Are you heading home now?

15
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,200
Who's this cute girl next to you?

16
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,120
I'll give you a ride home.

17
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:04,260
Get in.

18
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,570
(Episode 7)

19
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:09,773
Come on, get in.

20
00:01:09,789 --> 00:01:11,056
Your friend can come too!

21
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,540
You live around here, right?

22
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,500
Komori Misato, right?

23
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:16,950
I recognize that uniform.

24
00:01:16,975 --> 00:01:19,762
Kitayama Girls' High. So cute!

25
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:22,715
- How do you...
- Leave her out of this.

26
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:24,456
She has nothing to do with this.

27
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,440
Of course she does.

28
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:29,100
- No, she doesn't.
- Well, she's here with you, isn't she?

29
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:34,000
- Maya-san…
- Huh?

30
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,000
Shut up, you!

31
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,240
So, are you two getting in, or not?

32
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,300
I'll get in by myself.

33
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:47,665
Okay, then get in.

34
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:49,399
Open the door yourself and get in.

35
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,180
Hey, old man! Say hello!

36
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,700
Y-yes.

37
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,920
H-hello.

38
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,920
Go.

39
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,200
This is seriously terrible.

40
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,600
Want some?

41
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,420
I don't want it.

42
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,912
It's not about what you want.

43
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,356
Hold it because it's in the way.

44
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:41,740
- Ah, yes.
- I wasn't talking to you!

45
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,500
- Here, drink it!
- Wait,

46
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,440
- Here!
- This is alcohol...

47
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,200
- Drink it! Drink and die, come on!
- It's spilling! Wait!

48
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,640
- Drink up, come on!
- Wait, wait, stop, stop!

49
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:58,000
"Happy of the End"

50
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:12,580
So, you're gay with Hayato, right?

51
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,433
Just being a man is already

52
00:04:16,449 --> 00:04:18,316
considered an advantage in life.

53
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,940
The only thing you've got going for you

54
00:04:19,965 --> 00:04:21,028
is being a little tougher.

55
00:04:21,053 --> 00:04:22,415
Hayato is no longer useful at all.

56
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,029
I kept trying to find better ways

57
00:04:26,054 --> 00:04:27,779
to sell him.

58
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,670
But anything that pays well is

59
00:04:30,694 --> 00:04:32,776
already monopolized by smarter people.

60
00:04:32,801 --> 00:04:35,321
There's no room to get in!

61
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,570
I feel like everyone looks

62
00:04:42,594 --> 00:04:44,484
at me the same way.

63
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,140
I haven't done anything wrong.

64
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,172
I've never lynched anyone.

65
00:04:49,196 --> 00:04:50,736
Murder? Not a chance.

66
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,100
Robbery? Nah. Rape…

67
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,060
well, sure, but that's no big deal.

68
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,420
Hayato betrayed me too,

69
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,780
even though we were best friends.

70
00:05:01,805 --> 00:05:02,999
It's weird, right?

71
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,740
Only you think that way.

72
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,260
Huh?

73
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,960
He doesn't have a best friend like you.

74
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:21,160
Oi, Mamiya! Pull over!

75
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,420
That's impossible! We're on the highway.

76
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:25,420
- And we're heading to Chiba, right?
- Huh?

77
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,513
I said pull over!

78
00:05:26,538 --> 00:05:28,271
Do you want to get killed?

79
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:34,140
This cocky punk needs a lesson.

80
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:46,660
Hey, Mamiya, you're up.

81
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,720
Huh? I don't like it.

82
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,660
I don't want my hands to hurt either.

83
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:53,800
- Hurry up.
- Ah... Yes.

84
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,720
That hurts!

85
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,700
- You broke my hand!
- You're so bad at this, you know!

86
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,280
Like this!

87
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,200
- See?
- Oww!

88
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,000
Do it like this!

89
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,060
You bastard!

90
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:21,520
Don't get cocky.

91
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,600
- Come here old man.
- Huh?

92
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,440
Ah. No, no.

93
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,060
- Alright.
- Ah, ah.

94
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,940
Kashiwagi,

95
00:06:29,457 --> 00:06:30,940
suck this old man's cock.

96
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,981
Don't make a obvious disgusted face.

97
00:06:37,013 --> 00:06:38,317
I feel sorry for him.

98
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,965
You're a homosexual.

99
00:06:39,989 --> 00:06:41,301
You should be good at it.

100
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,504
You can call me Misato,

101
00:06:47,528 --> 00:06:49,208
the high school girl.

102
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,629
Suck it off, quickly!

103
00:07:05,793 --> 00:07:06,913
I'll film you.

104
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,060
Hey.

105
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,580
Hurry up!

106
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,980
Already left?

107
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,160
He switched shifts a bit ago...

108
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,740
I see.

109
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,405
Usually he comes home right after

110
00:07:38,422 --> 00:07:39,905
he finishes his part-time job.

111
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,340
So disgusting.

112
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,955
The old man can't get it up.

113
00:07:56,971 --> 00:07:58,165
You're awful!

114
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,560
You should try harder, old man!

115
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,580
This is so bad!

116
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,780
Hey Kashiwagi,

117
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,580
you should cry.

118
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,220
Okay, let's break his arm.

119
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:18,360
Mamiya, release him and hold him down.

120
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,760
Are you serious?

121
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:32,700
Old man, hold down this guy!

122
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,640
Hurry!

123
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,760
Dammit!

124
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,920
Lift him up a bit!

125
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,800
- I'm sorry...
- Dammit!

126
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:51,460
- Old man! Why did you let go?
- Ah, I'm sorry!

127
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,860
I missed!

128
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,720
I'm sorry!

129
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,280
That's enough. Let's do it.

130
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,880
Maya, I want to ask you something!

131
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:16,140
The pictures!

132
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,160
Why the frog?

133
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,020
Huh?

134
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,060
Frogs.

135
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,860
All of them are frogs.

136
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:28,520
Oh,

137
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,040
I have

138
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:33,900
always loved frogs.

139
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:35,989
When I was a kid,

140
00:09:36,013 --> 00:09:37,497
I shoved rocket fireworks up

141
00:09:37,522 --> 00:09:38,998
a frog's ass and lit it on fire,

142
00:09:39,023 --> 00:09:40,670
and it died a spectacular death with its

143
00:09:40,695 --> 00:09:42,051
internal organs scattered around.

144
00:09:42,076 --> 00:09:43,122
I thought I wish

145
00:09:43,146 --> 00:09:44,426
I could die

146
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,720
that way too.

147
00:09:47,965 --> 00:09:49,620
Respect!

148
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,500
I see.

149
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,240
Your guy will die today, though.

150
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,200
In a normal way.

151
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:10,960
No!

152
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,940
Hey, old man!

153
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,860
- Old man! Hey, old man!
- Help!

154
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,140
- Stop it! Hey!
- Someone! Help!

155
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,880
I'm going to kill you! Hey! Shut up!

156
00:10:25,746 --> 00:10:28,720
You old bastard, don't run away!

157
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,600
- Wow, amazing! What's that?
- Film it!

158
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,740
Damn kid! What the hell are you filming?

159
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,540
- Smile!
- Hey!

160
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,300
What the hell are you doing?

161
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:43,800
- This guy has a knife! I'm scared!
- I'm going to kill you! You bitch!

162
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,120
Run! Run! Uncle, uncle, uncle!

163
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,520
- What are you running away for?
- Uncle, uncle!

164
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:51,680
- Hey! You guys are in trouble!
- Help!

165
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,340
- Come here! I'm going to get you lot!
- He's got a knife!

166
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:59,560
I said come here! Don't look down on me!

167
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,091
I called the police!

168
00:11:01,677 --> 00:11:03,436
The police will be here soon!

169
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,028
This is bad, if I get busted again,

170
00:11:05,044 --> 00:11:06,035
I'm done for!

171
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:09,040
Let go of me! Mamiya, hey!

172
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,060
- I'm pulling the car around!
- Huh? You ordered you to?

173
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:25,320
- Stop, you idiot!
- Maya-san, if we keep this up...

174
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,520
Wait! I said stop, you bastard!

175
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,440
Just get in!

176
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,380
I told you to stop, damn it!

177
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,300
Help me!

178
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,340
Help me!

179
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:57,640
Yo.

180
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:01,680
Kaji.

181
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:06,760
Keito's outside.

182
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,400
But are you alright, man?

183
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,715
It's not broken,

184
00:12:14,731 --> 00:12:15,973
but there's a big crack...

185
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,560
There were a lot of cops.

186
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,919
They said something about

187
00:12:25,943 --> 00:12:26,997
pressing charges...

188
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,160
I don't really get it.

189
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,380
I don't hear much about this.

190
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,383
More like you've never

191
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:34,438
heard of it at all.

192
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,960
Hey, Keito. Get in here already.

193
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:17,820
I'm sorry.

194
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,740
That necklace...

195
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:25,780
I lost it.

196
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,340
It's fine.

197
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:32,740
It's okay, Chihiro.

198
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,240
Haoren.

199
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,620
We're running low on food, aren't we?

200
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,520
Ah, I already asked Kaji to get some.

201
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,100
Yeah.

202
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,680
Alright.

203
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:11,540
Water?

204
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,520
Here. I'll get it for you.

205
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,240
I can handle this much.

206
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:16,760
It's fine.

207
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,940
What?

208
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:36,060
Oh... I was just looking.

209
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,060
Don't stare.

210
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,040
Sorry.

211
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,840
Sorry.

212
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,120
There was an eyelash on your face.

213
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:07,640
Really?

214
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,120
Thanks.

215
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,460
Are you scared?

216
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:23,543
That's enough. Let's do it.

217
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,120
Yeah.

218
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,580
Just a little.

219
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:01,520
Here. A week's worth.

220
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,820
- Thanks.
- Mhm.

221
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,684
How's Chihiro?

222
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,083
I'd like to see him at least.

223
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,140
He's fine.

224
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,900
You should go home.

225
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:16,580
What?

226
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,468
- Just let me see his face for a sec.
- Go home.

227
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,860
Haa...

228
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,780
Is everything really alright?

229
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:31,200
- I said he's fine.
- No.

230
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,500
I mean you.

231
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,400
I'm fine.

232
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,420
I'll call you later.

233
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,140
Hey!

234
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,160
Chihiro!

235
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,560
Huh?

236
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:22,820
Weren't you crying just now?

237
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:24,920
I wasn't crying.

238
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,760
Sorry. Never mind.

239
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:33,600
- Yeah.
- This is the food I got from Kaji.

240
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,140
Oh, thank you.

241
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:36,800
Kaji?

242
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:42,260
- He left in a hurry.
- What the? That's cold.

243
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,940
It's your fault.

244
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,720
Chihiro.

245
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,800
- Huh?
- What did you just say?

246
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,100
Nothing.

247
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:00,900
Right.

248
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,200
You're a bit strange.

249
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,240
It's your fault.

250
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,440
It's because of you that I'm like this.

251
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,503
It's because of you that

252
00:18:42,527 --> 00:18:43,635
this happened to me.

253
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,740
Chihiro.

254
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,600
Chihiro.

255
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:53,720
Chihiro!

256
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,220
Huh?

257
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:01,620
What is it, Haoren?

258
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,560
It's nothing.

259
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,080
Huh?

260
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,160
What are you watching?

261
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,500
Pandas mating!

262
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,460
What?

263
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,195
I need the phone to check a recipe.

264
00:19:44,218 --> 00:19:45,416
Can you hand it over?

265
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,500
Huh?

266
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,520
Hurry up.

267
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:53,420
Ah.

268
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,880
I'll just smoke, then.

269
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,320
Give it to me.

270
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,480
Ah.

271
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:07,580
Here.

272
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,420
Thanks.

273
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,180
Here.

274
00:20:31,507 --> 00:20:33,287
Smoke outside.

275
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:35,840
Yes. Yes.

276
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:37,040
Alright.

277
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:56,420
(Easy menu in ten minutes
unlimited boiled cabbage)

278
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:58,680
(Maya: Sent you a clip)

279
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,740
(Maya: Sent you a clip)

280
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:07,740
(Don't joke, it's because of you)

281
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:40,000
Haoren, I want to buy some cigarettes.

282
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,680
I'll get them later.

283
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,820
Yay!

284
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:05,420
(I want to meet and
apologize for the past)

285
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:07,420
(Where are you?)

286
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,980
Mhmm...

287
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,940
Hayato!

288
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:30,920
Hey.

289
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,600
Check this out! It's bad, right?

290
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,912
If they find out I've been

291
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:37,006
messing around,

292
00:22:37,031 --> 00:22:38,215
I'm dead for sure this time.

293
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,680
Mamiya got busted,

294
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,685
I told him not to do anything unnecessary.

295
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:44,982
They're scary, man, those guys.

296
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,967
You've cut ties with

297
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:50,672
Kashiwagi-kun, right?

298
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:54,655
He caused all that trouble

299
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,440
with the cops,

300
00:22:56,465 --> 00:22:59,065
and now I've ended up looking like this.

301
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,560
Why Chihiro?

302
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,480
The one who should apologize is me.

303
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,380
Why?

304
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:12,520
I didn't really think about it.

305
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:14,820
But why?

306
00:23:17,276 --> 00:23:19,580
Maybe just because you were with him?

307
00:23:22,207 --> 00:23:23,567
Maya,

308
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:27,317
if it weren't for you,

309
00:23:27,653 --> 00:23:29,720
my life wouldn't be like this.

310
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,120
Are you serious?

311
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:33,580
We're the same.

312
00:23:34,201 --> 00:23:38,280
You and me. Always have been.

313
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,860
Huh?

314
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,200
Doesn't hurt!

315
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,560
I'm good to go!

316
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,060
Oh.

317
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:04,280
Ha...

318
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,060
Haoren's taking a while...

319
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:23,140
S-stop, stop, stop...

320
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:25,720
Stop, stop...

321
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:27,040
Stop...

322
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,180
Hayato,

323
00:24:39,971 --> 00:24:42,420
we're the same, aren't we?

324
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:48,880
No, don't kill me. Spare my life.

325
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,000
Hayato, you...

326
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:59,520
Hayato!

327
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,740
(Next episode)

328
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,140
Let's run away.

329
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,920
Let's go together.

330
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:10,600
Are you thinking that...

331
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,975
Just let go of me here.

332
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,084
I don't want to get involved

333
00:25:13,092 --> 00:25:13,996
with Chihiro anymore.

334
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:15,100
"Happy of the End"
