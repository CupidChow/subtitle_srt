00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:05,080
(Episode 2)

2
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:07,522
I'm on the run.

3
00:00:08,562 --> 00:00:10,421
I was being chased since yesterday.

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,860
I didn't realize that yesterday

5
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,020
was closing in on me.

6
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:23,980
What are you looking at?

7
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,740
Nothing.

8
00:00:27,921 --> 00:00:29,200
Just people.

9
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:37,080
Doesn't it piss you off?

10
00:00:37,593 --> 00:00:38,858
They get everything,

11
00:00:38,882 --> 00:00:40,576
where they live, their families.

12
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,185
Except for you,

13
00:00:42,616 --> 00:00:43,803
no one else has gotten it

14
00:00:43,827 --> 00:00:44,889
without struggling.

15
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,600
The things that you want,

16
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,840
of course they have it all.

17
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:54,040
That guy, that guy, and that guy.

18
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,820
Doesn't it make you want to kill them?

19
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,680
I don't get it.

20
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,020
The things that I want,

21
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,960
even if I kill them, I won't get them.

22
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:13,440
Really? Ohhh.

23
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,280
You're so dark.

24
00:01:18,807 --> 00:01:20,221
Thinking about it is the end.

25
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:21,446
Stop thinking.

26
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,240
Keito.

27
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:36,800
What's wrong?

28
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,320
Nothing.

29
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,680
Hey.

30
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:45,020
It's been two weeks since I came here.

31
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:47,500
Can I stay a little longer?

32
00:01:49,564 --> 00:01:51,084
If you want to stay, then stay.

33
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:55,340
Ah, mhm.

34
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,560
Hey!

35
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,640
Oh? You're still here?

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,200
- Yeah.
- Well, whatever. Let's drink.

37
00:02:05,351 --> 00:02:07,800
- I brought some fun for you.
- Hello, hello, hello, hello.

38
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,380
- Okay, okay, okay, come on, come on.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

39
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,680
He's already started drinking.

40
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:14,440
- Hey... Here.
- Oh, is that okay?

41
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,520
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

42
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,880
- Come on, let's go!
- Yes, yes.

43
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,120
Come.

44
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:27,920
"Happy of the End"

45
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,880
Ahh! Delicious!

46
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:35,900
Ah...

47
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:37,820
Here.

48
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,760
Thanks.

49
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,660
Huh?

50
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,000
Are you two... like that?

51
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,480
No, it's not like that.

52
00:03:48,075 --> 00:03:50,115
He has no place to go.

53
00:03:50,904 --> 00:03:52,341
You're a leech, right?

54
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:53,552
Go back to your pimp.

55
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,100
I can't go back. I've got nowhere to go.

56
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,880
I'm pitiful.

57
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,300
What about your family?

58
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,780
Impossible. I've been disowned.

59
00:04:01,998 --> 00:04:04,800
Oh, you poor thing.

60
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,660
You're homeless.

61
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,640
- Drink, drink.
- Let's drink, drink.

62
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,880
So, what's your deal with Keito?

63
00:04:20,905 --> 00:04:22,638
Are you his boyfriend?

64
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:26,740
Idiot, I've got a girlfriend.

65
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,040
Mhm.

66
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:28,800
Here.

67
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,920
- Emika.
- Oh, she's cute.

68
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,480
Right?

69
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,840
- Kaji's just fooling around with a hostess.
- Ah.

70
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,364
She's not his girlfriend.

71
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,591
That's against the rules.

72
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,145
That's why I'm going

73
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:43,790
to quit being a driver

74
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,309
and started recruiting to

75
00:04:45,334 --> 00:04:47,134
save up for my ramen shop.

76
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,500
Then I'll marry Emika.

77
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:53,989
I don't think Emika's going to

78
00:04:53,997 --> 00:04:54,936
quit her job, though.

79
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,820
Huh?

80
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,880
It seems to be that way!

81
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,240
- Oww, that hurts!
- Shut up, you!

82
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,883
You're just an the former fling

83
00:05:03,907 --> 00:05:05,236
of a friend with benefits.

84
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:06,461
A scrub who leeches off

85
00:05:06,469 --> 00:05:07,896
someone who has beaten you.

86
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,820
Why are you such a garbage?

87
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,800
It was in the past...

88
00:05:15,094 --> 00:05:16,980
Because it didn't matter anymore?

89
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:21,234
The guy I dated for four years

90
00:05:21,259 --> 00:05:22,939
suddenly got married.

91
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,656
He was two-timing me with a woman...

92
00:05:25,688 --> 00:05:26,820
and he had the nerve

93
00:05:26,836 --> 00:05:28,422
to invite me to the wedding

94
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,880
at this beautiful church.

95
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:34,280
And you went?

96
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,800
What did you say? Did you cause a scene?

97
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,400
I said something.

98
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,800
Like, 'Congrats...'

99
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,220
Whoa...

100
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,034
When I saw the happy face

101
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:48,570
of the one I loved,

102
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,000
all I could say was 'congratulations'...

103
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,680
Ugh,

104
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,160
I'm going to sleep.

105
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,440
Haa...

106
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,760
Go ahead, sleep.

107
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,400
- Cheers, cheers.
- Cheers.

108
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,680
Hey,

109
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:11,960
hey.

110
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:13,980
- Hey.
- Huh?

111
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,420
- Get up.
- Hmm?

112
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,680
- Get up.
- Mhm.

113
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,390
Let's taking the old man away.

114
00:06:19,413 --> 00:06:20,773
He's in the way.

115
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:22,020
Alright.

116
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,060
Come grab him quickly.

117
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,940
- Let's go, old man.
- Huh?

118
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,880
Yeah, yeah.

119
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,760
Oww.

120
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,880
Heavy!

121
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,860
Where's Keito?

122
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,340
He left for some business.

123
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,350
Seriously, there's nothing

124
00:06:39,367 --> 00:06:40,596
between you guys?

125
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:41,940
Nope.

126
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,366
I just introduced him

127
00:06:43,391 --> 00:06:44,869
to a job a long time ago.

128
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,760
Now, we're just drinking buddies.

129
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,460
Oh.

130
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,980
But it's rare.

131
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,100
For him to live with someone.

132
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,180
Really?

133
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,020
He's usually alone.

134
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,100
- Aren't you his friend?
- Not like that.

135
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,862
I met him once about ten years ago

136
00:07:02,887 --> 00:07:05,740
when he was around 15, almost 16.

137
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,553
Then we didn't see each

138
00:07:07,561 --> 00:07:08,976
other for a long time

139
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,940
until two years ago.

140
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,060
I introduced him to his current job.

141
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:17,420
- Hey, we're here.
- Huh? Thank you.

142
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:19,940
- Roll inside.
- 26 years old?

143
00:07:20,456 --> 00:07:23,040
- Keito is the same age as me.
- Haa...

144
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,175
Let's go. I'll buy you some

145
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:26,396
booze and cigarettes.

146
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,300
- Really?
- Yeah.

147
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,360
- Thanks a lot.
- Yup.

148
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:29,260
Here.

149
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,480
- Goodbye.
- See you.

150
00:07:35,645 --> 00:07:38,440
- Hey, Rina-chan.
- Oh, thank you as always.

151
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,660
- Sure.
- Come by again.

152
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:40,640
Sure, sure.

153
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,580
- Rin-chan. You look great today.
- Oh, hello.

154
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:46,300
- Thank you. I'll be waiting.
- Bye.

155
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,100
- Saya.
- Hey.

156
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,260
- Cool.
- Cool. Come by again.

157
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,100
See you.

158
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,200
- Hey, Kaji.
- Huh?

159
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,340
Isn't that Keito?

160
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,240
Ah, that's Keito's mom.

161
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,580
Hmm?

162
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:08,240
He's giving her money.

163
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,745
Well,

164
00:08:09,761 --> 00:08:11,526
I don't know if she's his real mom.

165
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,760
Here, Mom.

166
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,900
Oh, thank you, thank you as always.

167
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:26,360
- Thank you.
- Oh. He's giving her money.

168
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,760
Haa...

169
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,130
She is a Yakuza's woman who was

170
00:08:33,146 --> 00:08:35,083
beaten until her brain was scrambled.

171
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:36,840
She's well-known.

172
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,674
I bet she's just pretending

173
00:08:39,706 --> 00:08:42,041
to remember who Keito is.

174
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:44,620
Let's go.

175
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,040
Will I accomplish it?

176
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:50,677
I guess it's not something

177
00:08:50,701 --> 00:08:51,901
you can choose.

178
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,600
I didn't know he could look so kind.

179
00:09:00,067 --> 00:09:03,867
- Hey, let's go.
- Yeah, yeah.

180
00:09:21,792 --> 00:09:23,708
You smell like booze...

181
00:09:24,544 --> 00:09:26,224
Did you drink too much?

182
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:31,620
Kaji bought me some.

183
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,160
Just because it was free,

184
00:09:34,168 --> 00:09:35,300
you drank too much...

185
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:37,040
Do you have a condom?

186
00:09:37,738 --> 00:09:39,520
Nope, don't have one.

187
00:09:40,075 --> 00:09:43,235
Why? I told you to buy some.

188
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,920
I told you, I'm broke... Ah...

189
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,320
I see.

190
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,200
Huh?

191
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,000
You're stopping?

192
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,940
Wouldn't it be troublesome without one?

193
00:10:04,338 --> 00:10:05,440
You...

194
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,200
Well... Mhm.

195
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,360
You've lost weight.

196
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,820
My diet sucks.

197
00:10:24,598 --> 00:10:26,082
I only eat once a day,

198
00:10:26,114 --> 00:10:27,817
and it's usually just cup noodles.

199
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,060
Huh?

200
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,293
But you eat with me when I

201
00:10:31,309 --> 00:10:32,644
have cup noodles, right?

202
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,400
You don't eat anything besides that?

203
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,020
Because I don't have any money.

204
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,780
At least make something for yourself.

205
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,960
Huh! I can cook for myself?

206
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:47,400
Huh?

207
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,920
Why are you tagging along, Keito?

208
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,000
Because I'm buying the ingredients.

209
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,298
If you give me the money,

210
00:10:57,322 --> 00:10:58,496
I can do the shopping.

211
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,420
Three thousand yen is more than enough.

212
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,540
Is cooking for yourself that cheap?

213
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,920
You've never done it?

214
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,540
Hey...

215
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:10,980
Ah.

216
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,020
Haa...

217
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:24,040
Hey, stop throwing useless stuff in.

218
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,340
Snacks.

219
00:11:25,467 --> 00:11:27,707
You couldn't finish it! Put them back!

220
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,340
I'm going to finish them.

221
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,480
You couldn't finish this much.

222
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,860
There, that's enough.

223
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:39,820
Hey!

224
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,600
Whoa. Seriously?

225
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:46,600
This is amazing!

226
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,300
I've been living alone for a long time.

227
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:50,920
Let's eat.

228
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:52,900
Bon appetit.

229
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:07,020
What's with that reaction? Is it bad?

230
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,140
I don't know.

231
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:11,520
Huh?

232
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,661
It's bland and not as good as

233
00:12:15,686 --> 00:12:17,286
what you get at a restaurant,

234
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,580
but it's delicious.

235
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,480
What's with you?

236
00:12:23,287 --> 00:12:24,547
Which is it?

237
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,640
I don't know.

238
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:28,980
That's annoying.

239
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:47,190
Other than Keito having a mother,

240
00:12:47,206 --> 00:12:49,377
I don't know anything about him.

241
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,880
And that mother too…

242
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,112
I don't even know if Keito's age,

243
00:13:06,128 --> 00:13:07,128
his name,

244
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:09,300
or anything else is true.

245
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:14,540
So why do I care so much about him?

246
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,920
What are you doing?

247
00:13:28,384 --> 00:13:30,684
Work. Data on women.

248
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:33,360
Ah, scouting, huh?

249
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,880
Don't waste them.

250
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,180
I'm looking for a favorite.

251
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,340
What do you want to eat tomorrow?

252
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,520
Mhm...

253
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,020
Omelette rice.

254
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,580
Are you a kid?

255
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:58,640
- Can't do it?
- No, it's easy.

256
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,220
That's settled then.

257
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,600
What ingredients do we have…

258
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,860
Oh yeah, we don't have ketchup.

259
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,660
And we're out of onions too.

260
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:39,801
What? Why are you suddenly

261
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:40,903
getting all touchy?

262
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,600
It's gross.

263
00:14:43,527 --> 00:14:45,607
No. I didn't mean to.

264
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,400
- You see...
- I know.

265
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,640
I won't do it again.

266
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,020
I'll take it.

267
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,140
It's no use.

268
00:15:01,987 --> 00:15:03,080
I don't want anyone

269
00:15:03,088 --> 00:15:04,400
getting inside my heart.

270
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,480
No ketchup.

271
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,440
Can't be helped.

272
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,220
Just eat.

273
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,940
The rice inside is plain white too.

274
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,460
Chihiro, give me your hand.

275
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,620
Huh?

276
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,460
What's this?

277
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,180
A toy that came with the snacks.

278
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,560
I can see that.

279
00:15:58,686 --> 00:16:00,201
Why are you giving it to me?

280
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,860
It's a present.

281
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,580
For me?

282
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,220
It's so lame.

283
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,940
It suits you.

284
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,140
Shut up.

285
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:54,880
Ah, I forgot to buy ham. Damn it.

286
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:02,960
Hmm?

287
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,440
Keito's mother?

288
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,300
What's wrong? Why are you here?

289
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,246
She is a Yakuza's woman who was

290
00:17:20,271 --> 00:17:22,400
beaten until her brain was scrambled.

291
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:25,105
I bet she's just pretending

292
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:26,810
to remember who Keito is.

293
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,220
It's dangerous here.

294
00:17:33,558 --> 00:17:36,260
- Let's move...
- No!

295
00:17:44,936 --> 00:17:46,656
Mom.

296
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,700
So she really is your mother.

297
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:54,786
I was just taking a walk when I

298
00:17:54,811 --> 00:17:56,225
saw her sitting in the road.

299
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,980
- Look, the building is collapsing!
- Mom!

300
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:00,280
- It's collapsing! Look, it's collapsing!
- Mom, calm down! Please!

301
00:18:06,194 --> 00:18:07,314
Mom.

302
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:13,320
Mom, it's me.

303
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,200
It's no use.

304
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:21,641
When she's like this,

305
00:18:21,697 --> 00:18:23,016
we have to leave her alone.

306
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,460
Here like this?

307
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,900
What if something happens?

308
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,000
- Let's move, okay?
- No, no!

309
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,080
- It's okay, calm down!
- No, no, no!

310
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,940
Hold on! I'm calling them!

311
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,200
Hurry up!

312
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,200
Calm down!

313
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,340
Mom,

314
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,840
please sit down.

315
00:18:46,812 --> 00:18:48,352
I'm sorry.

316
00:18:54,927 --> 00:18:58,487
I'm sorry for the trouble we caused.

317
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,100
Who was that?

318
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,692
The manager of the place

319
00:19:08,717 --> 00:19:10,270
where my mom used to work.

320
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,420
I don't know what their relationship is.

321
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,260
I see.

322
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,420
Haa... I'm exhausted.

323
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,840
Let's just go home.

324
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,271
Sorry. I have something to do,

325
00:19:26,296 --> 00:19:27,656
so you go ahead.

326
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,200
Huh?

327
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,260
You don't have any plans.

328
00:19:31,527 --> 00:19:33,267
Even I have a few.

329
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,620
Oh, and buy some ham at the store.

330
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,320
Yeah.

331
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,320
Plans?

332
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,000
But he doesn't even have any friends.

333
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,200
Ah.

334
00:19:55,348 --> 00:19:57,988
I don't know what kind of ham to buy.

335
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:02,020
Hey!

336
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:04,780
Ah.

337
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:07,740
- What are you doing?
- Why...

338
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:22,197
Chihiro, you lost the toy I gave you,

339
00:20:22,222 --> 00:20:23,222
didn't you?

340
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:26,520
It seems like it flew off earlier.

341
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,580
It was just a piece of junk.

342
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,500
No, it isn't.

343
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:22,128
- Hey, Chihiro.
- Yeah?

344
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,200
Oh.

345
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,160
- Is it broken?
- Yeah.

346
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,880
Okay, it's fixed.

347
00:21:37,147 --> 00:21:38,187
Huh?

348
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:39,720
Here.

349
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,600
Thank you.

350
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,540
What?

351
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:04,800
It suits you.

352
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:07,100
Shut up.

353
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,600
Thanks for today.

354
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,600
Hmm?

355
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,700
You're the one who found it.

356
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,820
It's not about that.

357
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:30,060
About my mother.

358
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,360
Oh.

359
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,297
Mom came from China and

360
00:22:45,313 --> 00:22:46,773
worked in the sex industry.

361
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:53,000
♪ Twinkle, Twinkle, Twinkle Star ♪

362
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,318
- ♪ How I wonder what you are ♪
- I'm apparently the child of

363
00:22:55,342 --> 00:22:57,022
one of her customers,

364
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,800
- ♪ Up above the world so high ♪
- but I lived with her when I was little.

365
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,700
- ♪ Like a diamond in the sky ♪
- For many reasons, we became estranged.

366
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:04,340
Take care of yourself.

367
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:15,280
When I was 15 I was looking for a job.

368
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,660
The black card that you stole...

369
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:28,940
That card is a membership card.

370
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,910
I guess it's some kind of sex industry

371
00:23:32,918 --> 00:23:34,152
specializing in minors.

372
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,980
A child's skin is really nice.

373
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:44,180
It feels so good.

374
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,140
I used to work there.

375
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:52,080
It doesn't hurt.

376
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,500
It only hurts if you think it does!

377
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,796
It would be a disaster

378
00:23:59,821 --> 00:24:01,655
if someone took that card.

379
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,080
Even so...

380
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:10,460
Using a vibrator to hit me is too much.

381
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:14,540
Don't laugh.

382
00:24:18,355 --> 00:24:19,775
Your mom…

383
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,360
And you too…

384
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,140
you're both Chinese, huh?

385
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,280
It's not Keito.

386
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,700
Huh?

387
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:35,900
Haoren.

388
00:24:36,674 --> 00:24:38,287
My real name.

389
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,400
Haoren.

390
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,560
Yeah. Remember it.

391
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,300
Yeah.

392
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,940
Haoren.

393
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,720
(Next episode)

394
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,940
We'll be together forever.

395
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,480
Turn around.

396
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,680
Put it in yourself and move it yourself.

397
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:14,060
You've been trash all along, haven't you?

398
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:15,280
"Happy of the End"
