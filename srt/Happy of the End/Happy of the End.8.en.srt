1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,140
Maya,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,265
if it weren't for you,

3
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:07,937
my life wouldn't be like this.

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:10,940
Are you serious?

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:12,340
We're the same.

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,280
You and me. Always have been.

7
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,220
S-stop, stop, stop...

8
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:39,820
Stop, stop...

9
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:41,040
Stop...

10
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,320
Hayato,

11
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,720
we're the same, aren't we?

12
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:03,000
No, don't kill me. Spare my life.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,180
Hayato, you...

14
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,640
Hayato!

15
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:18,000
"Happy of the End"

16
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,220
Oh, Haoren.

17
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:26,480
Hmm?

18
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,660
Hey, what happened?

19
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,980
I stabbed him.

20
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,320
I wanted to kill Maya.

21
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,540
Huh?

22
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,000
I need to get rid of this.

23
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,920
Is Maya dead?

24
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,060
I don't know.

25
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,580
We need to run.

26
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:05,680
Huh?

27
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,340
We have to we have to escape somewhere.

28
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,460
- Where?
- I don't know!

29
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:14,320
Somewhere far away!

30
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:21,780
Let's go.

31
00:03:22,558 --> 00:03:23,880
Together.

32
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,900
But how do we escape?

33
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,234
Trains...

34
00:03:31,259 --> 00:03:33,055
there are cameras at the station...

35
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,600
- buses, taxis...
- There's a place

36
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,180
I want to go with you.

37
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:45,720
(Episode 8)

38
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,440
The ocean is amazing!

39
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,120
The waves are huge.

40
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,180
And it even has an aroma!

41
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:55,820
Haoren.

42
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,940
It's my first time seeing the sea.

43
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,960
I've always wanted to come here.

44
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:07,140
It's all moving, the whole thing.

45
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,220
Where is this?

46
00:04:11,371 --> 00:04:12,540
Oarai.

47
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,547
I came here on a school field trip

48
00:04:14,571 --> 00:04:15,856
when I was in elementary school.

49
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,940
What's here?

50
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,460
Shirasu rice bowls, dolphin shows...

51
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,360
and the sea.

52
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,480
Then let's do it all.

53
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:28,600
Yeah.

54
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,940
Hey, don't trip!

55
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:37,260
Bon appétit.

56
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,380
- Delicious.
- So delicious, right?

57
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:47,580
You're not eating?

58
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,480
I'm just not feeling it.

59
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,180
Then can I have it?

60
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,460
Yeah.

61
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,840
Mmm, it's good.

62
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,200
You're eating a lot today.

63
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,920
So cute.

64
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:16,540
The dolphin has the sea lion on its back!

65
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,360
What a spectacular performance!

66
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,580
Wow!

67
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,280
It's not coming again?

68
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:51,960
Here it comes again, here it comes!

69
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,900
What the heck is this?

70
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,200
Amazing!

71
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,880
- You're totally soaked!
- You're soaked!

72
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:06,860
Are you nervous?

73
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,240
Whoa, it's scary!

74
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:11,600
Okay, let's go. One, two, three!

75
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,320
Whoa, that's amazing!

76
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,840
It's incredible.

77
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:33,420
The sea lion's hand felt like rubber.

78
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,960
More like a tire.

79
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:37,959
It wasn't that hard.

80
00:06:37,983 --> 00:06:39,530
If you bit into it hard enough,

81
00:06:39,538 --> 00:06:41,475
you could probably gnaw through it.

82
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,800
What are you talking about?

83
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:50,660
Haa...

84
00:06:52,684 --> 00:06:56,700
I don't regret stabbing Maya.

85
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,940
I...

86
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,000
I'm having fun right now.

87
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,320
Being with you...

88
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,440
Look at that light.

89
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:37,620
It's beautiful.

90
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,920
I could take a great photo here.

91
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,300
Yeah.

92
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,320
Once my arm heals, I'll go back to work.

93
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:53,220
I'll buy a camera,

94
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,140
and aim to be a photographer again.

95
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,520
That's great.

96
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,560
You can do it. I believe in you.

97
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,880
First, I need to save some money.

98
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,140
You can do anything.

99
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,840
You can go anywhere,

100
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,500
and you'll survive anywhere.

101
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,877
The only thing stopping you from

102
00:08:26,893 --> 00:08:28,072
going anywhere is me.

103
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:33,640
Chihiro!

104
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,400
Huh?

105
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,280
You don't have to worry anymore!

106
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,480
No one will ever get in your way again!

107
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,300
Haoren.

108
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,960
Haoren!

109
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,400
Haoren!

110
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,260
Haoren!

111
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:56,820
Alright, there's no one here. Lucky.

112
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,931
Let's just hop on the next train

113
00:09:58,948 --> 00:09:59,948
that comes.

114
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:06,860
Huh...

115
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:08,920
You're not getting on?

116
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,300
What are you talking about?

117
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,900
I'm done running.

118
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,460
No way.

119
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,260
You also want this.

120
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,040
That's weird.

121
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:34,940
You said we'd run together!

122
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:41,660
Are you telling me you're...

123
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,060
By yourself...

124
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:47,760
I won't die.

125
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,440
I'll turn myself in and pay for my crimes.

126
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,480
Just let go of me here.

127
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,075
I don't want to drag you

128
00:11:00,091 --> 00:11:01,098
into this anymore.

129
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,740
We'll see each other again, right?

130
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,260
You won't die, right?

131
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,660
You'll contact me!

132
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:44,120
Go.

133
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,940
Promise me you'll contact me.

134
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,060
Promise me.

135
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,340
I'll come get you!

136
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,660
Thank you, Chihiro!

137
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:13,020
Think of the memories you have with me,

138
00:12:14,599 --> 00:12:15,940
then forget about me!

139
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:19,960
Huh?

140
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,440
Wait,

141
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:24,760
what do you mean by that?

142
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,300
Hey! Hey!

143
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,940
Haoren!

144
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:31,560
Haoren!

145
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:34,900
Wait!

146
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,060
Hey!

147
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:39,440
Dammit!

148
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,840
Haoren!

149
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,660
Haoren!

150
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,880
What do you mean?

151
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,680
Haoren!

152
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:50,740
Haoren! What are you doing?

153
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:54,500
Stop! Please stop!

154
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,320
(Three Years Later)

155
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,240
Yes, this is Kashiwagi.

156
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:37,098
The rehearsal the day after tomorrow…

157
00:13:37,106 --> 00:13:38,418
for the pamphlet shoot…

158
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,680
I can make it.

159
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,220
Thank you.

160
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,500
- Ah, that's good.
- Okay.

161
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,500
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- I'll be in your care.

162
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,380
Yes.

163
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,980
I'll take a picture now.

164
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:56,460
Yeah.

165
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,000
- So cute.
- Yeah, so cute.

166
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Yeah.

167
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,540
- Can we get a bit more smile here?
- Sure.

168
00:14:06,268 --> 00:14:07,690
- I worked like crazy, saved up,
- Great.

169
00:14:07,715 --> 00:14:08,722
and bought a camera.

170
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,940
- I didn't want to assist other pros
- Mhmm.

171
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,180
- because of my trauma,
- Very cute.

172
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,160
- but I pitched myself
- One more photo.

173
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,020
to any industries.

174
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,180
- I took any job I could, bit by bit,
- Oh.

175
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,605
I started getting more work.

176
00:14:18,622 --> 00:14:19,596
Now, I'm pretty busy.

177
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:20,620
Yes. Done.

178
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,360
Oh yeah, what's this? Your Instagram?

179
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:37,380
- Don't look through it without asking!
- What's the big deal? It's public!

180
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,119
So sparkling.

181
00:14:40,135 --> 00:14:41,174
I want to go to

182
00:14:41,198 --> 00:14:42,196
these beautiful cafes too.

183
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,420
It's for networking.

184
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,845
In case I can get jobs

185
00:14:44,853 --> 00:14:45,976
from social media.

186
00:14:46,016 --> 00:14:47,438
Ah, yeah, you were shooting

187
00:14:47,447 --> 00:14:48,856
influencers and stuff.

188
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,640
Yeah.

189
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,840
Oh, by the way,

190
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,720
did you hear about Maya?

191
00:14:55,006 --> 00:14:56,888
Huh? No.

192
00:14:57,779 --> 00:14:59,607
After that, the guy went to a hospital

193
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:01,170
because he was taking drugs.

194
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:04,540
And shortly after leaving the hospital,

195
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,240
he jumped off a building

196
00:15:06,265 --> 00:15:07,334
and killed himself.

197
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,255
He left a suicide note, or something.

198
00:15:12,272 --> 00:15:13,952
Addressed it to his mom.

199
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,600
Written in this childish handwriting.

200
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:20,040
Thing is, the guy was an orphan.

201
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,940
He didn't even have any parents.

202
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:25,980
Yo.

203
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,520
I see…

204
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,040
Oh my!

205
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:39,960
It is Chi-chan!

206
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,220
And...

207
00:15:41,968 --> 00:15:43,668
- And... what, the agency guy, Kaji?
- So annoying.

208
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:49,560
- Still drinking at these cheap places?
- Shut it.

209
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,060
How's the new place?

210
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,360
What? Huh?

211
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,360
Matsuki-san helped me find an apartment.

212
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,480
It's very convenient.

213
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,440
Glad to hear it!

214
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:02,460
So… how about Hayato? Any word?

215
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:07,324
Well, if you're going to wait,

216
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,340
be patient.

217
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,680
Adieu!

218
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,460
Thank you.

219
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,040
Haa...

220
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:28,016
You still can't forget about him,

221
00:16:28,032 --> 00:16:29,032
can you?

222
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,760
I don't see any reason to forget him.

223
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,320
I still love him.

224
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,626
Don't you have any pictures

225
00:16:42,642 --> 00:16:43,939
of the guy or something?

226
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,260
No.

227
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,860
I only ever took one.

228
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,960
And it was terrible.

229
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,240
I want to take another shot.

230
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,400
If he's alive, I'm sure

231
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:01,642
you'll get your chance.

232
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,300
Here you go.

233
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,720
Thank you for everything.

234
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,880
Yeah.

235
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,963
I think I'll go on a date

236
00:18:15,987 --> 00:18:17,667
or enjoy the night view.

237
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:20,980
Huh?

238
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:25,020
- So you have a girlfriend?
- Geez, of course I do.

239
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,335
But I thought I could get back

240
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,726
together with her after release,

241
00:18:28,776 --> 00:18:30,362
but after getting out, she dumped me

242
00:18:30,378 --> 00:18:31,596
and cut off all contact.

243
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,940
She was a model, super cute too.

244
00:18:35,528 --> 00:18:36,691
What about you, Haoren-san?

245
00:18:36,692 --> 00:18:37,684
Had a girlfriend?

246
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,200
I probably won't see them again.

247
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,240
Right.

248
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,498
But even though you're an ex-convict,

249
00:18:46,523 --> 00:18:47,984
you're very popular.

250
00:18:48,008 --> 00:18:49,128
Since you're this handsome.

251
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:51,960
What are you saying?

252
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,380
I wonder what Chihiro is doing now.

253
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,920
I always think about it.

254
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:03,760
I really want to know one thing,

255
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,380
did his dream come true?

256
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,100
Who's that?

257
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,080
You scared me!

258
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:24,960
It's my ex.

259
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,340
Hmm?

260
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,220
She really was cute.

261
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,500
Did you think I was lying?

262
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:35,820
- You stalking her online?
- No.

263
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:36,899
Just checking in,

264
00:19:36,924 --> 00:19:38,604
making sure she's happy!

265
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,420
Looks like she is.

266
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:44,780
Geez.

267
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,060
Yasumoto, you got a delivery.

268
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,660
Coming!

Thank you, Takuya-san, for making me happy)

270

Today, we're taking wedding photos)

Thank you for the beautiful photos.)

Please take care of me.)

274
00:20:14,774 --> 00:20:16,100
Chihiro.

275
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,240
Haoren-san.

276
00:20:46,843 --> 00:20:48,468
If you want it delivered to the company,

277
00:20:48,493 --> 00:20:50,211
can't send it without a signature, right?

278
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,640
Oh. What's wrong?

00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:18,760

282
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,240
We shouldn't meet again.

283
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:34,360
I've made up my mind.

284
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,500
But

285
00:21:38,927 --> 00:21:40,286
what kind of things have

286
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:42,177
Chihiro seen since that day?

287
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,140
What kind of photos has he taken?

288
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,760
That's all I want to know.

289
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:01,240
Whoa, Haoren-san, looking sharp!

290
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:03,160
Meeting someone?

291
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,260
No, I'm going when no one's around.

292
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,460
Huh?

296
00:22:55,315 --> 00:22:56,590
So, this is what Chihiro

297
00:22:56,606 --> 00:22:57,886
has been seeing.

298
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,260
Keito,

299
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,480
try remembering your mother…

300
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:26,660
- Hey!
- Ah!

301
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:30,747
