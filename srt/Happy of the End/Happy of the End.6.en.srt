1
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:03,220
- Sorry to keep you waiting.
- Mhm.Thanks.

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:06,760
(Episode 6)

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:09,160
Here you go, duck feet.

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,440
Duck feet are the best.

5
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:17,980
You really like that stuff.

6
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,359
You've been drinking a lot lately.

7
00:00:22,368 --> 00:00:23,656
Got too much time on your hands?

8
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,539
Yeah, I broke up with my girlfriend,

9
00:00:25,547 --> 00:00:26,890
so I have a lot of time.

10
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,840
Got any mixers coming up?

11
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:30,860
- I'll go for you.
- Huh?

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,509
'Kashiwagi Chihiro, age 20.

13
00:00:32,534 --> 00:00:34,510
Works in consulting.'

14
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,420
That's all lies!

15
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:38,212
'I've broken up with my girlfriend

16
00:00:38,237 --> 00:00:39,610
and I'm looking for a new one.'

17
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,560
- Well...
- Liar.

18
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,560
You've got a live-in boyfriend.

19
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:47,690
- Huh?
- Huh?

20
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:49,820
Huh?

21
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:58,000
"Happy of the End"

22
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,140
Oww...

23
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,880
Haa...

24
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:07,120
Ah...

25
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,420
Haa...

26
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:10,880
Oww...

27
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,300
Don't throw up in the taxi.

28
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,820
I know.

29
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:24,980
But, you know…

30
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,960
Keito seemed happy, so that's good.

31
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:31,780
Huh?

32
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,920
If I hadn't

33
00:02:35,847 --> 00:02:37,327
sold him out to Maya,

34
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,500
he could've…

35
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,320
Haa...

36
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,420
Kaji. You've had too much to drink.

37
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,840
- Hey, hey, hey, hey… Hold on…
- Hey!

38
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:58,440
- I got a cab.
- Oh, Kaji, time to get up.

39
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,520
Yeah, yeah. I got it.

40
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,260
- Kaji, you've really had too much.
- Thanks. Three, four...

41
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,860
Alright.

42
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,180
- Oww...
- Haa...

43
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,000
- Sorry about this.
- It's fine.

44
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,340
Hey,

45
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:25,940
what was that earlier?

46
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,440
Duck feet?

47
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,380
No, idiot.

48
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,080
About the live-in boyfriend thing.

49
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:37,980
What?

50
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:40,960
Are we, like…

51
00:03:41,455 --> 00:03:43,495
dating?

52
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,400
Shut up.

53
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,720
Don't ask things you already know.

54
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,060
Huh?

55
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,380
It's important to clarify these things,

56
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,780
idiot.

57
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,240
Alright, alright.

58
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:02,980
I like you.

59
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,940
Will you go out with me?

60
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,260
Happy now?

61
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,620
I'll be in your care.

62
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,820
Clarification

63
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,320
is really important, huh…

64
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,120
I told you.

65
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,700
(Summer Purification Ceremony)

66
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,560
Ah.

67
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,509
You throw this into the offering box

68
00:04:37,517 --> 00:04:38,797
and make a wish.

69
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,080
- Make a wish?
- Yeah.

70
00:04:41,727 --> 00:04:43,547
Make a wish to God.

71
00:04:46,047 --> 00:04:47,587
Make a wish...

72
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,500
I hope I get way better at cooking,

73
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,240
find 10 million yen,

74
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:03,080
and a DSLR camera falls into my lap.

75
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:05,660
Also...

76
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:32,920
What's the matter?

77
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,760
I just made a wish earlier.

78
00:05:37,119 --> 00:05:38,272
I want to do it with Chihiro

79
00:05:38,297 --> 00:05:39,421
as soon as possible.

80
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,360
Wait a minute.

81
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,180
You should take your clothes off too.

82
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:04,700
No.

83
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:49,657
I really wish you'd take

84
00:06:49,682 --> 00:06:50,924
your clothes off too.

85
00:06:52,557 --> 00:06:53,620
Huh?

86
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,350
It's not fair that I'm the

87
00:06:55,366 --> 00:06:56,779
only one being undressed.

88
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,460
I'll take them off when I feel like it.

89
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,100
Was it like this with your ex too?

90
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,040
What's that about?

91
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,297
Do you think

92
00:07:15,322 --> 00:07:17,255
I'm not worth undressing for?

93
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,203
It doesn't matter what

94
00:07:20,227 --> 00:07:21,907
I was like with my ex.

95
00:07:24,312 --> 00:07:25,792
It doesn't feel good.

96
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,340
If there's something I'm lacking,

97
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,680
just tell me,

98
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,540
knowing that could help me learn?

99
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,520
Learn what?

100
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:41,560
To hook up with another guy?

101
00:07:41,777 --> 00:07:42,720
Huh?

102
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,840
I didn't mean that.

103
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,680
You've got a history with exes.

104
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,240
- That was different!
- How so?

105
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,200
Damn it. This is so annoying.

106
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,080
Hey, where are you going?

107
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:17,000
Not your concern.

108
00:08:18,387 --> 00:08:20,407
Don't get the wrong idea, parasite.

109
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,500
"Parasite" huh?

110
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,500
What the hell are you trying to say?

111
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,520
You can't protect me.

112
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:30,020
- That's not true. I can...
- One day, you'll run away from me too.

113
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:31,900
Why do you always assume the worst?

114
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,860
You can't even buy your own food.

115
00:08:36,476 --> 00:08:38,456
You're just a parasite.

116
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:41,760
Sorry then.

117
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,140
I'll leave.

118
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:48,540
I'll go find someone else like you said.

119
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:50,360
Bye.

120
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,260
Aren't you going to come after me?

121
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,600
(Duck Feet 1000 yen)

122
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,860
Duck feet are the best.

123
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:14,840
(Duck Feet 1000 yen)

124
00:09:15,077 --> 00:09:16,760
Duck feet.

125
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,320
Not enough.

126
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,200
Guess I'll need to get more.

127
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,840
Hey!

128
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,340
Long time no see!

129
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,620
I'm finally back in Tokyo!

130
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,232
I got sent to Nagano

131
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,920
right after getting out.

132
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,842
Hey, aren't you going to say hi?

133
00:10:18,866 --> 00:10:20,241
It's been a while, right?

134
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,680
Something's off about this person.

135
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:39,720
What? You're acting so distant.

136
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,860
Who are you?

137
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,540
By the way, Hayato, you moved again?

138
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:48,320
- I said who are you?
- Invite me over to your new place!

139
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,435
I left a gift at the old place.

140
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,660
Did you see it?

141
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,320
Oh, you didn't see it?

142
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,360
Photos.

143
00:10:58,475 --> 00:11:00,290
I left some photos at the stairs

144
00:11:00,298 --> 00:11:01,418
as a surprise.

145
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,400
It's on a disposable camera.

146
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,380
Every single one is a frog.

147
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,120
All these frogs…

148
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,040
Sorry, we're in a hurry.

149
00:11:20,714 --> 00:11:23,040
- Haoren, let's go.
- Huh? Haoren?

150
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,540
Is that his name now?

151
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,780
- I only get to know him as Keito!
- Let's go.

152
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,440
Wait!

153
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:34,760
Is your new place kind of rundown?

154
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,140
That used to be a tutoring school...

155
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,380
for kids.

156
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,540
No. Just a guess, just a guess.

157
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,323
How about working together again?

158
00:11:49,331 --> 00:11:51,116
I've already arranged things!

159
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,880
- You're so persistent...
- Maya.

160
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:57,992
I'm not working with you anymore.

161
00:11:59,531 --> 00:12:00,840
We won't be seeing each other.

162
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,740
Why not?

163
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:04,940
Because there's no need to...

164
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,180
Chihiro, let's go.

165
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,060
Yeah.

166
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,940
Is that the guy you don't want to meet?

167
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,280
Your old colleague.

168
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,580
Actually, it's not just that.

169
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:37,080
Maya was my employer.

170
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,320
Let's avoid going home for now.

171
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:56,400
Hey, this bath feels great!

172
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,200
Haa...

173
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,800
Ah...

174
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,620
This feels good.

175
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,603
These scars are from

176
00:14:08,619 --> 00:14:10,032
when I worked for Maya.

177
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,940
All of them…

178
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:18,511
It was supposedly

179
00:14:18,536 --> 00:14:20,269
a VIP-exclusive BDSM club,

180
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:22,980
but in reality,

181
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,140
it was only filled with crazy clients.

182
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,351
Jobs that only people like me could do,

183
00:14:30,367 --> 00:14:32,734
who wouldn't leave
any traces if they died.

184
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,226
Maya gathered people like that,

185
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:38,851
both men and women.

186
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,657
Since the first time we met,

187
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:45,415
Maya has been addicted to drugs.

188
00:14:45,971 --> 00:14:47,771
And in a drugged state.

189
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,180
Nice to meet you.

190
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,540
Are you experienced?

191
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,640
Yes.

192
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,640
Maya was creepy.

193
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,140
He looked young

194
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,740
but also looked much older.

195
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,266
Yes. We've got a new kid.

196
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:16,971
He's experienced, but…

197
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,800
People who are worthless,

198
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,771
have no choice but to try harder,

199
00:15:31,796 --> 00:15:33,263
don't they?

200
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,334
You have no choice but to try harder,

201
00:15:38,359 --> 00:15:39,560
don't you?

202
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,960
In that room, Maya was absolute.

203
00:15:41,985 --> 00:15:43,545
- When he was in a bad mood
- Are you even trying?

204
00:15:43,562 --> 00:15:44,656
or when work failed,

205
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,800
- he would resort to violence.
- Huh?

206
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,660
- he would resort to violence.
- Yes.

207
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:47,600
- he would resort to violence.
- Right?

208
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,560
- Meals and water were restricted,
- Do better.

209
00:15:51,211 --> 00:15:52,453
and we were sometimes

210
00:15:52,461 --> 00:15:53,609
locked in suitcases.

211
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,520
It's not painful.

212
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,836
It's painful because

213
00:16:05,861 --> 00:16:07,031
you think it's painful!

214
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,100
Did you just think it's painful?

215
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,560
It's not painful!

216
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,740
Not painful!

217
00:16:18,146 --> 00:16:20,620
- Maya's words changed rapidly,
- Not painful!

218
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,795
- saying things that were the opposite
- Not painful!

219
00:16:22,811 --> 00:16:24,296
of what he said 10 seconds earlier.

220
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,880
He made up strange words.

221
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,900
You know ‘Paprika'?

222
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,640
"Papri" is pa.

223
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:32,900
Pa...

224
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,360
Papuru.

225
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,052
Because of the drugs,

226
00:16:42,076 --> 00:16:43,365
Maya would sometimes

227
00:16:43,381 --> 00:16:45,076
become motionless, like a statue.

228
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,520
Can you kill someone?

229
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,840
Do you know Yamagata-san? That old man.

230
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,922
That old man's younger brother

231
00:17:12,947 --> 00:17:14,656
is a real masochist.

232
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:16,883
He says he can only climax

233
00:17:16,891 --> 00:17:18,176
when he's on the brink of death.

234
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,133
Yamagata-san will hit and stop him

235
00:17:20,165 --> 00:17:21,845
just before he dies.

236
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:24,820
But can you continue beat him up?

237
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:36,000
Hayato, you did it!

238
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,300
I followed the instructions…

239
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:43,920
Nice, nice! Well done!

240
00:17:45,383 --> 00:17:48,680
You should be happy, come on, be happy!

241
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:52,620
That kid…

242
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,480
Hayato-kun, right?

243
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,160
He's really something.

244
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,240
His hands are all torn up.

245
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:02,883
I'm glad I was able to

246
00:18:02,908 --> 00:18:04,204
help Yamagata-san.

247
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,360
Contact me if anything dangerous

248
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:07,556
comes up again.

249
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:09,487
You're a lifesaver.

250
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,600
You and I are similar, Hayato.

251
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,440
What do you mean?

252
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,880
In having nothing?

253
00:18:22,613 --> 00:18:24,020
In being empty?

254
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:26,720
No.

255
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,040
It's not different.

256
00:18:30,547 --> 00:18:31,907
We're basically the same.

257
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:36,180
Like soulmates?

258
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,980
Or is that old-fashioned?

259
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,460
A shared destiny, I suppose?

260
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,700
You and I…

261
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,620
we're the same.

262
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:04,880
At that time, my world was so small,

263
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,108
and there were many chances to escape,

264
00:19:08,133 --> 00:19:10,200
but I pretended not to notice.

265
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,200
Nah, it's fine.

266
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,680
But it's perfect, actually.

267
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,040
Then...

268
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,920
You could even kill him.

269
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,540
Oh well.

270
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:43,220
Shinjuku 68-83.

271
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,220
Shinjuku Alley 2, Shinjuku Ward.

272
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,620
Room 601.

273
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,520
Yes.

274
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,680
I'm ready to die anytime.

275
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,060
If I die, I will be liberated.

276
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,560
That's what I thought.

277
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:06,840
But in the end...

278
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:09,760
I couldn't stop wishing.

279
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,000
I couldn't give up.

280
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:25,220
Because I

281
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,780
haven't lived once yet.

282
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:33,780
I'm scared.

283
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,460
I don't want to see him again.

284
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,542
I'm the one who sold

285
00:20:42,567 --> 00:20:43,885
Maya out to the police.

286
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Huh?

287
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:50,320
Everything

288
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,820
about the shop and the drugs.

289
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,059
Because of that, Maya got an

290
00:20:56,084 --> 00:20:57,840
immediate 4-year prison sentence.

291
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,820
Maya probably wants revenge on me.

292
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,240
I'm not letting that happen.

293
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:07,380
I'm here with you.

294
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:13,220
I'll beat up that little guy.

295
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,000
Ha.

296
00:21:16,127 --> 00:21:17,587
But you're skinny too.

297
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,680
I won't lose to a little guy.

298
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:31,360
Heh, a little guy vs. a skinny guy.

299
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,560
Sounds like a pretty pathetic matchup.

300
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,980
Chihiro.

301
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:17,320
My own personal Chihiro.

302
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,440
You need me

303
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,580
in order to live on.

304
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:33,160
I already am.

305
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,760
Please, Matsuki-san, any place will do.

306
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,220
Even if it's not in Tokyo…

307
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,400
Catching a weasel game isn't it?

308
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,860
- You can't escape from the past.
- I can escape.

309
00:22:53,735 --> 00:22:55,075
I will escape.

310
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:59,600
So I need Matsuki-san's help to do that.

311
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,660
Give me two days.

312
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,820
Thank you.

313
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:08,500
I'll be in your debt, Matsuki-san.

314
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,900
Oh, using such formal language?

315
00:23:10,908 --> 00:23:12,736
You're just an elementary schooler.

316
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:15,440
I didn't even go to elementary school.

317
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,540
See you.

318
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,540
Please let it stay like this…

319
00:23:29,813 --> 00:23:31,720
Let it stay like this forever.

320
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:38,640
Now I have something I want to protect.

321
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,300
That's why I'm afraid of Maya.

322
00:23:46,735 --> 00:23:48,775
- Thanks for your hard work.
- Thanks for your hard work.

323
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,660
Kashiwagi-san!

324
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:59,400
Oh, Komori-san, what's up?

325
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,940
I'm heading home.

326
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,580
Want to walk together?

327
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:07,700
Ah. Sure.

328
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,900
Are you headed this way too?

329
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:15,860
Ah… I have a stop to make on the way!

330
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,420
I see.

331
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,940
Well, I'm living with my partner.

332
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,440
Oh… I see.

333
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:31,560
- Ah.
- I see.

334
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,680
Umm...

335
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,925
Hey, isn't that Chihiro-kun?

336
00:24:47,941 --> 00:24:50,214
Are you heading home now?

337
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:52,900
Who's this cute girl next to you?

338
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,860
I'll give you a ride home.

339
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:56,960
Get in.

340
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,360
(Next episode)

341
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:05,020
Suck that old man's dick.

342
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,200
Scared?

343
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,860
"Happy of the End"
