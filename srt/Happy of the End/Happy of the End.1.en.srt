00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:06,200
(Episode 1)

2
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:09,484
This is the story of when I was hopeless,

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,100
when I was living like a piece of trash.

4
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:22,060
This guy nearly killed me last night.

5
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:26,590
And yet, I got into his car willingly.

6
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,040
Why?

7
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,480
I don't even know.

8
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:32,651
But I thought, if I didn't get in,

9
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:36,040
I'd never see him again.

10
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,900
(24 hours earlier)

11
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,640
Now? There are three of us.

12
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,260
Yeah.

13
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:02,790
We're waiting.

14
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:03,730
Try this.

15
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:04,850
Seriously?

16
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:06,310
It's really good.

17
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,280
- Mmm, delicious!
- Isn't it good?

18
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,080
- Yeah, give me more.
- No, no, no.

19
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,170
Okay, okay.

20
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,660
Let's hurry and go.

21
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:18,800
- Now?
- Now?

22
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,760
- Hurry. Come quickly.
- Sure.

23
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:23,180
Where are we going?

24
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:24,130
Hmm?

25
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:26,230
In a movie I once saw,

26
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:29,380
they said life is like a box of chocolates.

27
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:31,277
You never know what you're gonna

28
00:01:31,302 --> 00:01:32,441
get until you open it.

29
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,180
My life is empty.

30
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:39,960
That's how I felt back then always.

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,710
That's good.

32
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:07,870
Right?

33
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:10,550
What should we eat?

34
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:14,860
- Fried pork?
- So irritating.

35
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:17,390
- Can you do it?
- Of course.

36
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:19,590
What about sandwich?

37
00:02:20,365 --> 00:02:21,895
- Can I eat it?
- Really like it.

38
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,540
Really like?

39
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:24,990
- Yeah.
- Then...

40
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:18,810
May I sit next to you?

41
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:21,920
- Sure, of course.
- Ah.

42
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,120
How old are you? I'm 23.

43
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,700
- Same here.
- What do you do?

44
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,490
- I'm a freelancer.
- Me too.

45
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,730
Sorry for all the questions.

46
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:37,480
Do you want something to drink?

47
00:03:37,496 --> 00:03:38,496
My treat.

48
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,590
- Huh? Is that okay?
- Yeah.

49
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:41,420
Ahem.

50
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,510
Thanks. I'll have the same.

51
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,860
Same for him!

52
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:54,728
By the way, what should I call you?

53
00:03:54,986 --> 00:03:55,986
I'm Chihiro.

54
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,420
Keito.

55
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,266
Keito...

56
00:04:01,433 --> 00:04:04,500
You're really my type. Seriously.

57
00:04:05,766 --> 00:04:09,033
No one's ever said that to me before.

58
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,633
It's kind of embarrassing...

59
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,100
Cute!

60
00:04:19,466 --> 00:04:22,333
I want to know more about you, Chihiro.

61
00:04:22,633 --> 00:04:24,200
Do you want to go somewhere

62
00:04:24,216 --> 00:04:25,496
quiet and talk?

63
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:29,600
Huh? Yeah, let's go!

64
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,966
"Happy of the End"

65
00:05:48,933 --> 00:05:53,066
Don't take it off. It's embarrassing.

66
00:05:53,233 --> 00:05:56,233
Come on, I want to see.

67
00:05:56,533 --> 00:05:58,333
No.

68
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,457
The more you resist,

69
00:06:00,481 --> 00:06:01,770
the more I want to see...

70
00:06:08,766 --> 00:06:11,766
- Will this do?
- Hmm?

71
00:06:27,233 --> 00:06:28,459
Since that day,

72
00:06:28,467 --> 00:06:30,998
I couldn't believe that life is like

73
00:06:31,023 --> 00:06:32,943
a box of chocolates.

74
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,600
Life is garbage.

75
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:57,700
You're alive. Congratulations.

76
00:06:58,633 --> 00:07:00,733
You...

77
00:07:01,866 --> 00:07:03,412
I dumped you here half a day ago,

78
00:07:03,429 --> 00:07:04,553
but you kept sleeping,

79
00:07:04,569 --> 00:07:05,701
so I was surprised.

80
00:07:06,066 --> 00:07:08,833
I'm glad you're not dead.

81
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:11,866
I'll report you to the police.

82
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:15,500
I remember your face.

83
00:07:30,766 --> 00:07:32,466
What? You're still alive, huh?

84
00:07:32,466 --> 00:07:34,460
You're going to kill me?

85
00:07:36,033 --> 00:07:38,066
This guy is so noisy.

86
00:07:39,366 --> 00:07:41,833
Are you going to kill me and bury me?

87
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,260
Kaji!

88
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,960
Sorry, sorry.

89
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:49,400
Just threatening him a bit.

90
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,133
If he died, I'd be in trouble.

91
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:57,600
Here, drink some water.

92
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,151
You were leeching off someone

93
00:08:16,167 --> 00:08:18,010
living in a luxury tower in Azabu, right?

94
00:08:18,934 --> 00:08:20,572
You got caught fooling around

95
00:08:20,612 --> 00:08:22,510
with other guys and got kicked out.

96
00:08:23,133 --> 00:08:24,484
You stole a card when you left,

97
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,500
didn't you?

98
00:08:25,733 --> 00:08:27,900
Do you understand what you did?

99
00:08:30,766 --> 00:08:32,366
Get out.

100
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:59,133
The credit card got blocked immediately!

101
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:01,800
- I didn't take cash either.
- That's not it.

102
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,600
There was another card. The black one.

103
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:07,080
I thought it was a black card,

104
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,533
but it wasn't a credit card,

105
00:09:08,557 --> 00:09:10,267
so I just tossed it somewhere!

106
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,660
Tossed it? Where?

107
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,533
In some convenience store's trash bin!

108
00:09:16,766 --> 00:09:19,466
Well, then it's gone for good.

109
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,266
I searched your whole body in the hotel.

110
00:09:24,633 --> 00:09:27,000
When I couldn't find it, I dumped you.

111
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:28,959
But then I realized,

112
00:09:28,967 --> 00:09:31,576
I haven't asked him yet.

113
00:09:33,533 --> 00:09:36,233
So you just wanted the card back?

114
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,039
It's fine now.

115
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:41,600
If you tossed it, nothing we can do.

116
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,200
Sorry for beating you up.

117
00:09:45,671 --> 00:09:47,366
Now disappear.

118
00:09:52,266 --> 00:09:54,600
Making a fool out of me...

119
00:09:59,066 --> 00:10:00,866
Let me do it.

120
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:05,000
We were in the middle of it.

121
00:10:05,966 --> 00:10:08,000
Let me finish!

122
00:10:10,133 --> 00:10:13,233
Is it here? Or maybe this way?

123
00:10:13,733 --> 00:10:18,266
- This is...
- We're moving.

124
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:23,033
If you help us, I'll let you do it.

125
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,200
Huh?

126
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,292
Whether you do it or not, I don't care.

127
00:10:26,324 --> 00:10:28,230
Just be careful.

128
00:10:29,433 --> 00:10:32,200
You're a leech, right?

129
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:34,376
You kept threatening like that,

130
00:10:34,385 --> 00:10:35,619
you're trash, huh?

131
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,233
And what about you guys?

132
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,142
We're scouts.

133
00:10:41,174 --> 00:10:42,814
For hostesses and sex workers.

134
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,133
Scouts?

135
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,233
That's a trash job too.

136
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:50,142
You make money by making

137
00:10:50,167 --> 00:10:51,847
girls sell their bodies.

138
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,642
Even if I'm a trash,

139
00:10:53,658 --> 00:10:55,009
I'm still better than that.

140
00:10:56,966 --> 00:10:58,400
So what?

141
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,266
Nothing.

142
00:11:09,584 --> 00:11:10,702
Got beaten up like that

143
00:11:10,727 --> 00:11:11,736
and still want to do it?

144
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,800
No, even I don't understand.

145
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:19,700
It can't be helped. My life is garbage.

146
00:11:21,433 --> 00:11:24,733
I thought I raised you right.

147
00:11:26,233 --> 00:11:28,900
Get out! You piece of trash!

148
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,080
Alright, move over a bit. Good.

149
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,033
- I said move it closer.
- Yes.

150
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:42,030
Good. Ah. Excellent.

151
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:44,500
You're in the shot, you idiot!

152
00:11:45,733 --> 00:11:49,200
Enough, will you? Die!

153
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,280
Life is garbage.

154
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,540
But...

155
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:03,062
There was something

156
00:12:03,078 --> 00:12:04,366
in his eyes last night.

157
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,109
A fragment of something

158
00:12:08,134 --> 00:12:09,701
that's not garbage.

159
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:25,100
(BBQ Shop)

160
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,900
Haa...

161
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,240
Are you done?

162
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,420
Well, that was the last box.

163
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:44,620
Alright, take care of the rest.

164
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,180
Wait...

165
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,300
Hey!

166
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,720
Alright.

167
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,920
I'm going to grab a coffee.

168
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:24,920
Hey!

169
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,940
Damn it, I can't do this!

170
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,440
Hey,

171
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:31,157
you've got to be kidding.

172
00:14:31,181 --> 00:14:32,297
You're still at it?

173
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,880
- Hurry and clean up.
- Yeah, yeah. I'm working on it.

174
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,880
- Where's mine?
- There isn't any.

175
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,483
Life is like a box of chocolates.

176
00:14:49,186 --> 00:14:50,912
When I opened it, it was empty.

177
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,040
But even so, I couldn't give up.

178
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,220
I was searching for something.

179
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,180
No need for that area.

180
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:14,890
We'll be moving again

181
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:15,915
soon anyway.

182
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,890
Moving again?

183
00:15:18,054 --> 00:15:19,476
You just moved, didn't you?

184
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,740
It's fine. Take a break.

185
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,460
Where were you before this place?

186
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:33,960
Shinjuku.

187
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,920
From Shinjuku to Shinjuku?

188
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,500
My workplace is nearby.

189
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,260
Ah, the scouting job.

190
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,500
But this place is really run-down.

191
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:48,340
There are many reasons.

192
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,000
It's just that you don't have any money.

193
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:51,539
If you're going to smoke,

194
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:52,976
do it by the window.

195
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Yeah.

196
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:02,700
Haa...

197
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:06,620
You seem different

198
00:16:06,636 --> 00:16:08,316
from my first impression.

199
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:10,120
You're a quiet person.

200
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,565
It'd be great if we could

201
00:16:12,581 --> 00:16:13,885
have sex, though...

202
00:16:27,352 --> 00:16:29,760
This was lying by the stairs.

203
00:16:29,784 --> 00:16:30,656
Take it.

204
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,140
Nah, that's trash.

205
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:34,300
That's your friend.

206
00:16:34,332 --> 00:16:35,532
Shut up.

207
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,280
There's one shot left!

208
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,560
Awesome!

209
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,860
What? That makes you happy?

210
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,760
Yeah, I'm happy.

211
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,740
Hmm, what should I take a picture of?

212
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,880
Do you like taking photos?

213
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:59,140
Yeah. I wanted to be a photographer.

214
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:00,920
Then take some pictures.

215
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,580
Can I take a shot of you?

216
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:05,080
Huh?

217
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,760
I'm sorry!

218
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:12,020
Look at this!

219
00:17:18,344 --> 00:17:19,904
Hurry up.

220
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,452
There's only one shot left,

221
00:17:21,477 --> 00:17:23,093
so I'm going to take my time...

222
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:25,660
Relax...

223
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:27,200
Smile.

224
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,400
Don't be ridiculous.

225
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,420
Then talk to me about something.

226
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,480
- Talk?
- Yeah.

227
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,060
When did you start liking guys?

228
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:54,150
I've always liked guys

229
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:55,775
since I was little.

230
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,293
When I was little,

231
00:18:05,722 --> 00:18:07,566
my parents took me to the hospital.

232
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,402
They said I was crazy

233
00:18:10,427 --> 00:18:12,107
and needed to be cured.

234
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:14,280
That's when I decided.

235
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,141
I'd have to hide it

236
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:17,846
for the rest of my life.

237
00:18:20,468 --> 00:18:21,657
So I avoided talking

238
00:18:21,673 --> 00:18:23,095
to anyone at school.

239
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,440
Ever been in a relationship?

240
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,420
Yeah.

241
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,680
Right after high school.

242
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,820
Up until recently.

243
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,280
What was his name?

244
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:41,740
Shunichi.

245
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,880
- Isn't this crazy?
- Teach me some English.

246
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,500
English? Sure, I'll teach you.

247
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,740
- What about math?
- I barely passed.

248
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:48,860
What score did you get in math?

249
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:50,460
Wait a second, I'll go grab my stuff.

250
00:19:05,307 --> 00:19:06,347
Bye-bye.

251
00:19:08,456 --> 00:19:09,620
Bye-bye.

252
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,372
Even though I didn't talk to anyone,

253
00:19:16,397 --> 00:19:18,513
he came to say bye-bye to me

254
00:19:18,529 --> 00:19:19,740
before going home.

255
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,110
That was the extent of

256
00:19:24,134 --> 00:19:25,782
our relationship until graduation.

257
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:32,540
But I still fell in love with Shunichi.

258
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,483
On graduation day,

259
00:19:37,155 --> 00:19:38,389
as I was about to leave

260
00:19:38,414 --> 00:19:40,064
without speaking to anyone.

261
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,560
Kashiwagi!

262
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,380
What about "Bye-bye"?

263
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,680
Huh?

264
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,940
Oh.

265
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,380
Well...

266
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:03,580
Let's go.

267
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,320
We became lovers.

268
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,082
But I was always unsure

269
00:20:21,107 --> 00:20:22,787
if he really liked me.

270
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,320
In the end,

271
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:42,723
it turned out that

272
00:20:42,748 --> 00:20:44,074
I wasn't the only one.

273
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,260
I see...

274
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:52,700
What about your family?

275
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,040
Ah, oh.

276
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,060
I had my parents and an older brother.

277
00:21:02,592 --> 00:21:04,240
But they disowned me.

278
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:08,540
They told me to get out because I'm gay.

279
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:10,540
They said I wasn't their child anymore.

280
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,126
What about you, Keito?

281
00:21:13,151 --> 00:21:14,831
Do you have a family?

282
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,700
I have my mom.

283
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,960
Your mom. Tell me about her.

284
00:21:22,453 --> 00:21:23,600
It's a secret.

285
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,900
What kind of person is she? Your mom?

286
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,500
A secret is a secret.

287
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,860
That face...

288
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,680
It's so gentle...

289
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,940
You can make that kind of face too...

290
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,700
Keito.

291
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:50,780
- Think about your mom.
- Huh?

292
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,980
Alright.

293
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,360
- Hey!
- Ah!

294
00:22:09,951 --> 00:22:12,271
I think your face got covered!

295
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,060
Forget it.

296
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,540
Let's go.

297
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,620
Such a waste! It was a good shot.

298
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,020
Oh well.

299
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:44,160
Aren't you going to work tomorrow?

300
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,300
Maybe.

301
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,760
Why?

302
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,732
I don't know what to think

303
00:22:50,748 --> 00:22:52,428
about when I'm alone.

304
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:55,638
When I space out,

305
00:22:55,662 --> 00:22:58,129
all I can think about are bad things,

306
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,820
and I feel like dying.

307
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:17,500
What?

308
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,880
Then let's do it.

309
00:23:20,814 --> 00:23:22,056
That way, you won't have to

310
00:23:22,081 --> 00:23:23,298
think about anything.

311
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:03,300
Yeah but...

312
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,280
are you going to do it with me?

313
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,960
You're not used to this?

314
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:14,800
No,

315
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,340
it's not that I don't like it...

316
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:28,520
You make cute sounds.

317
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:40,600
I don't know why I was drawn to Keito.

318
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,386
Maybe he was the chocolate

319
00:24:43,403 --> 00:24:45,325
I found at the end of my ruined life.

320
00:24:46,832 --> 00:24:48,535
I don't know if this is the start of

321
00:24:48,535 --> 00:24:50,340
happiness or the beginning of hell,

322
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,600
but that chocolate was bitter;

323
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:57,300
oh so sweet.

324
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,820
(Next episode)

325
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:05,580
I've been here for two weeks.

326
00:25:05,612 --> 00:25:07,292
Can I still stay here?

327
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:08,960
If you want to continue to stay.

328
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,880
What? Why did you suddenly cling to me?

329
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,180
"Happy of the End"
