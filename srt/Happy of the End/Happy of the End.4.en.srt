00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:08,600
(Episode 4)

2
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:09,660
Haa...

3
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,100
Sorry to keep you waiting.

4
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,340
It doesn't hurt.

5
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,700
It only hurts because you think it does.

6
00:00:23,192 --> 00:00:25,140
You're thinking it hurts, right?

7
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,680
It doesn't hurt.

8
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:30,720
It doesn't hurt.

9
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:32,720
It doesn't hurt.

10
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,360
It doesn't hurt!

11
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,620
It doesn't hurt!

12
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:37,020
It doesn't hurt!

13
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,000
It doesn't hurt.

14
00:00:40,078 --> 00:00:41,164
Good boy.

15
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:43,399
Now go tell Horikawa hag the same thing.

16
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,280
Okay.

17
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,480
Haoren.

18
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:03,700
Alright.

19
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,020
Here.

20
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,580
Touch it.

21
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,080
I'm home!

22
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,880
What the hell are you doing?

23
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:23,840
You're the worst!

24
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,200
Get out!

25
00:02:25,819 --> 00:02:26,980
Get out!

26
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,920
- Get out!
- Yes, yes.

27
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:33,760
I'm so sorry,

28
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:35,460
I'm so sorry.

That unlucky,

35
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,920
pitiful version of me.

36
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,360
I'm watching myself.

37
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,980
Mom.

38
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:28,980
"Happy of the End"

39
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,660
Mmm…

40
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:39,760
Mmm...

41
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,800
Lately, we've been short on young ones.

42
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,360
Yeah.

43
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,760
- It's tough, man.
- Oh.

44
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,520
- You got anyone for me?
- Yeah, I got someone.

45
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,100
- I'll send them to you.
- You do?

46
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,220
- Seriously? Thanks as always.
- Yeah.

47
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,760
- You're really helping us out.
- Yeah.

48
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,860
- Catch you later.
- Sure.

49
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:05,640
Bye.

50
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:23,680
You're the kid looking for work, right?

51
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,980
Go home, kid. This ain't for you.

52
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,040
I don't have a home. I can't go back.

53
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:41,160
Work, huh?

54
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,280
Guy, right?

55
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:46,340
But you're still a kid.

56
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,400
I'll do anything.

57
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,920
I've only eaten garbage for a week.

58
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,080
Anything, huh? You really mean that?

59
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:03,780
Yeah.

60
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,780
I'll do whatever it takes.

61
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,120
Haa...

62
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:12,900
Wait here a sec.

63
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,520
Hey, Maya?

64
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,030
Got a kid here who might be

65
00:06:25,055 --> 00:06:26,178
useful in your area.

66
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,960
Yeah.

67
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:31,100
Come pick him up.

68
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,680
Wait here for a bit.

69
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,280
Children's skin is so soft.

70
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,400
It feels amazing.

71
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,140
Right?

72
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:32,260
Haoren, this is where we say goodbye.

73
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,800
With this money,

74
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,340
you can call this number,

75
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:40,680
and someone from the orphanage will come.

76
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,600
Be good, okay, Haoren.

77
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:53,320
My mother loves me. She will protect me.

78
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:57,560
Because she's my mom.

79
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:04,000
Never seen again...

80
00:08:06,539 --> 00:08:07,923
She vanished.

81
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,200
Mom...

82
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,760
Mom.

83
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,980
Mom.

84
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:47,080
It doesn't hurt.

85
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,080
From that day,

86
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,780
I stopped feeling pain.

87
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:57,300
Hey, Hayato.

88
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,414
Why don't you quit this place

89
00:08:59,439 --> 00:09:00,879
and become my pet?

90
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,187
Sorry,

91
00:09:03,212 --> 00:09:05,545
I already have a new job lined up.

92
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:09,740
Is it that new S&amp;M club

93
00:09:10,328 --> 00:09:12,588
Maya's opening?

94
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,080
Yeah.

95
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,140
It's supposed to be for VIPs,

96
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,429
but I'm sure Matsuki-san

97
00:09:17,445 --> 00:09:18,804
could get in if you wanted.

98
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:21,740
Right.

99
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,500
But S&amp;M isn't really my thing.

100
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,600
I think I'll pass.

101
00:09:28,227 --> 00:09:29,307
I see.

102
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,868
C'mon, Hayato, you need to eat.

103
00:09:48,893 --> 00:09:50,918
How else are you going to puke?

104
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,612
It's soggy.

105
00:09:53,637 --> 00:09:55,205
It doesn't taste like anything.

106
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,212
You're going to throw it up anyway.

107
00:09:57,237 --> 00:09:58,620
That hag won't shut up

108
00:09:58,645 --> 00:10:00,512
unless it's pure white puke.

109
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,940
Don't eat anything else.

110
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:03,940
Shut the hell up!

111
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,780
What do you do during punishment time?

112
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,860
- We stay quiet.
- We stay quiet.

113
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,620
Oh yeah, how's your eye?

114
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,693
Damn, it's healing slow.

115
00:10:19,718 --> 00:10:21,398
Hurry up and fix that.

116
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,365
You're already a boy, which makes you

117
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:24,755
pretty much worthless.

118
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,280
I know.

119
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,080
No.

120
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,185
You don't get it

121
00:10:33,193 --> 00:10:34,743
the demand and supply, kid.

122
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:35,868
You're good-looking,

123
00:10:35,884 --> 00:10:36,978
but there aren't many women

124
00:10:37,002 --> 00:10:38,224
who'll actually pay for you.

125
00:10:38,249 --> 00:10:40,153
You gotta expand your market.

126
00:10:40,761 --> 00:10:42,415
Become a handsome masochist

127
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,196
who can take anything.

128
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,337
Vomit on command,

129
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:46,583
endure pain like it's nothing.

130
00:10:46,608 --> 00:10:47,788
Got it, Hayato?

131
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,080
Yes.

132
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,780
You understand, right, Hayato?

133
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,740
Say the usual.

134
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,620
I've done almost all the painful things,

135
00:11:17,645 --> 00:11:19,845
dirty things, and things I hate.

136
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:21,800
But...

137
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,160
But pain and fear, they're inevitable.

138
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,360
Please, Mori-san.

139
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,080
Good.

140
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,660
Understood.

141
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,640
Come on! Hey!

142
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:06,140
Get up!

143
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:11,560
Hmph!

144
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,719
What I fear more than such things

145
00:12:14,744 --> 00:12:15,784
is wishing.

146
00:12:16,852 --> 00:12:18,735
Wishing for a normal life.

147
00:12:18,743 --> 00:12:20,423
Wishing for happiness.

148
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,320
Wishing for such things.

149
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,980
Hey, Hayato.

150
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,522
Tomorrow,

151
00:12:37,547 --> 00:12:39,811
Mori-san wants you for a full 24 hours.

152
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,540
Mori-san?

153
00:12:43,259 --> 00:12:45,920
And the option will be cutting.

154
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,540
Cutting?

155
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:54,280
Yeah, it's totally fine. Yes.

156
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:57,640
Same room as always. Thanks.

157
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,220
Hayato,

158
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,304
I know he gets real rough,

159
00:13:06,312 --> 00:13:07,992
but he pays good money.

160
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,320
Don't run away now.

161
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:12,727
I'll make this the last time

162
00:13:12,751 --> 00:13:14,157
you have to deal with him.

163
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,320
Mori-san, yes.

164
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,456
He's totally fine, don't worry.

165
00:13:30,481 --> 00:13:32,495
Yeah, he's still kicking.

166
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,620
It's nothing.

167
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,320
Alright, see you then.

168
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,320
Thank you.

169
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:49,360
Whoa..

170
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,600
Hey.

171
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,640
You reek.

172
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,820
Your condition is terrible.

173
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,480
Can you even heal from this?

174
00:14:00,635 --> 00:14:02,838
Hayato, hey,

175
00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:05,016
you better be able to walk on your own.

176
00:14:05,048 --> 00:14:08,008
I don't want to touch you right now.

177
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:11,140
Haa...

178
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,480
Doc,

179
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,540
can you do plastic surgery?

180
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,920
Well, let's see.

181
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:26,175
If it doesn't heal back to normal,

182
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,200
I'll do it.

183
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:31,280
- Don't be stingy.
- I'll charge you the usual fee.

184
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,380
How much is it?

185
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,040
Is that an extra zero?

186
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,980
Don't look at me.

187
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,100
Stop looking at me like that.

188
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:05,260
Nah, it's fine.

189
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,520
But it's perfect, actually.

190
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,160
Then...

191
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:15,040
You could even kill him.

192
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,540
Oh well.

193
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:25,220
You want to book him,

194
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,040
Mori-san?

195
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,000
Hayato,

196
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,180
Hayato, where are you?

197
00:16:22,328 --> 00:16:24,288
Do you know who this is?

198
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,460
Matsuki-san.

199
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,020
Yes, it's me! Where are you?

200
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,460
Where are you?

201
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,835
Maya got arrested for drugs…

202
00:16:35,867 --> 00:16:37,703
and the club too.

203
00:16:39,023 --> 00:16:40,600
I know.

204
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,160
I'm fine.

205
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:46,860
Alright, that's good then.

206
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,340
Thanks, Matsuki-san.

207
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:53,280
I'll call you later.

208
00:16:53,371 --> 00:16:55,431
Hayato, Hayato?

209
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:26,800
Hey, you.

210
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,560
That's my car, you know.

211
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,220
Hey!

212
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,280
You...

213
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,800
We've met before, right?

214
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:44,740
You're with Maya.

215
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,480
You okay?

216
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,260
Can you help me find some work?

217
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,280
Yeah. Sure.

218
00:18:00,508 --> 00:18:01,688
Thanks.

219
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,840
Maybe get those wounds treated first?

220
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:09,200
I want a new name.

221
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:12,220
Huh? No.

222
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,060
You already have a name, don't you?

223
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,500
I want a new one.

224
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,280
Then...

225
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,000
(Host Club - Keito)

226
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Keito?

227
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,820
"Keito?"

228
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:47,882
If you're looking for

229
00:18:47,898 --> 00:18:49,788
a job in the nightlife, give me a call.

230
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,260
You'd make a killing.

231
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,280
You can consult anything with me.

232
00:18:57,632 --> 00:18:59,372
I might just call you.

233
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,540
I'll be waiting.

234
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,620
Hey.

235
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:19,300
- Keito.
- Oh, Kaji.

236
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,930
How's the job going?

237
00:19:23,938 --> 00:19:25,243
Getting the hang of things?

238
00:19:25,268 --> 00:19:27,168
Mmm, well...

239
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,500
They're talking about you on ‘Host Love,

240
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,166
saying you're this ultra-handsome guy

241
00:19:31,182 --> 00:19:32,181
and have a romantic interest.

242
00:19:32,206 --> 00:19:34,286
I've never had a love affair.

243
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,360
Not denying the ‘ultra-handsome' part?

244
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:38,680
Hmph.

245
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,720
What an attitude.

246
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,420
Oh, Yoc-chan!

247
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,700
Kaji.

248
00:19:51,074 --> 00:19:53,160
Huh? What's up?

249
00:19:56,885 --> 00:19:57,900
Hey.

250
00:19:58,420 --> 00:19:59,680
Hey!

251
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,480
Mom.

252
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:05,380
Huh?

253
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:10,300
- Mom, it's me, Haoren.
- Who the hell are you?

254
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,340
Let go of me.

255
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,980
What are you doing here?

256
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:13,956
What do you think?

257
00:20:13,964 --> 00:20:15,136
I'm waiting for a client. Let go of me!

258
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,040
Wait!

259
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,511
No, if you're gonna

260
00:20:17,527 --> 00:20:20,190
pull something like this, then pay up!

261
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,620
You don't have money?

262
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,080
Here.

263
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,560
Huh?

264
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,600
So you're a client?

265
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:51,440
It's me, Haoren.

266
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:53,200
Haoren.

267
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,540
Mom,

268
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:59,000
- I'm so happy to see you.
- Oh, uh…

269
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,480
I'm happy to see you too.

270
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,340
Haoren.

271
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:14,200
Haoren.

272
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,740
Haoren.

273
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:22,480
What? You're up already?

274
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,400
I just woke up.

275
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,740
Man, I slept a lot.

276
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,460
So, what should we do?

277
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,500
What do you mean?

278
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:34,049
There's nothing for breakfast.

279
00:21:34,074 --> 00:21:35,274
Not even bread.

280
00:21:37,948 --> 00:21:39,728
Let's go buy some.

281
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,880
Yeah.

282
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,520
Haoren,

283
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:00,320
do you know what your name means?

284
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,220
I don't know anything about that.

285
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,460
I was free, so I looked it up.

286
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,540
Give me your phone.

287
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,660
Ah.

288
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,300
Mmm...

289
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,520
"Chinese, meaning."

290
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,895
Hao-ren' means ‘big and wide,

291
00:22:34,911 --> 00:22:36,880
like a big calm lake.'

292
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,840
"Haoren" means

293
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,523
I want you to be like

294
00:22:44,539 --> 00:22:46,296
a big and quiet lake.

295
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:50,940
"Lake..."

296
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,900
"A quiet lake"

297
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,440
It's a great name, Haoren.

298
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,020
Right?

299
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,550
So what about your name?

300
00:23:21,575 --> 00:23:23,375
Do you know what it means?

301
00:23:23,887 --> 00:23:26,427
Huh? No idea.

302
00:23:29,644 --> 00:23:32,880
Then let me think about it for you.

303
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,520
Mmm.

304
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,540
‘It's easy for me to call you by that.'

305
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,140
That's just random!

306
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,340
That's not even a real meaning.

307
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,760
It's not random.

308
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,940
It's the best meaning ever.

309
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:06,800
Take that.

310
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:08,600
What's with you?

311
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:11,560
- It's dangerous. Did someone jump?
- Their head's all smashed in.

312
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,380
Step back, step back. Please, stay back.

313
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:15,360
Everyone, step away from the scene!

314
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,860
How pitiful.

315
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:21,500
- Isn't that…
- Who's that?

316
00:24:21,525 --> 00:24:22,655
The woman who used to hang

317
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,776
around here, selling her body.

318
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,140
What? No way!

319
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,580
Requesting backup from Shinjuku Division 1,

320
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:29,100
- You're right.
- Please cooperate.

321
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,800
Mom.

322
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,740
Haoren.

323
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,900
Mama!

324
00:24:40,011 --> 00:24:41,340
Haoren.

325
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,820
My beloved son.

326
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,040
Haoren.

327
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,600
Mom.

328
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,700
(Next episode)

329
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:07,960
I want to die.

330
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,920
Hey, Chihiro!

331
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,520
It's because of you!

332
00:25:12,295 --> 00:25:14,015
It's because you're here.

333
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,260
"Happy of the End"
