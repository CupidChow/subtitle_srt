00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:09,980
[Name: Chen Duo. Is this person an Outsider? Yes]

2
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:12,830
Let Chen Duo out?

3
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:13,960
Liao,

4
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:15,080
are you serious?

5
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:17,600
According to these documents,

6
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:19,320
the Poison Girl has not been cured.

7
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:23,320
What if we allowed her limited access

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,280
to the normal world

9
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,870
under surveillance?

10
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,510
We've tested Chen Duo.

11
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,520
After this period of training,

12
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,840
her control has greatly improved.

13
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,640
She can now

14
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:37,710
fully manage

15
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,470
the poison within her,

16
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,280
and with the protection suit,

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,640
the risks are completely controllable.

18
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,320
Liao Zhong.

19
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:49,960
Let me be clear.

20
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,430
She's not yet cured,

21
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:53,520
and even if she were,

22
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:56,200
this isn't something we can easily agree on.

23
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:59,430
She's not like the Body of Disruption and other cases we've dealt with.

24
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:01,390
We've been involved in every step

25
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:02,790
of her rebirth.

26
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:04,200
To put it bluntly,

27
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,310
her life belongs to the company.

28
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:09,070
Now,

29
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,230
are we really going to continue wasting resources on her

30
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:12,430
just to cater to her personal feelings?

31
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:15,120
Do you even know whose money we're spending here?

32
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:16,590
I'm not denying

33
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:18,280
the Poison Girl's innocence,

34
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:19,790
but

35
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:21,350
do you really think she deserves

36
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:22,920
this unnecessary expense?

37
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:30,790
Liao,

38
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,640
I see where you're coming from.

39
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:33,760
But this time,

40
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:35,430
I'm on Mr. Bi's side.

41
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:37,870
We're not a charity

42
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:39,070
and what we need is stability.

43
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,560
Of course, I admit

44
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,510
that sometimes,

45
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:43,000
there's just nothing we can do to help.

46
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,760
I know that Chen Duo's current situation

47
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,230
doesn't entitle her to these privileges,

48
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:47,150
but what if she

49
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:48,040
could contribute

50
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,150
to our cause?

51
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:53,680
Her abilities are documented in her file.

52
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,040
The person currently working under me

53
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,480
is in poor health

54
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,590
and has been wanting to step down.

55
00:01:58,230 --> 00:01:59,480
What if the replacement is someone

56
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,680
who has mastered the poison technique?

57
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,310
I understand that Chen Duo is a special case,

58
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:10,000
which is why I've come to the board

59
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,590
to seek everyone's approval.

60
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,560
If the Saint Poison Girl

61
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,560
could become the next temporary worker,

62
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,630
do you think

63
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,560
the investment would be worth it?

64
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,360
We need

65
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,360
to give this

66
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,430
more thought.

67
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,870
We've reached a conclusion, Liao.

68
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:40,750
You can proceed.

69
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,800
But

70
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,630
you'll be fully accountable.

71
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,870
How you handle security matters

72
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,080
is up to you,

73
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,280
but necessary precautions must be taken.

74
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:51,520
Once this collar

75
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,560
is on, it can never be removed.

76
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:58,910
If the Poison Girl shows any signs of losing control,

77
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,310
eliminate her.

78
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:06,710
Ultimately, you must understand

79
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,150
that even if she wears the same clothes,

80
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:10,400
she is not

81
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:11,680
one of us.

82
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,680
Chen Duo,

83
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,470
I've gotten you

84
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:36,240
the freedom you asked for.

85
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,190
Due to the uncontrollable nature of Chen Duo's poison,

86
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:56,630
she must wear this collar,

87
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,430
which can be detonated at any time,

88
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,840
as a necessary safety measure when she goes out

89
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,590
on missions.

90
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:18,920

No.

00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,600
I mean, she's too stable.

147
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,600

154

155

00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:09,510
Chen Duo,

192
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:10,600
I know you want

193
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,960
to live a normal life,

194
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,080
just like Chen Junyan and the Big Monster.

195
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,870
No need to rush. Take it one step at a time.

196
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:15,630
Look.

197
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:18,030
Things are heading in a positive direction, aren't they?

198
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:18,910
Not at all!

199
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:20,910
Do you realize

200
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,600
how much harm

201
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,200
it would do to her body

202
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,360
if she keeps the poison

203
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,630
suppressed like this?

204
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,870
If she reaches a point where she can't control it anymore,

205
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,120
it'll be dangerous.

206
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,910
This is like gambling with her life.

207
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,790
We must stop this right now.

208
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,840
If all she wanted was to leave the Bunker,

209
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,720
she didn't need to do all this.

210
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,750
This child is risking her life for us,

211
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,240
making herself harmless.

212
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:53,080
She's not good at expressing herself,

213
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,480
but I think she understands.

214
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:58,510
She knows

215
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,600
this is her only way to connect

216
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,390
with the normal world right now.

217
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:15,480
We should honor her determination.

218
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:19,870
Liao,

219
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:21,440
I'm a bit concerned.

220
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:24,550
I'm worried that we might have gotten it wrong from the start.

221
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,960
Do you remember

222
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,750
when we first brought her out of the Bunker

223
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:30,790
and into normal society?

224
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:33,000
Her data didn't show

225
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,790
a single abnormal fluctuation.

226
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:36,550
Maybe

227
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,480
she doesn't care

228
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,720
about living like a normal human at all.

229
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:40,320
She

230
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:43,000
doesn't seem to care about anything.

231
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:47,000
You're just overthinking it.

232
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,960
If she truly didn't care,

233
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,960
why would she risk her life

234
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,390
just to prevent the poison from spreading?

235
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,870
The latest mission

236
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,080
involves a target

237
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,320
responsible for the deaths of eleven people,

238
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:59,670
including seven ordinary people

239
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:01,720
and four employees sent by the company to search for her.

240
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:04,150
The target is extremely dangerous.

241
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,840
This person is quick to escape.

242
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,240
Go ahead and take action.

243
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,870
This area is uninhabited.

244
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,630
Bring the target back to the company,

245
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:13,030
regardless of whether she's alive or dead.

246
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,630
Chief... Chief Ma.

247
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,790
Who did this to you?

248
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:30,390
Chief Ma,

249
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,870
help me.

250
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:33,320
You stole my magic weapon

251
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,320
and wreaked havoc out there,

252
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,390
and now you're asking me to help you?

253
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:39,510
I admit my fault, Chief Ma.

254
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,510
Help me.

255
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,030
Help me.

256
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:47,510
The ghost...

257
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:48,840
The ghost is here!

258
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,360
You did this on your own?

259
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:55,480
Not bad.

260
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,320
Never mind.

261
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:00,960
She brought it upon herself anyway.

262
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,910
Please leave her here.

263
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,480
Come on, cut me some slack.

264
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:08,910
She committed a wrongdoing,

265
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:10,440
and I need to bring her back for questioning.

266
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:38,750
Sir,

267
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:40,270
the tracker on Chen Duo shows

268
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:41,750
irregular movements within a limited area.

269
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,200
It's not a pursuit.

270
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:44,120
It's a fight.

271
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:47,080
Chen Duo.

272
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,480
The target has accomplices.

273
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:49,390
There are three of them.

274
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:50,270
Three?

275
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:53,080
What's the situation?

276
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,030
Can you handle it?

277
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:54,960
Don't push yourself too hard.

278
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:55,960
No,

279
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,910
they're impressive.

280
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:58,120
The opponents

281
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:00,000
are using techniques I've never seen before.

282
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:01,360
Chen Duo, listen to me.

283
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,320
Retreat for now.

284
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:03,510
I'll come to assist you immediately.

285
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:04,630
Hang in there, Chen Duo.

286
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:05,360
Hang in there.

287
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:08,270
Chen Duo.

288
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:09,390
Chen Duo, answer me.

289
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:10,510
Chen Duo, answer me.

290
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,240
Sir,

291
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:12,600
it's disappeared.

292
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,150
Chen Duo's tracker can no longer be detected.

293
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:15,600
How is that possible?

294
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,240
The tracker is implanted in her body.

295
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,670
It shouldn't disappear, even if she's taken down.

296
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,790
Not unless she vanished into thin air.

297
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:27,120
She's a tough one to handle.

298
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:28,510
What's her trick?

299
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:29,870
She's a poisoner,

300
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,390
no doubt about it.

301
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,600
But it's quite unusual

302
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:37,720
for someone her age

303
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,720
to be at the grandmaster level.

304
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:41,870
Chen Duo!

305
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:43,600
Chen Duo!

306
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,270
Chen Duo!

307
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:54,720
Chen Duo!

308
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,480
Chen Duo!

309
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,080
You were the one who put the collar on her,

310
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,440
and the controller is in your hands.

311
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,750
Now, you can end this yourself.

312
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,600
I'll give you seventy-two hours.

313
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:09,120
If Chen Duo's exact location

314
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:10,790
isn't found within that time,

315
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:12,320
you know what to do.

316
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,200
If you can't make the decision by then,

317
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:17,720
we'll handle it for you.

318
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:49,390
You're awake.

319
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:51,000
Wait.

320
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,390
Your skills are certainly impressive,

321
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:55,480
but there's no need for you to target me.

322
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,080
I won't make things hard for you.

323
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,790
This is your work, huh?

324
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,720
She died before making it here.

325
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,630
What exactly is the source of your power?

326
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:14,670
I've examined you,

327
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,080
but I've never seen anything like this.

328
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:19,750
Mission

329
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:21,390
accomplished.

330
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,510
No matter what she did wrong,

331
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,270
she's still a person,

332
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:28,320
a life.

333
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,910
She died at your hands.

334
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:31,600
Is this your only reaction?

335
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,360
I must accomplish every mission

336
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,200
that Mr. Liao assigns to me.

337
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:40,910
He says she has done too much evil

338
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,150
and deserves to die.

339
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,270
You...

340
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,390
Forget it.

341
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,440
She's already dead.

342
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:55,960
No point in saying anything more.

343
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:57,870
I'll get you something to eat.

344
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:37,510
The doctor in the village has checked

345
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:38,640
and said it's probably not contagious.

346
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:40,350
But just to be safe,

347
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,880
perhaps we should learn more about her.

348
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:42,710
Is that so?

349
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:44,820
What a pity.

350
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,540
She might have already left.

351
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:53,820
Why is she still here?

352
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:56,740
Where's the food?

353
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:58,850
Chief Ma,

354
00:17:59,130 --> 00:17:59,890
how about

355
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:01,610
I ask Fu Rong to set up two more tables?

356
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,170
Even though that person brought this upon herself,

357
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:06,060
she was still my companion.

358
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:07,650
You've taken her out,

359
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,610
and now you're expecting me to drink with you

360
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:13,020
and hold a farewell party?

361
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:17,810
We've cleared everything up.

362
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:19,610
I won't make things difficult for you.

363
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:20,810
You can leave now.

364
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:22,740
Leave?

365
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,090
Where to?

366
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:29,980
Is she trying to blackmail me?

367
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,260
Someone will come to pick me up.

368
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,810
Are you looking for the communicator?

369
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,370
It broke during our fight.

370
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,410
Also,

371
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,220
I found a tracker on you,

372
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,020
removed it,

373
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:46,890
and destroyed it.

374
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:49,130
Sorry,

375
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:51,890
but no one's coming to pick you up.

376
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,570
I'll take you to the village entrance.

377
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:28,810
Chief Ma.

378
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:52,840
[Biyou Village]

379
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,610
This road will lead you out of the village.

380
00:19:58,410 --> 00:19:59,020
I won't be seeing you off.

381
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:00,570
Have a safe trip.

382
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:16,780
Huang, come here.

383
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,060
Where should I go?

384
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,020
Go wherever you want.

385
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:28,170
It's your freedom.

386
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,370
No one can stop you.

387
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:33,980
Freedom.

388
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:31,760
[Biyou Village]

389
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:47,780
Chief Ma.

390
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:51,980
I'm actually a bit curious about you now.

391
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:56,780
Could you tell me more about yourself?

392
00:21:58,090 --> 00:21:58,700
You mean,

393
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:01,980
myself?

394
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:41,810
This is the collar you've been wearing all this time.

395
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:44,890
You're lucky.

396
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:47,850
Not many people can take it off.

397
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:50,410
While you were unconscious,

398
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:51,740
I examined it

399
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,330
and made a switch.

400
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,740
Want to see the power of this thing?

401
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:12,330
This

402
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:14,460
is what they've left on you.

403
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:18,260
If you have nowhere else to go,

404
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:19,890
you can stay in the village.

405
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:22,940
I've studied your condition,

406
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,170
and if I can complete my invention,

407
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,330
there's a chance I could cure you.

408
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:28,330
Can I

409
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:30,370
do that?

410
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:31,810
It's not about whether you can or can't,

411
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:33,700
it's whether you want to.

412
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:36,940
But

413
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,940
it's not convenient for me to stay elsewhere.

414
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:42,460
I'm aware of that.

415
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,980
I can create an environment

416
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,260
that's suitable for you to live in.

417
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:46,940
Just tell me

418
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:48,300
if you still want to go back

419
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,500
to that Bunker.

420
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,330
Don't stress about the rest.

421
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:53,410
It's all about what you want.

422
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:03,220
I don't want to go back,

423
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:08,740
but I'd like to see Mr. Liao one more time.

424
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:11,370
He's always

425
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:14,330
had my best interests at heart.

426
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:15,890
He researched you

427
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:17,130
and trained you to kill,

428
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,330
yet you still think he has your best interests at heart?

429
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,650
Can you help me put it back on?

430
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:56,090
I really have no idea what you're thinking.

431
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:01,610
I don't know either,

432
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,650
which is why I want to go and find out.

433
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:13,940
Hello.

434
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:16,530
Chen Duo,

435
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:17,980
where are you?

436
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:22,050
Not far at all.

437
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:23,090
I'll be there soon.

438
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:28,420
You went alone?

439
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:29,290
Didn't you bring anyone with you?

440
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:30,850
I'm the closest to Chen Duo,

441
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:32,130
so I went ahead.

442
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:34,050
I've informed the others as well,

443
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:35,530
so don't worry. Everything is under control.

444
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:37,220
Turn on the receiver

445
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:38,900
so we can stay updated.

446
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,130
Send me the location.

447
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:41,220
Those who took Chen Duo

448
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:42,570
don't seem to want any trouble.

449
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:43,940
They brought her back

450
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:45,500
after clarifying the situation.

451
00:25:58,290 --> 00:25:59,020
Chen Duo!

452
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:01,660
Chen Duo!

453
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:04,900
Chen Duo!

454
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:11,700
Chen Duo.

455
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:14,020
Chen Duo!

456
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:18,290
Mr. Liao.

457
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:24,940
Chen Duo!

458
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:27,130
Are you all right?

459
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:28,660
Did those people give you a hard time?

460
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:30,220
No.

461
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:32,260
Good, that's a relief.

462
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:34,020
You gave me quite a scare.

463
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,700
You were right to choose this place to meet.

464
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,220
From now on, always inform me

465
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,700
about any issues you encounter.

466
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,420
Tell me what those people did to you

467
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:43,900
on the way back.

468
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:45,850
I won't let them get away with it.

469
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:47,090
Let's go.

470
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:51,530
Chen Duo.

471
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:52,610
Let's go.

472
00:26:58,770 --> 00:26:59,740
Mr. Liao,

473
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,420
is it all right

474
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:05,900
if I don't go back?

475
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:11,330
Mr. Liao,

476
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:12,570
is it all right

477
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:13,850
if I don't go back?

478
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:25,850
Silly girl,

479
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:27,260
what are you talking about?

480
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:29,570
I'm here to pick you up.

481
00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:31,130
Come with me.

482
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:32,220
Mr. Liao.

483
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:33,660
Come with me!

484
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:35,180
Let's go.

485
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:35,770
Mr. Liao.

486
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:39,740
Shut up.

487
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:42,130
Don't speak a word from now on.

488
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,330
Shut up!

489
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:45,850
Mr. Liao,

490
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:52,740
I'm not going back.

491
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:53,980
I told you to shut up!

492
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:56,090
What's so hard to understand?

493
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:57,420
Liao Zhong, do it.

494
00:27:58,940 --> 00:27:59,610
Mr. Bi,

495
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:00,570
everyone,

496
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,180
this child is sick.

497
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,220
Yes, she's sick.

498
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:05,180
Just give me some time.

499
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:06,330
I'll take her back right away.

500
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:07,460
Don't worry,

501
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:08,530
Mr. Liao.

502
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:11,290
Someone says he can help cure me.

503
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:22,180
Chen Duo, what are you talking about?

504
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:23,180
So what if someone said that?

505
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:24,460
It doesn't matter.

506
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:25,810
Do you hear me?

507
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:27,260
Those things aren't important.

508
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:29,220
What matters is that you come back with me right now.

509
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:31,020
Yes, Mr. Liao.

510
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:33,500
None of that matters.

511
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:35,290
Neither the company

512
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:36,810
nor the bunker

513
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:38,740
matters.

514
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:42,330
What matters to me

515
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,570
is you.

516
00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:51,090
Chen Duo,

517
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:53,740
don't push me!

518
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:58,530
Liao Zhong,

519
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:00,050
the Poison Girl has begun to have second thoughts

520
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:01,290
and is no longer useful to us.

521
00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:02,260
Do it now.

522
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:03,900
Mr. Bi, just give me a moment.

523
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:04,980
I'll knock her out

524
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,220
and bring her back.

525
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,130
Have you lost your mind?

526
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:16,980
What have you

527
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:20,020
done to me?

528
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:51,020
This is what happened

529
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:53,940
behind Chen Duo's defection.

530
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:02,260
Why?

531
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:05,770
Why did you go to see Liao?

532
00:30:06,770 --> 00:30:09,530
Do you think he'd kill you?

533
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:12,260
He wouldn't.

534
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:15,570
Liao's not that kind of person.

535
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:17,810
Why?

536
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,180
That doesn't make sense.

537
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:21,220
The story Chen Duo told Meng

538
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:22,740
doesn't quite add up.

539
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,290
The whole situation seems to make sense at first,

540
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:27,420
but there are a few parts that don't really add up.

541
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:29,420
If Chen Duo really wanted to escape,

542
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:31,130
she could have easily avoided Liao Zhong

543
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:32,330
and disappeared alone.

544
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:33,700
Why would she return

545
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:34,770
to see him for one last time

546
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:37,130
and put herself in that situation?

547
00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:38,770
According to the autopsy,

548
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:41,090
Liao Zhong did die from Chen Duo's poison.

549
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:42,460
But his internal organs

550
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:44,420
were gradually corroded.

551
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:46,850
Yes,

552
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:48,090
that's the key point.

553
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:50,700
If Chen Duo only wanted to leave the company

554
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:52,370
and gain the so-called freedom,

555
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:53,810
she wouldn't need to return

556
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:55,290
and meet Liao Zhong for the last time.

557
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:56,940
Even if

558
00:30:57,090 --> 00:30:58,130
she did return,

559
00:30:58,610 --> 00:30:59,980
based on her account,

560
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:01,460
it doesn't seem like things

561
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:02,980
had escalated to the point where she had to kill Liao Zhong.

562
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:05,810
Chen Duo must be hiding something

563
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:07,330
about this matter,

564
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,940
and we need to get to the bottom of it.

565
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:12,530
Ma Xianhong,

566
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:15,260
you'd better stick to your so-called principles.

567
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:18,020
Don't hand Chen Duo over just yet,

568
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:19,980
or I'll be in a bind.

569
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:22,460
If we can uncover

570
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:24,050
the truth hidden by Chen Duo,

571
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:25,660
we can resolve this.

572
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:27,940
However, regarding this particular matter,

573
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:30,610
my inherent flaw is a major problem.

574
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:32,700
I know nothing

575
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:34,940
about women.

576
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:36,330
Why?

577
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,770
Why?

578
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:40,020
Those guys

579
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:42,330
have likely spotted the issue.

580
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:43,460
Actually,

581
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:45,610
they might be able to answer my questions,

582
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:48,180
but I can't exactly ask them.

583
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:51,330
After all, they are my biggest threat

584
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:52,700
on this trip.

585
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:56,700
Perhaps I should consider Bao's opinion

586
00:31:58,530 --> 00:31:59,090
as sometimes,

587
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:00,610
she does have a unique way

588
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:02,090
of looking at things.

589
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:04,130
Wait a minute.

590
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:06,090
I'm not drunk enough to do that.

591
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:09,460
Maybe Wang could help?

592
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:11,740
No,

593
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:13,660
he's pretty smart,

594
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,330
but he's the type

595
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:16,090
who doesn't waste time

596
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:17,900
on women.

597
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:21,050
Besides, right now, he's either searching for the Refining Furnace

598
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:23,180
or resting up

599
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:25,260
to take down Ma Xianhong and Zhuge Qing.

600
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:27,570
Oh,

601
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:30,420
how could I forget about that guy?

602
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:35,770
It's truly a sad story.

603
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:37,610
The protagonist of the story

604
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:38,610
must be Chen Duo, right?

605
00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:39,500
No.

606
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,610
Stop making wild guesses.

607
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:41,370
Zhang Chulan,

608
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:42,770
you say you're clueless about women,

609
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:43,980
but I think

610
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:45,460
you're actually quite clever.

611
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:47,090
You've unwittingly

612
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:48,740
pinpointed the core of the issue:

613
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:50,180
women.

614
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:52,810
Women?

615
00:32:52,810 --> 00:32:53,500
Yes.

616
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:54,900
You wonder why the heroine

617
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,420
would conceal the truth in a way

618
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:57,980
that's so easy to expose.

619
00:32:58,220 --> 00:32:59,420
Based on what you've told me,

620
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:01,020
I think it's most likely

621
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:04,020
that she doesn't care about being found out.

622
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:06,050
No matter how much you press her,

623
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:08,180
she won't tell you the truth

624
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:09,810
because, in the end, the story

625
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:12,290
is about the memories shared between a man and a woman,

626
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,330
a secret just for the two of them.

627
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:16,290
At the end of the story,

628
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:18,180
the heroine put on the deadly collar,

629
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:19,660
giving up her hard-won freedom,

630
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:21,260
just to see the hero one last time.

631
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:22,940
Those things aren't important.

632
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:24,530
What matters is that you come back with me right now.

633
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:26,610
Yes, Mr. Liao.

634
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,050
None of that matters.

635
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:30,740
What matters to me

636
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:34,180
is you.

637
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:35,900
Doesn't this show

638
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:37,610
how important the hero is to the heroine?

639
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:43,900
People

640
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:46,530
leave

641
00:33:46,530 --> 00:33:47,980
or come to a place

642
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:48,980
for the same reason.

643
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:52,220
It all depends

644
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:55,770
on whether it offers something they truly want.

645
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:05,370
The heroine going to meet the hero

646
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,460
wasn't so much about saying goodbye.

647
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:09,530
It was more about weighing her options.

648
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:11,730
If the hero could give her

649
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:13,210
what she was looking for,

650
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:14,860
she might have stayed.

651
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:16,500
Zhang Chulan,

652
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:18,500
to uncover the truth,

653
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:19,900
you need to figure out

654
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,500
what the heroine truly desires.

655
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:26,130
But the hero is already dead.

656
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:27,170
How am I supposed to know?

657
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:28,420
Just make a guess.

658
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:29,340
A guess?

659
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:30,050
Yes,

660
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:31,380
you have to guess.

661
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:34,690
♪The thoughts of a girl♪

662
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:36,420
♪They are not for you to guess, boy♪

663
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:41,860
♪You'll never guess them right, no matter how hard you try♪

664
00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:50,820
Take dating as an example.

665
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:51,900
Those who can flirt with women

666
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:53,650
are just beginners.

667
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:56,860
Those who pamper women

668
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,300
are intermediate.

669
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:02,170
But those who truly understand women

670
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:04,340
are the real masters.

671
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:08,420
But this is too complicated,

672
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:11,050
and they're not even lovers.

673
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:12,730
Wait a minute.

674
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:15,780
I think I get it now.

675
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:22,170
I gave up my freedom

676
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,500
and risked death

677
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:26,170
just to see you one more time.

678
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:27,460
Because you

679
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:28,500
are more important to me

680
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:30,570
than my freedom and even my life.

681
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:34,610
I don't need to search far and wide.

682
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,380
The path

683
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:38,130
lies in your hands.

684
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:39,730
I see it now.

685
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:41,210
I see it. Give it to me.

686
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,610
Give me what I want.

687
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:45,170
Just give it to me.

688
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:46,860
I...

689
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:49,650
Qing, with that exaggerated acting of yours,

690
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:51,530
how did you manage to stay in the crew?

691
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:52,380
Is that even related?

692
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:55,340
Your analysis is logically sound.

693
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:57,090
The hero is both a strict teacher

694
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:58,170
and a caring father

695
00:35:58,170 --> 00:35:59,250
to the heroine,

696
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:01,210
but clearly,

697
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:03,420
he hasn't given her the outcome she desires.

698
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:09,300
There's also the sad possibility

699
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:10,530
that the man gave her

700
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:13,170
the wrong thing.

701
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:14,980
Gave her the wrong thing?

702
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:19,020
There are men

703
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:20,380
who are perfect in every way.

704
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:22,820
They give wholeheartedly,

705
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:24,570
even going so far as to assume

706
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:26,090
they know exactly what the other person wants.

707
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:28,380
But once a conflict

708
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:29,460
arises over this,

709
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:31,770
if the man doesn't realize his mistake soon enough,

710
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:33,210
the relationship is doomed

711
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:34,610
to fall apart.

712
00:36:35,090 --> 00:36:35,900
They just don't understand

713
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,610
what women want,

714
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:38,940
and there are plenty

715
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:40,170
of such men.

716
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:41,460
All right,

717
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:42,690
I've said enough.

718
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:43,730
I should head back now.

719
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:44,980
Whatever you're planning to do,

720
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:47,210
good luck.

721
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:48,060
Qing,

722
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:50,020
since we don't see each other often,

723
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:51,170
let's talk a bit more.

724
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:53,730
Wang Ye

725
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:55,650
told me about what happened with you.

726
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,380
So, about Ma Xianhong

727
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:59,340
and the Refining Furnace,

728
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:01,820
you didn't get involved,

729
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:03,730
did you?

730
00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:07,650
Are you

731
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:09,980
asking me this as the employee

732
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,060
of NDT Express?

733
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:17,060
As your friend.

734
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:21,730
In that case, I've got nothing more to say.

735
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:22,900
Sorry.

736
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:24,500
Qing,

737
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:27,540
you're pretty close to Ma Xianhong now.

738
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:30,060
If push comes to shove,

739
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:32,210
we won't end up as enemies,

740
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:33,090
right?

741
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:43,500
Zhang Chulan, you know,

742
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:45,940
the most fascinating thing about fate

743
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,730
is that the future is always full of uncertainty.

744
00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:50,090
If you ask me now,

745
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:51,610
all I can say is this:

746
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:53,020
it can't be predicted.

747
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:55,860
I'm off.

748
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:06,340
According to Qing,

749
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:08,090
what Chen Duo wants can only be guessed.

750
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,020
The private matters between her and Liao Zhong

751
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:12,420
are impossible to ask about.

752
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:14,250
This guy is indeed adept

753
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:15,610
when it comes to matters between men and women.

754
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:17,980
But he overlooked one thing,

755
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:20,380
what's Ma Xianhong's role in this?

756
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:21,690
Freedom?

757
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:23,250
No,

758
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:24,690
based on Qing's analysis,

759
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:25,860
Liao Zhong has

760
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:27,340
what Chen Duo truly wants,

761
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:28,900
and it's clearly not freedom.

762
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:30,820
I must ask her again

763
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:32,570
and not miss a single detail.

764
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:04,700
That's not how basketball is played.

765
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:14,910
I scored!

766
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:19,180
You seem to be great at basketball.

767
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:20,580
Who taught you?

768
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:21,620
A

769
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:23,660
friend.

770
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:27,100
A friend you made in the village?

771
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:29,220
A friend from the Bunker.

772
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:31,260
His name is Chen Junyan.

773
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:32,990
Have you heard of him?

774
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:41,220
Why did you come

775
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:42,660
to see me?

776
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:44,950
Chen Duo.

777
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:45,660
Chen Duo.

778
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:46,220
Could you tell me

779
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:48,660
the detailed story of how you arrived here?

780
00:40:54,350 --> 00:40:55,030
Yes.

781
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:05,260
Chief Ma brought me back to Biyou Village.

782
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:06,350
He told me

783
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:08,030
I no longer need to return to the Bunker,

784
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:12,260
but I still wanted to see Mr. Liao again.

785
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:13,950
Chen Duo,

786
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:16,140
what did you do to Liao Zhong

787
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:17,830
before he died?

788
00:41:18,990 --> 00:41:20,220
I asked him to end my life.

789
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:25,620
Chen Duo,

790
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:28,310
don't push me!

791
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:33,390
Liao Zhong,

792
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:34,780
the Poison Girl has begun to have second thoughts

793
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:36,070
and is no longer useful to us.

794
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:36,830
Do it now.

795
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:38,550
Mr. Bi, just give me a moment.

796
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:39,550
I'll knock her out

797
00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:40,780
and bring her back.

798
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:47,390
Mr. Liao.

799
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:49,510
Chen Duo,

800
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:51,830
don't push me.

801
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:11,350
Mr. Liao,

802
00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:15,430
I was right to come here.

803
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:17,950
What?

804
00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:22,550
I'm happy.

805
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:26,510
I've never felt this happy.

806
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:38,580
Mr. Liao,

807
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:41,300
let me leave.

808
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:44,180
Do it.

809
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:47,260
That's an order.

810
00:42:47,470 --> 00:42:48,100
Do it!

811
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:49,070
No.

812
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:52,180
Then,

813
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:54,300
come with me.

814
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:55,660
No!

815
00:42:57,470 --> 00:42:58,580
In that case,

816
00:42:58,780 --> 00:42:59,660
Mr. Liao,

817
00:43:00,830 --> 00:43:01,830
end my life.

818
00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:20,140
Have you lost your mind?

819
00:43:27,070 --> 00:43:27,740
Liao Zhong,

820
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:29,030
what happened?

821
00:43:31,390 --> 00:43:32,300
Liao Zhong, answer me.

822
00:43:35,030 --> 00:43:35,700
Liao Zhong!

823
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:39,470
What have you

824
00:43:40,470 --> 00:43:42,390
done to me?

825
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:44,620
The Primordial Poison.

826
00:43:45,390 --> 00:43:46,550
You once told me

827
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:47,990
that the essence of the poison technique

828
00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:50,070
is to make my internal organs

829
00:43:50,070 --> 00:43:51,350
a breeding ground for these toxins,

830
00:43:52,390 --> 00:43:53,950
which are the Primordial Poison.

831
00:43:54,470 --> 00:43:56,620
They feed on the qi within my body.

832
00:43:58,140 --> 00:43:59,580
If I lose my qi,

833
00:44:00,470 --> 00:44:00,950
the poison

834
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:02,870
will immediately lose its power.

835
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:15,300
Now,

836
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:16,580
Mr. Liao,

837
00:44:17,470 --> 00:44:18,300
end my life.

838
00:44:25,350 --> 00:44:26,470
Once I'm dead,

839
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:29,100
the poison in you will be gone too.

840
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:37,140
Liao Zhong,

841
00:44:38,350 --> 00:44:39,950
what's going on right now?

842
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:41,470
Liao Zhong.

843
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:43,140
Liao Zhong, answer me.

844
00:44:49,430 --> 00:44:49,990
Liao Zhong.

845
00:44:51,350 --> 00:44:51,910
Liao Zhong!

846
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:02,430
Is this what it feels like

847
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:06,390
to have something like this planted in your body?

848
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:09,870
All this time,

849
00:45:11,350 --> 00:45:12,660
you've been enduring this pain,

850
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:15,300
haven't you?

851
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:20,220
Chen Duo,

852
00:45:22,070 --> 00:45:24,030
I know you want to run away,

853
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:26,660
but doing that

854
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:29,660
will only make things worse.

855
00:45:30,910 --> 00:45:32,180
Hold on

856
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:35,260
to what you've been wanting the most

857
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:37,740
this whole time.

858
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:41,070
I'm here with you.

859
00:45:43,350 --> 00:45:44,780
Don't give up.

860
00:45:56,830 --> 00:45:57,740
Mr. Liao,

861
00:46:02,390 --> 00:46:04,430
so you really don't get it at all.

862
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:10,350
In the Bunker,

863
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:12,620
you all taught me many things.

864
00:46:13,430 --> 00:46:14,740
You said I was a fast learner

865
00:46:15,070 --> 00:46:16,220
and praised me for being smart.

866
00:46:19,070 --> 00:46:20,390
Were you lying to me?

867
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:23,950
If you weren't,

868
00:46:27,830 --> 00:46:30,350
then why are you treating me like a fool now?

869
00:46:32,910 --> 00:46:34,140
Why do you think

870
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:35,350
I'm stupid enough

871
00:46:35,350 --> 00:46:36,950
to want a "normal" life?

872
00:46:38,990 --> 00:46:41,260
Even if you can cure my body,

873
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:44,950
can you

874
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:48,350
make this part of me

875
00:46:49,070 --> 00:46:50,470
normal too?

876
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:53,350
Can you give me

877
00:46:54,350 --> 00:46:56,070
a so-called "normal" past?

878
00:47:02,870 --> 00:47:04,780
I've never cared about those things.

879
00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:08,140
For me,

880
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:11,830
what can make me happiest is simple.

00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:35,700
Mr. Liao is dead.

888
00:48:40,430 --> 00:48:42,390
This is the entire story.

889
00:48:45,870 --> 00:48:47,550
Only by using this method

890
00:48:48,030 --> 00:48:50,180
could Liao Zhong understand what you wanted.

891
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:52,030
Unfortunately,

892
00:48:52,430 --> 00:48:54,390
he never did, not even until his death.

893
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:57,140
But I still have to thank you,

894
00:48:57,470 --> 00:48:58,070
Liao Zhong.

895
00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:00,660
I will make good use

896
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:02,950
of the poisonous flower

897
00:49:04,070 --> 00:49:05,390
you nurtured with your own blood.

898
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:26,510
Did you do this?

899
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:04,470
Morning.

900
00:51:05,910 --> 00:51:06,510
Meng?

901
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:13,390
Chen Junyan says something has happened to Chen Duo.

902
00:51:20,990 --> 00:51:22,740
What is this strange thing?

903
00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:26,870
It must be Chief Ma

904
00:51:26,870 --> 00:51:28,470
who didn't want you near me,

905
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:30,470
so he isolated this place.

906
00:51:36,430 --> 00:51:37,740
Ma Xianhong,

907
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:39,430
let me out.

908
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:45,180
Ma Xianhong!

909
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:52,870
Is this Chief Ma some kind of freak?

910
00:51:53,030 --> 00:51:54,430
Does he enjoy locking people up?

911
00:51:56,260 --> 00:51:57,180
I don't think so.

912
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:01,550
Chief Ma

913
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:04,780
is a good person.

914
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:18,430
The divine crafts that forge tangible power,

915
00:52:19,070 --> 00:52:20,990
coupled with techniques that utilize abstract forces,

916
00:52:21,510 --> 00:52:22,910
create a perfect combination.

917
00:52:24,870 --> 00:52:26,910
Zhuge Qing used the ultimate phantasmagoria technique

918
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:28,870
to guide the Refining Furnace in the correct direction.

919
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:31,300
The techniques are evolving endlessly,

920
00:52:31,550 --> 00:52:33,470
and the structure of the divine crafts keeps improving.

921
00:52:34,870 --> 00:52:36,830
By giving Zhuge Qing the Divine Forge,

922
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:38,620
I triggered the awakening of the Refining Furnace.

923
00:52:40,910 --> 00:52:43,580
Now, I can finally recover my memories.
