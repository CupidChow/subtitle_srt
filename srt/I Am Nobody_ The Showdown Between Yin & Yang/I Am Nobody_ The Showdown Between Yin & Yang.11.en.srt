I won't make it.

All I can give you now

3
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,430
is this heart.

4
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:55,750
You've already died once,

5
00:00:58,070 --> 00:00:59,790
so consider your past

6
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,200
a closed chapter.

7
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:07,790
From now on,

8
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,040
free yourself of all burdens

9
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,840
and keep living.

10
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,590

Guan.

13

Guan.

14
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:59,400
Guan.

15
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,870
Are they all gone now?

16
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,190
You scared the life out of me.

There's no need for me to step in.

58

and fight with everything you've got

60
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,720

going to lose?

78
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:31,630
Lose to these people?

79
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,150
Sis,

80
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,910
the enemies are formidable.

81
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,390
Every single one of them.

82
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:39,270
Every one of them is a pain in the neck.

83
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:41,030
Where did they find

84
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:42,790
these maniacs?

85
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:44,510
How come they are so powerful?

86
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,870
You are still alive.

87
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:50,750
Sorry to disappoint you.

88
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,510
The heart implanted in me

89
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:55,960
was once my comrade's,

90
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,910
and it's not exactly in the usual position.

91
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:01,870
You've pierced the wrong spot.

92
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,320
Your Divine Forge is truly impressive,

93
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:14,360
and your magic weapons are powerful.

94
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,870
Our mortal bodies are weak,

95
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,510
but our experiences

96
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,870
have granted us great strength.

97
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:24,960
The strength is so powerful

98
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:27,120
that it can defeat you.

99
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,390
Chief Ma,

100
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,910
this is something you will never possess.

101
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:37,910
Then all of you

102
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,670
can die.

103
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,480
Guys, let's attack him together!

104
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,000
What's going on?

105
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,790
Does this guy have

106
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:09,360
a new form of protection?

107
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,600
Stop attacking him.

108
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,390
What you're attacking

109
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:36,000
isn't his protection.

110
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:37,790
It's a gap caused

111
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:39,320
by the distortion of time.

112
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:41,440
Wang?

113
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,670
Be honest with me.

114
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:48,000
Does the company want Ma Xianhong dead?

115
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:51,360
I don't know,

116
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:52,360
but we were told

117
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,840
to bring him back alive if possible.

118
00:11:58,870 --> 00:11:59,670
All right.

119
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:01,270
That's good enough.

120
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:04,720
I'll handle his magic weapons.

121
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,790
Just make sure you don't go too hard on him.

122
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,750
I don't want to see

123
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,320
anyone getting hurt.

124
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:22,440
We both have a bad habit.

125
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,480
We want to change other people's fates.

126
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:30,200
The last time I did that,

127
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,720
I almost lost one of my best friends.

128
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:37,840
Qing was right.

129
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,120
I don't have the right to do that.

130
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,000
But how can I stand by and do nothing,

131
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:47,120
knowing that you, Chief Ma,

132
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,510
will bring great chaos to this world?

133
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,360
If I have to choose,

134
00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:00,270
I'll bear all the consequences

135
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:03,320
of changing your fate.

136
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,440
Your attacks on Ma Xianhong

137
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,480
were disrupted by the Chaos Golden Space Rip.

138
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,790
It's a technique from Qimen Manipulation

139
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,480
that controls time.

140
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:15,510
Or, more precisely,

141
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:17,870
it is a technique that alters

142
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:18,750
the speed of change.

143
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,270
It shifts the target

144
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:22,360
into a different space where time flows at a different rate.

145
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:25,200
While the target may appear to still be in front of you,

146
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,150
what you're actually touching

147
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:29,910
is merely a gap caused by the distortion of time.

148
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:32,910
Any force applied to this gap

149
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,910
will rebound entirely

150
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:36,390
onto the one applying it.

151
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,630
It's not impossible

152
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:47,720
to affect a target

153
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,510
in another timeline.

154
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:52,270
But you'd need to use

155
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:53,870
an additional technique on yourself.

156
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,270
Slow the body down by fiftyfold.

157
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:03,910
Tortoise-Musca Technique.

158
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,910
I can burn my life force

159
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,510
to boost my body's performance

160
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:14,910
to five times the normal rate.

161
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:18,630
That should suffice.

162
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:20,630
If I push any further,

163
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,320
my body won't hold up.

164
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,750
How remarkable.

165
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,240
Even these seasoned

166
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,720
and formidable figures

167
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,480
are utterly stunned

168
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,630
and at a loss for words.

169
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,200
His movements appear so much slower

170
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,720
than an old man's morning exercises.

171
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:48,200
Wait.

172
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,750
Perhaps it's that uncanny slowness

173
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,150
that showcases

174
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:56,150
the sheer force in his punch.

175
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:19,200
Chaos Golden Space Rip!

176
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,870
Tortoise-Fly Form,

177
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,120
disengage!

178
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,240
Attack!

179
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,510
Ma,

180
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,510
that's enough.

181
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,480
The winner has been decided.

182
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,840
Come back to the company with us.

183
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,790
Your Refining Furnace is far too dangerous,

184
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,200
and it could jeopardize the peace of the entire Outsiders' world.

185
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:30,030
We have to stop you.

186
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:31,360
Please stop now.

187
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:33,510
I need my Refining Furnace!

188
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:36,870
I need to use it to recover my memories.

189
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,550
I want to use it

190
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:40,440
to help all those like Chen Duo.

191
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,510
I want to help them

192
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:44,150
regain control of their own fate.

193
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,150
And now,

194
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,320
you've ruined everything!

195
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,110
Zhang Chulan,

196
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,480
if you have the guts, kill me right now.

197
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,440
Otherwise, I'll never surrender.

198
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,750
Why insist on this,

199
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:44,960
Chief Ma?

200
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:48,400
We all understand that you have your own beliefs,

201
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:49,830
and we are deeply grateful

202
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:51,960
for everything you've done for Chen Duo.

203
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:54,310
Everyone here

204
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:55,480
has to admit

205
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,920
that the Divine Forge

206
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,510
is truly impressive.

207
00:17:58,510 --> 00:17:59,640
We also believe

208
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,480
that you have the strength to carry on.

209
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,070
But is it really necessary?

210
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,960
All it will do is force everyone to exert more effort

211
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,640
while you endure even greater pain.

212
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,000
That will be the outcome.

213
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:11,440
Have you ever considered

214
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,440
the unimaginable consequences

215
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,590
of turning so many ordinary people into Outsiders?

216
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,790
Stop being so stubborn.

217
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:19,750
Don't tell me you are afraid to face the company.

218
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:27,440
I am afraid.

219
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:32,960
Haven't you seen through the company yet?

220
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:36,400
All right.

221
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,160
I'll go meet those high-and-mighty folks

222
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,030
at the company.

223
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:17,440
Zhang Chulan,

224
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:20,310
make sure you've collected all those beads.

225
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:21,920
They'll have to be handed over to the company later.

226
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:27,350
Bao,

227
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:28,030
the beads.

228
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:31,270
Hand me the beads.

229
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,310
Four.

230
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,200
Only four?

231
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:47,790
Guan, I got them.

232
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,310
If you didn't make this furnace,

233
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,550
I wouldn't have stood in your way

234
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,640
and I'd even be fine with being your friend.

235
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:23,270
If you didn't make this furnace,

236
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:25,240
I might actually be on your side

237
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,310
if they took action against the village.

238
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,030
Ma Xianhong,

239
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:32,510
no matter what you think of me,

240
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,920
I have one piece of advice for you before I leave.

241
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,000
Someone

242
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,200
has a major influence on your life.

243
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:42,920
If you want

244
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,830
a peaceful life,

245
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:48,680
stay away from her.

246
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:54,400
Wang,

247
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,510
you're at it again with all that fortune-telling nonsense.

248
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:58,590
Zhang,

249
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:01,030
that day,

250
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,110
you,

251
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:03,070
I,

252
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:04,400
and Qing

253
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,070
were in the phantasmagoria,

254
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,720
and you asked a question.

255
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:09,590
Zhang Chulan,

256
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:10,920
what did you ask?

257
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:19,200
That nearly got the three of us into some serious trouble.

258
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:22,110
It was about Feng Baobao, wasn't it?

259
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,830
What I just said

260
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:30,960
applies to you too.

261
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:33,790
I'm off.

262
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,030
This time, I'm completely drained.

263
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:43,920
I'll head down the mountain and find a big bed

264
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:46,030
to sleep for a solid two days.

265
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:51,550
Someone

266
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,960
has a major influence on your life.

267
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,590
I'm doing this because of a request from someone,

268
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,830
someone I can't say no to.

269
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:04,110
The company's team

270
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:06,000
to receive the criminal is almost here.

271
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:08,200
Chief Ma,

272
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:10,550
we need to get going.

273
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,030
This is going to be a bit uncomfortable for you,

274
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:18,400
but I trust you can understand.

275
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,720
You need to understand

276
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:46,480
that I'm allowing this

277
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:48,590
because I want to.

278
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:52,270
I wanted to help you take back your lives,

279
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,400
but you chose

280
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,480
to remain under their control.

281
00:22:57,790 --> 00:23:00,510
You helped the company kill Chen Duo.

282
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,550
Remember,

283
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,680
Chen Duo is dead,

284
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,830
and so are you.

285
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,750
The issue with Ma Xianhong and Biyou Village

286
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:28,830
has been resolved.

287
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:31,550
Now, the only task left is dealing with Chen Duo.

288
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:36,920
Guys,

289
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:38,400
should we make a move?

290
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:40,440
Let's wait a bit.

291
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:42,400
After all, Chen Duo didn't side with Ma Xianhong

292
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,350
to fight against us

293
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,640
There's still a chance to negotiate.

294
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,550
I'll go speak to her first.

295
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:48,750
Can you handle this on your own?

296
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,680
It's more than just asking questions this time.

297
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,160
After the Medicine Immortal Association was eradicated,

298
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,640
the company redefined the poison technique,

299
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:02,030
which is to use qi to induce mutations

300
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,550
in the microorganisms inside living creatures.

301
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:06,720
This approach serves as the foundation

302
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,480
for the poison technique.

303
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,510
In terms of controlling living beings,

304
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,510
there's some overlap between the poisoners' methods and mine.

305
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,200
Therefore, a certain amount of poison

306
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,680
is ineffective against me.

307
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,200
Instead, I can use it

308
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,550
as a weapon.

309
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,750
I have a natural advantage

310
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,070
in dealing with poisoners compared to you...

311
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,510
What are you doing?

312
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:25,550
Wait!

313
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:27,110
Wait for me!

314
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:30,510
Zhang Chulan,

315
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:31,350
what were you doing?

316
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:32,830
Why didn't you keep your soldier in check?

317
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,550
I got distracted for a moment, and she...

318
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,750
That's it, Bao.

319
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,880
Just as we agreed before,

320
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:43,240
ignore everyone, including me.

321
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:56,400
Don't act rashly, Feng Baobao.

322
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:57,830
Feng Baobao.

323
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:59,110
Get the med kit now,

324
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:00,510
or it's game over.

325
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,920
How do I use it?

326
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,200
Tap on it.

327
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,960
Chen Duo,

328
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,680
what are you two doing?

329
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,550
I'm waiting for you all.

330
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,750
Have you

331
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:23,830
taken down Chief Ma?

332
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:25,510
Baobao,

333
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,510
what exactly happened?

334
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,310
Just the day before,

335
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,880
she came to see me alone,

336
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:35,240
asked about what happened to me again,

337
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:37,790
and in the end,

338
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,000
she asked me...

339
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,110
Chen Duo.

340
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,920
We'll offer you a choice.

341
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:48,400
We

342
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,400
are going to attack this village soon.

343
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,350
Chief Ma and his subordinates

344
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:53,960
will become our enemies.

345
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,750
You can either choose to join them

346
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:56,920
and fight against us,

347
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:58,680
or you can stay here.

348
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,350
As for your future,

349
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:02,440
we'll meet with you once the village is destroyed.

350
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,310
Maybe you'll have

351
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:05,550
new options by then.

352
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:06,920
What do you think?

353
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:09,030
The latter.

354
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:12,400
I decided to wait for you guys.

355
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,350
It was my own choice.

356
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:16,160
Bao,

357
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:16,960
why didn't you tell me

358
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:17,920
about something so big?

359
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,270
Why didn't you notify the rest of us beforehand?

360
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,270
If this went wrong,

361
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:21,240
the consequences could be serious.

362
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,400
Enough, Zhang Chulan.

363
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,440
Cut it out.

364
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,640
Perfect,

365
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,550
great development.

366
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,400
Only you, Bao,

367
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,200
could do something so ridiculous

368
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,160
and not make it feel suspicious.

369
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,350
Choices?

370
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,510
I see now.

371
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,750
I can't believe I actually missed that.

372
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,310
Now it all makes sense.

373
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:45,030
And of all people, this clueless person

374
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,350
was the first to notice.

375
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:47,720
So,

376
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,270
what should I do now?

377
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:52,440
I don't know.

378
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,110
Did you lie to me?

379
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,510
You can ask them

380
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:00,750
about what you should do.

381
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,640
They have plenty of ideas.

382
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:05,680
This is great.

383
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:08,240
Well done, Feng Baobao.

384
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:09,110
Then, let's...

385
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:09,960
Meng,

386
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,720
choose your words wisely.

387
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:16,790
I understand.

388
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,030
I understand.

389
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:22,590
Choices.

390
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:25,440
Liao Zhong,

391
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,350
I must say that you treated Chen Duo very well.

392
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:31,720
You gave her care,

393
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,030
love,

394
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,830
and everything you could think of,

395
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,880
even your life.

396
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:40,960
But what you forgot

397
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:43,680
was that after Chen Duo regained her human needs,

398
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:44,920
she was still living a life

399
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,640
with no choices.

400
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,510
After years of being the Poison Girl,

401
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,440
the physical and mental pain

402
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,790
has become her norm.

403
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:57,640
To her, that's just life.

404
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,030
From the Poison Girl

405
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:01,160
to the temporary worker, Chen Duo,

406
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:03,880
the treatment may be worlds apart,

407
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:07,030
but when it comes to life choices,

408
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,310
both are like puppets.

409
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,830
As for the freedom you promised,

410
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,720
it's nothing more than a fantasy.

411
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:18,790
No one has absolute freedom,

412
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,880
and Chen Duo

413
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:23,270
doesn't even understand what freedom truly means.

414
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:30,750
Before painting those illusions,

415
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,590
you overlooked

416
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,510
her deep yearning for choice.

417
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,270
Chen Duo,

418
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,310
you have a choice.

419
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,720
You can choose to come back with us,

420
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:46,960
back to the company.

421
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:48,640
I won't let anyone harm you,

422
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,000
I promise.

423
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,400
Of course,

424
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:52,680
you can also choose...

425
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,680
You can also...

426
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,270
You can also...

427
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:03,510
What will you choose?

428
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,720
Mr. Liao,

429
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:18,350
for me,

430
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:21,160
being able to make my own choices

431
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:23,920
is a truly happy thing.

432
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,070
I don't understand

433
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:29,750
the happiness

434
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:31,680
you all often talk about,

435
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:38,000
but there's one thing

436
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,310
I've dreamed of.

437
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,350
