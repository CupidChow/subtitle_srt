1
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,750
How much for a bowl?

2
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:35,600
Hello.

3
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:36,520
Who's this?

4
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:37,710
Wang Ye,

5
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,350
how's your trip?

6
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,200
Have you decided on your next stop?

7
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,670
Who are you?

8
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,470
If you haven't decided yet,

9
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:53,790
you can come to me.

10
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:55,880
Let me introduce myself.

11
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:57,390
I'm Ma Xianhong,

12
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,390
a descendant of Ma Benzai of the Divine Forge.

13
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,710
We, the inheritors of the Eight Supremes,

14
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:05,200
should gather

15
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,510
and do something together.

16
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:15,040
You've got the wrong person.

17
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:16,680
Don't be in such a rush to turn me down.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:17,790
Give it some thought first.

19
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:18,840
By the way,

20
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,790
one of your friends,

21
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:22,150
Zhuge Qing,

22
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:24,400
should already be on his way here.

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,560
Let me know once you've made up your mind.

24
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,040
I'll be waiting.

25
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:42,920
Hey,

26
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:44,000
Qing.

27
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,040
Hey, Wang.

28
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,040
What's up?

29
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,150
Nothing.

30
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,680
I'm just checking in on you.

31
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:50,920
Have you

32
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,350
run into any trouble

33
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,400
or met anyone strange recently?

34
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,510
I wouldn't necessarily call it

35
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:57,040
trouble,

36
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:58,430
but I have met

37
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,040
someone strange.

38
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:03,040
And I'm going to a strange place with her

39
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,590
to meet a strange village chief.

40
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,230
Accidents are frequent ahead.

41
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,840
Please drive carefully.

42
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,120
Accidents are frequent ahead.

43
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,190
Please drive carefully.

44
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:14,150
That's my voice.

45
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,150
What do you think?

46
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,240
Pretty nice, huh?

47
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,470
Weirdo.

48
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,080
What is it?

49
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,030
Did they contact you too?

50
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:26,280
We don't know anything about these people

51
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,870
or their intentions.

52
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,120
It's too dangerous.

53
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,310
They're dangerous,

54
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,800
but I'm no pushover either.

55
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,910
Qing,

56
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:39,960
- this... - Wang,

57
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,520
I appreciate

58

the call,

59
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:44,310
but this is a personal matter,

60
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:45,840

I wasn't surprised

91
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,630
by this stubborn mule's reaction.

92
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,360
He insisted on coming,

93
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,000
so I had no choice

94
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,470
but to follow him.

95
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:23,390
So,

96
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:24,510
did you come over because you're worried

97
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:26,040
the village chief might see me as a threat

98
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,630
and eliminate me?

99
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,120
You could say so.

100
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:35,160
Wang,

101
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:37,750
you really don't need to be like this.

102
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,360
Don't feel like you owe me anything

103
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,430
just because you beat me once.

104
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:42,750
To be honest,

105
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,600
I still hold a grudge

106
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,510
about how you defeated me,

107
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,750
but that's my issue to sort out,

108
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,870
not yours.

109
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,600
I really do owe you an apology.

110
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,120
The truth is,

111
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:03,750
I didn't have to beat you.

112
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,720
Before the Outsider Martial Arts Contest,

113
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:11,510
I saw in the phantasmagoria

114
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:12,870
that the Celestial Taoist was destined to face a trial.

115
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:14,920
But when we got to the mountain,

116
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,120
I realized that trial

117
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:19,240
was meant to befall you.

118
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:22,000
To ensure Zhang Chulan's smooth advancement,

119
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,360
the Chief Celestial Taoist

120
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,800
would surely sabotage you in secret.

121
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,390
You would lose to Zhang Chulan,

122
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,560
but with your intelligence,

123
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,950
you'd certainly catch on.

124
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,190
If word got out,

125
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:35,040
it would ruin the Chief Celestial Taoist's reputation.

126
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:36,310
A kid like you

127
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:37,950
isn't worth involving the Chief Celestial Taoist.

128
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,510
So

129
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,920
I stepped in and dealt with you.

130
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:45,390
Looking back,

131
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,720
the Chief Celestial Taoist escaped the trial,

132
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:49,480
but my actions

133
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,720
have had a negative impact on you.

134
00:05:58,750 --> 00:05:59,720
I'm sorry

135
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:02,120
for altering your fate without your consent.

136
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,750
So that's the story.

137
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,190
My fate has indeed changed.

138
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,390
But

139
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:11,800
whether it's for the better or worse,

140
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,870
it's not up to you to say.

141
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,000
Ouch.

142
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:18,720

145
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:21,630
Hot!

00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:33,600
Not really.

154
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,040

why you called us here?

156
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,600

00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:47,720
now that you're here,

161
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,680
do me a favor

162
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:52,040
and defeat him.

163
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:55,630
Me?

164
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:02,160
I'd really rather not.

165
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:03,630
Wang.

166
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:08,630
Oh, no.

167
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,120
This guy clearly hasn't practiced using qi.

168
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,240
Chief Ma,

169
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,720
what's your game here?

170
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,360
Are you all right, Liu Dang?

171
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,160
I'm fine.

172
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,830
As you can see,

173
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:25,270
Liu Dang is just an ordinary guy,

174
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:27,830
a combat enthusiast

175
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:30,600
who's earned some fame

176
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,630
and respect in his circle.

177
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:34,070
He was about to retire,

178
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,390
but meeting

179
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:37,310
a young boy learning boxing

180
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:38,830
made him rethink everything.

181
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,680
This little boy

182
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,560
seemed to be only about ten.

183
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,680
At first, I didn't take him seriously.

184
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,240
He came straight to me for training.

185
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,040
I was going to go easy on him.

186
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,160
But to my surprise,

187
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,680
during our sparring,

188
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,070
this skinny little kid,

189
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,680
who'd only trained for a few days,

190
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:57,600
actually made me feel some pressure.

191
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:01,430
I even instinctively used

192
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,240
my full strength.

193
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,120
Sorry about that, kiddo.

194
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,270
Are you okay?

195
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,630
I may have hit you harder than I intended.

196
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:17,800
No worries, Dang.

197
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,510
I asked for it.

198
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,000
I should have listened to my master.

199
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,680
I'm just not cut out for this.

200
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:24,720
Master?

201
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,830
The kid didn't want to say anything at first,

202
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,750
but I won him over with my sincerity.

203
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:32,030
He then agreed to take me to meet his master.

204
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:32,840
[Sun's Blacksmith Shop]

205
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,120
It was an old man who forged blades by hand.

206
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,150
Martial arts?

207
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,390
I'm just a blacksmith.

208
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:42,030
I don't have a clue about that.

209
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,630
I didn't believe what the old man said,

210
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:44,870
so

211
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,150
I asked to stay there as an apprentice.

212
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:48,240
Sure,

213
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:49,630
not many youngsters

214
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:51,630
want to learn this craft these days.

215
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:52,910
Let's see what you've got.

216
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:54,910
To my surprise, the old man agreed right away.

217
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,200
So,

218
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:59,960
I stayed with him

219
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,150
to learn blade forging and blacksmithing,

220
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:03,150
but I had to use

221
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:04,840
the breathing technique he taught me

222
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,150
to complete each strike.

223
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:08,030
He said

224
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,910
that was the only way

225
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:11,870
to forge a good blade.

226
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,320
Kid,

227
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,320
if you're set on forging blades here,

228
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:17,720
I won't stop you.

229
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:19,790
But I'd suggest you

230
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:21,910
head back.

231
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,030
You won't find

232
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:25,630
what you're seeking here.

233
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,960
I stayed there for a month.

234
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,600
Aside from forging blades,

235
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,670
I couldn't do anything else.

236
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,910
I couldn't keep wasting my time like that.

237
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:35,960
When I returned to the boxing gym,

238
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,750
I trained even harder.

239
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,360
Normally, I'd feel joy

240
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,870
when I made progress,

241
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:44,150
but it was different this time.

242
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,000
The stronger I became,

243
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,440
the more powerless I felt.

244
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,750
No matter how many victories I achieved,

245
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,270
they couldn't satisfy me.

246
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,480
There was always

247
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,150
this lingering feeling.

248
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,030
I felt like

249
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,080
I was missing something all along.

250
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:14,670
Liu Dang,

251
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:19,240
this is Wang Ye from Wudang,

252
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,150
and this is Qing from the Zhuge family.

253
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,870
After meeting them,

254
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:27,630
can you feel the part

255
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:29,390
you've been missing?

256
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:30,270
I...

257
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,270
Can I really not be like the two of them

258
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:35,480
and have that qi?

259
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:36,790
It's pointless.

260
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:40,120
You don't have the talent.

261
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,550
The breathing technique that the old man taught you

262
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:44,600
is probably his sect's method for controlling the breath,

263
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,150
designed to help one quickly detect

264
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:47,790
the qi within their body.

265
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,030
But you couldn't sense it even after a month.

266
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,870
I started at seven

267
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:53,270
and could sense it within two days.

268
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:55,390
Some people, even without any techniques,

269
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:57,390
can sense the qi within themselves.

270
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,360
If someone can't detect it within two weeks,

271
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:02,480
we consider them to lack the talent.

272
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,080
Qing,

273
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,360
don't make it sound so definite.

274
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:13,000
As Outsiders,

275
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,510
we have potential that ordinary people can't even dream of.

276
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,320
The ability to harness qi

277
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,270
is as natural as breathing for us.

278
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,440
But most people in this world,

279
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:26,360
like Liu Dang,

280
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:28,360
are deprived of this ability

281
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,080
from birth.

282
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:34,790
Our gift

283
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,960
is their flaw.

284
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:39,150
Is that fair?

285
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,750
Flaws have filled this world with misfits,

286
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:51,960
but that's not their true purpose.

287
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:57,550
This world holds countless possibilities,

288
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,440
and everyone deserves

289
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,240
the chance to fix their flaws

290
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,320
and gain the power they long for.

291
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:05,390
Don't you think?

292
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,120
Wang Ye,

293
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:15,750
do you disagree?

294
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,200
I wouldn't say I agree or disagree,

295
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,840
but you

296
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:23,240
have certainly piqued my interest, Chief Ma.

297
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:25,200
Is that so?

298
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:27,750
That's great.

299
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,270
The ability to sense qi is innate,

300
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:33,630
it's part of one's fate.

301
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:34,790
Chief Ma,

302
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,240
what you're saying

303
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,270
doesn't quite make sense.

304
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:39,750
Fate, huh?

305
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:41,910
Qing,

306
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,720
from what I know,

307
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,840
you're not someone who accepts fate, are you?

308
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,440
As an Armorer,

309
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,600
I believe

310
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,080
the greatest Armorer is destiny itself.

311
00:12:56,790 --> 00:13:00,080
Everything in this world is shaped by destiny,

312
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,440
and humans are no exception.

313
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:04,910
They, too, can be forged.

314
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:23,750
At that time, neither Qing nor I

315
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,910
took Ma Xianhong's words too seriously.

316
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:27,840
Out of curiosity,

317
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,750
we accepted his invitation

318
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,030
and went to a distant brick kiln,

319
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,440
which appeared to be nothing special.

320
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,320
Destiny can't be controlled by humans,

321
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,390
so I created a substitute for it.

322
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:04,960
I call it

323
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,080
the Refining Furnace.

324
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:23,780
[The Refining Furnace]

325
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,440
The Refining Furnace?

326
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,870
What exactly is it?

327
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:29,440
I'm no expert

328
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,080
in divine crafts,

329
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:33,320
but that thing

330
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,790
gives off a strange vibe.

331
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:38,320
When I stood before it,

332
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,390
I felt something intense

333
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:42,270
as if

334
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:44,030
it were judging me.

335
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:50,390
Liu Dang,

336
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,670
I've told you everything you need to know.

337
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:55,360
Are you going to wait

338
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,120
or accept?

339
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:05,510
Chief Ma,

340
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,030
I accept.

341
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:09,030
They look pretty serious.

342
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,600
Does it really have such power?

343
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,750
Go.

344
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,080
Chief Ma,

345
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,200
this won't end up ruining him, will it?

346
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:35,750
It's merely a work in progress.

347
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,480
There's still a long way to go before turning it

348
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,600
into the perfect Refining Furnace.

349
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,150
But

350
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:41,440
it's enough for Liu Dang

351
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,960
to get what he wants.

352
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,400
To be honest,

353
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:29,240
although I saw quite a few strange things,

354
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,720
at that time,

355
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,110
I didn't believe a single word

356
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:34,160
of what Ma Xianhong said.

357
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,640
That was until I saw him

358
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:38,550
walk out of the furnace again.

359
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,830
It's completely different from the state he was in

360
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:56,240
when he fought me earlier.

361
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:58,400
Is this the power of the Refining Furnace?

362
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:00,640
I could clearly feel

363
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:03,640
the qi from him.

364
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,000
I never expected the Refining Furnace

365
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:07,590
to turn an ordinary person

366
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:09,000
with no sense of qi

367
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,200
into an Outsider.

368
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,720
Now, I think I understand

369
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,880
why so many ordinary people

370
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,790
in this village

371
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,240
follow Ma Xianhong.

372
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,720
They hope

373
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:24,000
he can use the Refining Furnace

374
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,000
to transform them into Outsiders.

375
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,000
An ordinary person can be granted qi

376
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,440
without any cultivation.

377
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,350
Wouldn't that throw the world into chaos?

378
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,000
Where is this Refining Furnace?

379
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,030
Can you take us there and show it to us?

380
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:44,200
Sadly, I can't.

381
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:45,960
Truth be told,

382
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:47,790
I was looking for that Refining Furnace

383
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,160
when I ran into you guys.

384
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,720
I spent the whole day going up and down the mountain trail,

385
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:55,200
but it was all for nothing.

386
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,830
It was nowhere to be found.

387
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,510
Here we go with those mechanisms again.

388
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,350
If it were just ordinary mechanisms,

389
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,750
that would be easy to handle.

390
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,550
But this technique

391
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,270
is one of the Eight Supremes,

392
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,680
the pinnacle of divine crafts,

393
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,510
the Divine Forge.

394
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:17,440
No need to worry about Liu Dang,

395
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:19,200
I've already sent him back to rest.

396
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,000
Let me raise a glass to you two.

397
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,480
I

398
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:24,920
am not much of a drinker.

399
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,680
No pressure.

400
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:31,830
Since you've entered the village,

401
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,720
I've talked too much about myself.

402
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,480
What I really want

403
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,240
is for you to get to know this village better.

404
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,110
The Refining Furnace you've seen

405
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:40,240
and those puppets Ruhua

406
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,720
are all my inventions.

407
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:43,400
This is the Divine Forge.

408
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:46,750
Of course,

409
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,110
it's nothing particularly remarkable.

410
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:52,550
If you two are willing to stay and help,

411
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:53,830
not only will you be able to use

412
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:55,270
all the inventions here,

413
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,310
but I'll also entrust

414
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:58,830
the Divine Forge to you.

415
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,720
If you want it,

416
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:09,240
that is.

417
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:14,270
Chief Ma,

418
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:16,200
you're way too generous.

419
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,160
This is one of the Eight Supremes,

420
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:20,350
a technique that all Outsiders in the world long to obtain.

421
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:22,590
Yet you'd give it away just like that?

422
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:43,200
Techniques may be fixed,

423
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,640
but people can be flexible.

424
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,480
If I can exchange the Divine Forge

425
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,830
for your help,

426
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,240
I'd be getting quite a bargain.

427
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,200
So why wouldn't I?

428
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,270
How about this?

429
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:06,000
We'll give it some thought

430
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,590
and get back to you tomorrow.

431
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,480
I could tell that Ma Xianhong

432
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:18,440
had really had

433
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,590
an impact on Qing.

434
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,110
So I tried to take Qing away

435
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,000
that very night.

436
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:26,110
Even if we have to leave,

437
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,400
there's no need to do it in secret.

438
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,400
Stop dragging your feet,

439
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,350
move faster.

440
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,000
If these people decide to go to extremes,

441
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,680
they'll dig a hole and bury both of us.

442
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,680
Then no one will ever find us.

443
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,510
Qing,

444
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:43,880
you're acting strange.

445
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,550
I'm thinking

446
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,160
that the fact Chief Ma called us here

447
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,640
shows he probably noticed us

448
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,680
since the Outsider Martial Arts Contest.

449
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,310
That's why I'm worried...

450
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:53,720
What are you worried about?

451
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:54,400
Qing,

452
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,200
Wang.

453
00:21:58,350 --> 00:21:59,030
Where are you going

454
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,310
at such a late hour?

455
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:07,550
So this is what you're worried about.

456
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,720
You noticed them a while ago.

457
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,240
Since he wants our help,

458
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,400
why would he let us leave so easily?

459
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:16,000
Even if you don't plan to stay,

460
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,480
you should have been upfront with me.

461
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,590
Instead, you left without a word.

462
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,720
What do you take me for?

463
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:31,240
Would you really let us go if we were upfront with you?

464
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,400
Whether you leave or not doesn't matter to me,

465
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:36,400
but my friends here

466
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:38,350
think that after your outstanding performance

467
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:40,240
at the Outsider Martial Arts Contest,

468
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,440
it would be a shame not to experience

469
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:43,880
your abilities firsthand

470
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,350
now that you are here.

471
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:54,720
I knew you were up to no good.

472
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:03,030
So fast.

473
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,030
I've defined the Center.

474
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:17,200
You two better watch out.

475
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,310
The blade severed the wind?

476
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:27,070
Get down here!

477
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:28,000
Qing!

478
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:49,350
Darn it.

479
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,200
I wasn't in the correct house.

480
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,440
Forcefully using Boulder Toss at this level...

481
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,550
Qing,

482
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,480
why are you doing this?

483
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:59,310
Don't turn around.

484
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:01,880
Turning around means you're officially declaring war on me.

485
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:03,680
To be honest,

486
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:07,070
I'm more interested

487
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:08,680
in how Wang Ye defeated you

488
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,030
at the Outsider Martial Arts Contest

489
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:12,750
than your Wuhou Qimen.

490
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,000
But I must clarify one thing:

491
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:19,790
I've never lied to you.

492
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:22,830
I really want you to join us

493
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,960
and become part of this village.

494
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:39,240
You'd have access

495
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:41,200
to my Divine Forge

496
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,400
and Wang Ye's Qimen Manipulation.

497
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:43,920
Of course,

498
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:46,030
you can always sit back and watch.

499
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:48,590
Who knows? Maybe Wang Ye

500
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:50,590
will pull off a miracle and defeat us all.

501
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:56,880
Is Qing under duress?

502
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,270
I've restrained five of them already.

503
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,350
I can't afford to drag this out any longer.

504
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:04,440
I'll sort one out first!

505
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:13,920
[Nine Heavens, Nine Earths, Vermilion Bird]

506
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,540

[Qinyin. Heavenly Stems: Xin, Jia, Ding. Earthly Branch: Wu]

508
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:19,100
[Jing, Kai]

509
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:34,790
Remarkable, truly remarkable.

510
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:36,880
You've managed to restrain

511
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,590
six masters on your own.

512
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,400
But it seems like you're already struggling.

513
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,510
Chaos Golden Space Rip!

514
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,270
Qing!

515
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:52,880
Get out of here quickly!

516
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,240
I'm already...

517
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:56,270
You're already at your limit, aren't you?

518
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,680
Wang,

519
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,750
who would have thought this would happen to you?

520
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,000
What are you doing?

521
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:06,240
Hurry up and leave!

522
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:22,510
Protection?

523
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,750
What is it?

524
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,350
Did you think for a moment

525
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:33,270
that I was going to attack you?

526
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:37,110
Wang,

527
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,440
whether you find someone to save me

528
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,480
or avenge me,

529
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,350
that's all for after you escape.

530
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:48,920
You don't have to feel indebted to me.

531
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,790
I quite like you, actually.

532
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:55,960
Because you and I

533
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,960
are completely different kinds of people.

534
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,880
You always think of others first

535
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:03,680
when you act.

536
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,030
Xun aligns perfectly with me,

537
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,030
and I don't even need to stand in the right house to unleash my full power.

538
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:10,480
Don't!

Crimson Serpent!

543
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,680
Wang,

544
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:52,160
I

545
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,920
always put myself first

546
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,400
in everything I do

547
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:01,550
and every decision I make.

548
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,680
Sorry, Qing.

549
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:11,440
I guess I have to disappoint you.

550
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:19,110
If things really get desperate,

551
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,400
I could leave you behind and run,

552
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,880
but it's not that bad yet.

553
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,680
Ma Xianhong,

554
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:26,920
you've won.

555
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:28,350
Let Qing leave,

556
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,480
and I'll stay.

557
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:32,200
I'll give you what you want.

558
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:34,270
Don't worry, it's all legit.

559
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,640
I'll teach you everything.

You did.

564
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:45,590
Wang, you've gained

565
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:47,590
a loyal friend.

566
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,110

567
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,310
you've earned the respect of everyone in Biyou Village.

When I first called,

569
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,920
I told you

570
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,790
that your Qimen Manipulation is the true legacy,

571
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:02,680
which is why I consider you one of my own.

572
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:03,680
I won!

573
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:05,160
Those who lost

574
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,400
will foot the bill later.

575
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,160
No way.

576
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,350
This guy clearly has the face of a villain.

577
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,880
I ended up losing money because of you.

578
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:22,960
Ma Xianhong,

579
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:25,350
what exactly is your intention?

580
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:28,160
It's only when facing a crucial decision

581
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,790
that one's true nature shows.

582
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:31,680
I need both of your help,

583
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:34,350
and I want to see your true character for myself.

584
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:37,200
Especially you, Qing.

585
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:39,510
You've really touched my heart.

586
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,030
I still want you both to stay,

587
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:44,830
but it seems like

588
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:46,310
you've never really liked me.

589
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:48,000
That's fine though.

590
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:50,350
I'd never force anyone.

591
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:52,310
Feel free to leave

592
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,640
if you want to.

593
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,880
Just remember

594
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:04,920
that Biyou Village will always have a place for you.

595
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,480
Forget it.

596
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:12,920
Let's go, Qing.

597
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:16,350
Qing?

598
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,030
I'm exhausted.

599
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:22,750
Wang,

600
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,200
I might rest here for a few more days.

601
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,270
Qing,

602
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:33,350
you should be able to tell, right?

603
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:35,750
Regardless of whether Ma Xianhong is good or evil,

604
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,590
this is a place of trouble.

605
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:37,920
He is...

606
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:38,920
What he's like

607
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:40,680
and what he wants to do

608
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,960
doesn't concern me.

609
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
As I've told you,

610
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:47,240
everything I do

611
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,350
and every decision I make

612
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,270
is based on my own interests.

613
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:16,270
You know how stubborn Qing is.

614
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:17,680
Once he decides on something,

615
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,590
nothing can change his mind.

616
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:22,550
I was quite wary of that Chief Ma,

617
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:24,160
so I entered the phantasmagoria right away

618
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:26,480
to get a clearer picture.

619
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,510
How could this be?

620
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,480
It's just like the time

621
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,000
when I asked Zhang Chulan at Wudang.

622
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,640
But Ma Xianhong's situation

623
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:05,880
shouldn't be so serious.

624
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,400
It just shouldn't.

625
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,070
Chief Ma,

626
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:19,510
whatever you're trying to do,

627
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:20,960
stop now.

628
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,310
You guys can go back first.

629
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,000
I'll talk to Wang Ye for a bit.

630
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,030
Wang Ye,

631
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,830
what are you trying to say?

632
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:33,830
You're too arrogant and stubborn.

633
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:35,440
Your goals are too ambitious,

634
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,790
and it will bring disaster to the Outsiders' world.

635
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:39,960
You won't succeed.

636
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:42,310
Those with determination

637
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,030
will eventually succeed.

638
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,240
I'm not mocking you.

639
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,400
If an arrogant person learns to see things clearly and accept their fate,

640
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,070
they may yet find happiness.

641
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,310
I don't believe in fate.

642
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,920
So it doesn't matter

643
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:58,550
even if it harms those around you?

644
00:32:58,550 --> 00:32:59,720
Of course, it matters.

645
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,270
That's why in Biyou Village, people come and go freely.

646
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,480
But even if I'm the only one left,

647
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:07,480
I'll keep going.

648
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,110
You're much like another person I've met.

649
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:12,680
You are both caught in the eye of a massive storm.

650
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,160
But you're also different.

651
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:18,000
What you're after affects too many

652
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,070
and poses too great a danger.

653
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:20,960
As for the other person,

654
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,440
future is still unclear to me.

655
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,680
If you don't stop,

656
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:28,440
I'll end you

657
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:29,920
here today.

658
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:32,960
Wang,

659
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:34,590
that's enough.

660
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,000
Stop trying to change other people's fate.

661
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,240
You don't have the right.

662
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,000
You're always welcome to come back.

663
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:03,510
That's what happened.

664
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,200
I didn't expect to see

665
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,960
this kind of change

666
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:08,190
in anyone

667
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:09,800
other than you,

668
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,070
but he's not you.

669
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:13,840
Ma Xianhong

670
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,630
will either destroy himself

671
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:16,960
or

672
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,760
the world.

673
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:20,670
His misguided sense of right and wrong

674
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:22,360
will only bring greater harm.

675
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:23,590
He must be stopped,

676
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,280
which is why I focused my investigation

677
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,480
on the Refining Furnace.

678
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,510
Judging by how much importance Ma Xianhong places on it,

679
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:30,670
that thing

680
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:31,960
is probably

681
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,630
the key to uncovering his secrets.

682
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:35,590
Any results?

683
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:37,960
Nope.

684
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:40,000
I'll be honest.

685
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,030
I've been trying to find that thing.

686
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,280
But this village is so strange

687
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:47,590
that I haven't found a single lead.

688
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,320
Anyway,

689
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:56,190
I've said enough.

690
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,480
I'm heading back now.

691
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,710
But Lian,

692
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:01,960
are you here

693
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,840
to take down Biyou Village?

694
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:14,880
If that's the case,

695
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:20,320
count me in.

696
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:37,840
Go back!

697
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,400
You shouldn't be here.

698
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:43,550
I just want to have a chat with Chen Duo.

699
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,360
I told you to go back.

700
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:47,360
Chen Junyan, bite him.

701
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,670
So you are called Chen Junyan?

702
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:02,760
That's a nice name.

703
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,360
Thank you.

704
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:06,480
Was it you

705
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,710
who broke my protection on the bridge

706
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:08,590
a few days ago?

707
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:11,960
How could it be me?

708
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,150
It really wasn't.

709
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:14,510
You think I'll believe you just because you say so?

710
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:15,670
Qiu,

711
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:17,230
didn't Chief Wang say not to provoke them?

712
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,440
Sirs,

713
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:21,590
I really just want to talk to Chen Duo.

714
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:24,000
Sir, you look quite capable,

715
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:25,110
there's no way

716
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:26,800
I can break your protection.

717
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:29,320
Please rest assured.

718
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,550
I won't cause any trouble.

719
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,440
Let him in.

720
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:38,630
Go ahead.

721
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:44,400
I know

722
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,190
you're all sent by the company to deal with Chen Duo.

723
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:47,630
But even you are here as well.

724
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:50,630
Are you out of your mind?

725
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:55,840
I know I'm weak.

726
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:57,400
Don't worry.

727
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,150
I won't start any trouble.

728
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,000
I didn't expect

729
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:03,510
even a Beast Tamer like him

730
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:05,590
to also get involved in this mess.

731
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,760
A Beast Tamer?

732
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,440
Sounds like someone who can control animals.

733
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,670
That's right.

734
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,710
They use their qi to communicate with

735
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:13,800
and control animals.

736
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,760
Since not many

737
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,280
are willing to train so hard

738
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,000
just to communicate with animals,

739
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,960
people in this profession

740
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,110
are quite rare.

741
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,670
Could this just be one of his tricks

742
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:25,590
instead of his true ability?

743
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,030
I doubt it.

744
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:28,920
While those in this profession may seem pretty useless,

745
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:30,480
it's actually quite hard to train for.

746
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:32,070
The fact that he has reached such a level,

747
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,280
you could say it's pretty impressive.

748
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:36,550
Impressive loser!

749
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,230
What are you doing here?

750
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:09,840
I'm really sorry.

751
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:13,360
Ever since I brought you out of the Medicine Immortal Association,

752
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:15,150
I've been so busy.

753
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:19,230
So, I've had to inquire

754
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,230
about your situation through Liao.

755
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,000
Could you tell me

756
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,710
what actually happened?

757
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:42,840
How

758
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:44,400
did Liao die?

759
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Sis,

760
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,510
I've brought back

761
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:22,000
the person you wanted.

762
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,480
You did a great job.

763
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:39,230
Are the people from the company already here?

764
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,190
They're here to find someone,

765
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,280
a girl named Chen Duo.

766
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:47,110
But don't worry, sis.

767
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,230
They won't be a threat in the village.

768
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:52,360
Look, sis.

769
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,280
What we've always wanted

770
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,150
is finally about to happen.

771
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:15,280
I didn't sleep a wink last night.

772
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:16,670
Guan,

773
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:17,760
what were you pondering

774
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,440
while staying up all night?

775
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,280
I've finally figured

776
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,480
something out.

777
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:23,590
Compared to Chen Duo,

778
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:26,000
what the headquarters dreads the most

779
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:27,630
is the current situation,

780
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:29,070
the population cap.

781
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,280
The population cap?

782
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:32,760
Do you know

783
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,280
how many people there are in the world?

784
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,510
Probably around eight billion.

785
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:38,070
What about the Outsiders?

786
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,070
I'm not sure.

787
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:41,440
Currently, the registered number

788
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,670
doesn't exceed eighty thousand.

789
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:44,280
The unregistered ones

790
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,550
are a small minority.

791
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:46,840
So, if we do the math,

792
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,670
the ratio of Outsiders to ordinary people

793
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:51,480
is somewhere between one in ninety thousand and one in a hundred thousand.

794
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:52,920
It sounds pretty balanced,

795
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:54,960
but what's the upper limit

796
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:56,960
for the ratio

797
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,190
of Outsiders to ordinary people?

798
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,670
One in fifty thousand.

799
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:04,960
That's the population ratio

800
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:07,360
widely accepted around the world after research.

801
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,280
In other words,

802
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:10,230
that's the population cap.

803
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:11,670
What happens

804
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:12,840
if the population cap

805
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:13,760
is exceeded?

806
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:14,960
The Outsiders are powerful individuals,

807
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,070
but few in number.

808
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:17,510
Once their numbers

809
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:19,400
surpass the population cap,

810
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,880
a crisis will occur.

811
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:22,150
The chances

812
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:23,280
of ordinary people

813
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,760
encountering them will rise,

814
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:27,360
and chaos will follow.

815
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:29,710
It seems that what Ma Xianhong intends to do

816
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,710
may very well push the population cap over the limit.

817
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:32,880
This Biyou Village

818
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,920
has taken in a large number of evil Outsiders,

819
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:36,920
and Ma Xianhong has even used the Refining Furnace

820
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,710
to turn ordinary people into Outsiders.

821
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:40,440
These illegal methods

822
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,710
disrupt the ecological balance of the Outsiders' world

823
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:45,510
and will lead to irreversible disasters.

824
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,760
Looks like Wang was right last night.

825
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,110
Ma Xianhong

826
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:51,800
is arrogant and stubborn.

827
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,670
He has clearly gone down the path of evil.

828
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,230
We must report to the headquarters soon.

829
00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:57,360
Sis,

830
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,230
only we

831
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:00,440
can truly treat everyone equally,

832
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,880
give everyone superpowers,

833
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,710
break the so-called balance NDT Express upholds,

834
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:07,320
and free everyone from control.

835
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:09,000
A world of unity will be achieved

836
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:11,000
and everything will be perfect.
