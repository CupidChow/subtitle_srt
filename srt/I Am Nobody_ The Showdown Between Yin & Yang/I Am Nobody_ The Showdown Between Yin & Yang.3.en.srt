Hey, you,

386
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,030
come here.

387
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:31,200
Fu Rong,

388
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,880
find a place for them to stay.

389
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,550
Chief Ma, rest assured.

390
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,270
We'll pay for all our living expenses

391
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:38,030
during our stay here.

392
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,960
You've come at just the right time.

393
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,960
There's a village banquet this afternoon.

394
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:45,550
You're welcome to join if you're interested.

395
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:48,000
A village banquet?

396
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:49,440
We'll think about it.

397
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,440
We'll head off now.

398
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:02,110
Don't mention these people

399
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:04,240
to anyone else in the village.

400
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:07,680
Just keep an eye on them for me,

401
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,960
but don't cause any trouble.

402
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,440
Their target is Chen Duo,

403
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:15,070
so as long as they don't make a move on her,

404
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:16,790
leave them alone.

405
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,720
There are two updates.

406
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,750
The good news is that Ma Xianhong has admitted

407
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,240
that Chen Duo is in the village.

408
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:24,440
The bad news is

409
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,830
that he'll never hand her over.

410
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,400
If we take action,

411
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:28,510
both he and the entire Biyou Village

412
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:30,310
will become our enemies.

413
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:31,440
Their power

414
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,440
has far exceeded our expectations,

415
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,440
especially since Ma Xianhong

416
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,160
is the successor of Divine Forge.

417
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,400
No wonder the Outsiders we've been fighting

418
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,070
have so many powerful magic weapons.

419
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,440
It turns out this village is home

420
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:45,440
to the heir of the Eight Supremes.

421
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,550
This trip has been worth it.

422
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,110
I've always wanted to see

423
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:52,030
the Eight Supremes which caused the Jiashen Calamity.

424
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:54,200
Once we're done with Chen Duo,

425
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,830
I'll pay Chief Ma a proper visit.

426
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,480
Are the Eight Supremes

427
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:02,200
truly as formidable as the rumors suggest?

428
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:05,070
Aren't you also an heir of the Eight Supremes?

429
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,640
He is the real deal.

430
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,350
The legend of the Eight Supremes

431
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,160
must have been exaggerated.

432
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,030
Still, we shouldn't take it lightly.

433
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,440
Here's the thing.

434
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:34,920
The Eight Supremes aren't as formidable as they're made out to be,

435
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,880
and the situation isn't as bad as it looks.

436
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,790
As long as we don't harm Chen Duo,

437
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:40,640
we can stay in the village.

438
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:41,270
Here's the plan.

439
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:42,510
I'll handle the village banquet

440
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:44,310
and keep a close eye on Ma Xianhong.

441
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:45,440
As for the rest of you,

442
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:47,440
feel free to roam around the village

443
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,480
and gather as much information as you can.

444
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,440
Here I come!

445
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:10,110
What

446
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:10,920
are these pigs doing?

447
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,160
Why are they acting so crazy?

448
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,920
You guys don't castrate pigs here?

449
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,240
If they're not castrated,

450
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,310
they won't fatten up

451
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,640
when they're in heat.

452
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,110
I see what you mean,

453
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,680
but we don't have the expertise.

454
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,790
Yeah.

455
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,000
Cut!

456
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:40,030
This pig's language

457
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,070
is so filthy.

458
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:43,030
What's it saying?

459
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,030
It's saying it hurts.

460
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:44,920
Cut!

461
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:45,750
Young lady,

462
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:47,240
did you also come to this village

463
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,830
to seek the village chief's assistance

464
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:49,920
in gaining stronger abilities?

465
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,510
No,

466
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:51,790
I'm already quite strong.

467
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:54,590
So, you're a master, too?

468
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:56,160
Do you possess any extraordinary powers or abilities?

469
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:57,110
I...

470
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,000
can eat more,

471
00:23:59,160 --> 00:23:59,790
sleep more,

472
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:00,510
and live longer than you all.

473
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:25,160
Hello,

474
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,240
do you know this person?

475
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:27,350
No, I don't.

476
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,000
Have you ever seen this person?

477
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:29,640
I haven't.

478
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,790
Why is the sun not moving at all?

479
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:56,420
[Biyou Village]

480
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:16,510
Good day, Chief.

481
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,160
Good day, Chief.

482
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:21,680
Good day, Chief.

483
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:23,200
[Welcome to Biyou Village]

484
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,030
Good day, Chief.

485
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,350
- Good day, Chief. - Good day, Chief.

486
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:27,070
- Good day, Chief. - Good day, Chief.

487
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,550
- Good day, Chief. - Good day, Chief.

488
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:29,350
Come on, everyone,

489
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,240
let's go to the village banquet with Chief Ma.

490
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:56,240
Chief Ma, we want to raise a glass to you.

491
00:25:58,310 --> 00:25:59,200
Chief Ma,

492
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,680
thank you for taking care of us.

493
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,510
Every person here exudes a strong aura of qi.

494
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,440
In this small Biyou Village,

495
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:27,160
there are actually so many exceptional Outsiders.

496
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:30,310
And it's never been recorded in the NDT Express system.

497
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,830
How many other secrets

498
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:33,510
does this village hold?

499
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,440
Chief Ma,

500
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,680
could you explain to us

501
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:37,790
what the pursuit of formlessness is?

502
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,070
Chief Ma,

503
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:40,590
go ahead and tell us about it.

504
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:41,920
Yes, please explain it to us.

505
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,200
Come on, have a seat.

506
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,400
Do you remember the tale from ancient times

507
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,750
when the Outsiders defeated opposing generals and rose to power?

508
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,000
I've heard it before.

509
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:53,350
On the surface, the battle

510
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:55,720
seemed like a struggle for world supremacy,

511
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:57,790
but what were these Outsiders

512
00:26:57,790 --> 00:26:59,240
truly fighting for?

513
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,200
It all stemmed from two sects of Outsiders

514
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,920
with differing views

515
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,920
on how their superpower should be passed down.

516
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:08,030
The Outsiders of the Chan Sect believe

517
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:09,550
in following the will of heaven

518
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:11,200
and explaining the law of nature.

519
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:14,070
They categorize all things into different ranks,

520
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:16,880
emphasizing the importance of teaching according to one's talents.

521
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:18,640
Those of the Jie Sect, however,

522
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,720
advocate the concept of fifty paths to Tao,

523
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,310
and that fate can only be predicted in forty-nine of them.

524
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,750
They believe that all beings have an unpredictable chance at life

525
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,480
and promote equality for all.

526
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,640
They seek the way of formlessness.

527
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,790
Their disciples are often beasts, birds, and other extraordinary creatures.

528
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,000
Compared to the Chan Sect's self-proclaimed orthodoxy,

529
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,240
where teachings are only passed on to the greatest,

530
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,640
I align more

531
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:41,160
with the Jie Sect's pursuit of formlessness.

532
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,550
Look.

533
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:14,310
Our lives

534
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:16,110
are like those puppets on the stage,

535
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,920
lost in illusions.

536
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:21,750
Others,

537
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:24,310
ourselves,

538
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,680
desires,

539
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,480
life, and death

540
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,920
are all constantly pulling

541
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:31,510
and manipulating us.

542
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:33,750
Gradually,

543
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,920
we grow weaker

544
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:37,680
and numb,

545
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:40,720
silently enduring

546
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,640
the manipulation of fate.

547
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,110
We lose ourselves

548
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,070
and our control over our own destiny.

549
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:53,310
Aren't you here

550
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:55,720
to break free from all of this?

551
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,200
Here in Biyou Village,

552
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,510
I hope everyone gets the chance

553
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:23,270
to realize their vision.

554
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,680
I will help you,

555
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:27,880
and all the suffering

556
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:31,480
will cease to exist.

557
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:46,030
This is all too bizarre.

558
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:51,750
Ma Xianhong,

559
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,270
who exactly are you?

560
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,070

00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,230
I don't.

746
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:27,760
Zhang,

747
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,550
can you tell me

748
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:31,070
your first impression on this person?

749
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:37,230
He looks righteous,

750
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,150
quite serious,

751
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,840
and even a bit rigid.

752
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,320
How about now?

753
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:53,280
Can you still see righteousness in his eyes?

754
00:37:57,590 --> 00:37:58,630
Sometimes,

755
00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:00,590
people can be judged by their appearance.

756
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:02,510
A person's true nature is hidden

757
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:03,800
in the subtleties of their facial expressions,

758
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,670
which need to be broken down and carefully analyzed.

759
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,800
Take Heiguan, for instance.

760
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:11,150
At first glance, he appears

761
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:14,030
to be just a rugged middle-aged man,

762
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,280
with clear signs of age

763
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,480
marked on his face.

764
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,670
His habit of raising his eyebrows

765
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:19,510
creates wrinkles,

766
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:21,760
and the long-term marks of his constant vigilance

767
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:24,110
suggest that he's more meticulous than he appears.

768
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,840
His reluctance to show his teeth

769
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,150
shows

770
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:29,440
that he's tight-lipped

771
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,230
and prefers to conceal his thoughts.

772
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:34,400
His strong and jutting chin

773
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,550
is a symbol of toughness and aggression,

774
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,280
but the relaxed facial muscles suggest

775
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,630
that he's not prone to extremes.

776
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:42,400
So,

777
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,000
Heiguan is someone

778
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:46,070
who won't put too much pressure on himself

779
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,710
even when faced with a challenging task.

780
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:54,320
Zhang,

781
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,400
based on what I've just explained,

782
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:57,960
take another look at this face

783
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,190
and tell me how you feel now.

784
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,320
He seems sullen

785
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:09,510
and indifferent.

786
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,920
Now, focus on the corners of his mouth.

787
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:18,920
I can't pinpoint it,

788
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,880
but something feels strange.

789
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:22,760
He's ruthless

790
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,670
and brutal.

791
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,630
I don't usually care about such features in ordinary people,

792
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:34,070
but these details

793
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,710
shouldn't appear on the face

794
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:38,400
of someone who collects herbs to cure others.

795
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:40,590
Guys,

796
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,440
as you all know,

797
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,150
I'm a patient,

798
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:46,230
and I'm especially sensitive

799
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:47,760
to the presence of fellow patients.

800
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:49,880
And Zhao Guizhen here

801
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,550
likely shares

802
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,400
the same condition as mine.

803
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:58,280
Fellow patients, huh?

804
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,440
Exactly,

805
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,440
he's a fellow patient.

806
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,000
What kind of condition is it?

807
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:09,960
Should we give them a beating?

808
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:11,710
I've never been scared

809
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,320
of a fight.

810
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:16,150
Bao,

811
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,000
enough with the beating and fighting.

812
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:20,480
We're here for Chen Duo this time.

813
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,280
Right,

814
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:26,150
we've got all the info on the village,

815
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:29,110
but how are we supposed to find Chen Duo?

816
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:32,150
That's easy.

817
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,150
Bao,

818
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:34,230
tell them

819
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:35,880
what to do when problems arise.

820
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:38,110
If there's a problem,

821
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:39,360
talk to Si.

822
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,480
That's the way to do it!

823
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,590
We must respect our leaders.

824
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:45,110
As those working under them,

825
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:46,920
we must constantly seek their advice.

826
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,960
Our leaders are always wise

827
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,880
and visionary.

828
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:54,440
For minor issues,

829
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,920
we must avoid bothering them.

830
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,760
We must always ease their burdens.

831
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:58,320
For larger issues,

832
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,070
we must follow their guidance.

833
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,480
Only under their leadership

834
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:02,800
can we overcome

835
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,400
our confusion.

836
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:06,550
Only under Xu Si's leadership can the Lubei Region

837
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:08,800
enter a new phase.

838
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,920
Cut it out, Zhang Chulan.

839
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:16,480
Your leader Xu Si isn't here,

840
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,630
so stop buttering him up.

841
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:19,280
Besides,

842
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,920
the headquarters

843
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:22,480
is the one in charge now.

844
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:25,110
I know that.

845
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,920
We're just used to

846
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:28,710
rehearsing

847
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:29,840
for the year-end party.

848
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:33,920
Bao!

849
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:09,920
Why is it still running without a head?

850
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:10,400
I saw it.

851
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:11,280
Its head fell off.

852
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,000
I saw it already.

853
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:13,920
This thing has quite some skill.

854
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,670
Everyone, use your abilities to capture it.

855
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:17,800
Got it.

856
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,510
Boulder Toss.

857
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:36,400
Boulder Toss?

858
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:37,320
Wang Ye?

859
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:51,630
Chaos Golden Space Rip!

860
00:43:07,230 --> 00:43:08,360
Good evening, Wang Ye.

861
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:10,630
Good evening.

862
00:43:13,710 --> 00:43:14,320
Break.

863
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:17,630
Wang Ye?

864
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:19,030
Why are you also here?

865
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:20,030
Lian,

866
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:21,820
how come you're always around?

867
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:25,420
[Wang Ye, Gate of Gale]

868
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,000
Is that your friend?

869
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:28,400
It's complicated.

870
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:29,440
I'll explain it to you later.

871
00:43:29,590 --> 00:43:30,590
Come with me.

872
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,320
Mr. Ye.

873
00:43:35,510 --> 00:43:36,320
Wait for me!

874
00:43:53,150 --> 00:43:54,110
What's the situation?

875
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:00,840
Watch out.

876
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,800
That person is hiding in there.

877
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,150
A person?

878
00:44:04,590 --> 00:44:05,510
Where's the person?

879
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:06,150
Wait.

880
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:06,920
The person...

881
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:08,000
Where is the person

882
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:09,440
you were talking about?

883
00:44:12,510 --> 00:44:13,510
Are you sure that's a person?

884
00:44:13,510 --> 00:44:14,280
Where is it?

885
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,230
It seems like NDT Express

886
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:18,710
doesn't know everything.

887
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:20,960
At least you know nothing

888
00:44:21,110 --> 00:44:22,400
about Biyou Village.

889
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:27,440
Bao,

890
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:28,110
where are you going?

891
00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:29,150
Come back.

892
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,280
This puppet appears to be moving.

893
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,710
The puppet didn't move.

894
00:44:32,710 --> 00:44:34,400
Come back and join the team. It's time to wrap things up.

895
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:36,920
You must have been mistaken.

896
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:38,710
We can call it a day now.

897
00:45:02,110 --> 00:45:02,510
Well.

898
00:45:02,510 --> 00:45:03,360
Why are you scared?

899
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:04,800
I'm not scared.

900
00:45:07,190 --> 00:45:08,230
What could possibly scare me?

901
00:45:34,590 --> 00:45:35,440
Let go of me.

902
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:37,280
Come on.

903
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:38,630
What's there to be scared of?

904
00:45:38,630 --> 00:45:39,920
I'm not scared.

905
00:45:48,110 --> 00:45:49,550
Did you really not move?

906
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:53,480
Caught you.

907
00:45:58,030 --> 00:45:59,190
These guys

908
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:00,760
ruined my Ruhua!

909
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:08,710
Zhang Chulan.

910
00:46:15,670 --> 00:46:17,510
Is this thing alive?

911
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:19,030
Alive?

912
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,280
You could say it's alive,

913
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:22,710
or you could say it's not.

914
00:46:23,230 --> 00:46:24,280
These are all magic weapons

915
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:25,590
empowered with the ability to use qi.

916
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:27,320
Wang,

917
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:29,880
have you also crossed paths with Ma Xianhong before?

918
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:32,710
Not only have we crossed paths,

919
00:46:33,150 --> 00:46:34,880
but he also invited me here.

920
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,230
No wonder it can't be killed.

921
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,590
For someone to make a puppet this strong,

922
00:46:47,150 --> 00:46:48,760
this person's skills

923
00:46:49,030 --> 00:46:50,880
are certainly praiseworthy.

924
00:46:51,590 --> 00:46:52,880
It looks quite real.

925
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:09,360
They actually moved.

926
00:47:12,110 --> 00:47:13,400
Who moved?

927
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,230
Behind you.

928
00:47:51,070 --> 00:47:52,190
What's going on?

929
00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:02,840
I was just getting to the most crucial part

930
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:04,230
when you interrupted me.

931
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:06,590
Qing?

932
00:48:07,630 --> 00:48:08,480
Zhang Chulan?

933
00:48:10,110 --> 00:48:11,110
What brings you guys here?

934
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:11,670
Qing,

935
00:48:11,670 --> 00:48:12,760
we tried calling and messaging you,

936
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:14,150
but you didn't answer.

937
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:17,630
This is just too crude.

938
00:48:19,150 --> 00:48:20,510
Your friend here seems to know

939
00:48:20,710 --> 00:48:22,550
a lot about these things.

940
00:48:32,510 --> 00:48:33,710
They're not just things.

941
00:48:34,150 --> 00:48:35,360
They have names.

942
00:48:35,630 --> 00:48:36,550
They're called Ruhua.

943
00:48:39,710 --> 00:48:41,230
Don't wander around the village.

944
00:48:41,510 --> 00:48:43,230
This isn't a place for people like you.

945
00:48:59,550 --> 00:49:00,880
That's strange.

946
00:49:01,110 --> 00:49:03,320
This Zhuge Qing seems different

947
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:04,710
from the one I knew before.

948
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,360
He managed to control Ruhua in just a few days.

949
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:12,280
What are he and Ma Xianhong plotting?
