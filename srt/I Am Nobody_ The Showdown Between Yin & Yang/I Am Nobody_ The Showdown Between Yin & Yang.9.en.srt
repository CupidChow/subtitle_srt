Sir,

66
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:41,080
this wasn't stealing.

67
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,080
I've had my eye on this stuff for a long time.

68
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,400

you should understand reasoning.

If I planned to return it,

82
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,190
why would I take it in the first place?

83
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,800

86
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:24,830
What do you mean by that?

87
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,630
Exactly what it sounds like.

88
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,000
Can't you just not go?

89
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,870
How could I not go?

90
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,800
They're targeting the village.

91
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:33,920
So what?

92
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,870
Is this village really that important to you?

93
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:36,680
Besides,

94
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,950
those going into the village aren't easy to deal with.

95
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,480
Zhuge Qing,

96
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,190
I really misjudged you.

97
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,510
I never thought you'd be this kind of person.

98
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,360
What kind of person am I?

99
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:46,240
Heartless and unkind.

100
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:47,630
Who said I'm heartless?

101
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:48,510
I just don't extend kindness

102
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:49,750
to everyone, that's all.

103
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:50,720
Except for you,

104
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,750
I have no connections

105
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,800
to anyone else in this village.

106
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,800
Also,

107
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,240
you still haven't told me

108
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,630
why you came to this village.

109
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:58,800
Alright,

110
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,240
I won't press you.

111
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:01,510
But I hope you think carefully.

112
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:03,360
Something truly worthwhile

113
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,750
is worth sacrificing your life for.

114
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,310
But in this village,

115
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:08,270
is there anything worth it?

116
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:15,800
You're right.

117
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,830
I shouldn't force you.

118
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,240
Who said you're forcing me?

119
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,830
Not at all.

120
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:24,950
Let's go.

121
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,000
I'll go with you.

122
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:30,120
Didn't you say you wouldn't go?

123
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,270
Well,

124
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:33,070
I was just worried you might not think it through.

125
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:34,190
Since you believe it's worth it,

126
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,040
then go ahead.

127
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,120
As for me,

128
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:37,390
I may have no ties

129
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:38,240
to the other villagers,

130
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,070
but I do have a connection with you.

131
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:49,000
The people outside

132
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,950
have already started fighting

133
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:50,600
with the villagers.

134
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,310
We need to hurry.

135
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,360
Then let's move.

136
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,870
Are you on their side too?

137
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:07,750
No,

138
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:08,600
don't fight me, please.

139
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:10,040
Zhuge Qing,

140
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,560
I finally found you.

141
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,480
Fu Rong,

142
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,240
it's great

143
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,680
that you're with Zhuge Qing.

144
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,430
You two are different from the others.

145
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,160
There are some things

146
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,920
that need to be explained to you directly.

147
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,190
Our target is the entire village,

148
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:23,480
especially Ma Xianhong.

149
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,560
As long as the two of you

150
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,510
don't get involved with him,

151
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,510
that's all that matters.

152
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,040
Soon,

153
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,750
we'll start a fire in the village

154
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:30,560
to draw the attention

155
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,870
of the ordinary villagers,

156
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:33,510
so the innocent ones

157
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:35,430
can escape quickly.

158
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:37,310
We don't want to cause more harm.

159
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:38,430
Fu Rong,

160
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:40,430
we're not here to hurt you.

161
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,800
Since I came to this village,

162
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,270
I've never seen Chief Ma

163
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,680
do anything evil.

164
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,390
On the contrary,

165
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,800
he's always been helping

166
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,870
those in need.

167
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,680
You're going to destroy

168
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,190
a village

169
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:52,430
that he painstakingly built,

170
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:52,950
and you still claim

171
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:53,950
you don't want to cause harm.

172
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:55,680
Whether Ma Xianhong is good or bad,

173
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,000
let's set that aside.

174
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,720
His problem is

175
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,240
he's too arrogant,

176
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,510
too self-centered.

177
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:01,720
That's why he failed to notice

178
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,480
and ended up sheltering

179
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,430
someone like Zhao Guizhen, a complete scoundrel!

180
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:06,190
We've looked into it.

181
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:08,360
You two are different from them.

182
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,750
Ma Xianhong's subordinates came here

183
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:10,830
with hidden motives.

184
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,310
But you don't have any, Fu Rong.

185
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:13,390
Who says I don't?

186
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,480
I came here

187
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,270
seeking peace of mind.

188
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,430
This village

189
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,190
took me in

190
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:20,240
when I was desperate.

191
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,800
It's my duty

192
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,310
to protect it in its time of need.

193
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,240
Fu Rong,

194
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,870
I don't want to fight you.

195
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:29,040
I also don't want

196
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,560
to take things too far.

197
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,120
Don't push me, please.

198
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,720
Cut the nonsense!

199
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,510
Look at this!

200
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,800
Fu Rong, what's that?

201
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,560
Stay back!

202
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:01,160
Don't come near me!

203
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:03,360
What's wrong?

204
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:04,950
You all...

205
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:06,920
You all...

206
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:07,750
Fu Rong,

207
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,070
if we want to,

208
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,920
there's nothing we can't uncover.

209
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,480
Zhuge Qing,

210
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,870
I know you've been

211
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,600
spending a lot of time with Fu Rong lately.

212
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,000
I don't know how she appears

213
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,310
in front of you,

214
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:21,680
but on these papers

215
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,360
is another side of her,

216
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,800
a side

217
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,240
she hasn't shown you.

218
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:28,870
Fu Rong, stop being so stubborn.

219
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:30,120
Accept the company's investigation.

220
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,160
With your background,

221
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,600
the company won't make things difficult for you.

222
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:33,790
Shut up.

223
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,080
Just shut up!

224
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:38,240
Owing Lubei Bank 150,000.

225
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,270
Owing Lunan Bank 100,000.

226
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,750
Owing Luzhong Bank 200,000.

227
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:41,960
Owing Spend Like Crazy 30,000.

228
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,790
Owing Shop Till Drop 40,000.

229
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:44,670
Owing Big Spender 10,000.

230
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:45,670
Owing Go All Out 20,000.

231
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:46,550
Owing Fortune Coming 2,000.

232
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:47,360
Owing Lucky Treasure 700.

233
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,080
Owing Swipe My Card 5,000.

234
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,200
Owing Super Convenient 6,000.

235
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,480
I even have a few overdue payment reminders of yours here.

236
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,720
Dear Ms. Fu Rong,

237
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,960
regarding your overdue loan with our bank,

238
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,870
despite multiple reminders,

239
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:56,720
you have refused to repay.

240
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,480
- We also found - Stop reading!

241
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,440
[Overdue reminders]
many of your spending records.

242
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,390
But what's odd is,

243
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:01,790
while your personal expenses

244
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:03,240
could be considered lavish,

245
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,960
they're not entirely excessive.

246
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,720
Among the debts,

247
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,870
a significant portion

248
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:09,200
was used to buy men's luxury goods.

249
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:11,390
Following this lead,

250
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:13,000
we roughly uncovered the truth.

251
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,960
Stop talking!

252
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,480
Fu Rong,

253
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:19,720
I have to comment

254
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,960
on your taste in men...

255
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,510
Take that playboy for example.

256
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,550
He played games all day in the cybercafe,

257
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:40,750
never working.

258
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:43,320
You recharged his account every day

259
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,600
until he found someone new,

260
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,600
his in-game partner.

261
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,080
But before he cheated, he really loved me!

262
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,030
We were so happy together...

263
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:52,360
But all the gear you bought for him

264
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,200
ended up with his in-game partner!

265
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,440
Then there's that unemployed guy

266
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,390
who living off stocks and futures.

267
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,480
He cost you a lot of money.

268
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:01,870
That was an accident!

269
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,480
I was investing in our future.

270
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,270
He said

271
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,080
he'd earn us a shared villa.

272
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,600
He didn't mean to lose all my money.

273
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,120
But now he's living in a villa

274
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,320
of a fifty-year-woman.

275
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:19,000
What nonsense are you spouting?

276
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,840
This is humiliating.

277
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,320
Who knew

278
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,120
what the future would hold?

279
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,320
But at the time, it was true love.

280
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:45,550
Once you fall in love,

281
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:47,240
you lose your senses,

282
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,360
completely irrational.

283
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:51,150
But no matter how much you care about others,

284
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,270
you can't lose your bottom line.

285
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,270
You still have to love yourself,

286
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,600
live your life well.

287
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:59,600
So I'm just a big fool, huh?

288
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:01,550
Same here.

289
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:03,790
I am no better than you.

290
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,320
Honestly,

291
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,550
compared to the guys

292
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:08,120
you've dated before me,

293
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,150
the only difference is

294
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:10,440
I haven't sunk so low

295
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,840
as to scam you out of money.

296
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,600
You really are a hopeless romantic.

297
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:16,240
Why do you become so compliant

298
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:17,720
once you're in love?

299
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:19,910
You're so lovable.

300
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,000
Why worry about not being loved by others?

301
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:35,720
Being good to the one you love

302
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:38,600
is just natural, isn't it?

303
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:43,960
Alright,

304
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,120
let's drop this topic.

305
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:47,750
We surrender.

306
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:48,480
No more fighting.

307
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:52,150
But seriously,

308
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:53,600
we won't face any punishment

309
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,390
from NDT Express, will we?

310
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:55,320
No.

311
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,510
All you need to do is cooperate

312
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:58,320
with the company's investigation.

313
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,670
That's all.

314
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:01,440
The company won't make things difficult for you.

315
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,550
As for Fu Rong,

316
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:04,790
the company has always held

317
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:06,080
a high opinion of you.

318
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,870
As a renowned Sword Gust Master,

319
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:09,960
you were forced into the mountains by debt collectors.

320
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,390
On the bright side,

321
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:12,080
despite your hardships,

322
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,550
you never used your skills

323
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:14,960
for any wrongdoing.

324
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:17,000
So, the company

325
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,840
will help you resolve your debts.

326
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,270
That's wonderful!

327
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,270
Then we'll just...

328
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,440
Wang?

329
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,600
Without a moment's hesitation,

330
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,390
Wang Ye acted

331
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:34,550
purely on instinct!

332
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:35,550
Oh no, he's going to fight!

333
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:36,750
Zhuge Qing immediately

334
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:37,910
understood his intention!

335
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:38,790
Wait, I've already...

336
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:39,550
Boulder Toss!

337
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,870
KO!

338
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:57,790
Qing,

339
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:59,120
don't blame me.

340
00:12:59,320 --> 00:12:59,750
Doing this

341
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,150
hurts me too!

342
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:06,750
Did Mr. Zhuge

343
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:08,720
owe Wang Ye money?

344
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:09,880
I've already...

345
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,640
Qing,

346
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,670
don't let our friendship hold you back.

347
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,630
Come on,

348
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:14,670
fight back!

349
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:15,790
I've already...

350
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:23,790
Qing,

351
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:24,840
get up!

352
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:26,320
Stand up, Qing!

353
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,360
Fight back, Qing!

354
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,240
I've already surrendered!

355
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,510
I'll leave Biyou Village!

356
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,000
What?

357
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:38,440
That was reckless of me.

358
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,600
But it's also your fault, Qing.

359
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,440
Why didn't you

360
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:43,320
speak up earlier?

361
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,120
I tried...

362
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,320
tried my foot!

363
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,200
Get up.

364
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:47,910
Let me dust you off.

365
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,480
All right,

366
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,750
let me dust you off.

367
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:51,480
I'll dust you off.

368
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,750
Why don't you chat outside the village?

369
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,080
Time is running out.

370
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,080
Mr. Zhuge,

371
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,390
please hurry and take Fu Rong out of the village.

372
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:00,960
The company's people will arrive shortly.

373
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,120
After that,

374
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,790
just follow their arrangements.

375
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,630
More people are coming?

376
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:06,910
With such a big operation?

377
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,910
Is the situation that serious?

378
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,080
It's not serious yet.

379
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,120
But if we let it escalate,

380
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,120
it will become very serious.

381
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:17,550
Follow me.

382
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,910
We need to talk.

383
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:20,030
Meng,

384
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,480
borrow him for a bit.

385
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,720
This isn't over, is it?

386
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,120
Let's go,

387
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:24,870
good boy.

388
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:25,750
I'm not hitting you.

389
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:26,670
Go.

390
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,120
All right,

391
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:32,720
you're quite the schemer,

392
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:35,120
surrendering as soon as the tide turned.

393
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:37,510
Even with all my scheming,

394
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,150
I still couldn't avoid a beating.

395
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:40,720
Consider yourself lucky.

396
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:42,720
Fine.

397
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,030
I'm just glad you backed out before getting caught up

398
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:46,390
in Ma Xianhong's mess.

399
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:47,320
But still...

400
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,240
Don't you feel even a little guilty

401
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,510
about Ma Xianhong?

402
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:55,600
What exactly are you trying to say?

403
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,270
After observing for a few days,

404
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:00,870
let's put his character aside for now,

405
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,840
he's been nothing but kind to you.

406
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,030
And you?

407
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,120
When trouble came his way,

408
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,360
you didn't even bother pretending to help,

409
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,600
and just pulled back.

410
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,670
You even took his best helper!

411
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,080
Enough.

412
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:15,870
Don't guilt-trip me.

413
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:18,480
I'll be straight with you.

414
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:21,270
You were worried that after entering the village,

415
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:22,550
I'd be influenced by Ma Xianhong,

416
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:24,000
even align with him,

417
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:25,240
right?

418
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,510
You worry too much.

419
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,630
No matter how good he is,

420
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:31,960
I'd never become close to him.

421
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,840
Wang, do you know?

422
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,670
Whether someone

423
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:37,000
can be accepted by others

424
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:38,720
depends on one quality,

425
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,120
even more than their morality.

426
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,030
Sometimes, it's the deciding factor.

427
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,000
This quality

428
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:45,960
is tact.

429
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:47,270
You,

430
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:48,240
gentle.

431
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,120
Lian,

432
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:49,790
clear-headed.

433
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,440
You both understand boundaries.

434
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,870
While treating yourselves well,

435
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,080
you also understand others.

436
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:57,550
That's why I'm willing to interact with you,

437
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,030
even make sacrifices for you.

438
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:00,200
It's worth it.

439
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,910
But Ma Xianhong?

440
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,440
He lacks tact.

441
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,270
He never considers others' feelings.

442
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:09,670
What good is it if he's a kind person?

443
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,510
Dealing with someone like him is exhausting.

444
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:13,790
So,

445
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:15,600
my relationship with him is purely transactional.

446
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:16,960
We're not close.

447
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,440
Sure,

448
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:19,910
he's been good to me.

449
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:21,390
But I also helped him perfect his furnace.

450
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:22,870
I never depended on him.

451
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:25,320
We owe each other nothing.

452
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,360
So now I can leave

453
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:29,030
without guilt.

454
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:31,360
Is that so?

455
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:35,120
I still remember you telling me

456
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:36,720
that when you make decisions,

457
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,390
you always consider yourself first.

458
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,510
Have you gotten what made you decide

459
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:48,600
to enter the village?

460
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,600
We're both sorcerers.

461
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,000
Take a guess.

462
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,640
Let's go.

463
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,510
Are you okay?

464
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:07,240
I'm fine.

465
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,000
Something's different.

466
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:14,880
It's not just my imagination.

467
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,480
How should I describe it?

468
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:21,400
Today, that guy seems unusually relaxed.

469
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:27,720
Mr. Zhuge,

470
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:29,750
Fu Rong's matter is resolved,

471
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,350
but there's one more thing we need your help with.

472
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,110
Based on what we've gathered,

473
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,350
only Qiu Rang mastered

474
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:37,510
Ma Xianhong's technique in this village.

475
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:38,440
Did you

476
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,000
also learn it?

477
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,960
No,

478
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:48,680
I've only been here a short while.

479
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,480
Really?

480
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,310
You don't believe me?

481
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:54,070
Well, that's troublesome.

482
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,790
We were hoping you could unlock

483
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:57,160
Ma Xianhong's mechanisms

484
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,200
to help Zhang Chulan

485
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,510
locate the Refining Furnace.

486
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,680
Why can't I break through the mechanisms

487
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:05,110
created by Divine Forge

488
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:07,000
without mastering it?

489
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,960
Fire!

490
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,070
Fire!

491
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:14,640
Quick, put out the fire!

492
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:15,750
There's a fire!

493
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:16,160
Quickly!

494
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,270
Where's the fire?

495
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,070
Where's the fire?

496
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:18,830
Hurry!

497
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,550
Quick!

498
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,400
Where's the fire?

499
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,160
Qiu,

500
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:22,000
is there a fire?

501
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:22,830
What's going on?

502
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:23,550
Where's the fire?

503
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:24,160
What happened?

504
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,880
Full of lies,

505
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:27,310
and dishonest hands.

506
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,640
Today, I have to deal with you!

507
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:29,920
What's the rush?

508
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,200
No fire, right?

509
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,200
Then I'll start one.

510
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:55,960
Since they made the first move,

511
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,270
there's no need to hold back.

512
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,240
Capture them alive.

513
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,200
I need to use them to negotiate with the company.

514
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:04,350
Understood.

515
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:05,440
We're heading over now.

516
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,110
You're finally here to seize my people, huh?

517
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,920
Ma,

518
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,830
stop being so stubborn.

519
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,480
I really don't want to see you fall out with the company.

520
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:27,270
You're quite concerned for me.

521
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,240
Zhang Chulan,

522
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,510
is this your plan?

523
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,720
Keeping me here

524
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,510
while the others make their move?

525
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,680
Why can't you

526
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,480
just think better of people?

527
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,000
I'm not holding you back.

528
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,160
I'm protecting you!

529
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:48,510
Why do you think

530
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:49,960
I call you my god-nephew?

531
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:51,680
Why don't I call anyone else that?

532
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:55,030
Because they don't deserve it.

533
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,160
Do you think you're the only one who values ties?

534
00:20:58,310 --> 00:20:59,750
If it weren't for those connections to the past,

535
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:00,640
do you think I'd be here

536
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,240
arguing with you?

537
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:04,270
I don't care about the others,

538
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:05,640
but I genuinely hope

539
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,680
you don't make an enemy of the company, Ma!

540
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,240
I'm begging you.

541
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,000
Just stay here.

542
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,830
You've already done everything you could for Chen Duo.

543
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:16,310
Stay here and wait

544
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,480
for the villagers and the temp workers

545
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,110
to settle their conflict.

546
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:25,400
Ma!

547
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:34,480
Zhang Chulan,

548
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:36,830
tell me

549
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,110
about your stories with Mr. Huaiyi

550
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:41,480
over the years.

551
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,000
The chief says

552
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:51,070
it's time to act.

553
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:53,830
We can finally deal with them.

554
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:57,310
My leg...

555
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,550
He's in position!

556
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:28,960
Xiaolong,

557
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,480
make your move!

558
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:58,720
No way.

559
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:00,830
He took my Finger Flick Skill

560
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:02,590
and he's fine?

561
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:03,920
That black staff

562
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,400
can block some of my channels

563
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,440
and

564
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:09,240
absorb my strength.

565
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:11,750
But don't get me wrong.

566
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:12,920
It's not my weapon.

567
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:15,160
It's just a prop

568
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,270
I use for training.

569
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:18,960
Don't be afraid.

570
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:19,960
He's all alone.

571
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:21,070
Let's attack together.

572
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:22,790
Take him down!

573
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:34,510
A few days ago, I recalled some past events.

574
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,200
Before I was born,

575
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,000
my great-grandfather had already passed away.

576
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,310
My grandfather told me

577
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:46,000
that he died with only one ear and one eye,

578
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,750
both arms completely cut off.

579
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:51,510
And I saw with my own eyes

580
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:54,510
my grandfather was killed, his left leg cut off.

581
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,110
And the 86 villagers,

582
00:23:58,110 --> 00:23:59,070
they all died...

583
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,310
I didn't expect that you and Mr. Huaiyi

584
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,110
had such a rough time too.

585
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,510
Since we share similar experiences,

586
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,920
we should cherish our life now even more.

587
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,640
In the early days of Biyou Village,

588
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,550
you kept to yourself.

589
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:28,400
But recently, what's going on?

590
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,310
First, you targeted Wang Ye and Zhuge Qing.

591
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,590
Then you had Chen Duo kidnap Mei Jinfeng.

592
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,790
This doesn't align with the way you've always handled things.

593
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:42,720
Since the Outsider Martial Arts Contest,

594
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,070
you've been unusually active.

595
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,720
Ma,

596
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:50,310
what exactly are you trying to do?

597
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:53,590
Zhang Chulan,

598
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,310
maybe it's my wishful thinking,

599
00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:58,400
but I can't help

600
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,070
but see you descendants of the Eight Supremes

601
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:01,070
as one of us.

602
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,000
Initially, my interest in the Contest

603
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,590
was because of you.

604
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,070
But your performance

605
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:10,960
was just absurd.

606
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:25,110
You're off-topic.

607
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,680
Anyway,

608
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,960
it's reassuring that you've found solid support

609
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,790
with the company.

610
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:33,400
However, during the Contest,

611
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,110
I also noticed two others:

612
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:36,920
Wang Ye from the Wudang Sect

613
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,240
and Zhuge Qing from the Zhuge family.

614
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:40,630
[Nine Heavens, Nine Earths, Vermilion Bird]

615
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:42,680
[Polaris, Lunar, Six Matches, Winged Snake, Zhifu]

616
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,960
Wang Ye is a legitimate successor of the Eight Supremes,

617
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:47,200
so naturally, I kept an eye on him.

618
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:48,960
As for Zhuge Qing,

619
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,310
he's skilled in divine crafts

620
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:52,000
and expert in sorceries.

621
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,720
It'd be a shame not to meet

622
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:55,200
such talent in person.

623
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:57,590
As for Ms. Jinfeng,

624
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,200
bringing her back

625
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,720
was a request

626
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,110
from someone I couldn't refuse.

627
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:04,920
Who was it?

628
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:07,000
That's none of your business.

629
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:10,240
You know the rest.

630
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,790
I do need sorcerers to help me

631
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:15,510
complete the Refining Furnace.

632
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,510
I don't see myself as a bad person.

633
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:19,880
Building this village and creating the Furnace

634
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,000
was genuinely to help

635
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,510
people like Chen Duo.

636
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:24,270
That's true.

637
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,830
But on the other hand,

638
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:29,880
I also wanted to help myself.

639
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,960
Help yourself?

640
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:41,590
What's wrong with you?

641
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,880
I'm sick.

642
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:49,830
Here, I'm sick.

643
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,750
But thanks to the Refining Furnace,

644
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,720
I've almost fully recovered.

645
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,790
All right,

646
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:01,640
you've delayed me long enough.

647
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,830
Your mission is complete.

648
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,070
I...

649
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,070
Zhang Chulan,

650
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,590
let me give you some advice too.

651
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:08,640
No matter if those came with you

652
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,030
are insane guys or not,

653
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:11,920
I'll take care of them.

654
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:13,920
But regardless,

655
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,680
I don't want you to interfere.

656
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,030
I sincerely don't want to hurt you.

657
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:27,160
Ma!

658
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,160
I said before that I didn't know

659
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,640
the origins of these insane guys.

660
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:37,110
But actually, I lied.

661
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,680
Among those people,

662
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,720
there's one I do know.

663
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,310
I know him very well.

664
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:47,160
I understand his terror deeply.

665
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,590
As for the others, I genuinely don't know,

666
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,510
but anyone who can be compared to that guy

667
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:53,920
is definitely not simple!

668
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:55,110
Ma,

669
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,440
I'm begging you,

670
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,350
stop being so stubborn!

671
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,550
Let go.

672
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:04,510
Either Chen Duo

673
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,590
or the village,

674
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:08,750
pick one.

675
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:10,830
Ma,

676
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,510
give up on Chen Duo.

677
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:14,110
Only then can you

678
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:15,240
protect your Refining Furnace

679
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,590
and save this village!

680
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:19,160
Zhang Chulan,

681
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:23,160
even after all I've said, you still don't understand me.

682
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,310
What I promised Chen Duo,

683
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:27,400
I will fulfill.

684
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,830
For me, giving up on Chen Duo

685
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:32,000
is the same as giving up on the whole village.

686
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:03,340
[Battle Armor: Red bead strings worn on hands and feet,]

687
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:04,030
[with the user's qi adheres to them.]

688
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:05,900
[During use, the bead strings spread out to form armor with strong defense.]

689
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:10,750
Ma...

690
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:14,640
Tell your people

691
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,510
I want both Chen Duo

692
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:18,000
and the village.

693
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:27,440
Ma,

694
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:29,440
you're so honest.

695
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,110
I almost feel bad

696
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:33,510
about breaking your furnace.

697
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,400
Meng,

698
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,550
have you found Qing yet?

699
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:43,240
Zhang Chulan,

700
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,160
are you so confident

701
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,680
that I'll help you?

702
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:49,440
I'm not sure about that.

703
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,110
But I have to try, right?

704
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:53,920
Listen closely to what I'm about to say.

705
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,480
From your current position, go 50 meters east.

706
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,680
There's a small path.

707
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,480
Take it.

708
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,790
Dear villagers,

709
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,030
I'm sorry.

710
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,750
To avoid causing panic,

711
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:06,960
I've been hiding something from you.

712
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:08,960
I've scared you.

713
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,110
Tonight,

714
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,590
Biyou Village was attacked by enemies.

715
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,000
The ones responsible are from the company.

716
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,880
They came to capture Chen Duo.

717
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,640
I refused.

718
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,070
I won't go into detail

719
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:27,160
about the reasons.

720
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:29,550
What I want to say is,

721
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,000
I won't let them take Chen Duo.

722
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,200
I will fight them.

723
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:39,510
Listen carefully to what I say next.

724
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,960
This battle,

725
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,030
has nothing to do with you

726
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:45,400
in terms of cause.

727
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,790
And in terms of strength,

728
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:50,000
you're no match for the company.

729
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,680
This fight is my personal choice.

730
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:55,480
The only one who should face this battle

731
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,720
is me.

732
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:03,000
The exit is now open.

733
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,440
This place will soon turn into a battlefield.

734
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:07,310
If you don't want to get involved,

735
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,790
leave the village immediately.

736
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:12,440
Don't carry any guilt about it.

737
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,550
Even if we escape,

738
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:31,880
we'll end up in the company's hands.

739
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,510
We might as well stay and fight to the death!

740
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:36,160
For those who wish to stay,

741
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:38,070
don't hold back!

742
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,640
Let's fight!

743
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:46,070
- Let's fight! - Let's do this!

744
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:54,440
We've located two of them.

745
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,830
Follow my flying insects to attack them.

746
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:58,030
Don't push yourself too hard.

747
00:31:58,030 --> 00:31:59,270
Just hold them off.

748
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:01,550
I'll deal with them one by one.

749
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,440
Move now!

750
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:03,720
That circus performer

751
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,510
is mine to handle.

752
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:05,400
Alright, follow me!

753
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:05,960
- Got it! - Let's go!

754
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,000
- Hurry up! - This way. Move!

755
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:10,200
The easy mode is over, everyone.

756
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:11,030
Let's get started!

757
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,270
Who's there?

758
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,920
A dark, windy night

759
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,920
is not ideal for traveling.

760
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,830
Hello, Mr. Zhao.

761
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,310
Wait a second!

762
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,640
You're here for Chen Duo.

763
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,720
I won't interfere.

764

I've been lacking exercise lately.

770
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,750
My fitness has really gone downhill.

771
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:30,880
You, the monkey trainer.

772
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:32,880
We meet again.

773
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,510
Hornet?

774
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,270
What a joke.

775
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:03,310
Is that all the power you've got?

776
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:05,550
What a useless waste of space.

777
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:07,070
If you've got real skills,

778
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:09,280

779
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,480
Otherwise,

780
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,320
what do you have to fight me with?

781
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,670
This young guy,

782
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,320
talking about mythical beasts.

783
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,080
Indeed,

784
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,200
Beast Tamers

785
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,480
were considered the most despised

786
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,230
in the eyes of past outsiders.

787
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,030
But interestingly,

788
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:35,120
with the development of modern technology,

789
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,510
most outsider techniques have faded.

790
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:38,670
Yet Beast Tamers

791
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:40,960
have managed to evolve even further

792
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,110
utilizing modern advancements.

793
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,400
The term Beast Tamer

794
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:49,070
originally referred to communicating with animals

795
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:51,190
like simple birds and beasts.

796
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:52,880
So,

797
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,280
their research targets were limited.

798
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,590
But as technology advanced,

799
00:34:57,710 --> 00:34:58,800
our understanding of biology

800
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,190
became more detailed and comprehensive.

801
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,070
Realizing this,

802
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:06,590
I developed my unique Beast Tamer philosophy.

803
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:09,840
Now, my communication targets

804
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,630
include microorganisms

805
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:12,800
and bacteria.

806
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,320
Any physical contact with my emitted qi

807
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,320
allows me to control

808
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,590
the increase or mutation of bacteria in the target's body.

809
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,400
This is my solo technique,

810
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,840

811
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,440

839
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:10,960
The matter with Chen Duo

840
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,510
is a minor issue for me.

841
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:14,360
However, there's something

842
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,550
I'd like to ask you about.

843
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,440
A year ago, within the province,

844
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:21,070
there were seven murder cases involving outsiders.

845
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:24,360
All seven cases had the same method.

846
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:26,800
The incidents were mysterious,

847
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,360
and the murderer left no clues.

848
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:32,480
Shortly after,

849
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,360
a herbalist collaborating with the Maoshan Sect

850
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:38,280
stole their martial arts texts,

851
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:41,360
injured their disciples, and disappeared.

852
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:44,070
Since then, no one has seen him.

853
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:47,400
That vanished herbalist

854
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:50,190
is you,

855
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:51,550

The Maoshan Sect's elders

sent you to bring me back, right?

860
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:04,070
At that time, I lost my mind

861
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:05,960
and mistakenly injured their disciples.

00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,000

Though rarely seen,

871
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,480
legends of the Maoshan Sect's techniques

872
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,360
are widespread.

873
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:06,230
The Maoshan Sect's Vermilion Books

874
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,000
are renowned across the world.

875
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:11,110
It's a highly disciplined and self-restrained sect,

876
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,480
appearing somewhat old-fashioned.

877
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:16,630
They don't obsess

878
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:18,510
over flashy techniques.

879
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,550
Studying the classics

880
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,440
and cultivating character

881
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,110
are their true pursuits.

882
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:27,960
But somewhere along the way,

883
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:31,920
some independent outsiders with special techniques

884
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,800
started wandering the world under the guise

885
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,400
of their disciples.

886
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,150
Such outsiders are numerous,

887
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,510
of varying quality,

00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:41,760
neither entirely good nor evil,

but all boasting the Maoshan Sect's banner

890
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:46,230
everywhere they go,

891
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:47,760

892
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,360

Fakes?

00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:01,880
Those so-called real Maoshan Sect disciples

895
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:04,760
spend their days chanting worn-out texts.

896

00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,440
I'm not sent by the company

949
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,320
to enforce justice.

950
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:58,280
I'm here to meet a friend.

951
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,400
Heaven and Earth are merciless?

952
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,880
Stop finding grand excuses

953
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,030
for yourself.

954
00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:06,920
For you and me,

955
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:11,960
trying to live as normal people is too hard.

956
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:17,550
What are you talking about?

957
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:23,440
It's so disappointing.

958
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,800
Harming others just to perfect your techniques,

959
00:43:27,670 --> 00:43:29,230
that's not right.

960
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:32,440
This was only meant

961
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:34,280
to make you face yourself.

962
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,150
No matter how noble

963
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:42,400
or great the reason,

964
00:43:42,590 --> 00:43:45,320
hurting innocent people

965
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:49,150
is simply hard.

966
00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:51,320
But you,

967
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,320
you did it with ease.

968
00:43:54,510 --> 00:43:56,670
You took seven lives,

969
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:01,070
all in their beautiful youth.

970
00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:05,840
For such fragile yet radiant lives,

971
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:08,070
instead of mourning their fleeting end,

972
00:44:08,070 --> 00:44:10,710
you only care about your absurd sorcery!

973
00:44:10,710 --> 00:44:13,000
What's wrong with your head?

974
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:24,150
Wake up, bro.

975
00:44:24,510 --> 00:44:25,840
You and I

976
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:29,710
are both obsessed with death,

977
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,840

if there's still a longing for light in our hearts,

981
00:44:44,070 --> 00:44:45,760
there's only one way:

982
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:47,920
fight fire...

983
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:49,280
with...

984
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:50,760
fire.

985
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,960
Accept your punishment.

986
00:44:59,070 --> 00:45:00,510

I've investigated them.

1023
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,070
Their social connections are simple.

1024
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:33,920
They all came to this village alone.

1025
00:46:34,190 --> 00:46:36,000
Even if they disappear, no one will investigate.

1026
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:37,320
