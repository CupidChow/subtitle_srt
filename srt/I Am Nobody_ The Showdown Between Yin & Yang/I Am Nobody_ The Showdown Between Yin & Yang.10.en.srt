00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:48,840
are unimaginable to most.

193
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,550
And yet,

194
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,750
these Outsiders you've created

195
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,120
haven't experienced any of that.

196
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:55,840
You've allowed them

197
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,120
to become Outsiders overnight.

198
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,750
But the consequence

199
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,960
is losing touch with reality.

200
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:03,120
They're reckless,

201
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,270
arrogant,

202
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,600
unprepared for the pain

203
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,550
that comes with the real world,

204
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:08,440
yet they've gained everything so easily.

205
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,750
What you've created aren't Outsiders

206
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,360
but a group of clueless tourists

207
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,390
wandering into the Outsiders' world.

208
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:16,550
A bunch of gamers.

209
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:18,670
Becoming Outsiders?

210
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:31,200
Do they deserve it?

211
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,390
Charge!

212
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:35,200
Everyone, stop!

213
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:42,200
I'm sorry, everyone.

214
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:50,080
Idiot.

215
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:51,750
These half-baked rookies

216
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,320
are nothing but burdens to us

217
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,910
and obstacles for you too.

218
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,440
It's my fault.

219
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:00,910
I take back what I said earlier.

220
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:03,790
This is now entirely a fight between them and me.

221
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:04,790
It has nothing

222
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,600
to do with any of you.

223
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,720
I now sincerely ask all of you

224
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,000
to leave this place.

225
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:12,200
Chief,

226
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,240
we're not leaving!

227
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,360
We're staying!

228
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,960
We'll keep fighting!

229
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,000
Sorry, Chief,

230
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,390
but I'll stay here

231
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:19,440
and fight alongside them!

232
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:20,840
It was you

233
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,390
who brought me from the dull life of an ordinary person

234
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:26,360
into the high walls of the Outsiders.

235
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:29,840
Today,

236
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:31,440
I'll fully enjoy

237
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,080
my first battle as an Outsider,

238
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:35,600
and show them

239
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,960
my true power.

240
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:39,200
I'm betting on the honor of an Outsider.

241
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,270
Even if I fail in the end,

242
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:43,390
I won't let this rare clash

243
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:45,080
end with any regret!

244
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,790
Fight to the end!

245
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,120
We have to experience

246
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,870
this Outsiders' battle ourselves!

247
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:51,670
Let me taste the thrill of an Outsider fight!

248
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:52,870
We don't care about them!

249
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:54,320
We've got to show them some real skills!

250
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:55,510
What a headache.

251
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:56,720
We'll fight to the end!

252
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,910
We won't back down!

253
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:00,150
What did I miss?

254
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:14,270
What's going on here?

255
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,630
Is this some corporate motivational training?

256
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:21,000
Especially you.

257
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:23,030
You're not running a pyramid scheme, anyway.

258
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:24,750
Why are you so fired up?

259
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:29,150
A clash?

260
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:32,200
What are you thinking?

261
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,080
Did we come here

262
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,440
just to clash with you?

263
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,200
Headquarters has made it clear:

264
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:43,840
we're to capture all of you.

265
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,550
But those with unshakable resolve,

266
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:51,000
those willing to risk everything for their beliefs,

267
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,630
I do admire them.

268
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:00,120
That is,

269
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:03,120
only if they've made a calm judgment,

270
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,120
and under rational circumstances,

271
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,320
they still choose to stay.

272
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,870
Only then are they valuable.

273
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:11,320
Foolish radicals

274
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:13,360
aren't worth the trouble of me

275
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,870
being held accountable for them.

276
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:18,870
So, everyone,

277
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,670
take five seconds to calm down.

278
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,320
Perhaps each of you

279
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,550
has your own reasons to stay.

280
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:30,000
I can't understand them,

281
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:33,630
but if you still want to stay,

282
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:36,910
then I'll

283
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,550
grant your wish.

284
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,240
This is Zhao Guizhen's wicked sorcery!

285
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:27,390
Didn't you say you wouldn't leave regrets?

286
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,440
Not just regrets,

287
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,550
you'll be left with nothing.

288
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:39,910
Come on.

289
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,150
All of you, get lost!

290
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:05,720
Qing,

291
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,960
are you messing with me?

292
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,390
Where's the furnace?

293
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:09,390
Don't worry.

294
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:11,150
The furnace is almost there.

295
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,630
[Hide, Fu Tian, Renchen Jia]
The Hide Gate suggests hiding.

296
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:14,080
Neutral Gates are aligned with wood.

297
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,750
Ma Xianhong hid the furnace there.

298
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,120
It's truly foolproof.

299
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,150
But If you fight at the Hide Gate,

300
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,320
you won't stand a chance.

301
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,910
The Life Gate is in the northeast.

302
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:23,080
[Zhifu, Fu Tian, Renchen Jia]
It suggests renewal of all things.

303
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,000
[Winged Snake, Jie Tian, Guiyin Jia]
It's a gate of great fortune.

304
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,390
[Six Matches, Ren Tian, Wuzi Jia]
Your current position

305
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:26,750
[Life]
is precisely the northeast Life Gate.

306
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,550
I'll move it over to you right now.

307
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,810
[Nine Heavens, Nine Earths, Vermilion Bird]

308
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:37,740
[Polaris, Lunar, Six Matches, Winged Snake, Zhifu]

309
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:42,550
Why are you gritting your teeth?

310
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:45,630
The others are fine,

311
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,600
but Zhao Guizhen deserved this.

312
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,270
I can't be wrong.

313
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,960
These people didn't come just for Chen Duo.

314
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:02,600
They came to Biyou Village

315
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,390
fully prepared.

316
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:07,240
You brought this on yourselves.

317
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,030
Guys,

318
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:10,600
let's go!

319
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:19,920
Guan and Xiao

320
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,510
apply direct pressure on Ma Xianhong.

321
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,960
Baobao may seem clumsy in normal times,

322
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,720
but her moves are nothing to scoff at.

323
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,640
It's been a long time

324
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,920
since we've worked this smoothly together.

325
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:35,790
Strange...

326
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:37,070
I can't sense anything

327
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:38,550
from these people.

328
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,160
Their mental state is unusually steady.

329
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,110
Their purpose...

330
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:44,640
Yes,

331
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,880
they must have a purpose.

332
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,550
These people

333
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:48,510
seem to be holding back.

334
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:49,880
Why?

335
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,590
Are they trying to stall me?

336
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:52,960
What's the matter, Chief Ma?

337
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,310
Why the grim face?

338
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:57,200
We're the ones

339
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,030
putting in all the effort here.

340
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,750
You five

341
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,880
designed your strategy

342
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,350
with the entire village as the target

343
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:04,550
from the start,

344
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,590
isn't that right?

345
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,200
You don't seem to care much

346
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,880
about your dear uncle.

347
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,160
Six of us.

348
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:11,270
No, seven.

349
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:12,590
Shut up!

350
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:13,790
Stop arguing with me!

351
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:18,830
At this point,

352
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:20,070
let's just lay it all out.

353
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,920
We came here

354
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,590
specifically to deal with the entire village.

355
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:26,440
Now that the villagers have been taken care of,

356
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,720
we're dealing with you.

357
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,790
So tell me...

358
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:32,030
what's your dear uncle

359
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,350
dealing with?

360
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,030
Zhang Chulan,

361
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:42,510
your task is to hold Ma Xianhong steady,

362
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:43,830
stall him as much as you can.

363
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:44,720
Chen Duo

364
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,270
is Ma Xianhong's Achilles' heel.

365
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:47,350
Her very existence

366
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:49,510
is like a noose

367
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:50,960
tightening around his spirit!

368
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,030
Before Ma Xianhong realizes the danger,

369
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:54,310
we need to quickly deal with

370
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:55,960
his followers and those villagers.

371
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,640
At the same time,

372
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,350
start destroying the village.

373
00:18:58,590 --> 00:18:59,550
Doing this

374
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:01,070
will definitely anger Ma Xianhong,

375
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:02,550
making him lose his mind.

376
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:04,070
This will create the conditions you need

377
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:05,160
to destroy the furnace later.

378
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,110
So what lies ahead

379
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:08,920
is the remaining forces of the village
