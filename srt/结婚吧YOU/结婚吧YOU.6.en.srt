FILMING OF CHILD ACTORS DONE
UNDER BROADCASTING GUIDELINES

3
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,592
Did you send him off well?

4
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:55,013
{\an8}Yes, thanks to you.

5
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:01,019
{\an8}It took you five years to say goodbye.

6
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:04,689
{\an8}Thank you, Ha-na.

7
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:10,904
{\an8}Shall we start anew?

8
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:14,157
Okay, let's do that.

9
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:20,914
Why is this…
Is it supposed to be like this?

10
00:01:20,997 --> 00:01:24,292
- What's wrong? Is it not working?
- This… Why isn't this…

11
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:26,127
This…

12
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:27,337
Like this.

13
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:48,817
- Wear it properly. Let's go.
- Okay.

14
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:54,489
Why is this… Is this for kids?

15
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:57,283
Do I just put my arm in?

16
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:01,788
Wait, isn't that Ba-da and San-i?

17
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,421
- Wait here.
- Cheol-hui.

18
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:28,731
San-i! Ba-da!

19
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:40,702
INJEONG INTERSECTION

20
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,371
Bong Ba-da, Bong San-i!

21
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:59,053
What are you guys doing here?

22
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:02,765
Can't you tell? We're eating carp bread.

23
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:05,143
Exactly why are you here?

24
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:09,355
We came here hoping we'd find you here.

25
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:14,235
See? I told you we could find him here.

26
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,991
Tell me honestly.

27
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:23,161
Didn't you follow a man here?

28
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:25,038
What are you talking about?

29
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,125
What?

30
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,711
You really…

31
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,757
Uncle is so mean, isn't he?

32
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,425
- It's Ha-na!
- It's Ha-na!

33
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:43,056
Uncle is so busy with his love life
that he doesn't play with you nowadays.

34
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:44,349
You must've been bored.

35
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:46,809
What should I do? Should I scold him?

36
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:48,645
No.

37
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:52,482
If he is spending his time with you,
we're fine with it.

38
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:55,360
Are you sure you didn't follow
a man wearing a black cap...

39
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:56,319
Don't.

40
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:58,029
Come here. Let's go home.

41
00:03:58,112 --> 00:04:00,490
I'll take you guys home. Let's go.

42
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:10,124
Are Ba-da and San-i okay?

43
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:15,838
You must've been startled too.
Get some rest.

44
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,674
Okay, bye.

45
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:33,147
- What's wrong? Is it not working?
- This…

46
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:40,697
What's wrong with me?

47
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:48,413
It's been too long since I last dated.

48
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:11,269
Ha-na, what is your hobby?

49
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:14,814
I like singing, so I take singing lessons.

50
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,942
I go to karaoke alone too.

51
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:19,610
Karaoke, I see.

52
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:22,155
I like hiking.

53
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:23,698
My dream is hiking…

54
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:25,575
- <i>His face is decent.</i>
- …with my girlfriend.

55
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,618
<i>His hobby is normal too.</i>

56
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:31,372
If you'd like to, we could go
on a night-hiking trail on a weekday.

57
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:33,750
You can smell the grass
twice as much at night.

58
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,586
The true phytoncide definitely...

59
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:37,795
I…

60
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,923
Often work overtime nowadays.

61
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:43,259
I see.

62
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:46,763
I like to meet often
when I'm in a relationship.

63
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:49,223
I can be a boyfriend
who waits for you to finish work.

64
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:51,976
<i>On top of that, he's kind.</i>

65
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:55,855
Actually,

66
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:58,691
you're really my type, Ha-na.

67
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:03,154
That dress suits you so well.

68
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:04,864
You're a good listener too.

69
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:05,865
And most importantly,

70
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:09,077
neither of us wants to get married.

71
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:12,914
Don't you think we'll get along well?

72
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:18,628
<i>But why do I feel so uncomfortable?</i>

73
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:30,848
I enjoyed today's blind date.

74
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:32,475
I see.

75
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:35,228
See you again soon.

76
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,503
- You had a blind date during lunch?
- My gosh.

77
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:03,798
I followed you from the café.

78
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:06,592
Why are you so deep in thought?

79
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:09,387
Well…

80
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:14,308
Don't tell me you're getting ready already

81
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:16,310
since Cheol-hui's date is going well.

82
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:19,355
Of course. I'll be joining
another department soon.

83
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:26,737
Jeong Ha-na, you sure are a planner.

84
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:37,832
Mr. Choi. This way, please.

85
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:48,759
MARRIAGE MORALE BOOST PROJECT
12 COMPLAINTS

86
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:50,470
We have a lot more complaints.

87
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:55,683
This shows the project is
getting a lot of attention.

88
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:58,728
It's a pity there aren't
successful matches.

89
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:00,396
Marriage isn't easy.

90
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,191
When you're in love and get proposed to,

91
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:06,569
you feel elated like
you're a character in a romantic movie.

92
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,614
But soon, the reality hits you.

93
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:13,159
That's right. Marriage is reality.

94
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:16,954
Unless you get married early like me
when you're still clueless,

95
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:19,123
it's hard to get married.

96
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:24,128
Expectations and the reality
of marriage are different.

97
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:25,379
They are.

98
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,468
We can turn their expectations
of marriage into reality.

99
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:32,970
That's why this team exists.

100
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:35,056
Mr. Im, hello.

101
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:37,225
It's been a while.

102
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:43,439
Anyway, if Bong Cheol-hui and Oh In-ah
of Dyan Group work out,

103
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:47,401
that will be the fantasy of marriage
turned into reality.

104
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:49,695
I'm keeping a close eye on it.

105
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,822
Okay, I'll keep it in mind.

106
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:55,660
Take advantage of this strong momentum
and do more promotion.

107
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:57,828
- Let's make this work.
- Okay.

108
00:08:57,912 --> 00:09:00,081
Yes, sir. We'll do our best!

109
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:16,222
I shall keep the promise I made last time.

110
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:17,431
Okay.

111
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:28,150
Cheol-hui!

112
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,820
How was it with In-a yesterday?
Did you ask her out again?

113
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:32,321
Next time, you must go farther.

114
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,532
I hope everything goes smoothly.

115
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:37,785
You should catch your breath.

116
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:40,371
We didn't meet up yesterday.

117
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:42,123
Why?

118
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:45,626
Ha-na must be worried.

119
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:48,462
Something urgent came up.

120
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,507
You must not like her that much.

121
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:56,554
With her personality, In-a would expect
everything to go her way.

122
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,056
You think so too?

123
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:07,315
Hello.

124
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:11,569
<i>Ha-na. I'm thinking
of inviting In-a to my place.</i>

125
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:13,404
<i>What do you think?</i>

126
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:17,450
<i>Since In-a treated me last time.</i>

127
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:19,827
Oh, you want a home date?

128
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,037
<i>Yes, that's my plan.</i>

129
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,623
<i>Suddenly, he wants to invite her
to his house?</i>

130
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,166
<i>That's so quick.</i>

131
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:28,127
It'll be nice with the twins too.

132
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:30,087
<i>Oh, with the twins?</i>

133
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:32,340
Is there anything I can help you with?

134
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:34,008
<i>I'll do the rest myself.</i>

135
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,302
<i>Have a nice day.</i>

136
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:37,386
Thanks.

137
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,060
Ms. Jeong.

138
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:49,231
A broadcasting station suggested
interviewing Cheol-hui and In-a.

139
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:50,483
What do you think?

140
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:52,943
It seems necessary for promotion.

141
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,156
Officially, this is their second meeting.

142
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:59,241
Isn't it too soon?

143
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,369
In-a is positive about it.

144
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:03,537
Dyan's PR team is keen on it too.

145
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:04,789
Exactly.

146
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:09,251
I can tell they want to use it
to change their group's image.

147
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:12,088
Cheol-hui has his niece and nephew too.

148
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:14,340
We should see
if it would affect the children

149
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:16,175
before making the call.

150
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:23,557
That sounds very organized and logical.

151
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:26,268
I understand.
Discuss it with Bong Cheol-hui.

152
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:32,525
- Where are you going?
- Restroom.

153
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:44,870
{\an8}<i>Spend more while you're at it.</i>

154
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,664
{\an8}<i>I'll look forward to it.</i>

155
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:51,710
- Oh, hey.
- Oh.

156
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:54,713
- Weren't you going to the restroom?
- Yes, I was on my way.

157
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:05,391
Yes, Mr. Choi.

158
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:08,227
The second floor?

159
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,397
Hold on. The second floor…

160
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,399
Mr. Yang?

161
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:17,611
What's happening?

162
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:27,663
Hold on. The second floor…

163
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:29,707
Oh.

164
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:02,698
What's this about?

165
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:08,037
Oh, my gosh.

166
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:11,415
You scared me, Cheol-hui.

167
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,293
It is you, Ha-na.

168
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:16,587
What brings you here?

169
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:18,964
I'm here for grocery shopping.

170
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:23,344
Why are you looking at me that way?

171
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:27,306
Your outfit is strange too.

172
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:31,477
Me?

173
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,812
Gosh, this look.

174
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:37,316
Like when you peeked at my body.

175
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,818
That's not it.

176
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:41,445
I'm joking.

177
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,406
Why are you here, Cheol-hui?

178
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:49,078
I came to buy stuff
to make for dinner for In-a.

179
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:52,498
Shall we look around together?

180
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:55,709
Well, sure.

181
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:57,503
Give me the cart. I'll push it.

182
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:03,801
Is there any dish you have in mind?

183
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:08,931
In-a seemed to like pasta
when we had the blind date.

184
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:13,561
That's good too,
but how about something hearty

185
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:15,312
that you can have with more people?

186
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:16,772
What are some options?

187
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:21,986
What about these?

188
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,993
Aren't you showing me
what you want to eat?

189
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:31,745
I got it. I'll remember them.

190
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:34,623
That's not true.
Choi Gi-jun's housewarming…

191
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:36,959
Yes?

192
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:39,670
Anyway, In-a liked this dish.

193
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:43,674
Then I'll go with braised ribs
and seafood stew today.

194
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:54,852
SANGSANG QUAIL EGGS

195
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:58,230
I don't add quail eggs in braised ribs.

196
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,735
Reminds me of quail eggs jangjorim
that my mom cooked for me.

197
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:07,031
Why are you putting it down then?

198
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:09,325
I don't cook at home anyway.

199
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:10,451
Let's go.

200
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:18,584
Try this.

201
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:21,462
Try this. It's buy one,
get one free today.

202
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:22,671
- Really?
- Yes.

203
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:28,093
- Give me one more.
- Isn't it good?

204
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:29,762
Try this.

205
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:35,809
You must be newlyweds.

206
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:38,103
Are you grocery shopping after work?

207
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:40,773
It's such a pleasant sight.

208
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,985
- Are we a pleasant sight?
- You are.

209
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,988
So, do you want one?

210
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:50,074
- No.
- Yes, I'll buy one.

211
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:57,623
Ha-na, wait for me!
We're a pleasant sight!

212
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:02,169
Ha-na, give me that.

213
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:03,212
Thank you.

214
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:04,630
I'm strong.

215
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:07,716
Wait.

216
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,803
Oh, Ms. Jeong.

217
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:12,972
You're here too, Cheol-hui.

218
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,181
- Hello.
- Hi.

219
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:16,183
I saw you a moment ago.

220
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:19,311
What brings you here?

221
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:21,897
Don't you live on the other side of town?

222
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:25,359
I went out for work
and stopped by for some groceries.

223
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,028
See you guys.

224
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:29,989
I'm off.

225
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:30,990
Goodbye.

226
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,835
Thank you. You should go.

227
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:45,212
I will. I'm going to have dinner too.

228
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:47,881
Okay. I'll call you later.

229
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:49,174
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

230
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:10,279
Strangely, I feel comfortable around him.

231
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:16,493
You press, flip, and press again.

232
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:19,371
Really? It's so fun.

233
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:20,581
- Like this?
- Yes.

234
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,752
It's from my dad.

235
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:26,170
Hey.

236
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:29,631
Your dad? San-i, do you miss your parents?

237
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:34,803
We have our uncle, so it's okay.

238
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:38,807
Still, uncles and dads are different.

239
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:43,771
Where is your dad? Has he called you?

240
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:48,025
I'm done.

241
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:49,985
San-i, Ba-da, wash your hands.

242
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:50,903
- Okay.
- Okay.

243
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:52,738
In-a, you too.

244
00:17:58,202 --> 00:17:59,369
Here, let's eat.

245
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:02,456
- Thanks for the food.
- Thanks for the food.

246
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:05,834
Thank you for the food.

247
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:19,014
It's so delicious.

248
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:21,308
Do you like it?

249
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:23,352
Then all is well.

250
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:29,817
But you should've given me a heads-up.

251
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:30,901
What?

252
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:34,863
I thought we were meeting alone,
so I got a bit excited.

253
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:41,328
I mean,

254
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:44,456
if I'd known beforehand,
I'd have bought Ba-da and San-i presents.

255
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:47,584
What do you guys like?

256
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:49,586
I like stocks,

257
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,880
and San-i likes soccer.

258
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:55,175
Stocks?

259
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:59,096
Ba-da, you must be interested
in the economy.

260
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:00,848
No, in money.

261
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:04,810
I must become rich like you
to do everything I want to do.

262
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:06,145
I see.

263
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:09,857
And, San-i, you like soccer?

264
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:15,696
Then shall we go to the UK
to watch soccer next time?

265
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,158
Must we go all the way there to watch it?

266
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:21,118
Why not? It would be fun.

267
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:23,829
You can go on a trip
and fly on a plane too.

268
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:25,664
It doesn't sound fun.

269
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:30,377
Normally, in soap operas,

270
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:33,589
a relationship doesn't work out
because of the kids.

271
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:36,175
Soap operas?

272
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,760
What does that mean?

273
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:41,638
I'm just worried about San-i.

274
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:45,058
Oh, are you worrying for San-i?

275
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:48,437
You're twins, but you're more mature,

276
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,855
maybe because you're older.

277
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:55,652
- Eat up now.
- Okay.

278
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:01,533
I wanted to go somewhere nice.

279
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:04,369
You can't because
the kids are waiting, right?

280
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:07,915
Go home early today.

281
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,043
It's a bummer.

282
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:14,338
How was it?

283
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:17,257
You had a free trial today.

284
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:20,219
This is my life every day.

285
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:22,679
I liked it even better.

286
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:27,935
My dream is to have a husband
who waits for me to come home from work

287
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:29,978
and cooks for me wearing an apron.

288
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:31,980
Really?

289
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,151
Right, Cheol-hui,
you heard about the interview, right?

290
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,195
I said yes right away.

291
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:43,033
It's like officially announcing
that we're a couple.

292
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:45,244
There's no reason for me to refuse.

293
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:47,079
I see.

294
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:51,959
I'll think about it carefully too.

295
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:54,503
What's there to think about?

296
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,588
As fast as lightning, you know?

297
00:20:58,298 --> 00:21:02,427
When you think for a long time,
random thoughts always butt in.

298
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:04,346
Okay.

299
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:07,099
- I'm off.
- See you.

300
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:49,182
San-i, do you miss your parents?

301
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:53,979
We have our uncle, so it's okay.

302
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:57,024
Still, uncles and dads are different.

303
00:21:58,191 --> 00:22:00,944
Where is your dad? Has he called you?

304
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:04,573
The kids might become
a hindrance to your future.

305
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:09,119
I'm living like a human being
thanks to the twins.

306
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:27,054
AN ANONYMOUS REPORT

307
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:28,221
<i>Reporting.</i>

308
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:32,684
<i>I suspect bribery in the Marriage
Morale Boost Team of Injeong City.</i>

309
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:34,853
<i>Please conduct a thorough investigation.</i>

310
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:47,699
What are all these?

311
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:54,456
You said you wanted to eat
quail eggs jangjorim yesterday.

312
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,626
I'm so touched.

313
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:00,879
But it's cheating to bring gifts.

314
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:02,714
Tell me honestly.

315
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:04,007
Is this a bribe?

316
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:07,719
What do you want that made you pack
a boxed meal I'd like?

317
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,389
It's nothing much.

318
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:16,311
It's about the interview with In-a.

319
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:20,607
What do you think about it?

320
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:24,569
Honestly? Or as the person
in charge of you?

321
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:29,866
Let's hear the latter version first.

322
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:33,370
You're just getting to know each other,

323
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:36,623
but it might affect you
and your niece and nephew's image.

324
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:39,459
We must review and work out the details.

325
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,045
I see.

326
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:46,466
Then what about the honest version?

327
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:56,935
If it's officially announced
that you two are a couple,

328
00:23:57,978 --> 00:24:00,814
I can go back to where I was

329
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:04,442
and get back my peaceful life,
so I'd like that.

330
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:12,284
I'm glad things worked out like this.

331
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:17,581
Yes, I'm ready.

332
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:19,207
You know my conditions.

333
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:22,544
Okay. Bye.

334
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:34,764
Mr. Choi.

335
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:36,016
Mr. Yang.

336
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:40,604
I feel sleepy around this hour.

337
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:44,691
I worked out on the stairwell,
and now I'm fully awake.

338
00:24:44,774 --> 00:24:47,444
I feel healthier too.

339
00:24:47,527 --> 00:24:50,530
I'll return to work now.

340
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:51,948
- Sure.
- Work.

341
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:05,295
Excuse me.
Is this the Marriage Morale Boost Team?

342
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:06,671
Yes, it is.

343
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:09,966
Welcome, director.

344
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,843
It's nice to see you.

345
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:13,929
I've been waiting for you.

346
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:16,556
Do you know him, Mr. Yang?

347
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,725
Of course I do.

348
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:22,187
He is the director of the documentary

349
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:24,773
that made Bong Cheol-hui a superstar.

350
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:27,776
You're the director?

351
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:29,027
What brings you here?

352
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:32,155
- Oh, it's...
- I highly recommended him.

353
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:35,909
Dyan Group wants to go all out
and make a sequel to the documentary.

354
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:37,827
They want to strike while the iron is hot.

355
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:40,038
Wasn't there just an interview?

356
00:25:40,121 --> 00:25:41,957
That will be in the documentary too.

357
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:45,252
How could you turn it into
such a big project without telling me?

358
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:48,713
Goodness. I thought you'd be
the happiest. What's wrong?

359
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:50,924
Mr. Choi approved too.

360
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:52,384
Right, Mr. Choi?

361
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:55,470
Yes. Director, I look forward
to working with you.

362
00:25:55,553 --> 00:25:56,805
I look forward to it.

363
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:05,021
Hello.

364
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:07,315
You're from the parking management?

365
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,985
Yes, I'll go down in a minute.

366
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:12,696
Why is Mr. Yang being so assertive?

367
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:14,030
Excuse me.

368
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:22,497
Ms. Jeong, can I see you?

369
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:36,928
Is there anything different
about Mr. Yang lately?

370
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,556
In what way?

371
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:44,144
Well, it's just that he seems to be
strangely motivated lately.

372
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,147
Isn't working hard a good thing?

373
00:26:49,482 --> 00:26:53,153
Are you suspicious of Mr. Yang?

374
00:26:53,236 --> 00:26:55,030
You look like something's bugging you.

375
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:57,991
No, that's not it.

376
00:27:00,618 --> 00:27:01,536
It's nothing.

377
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:03,204
What was that?

378
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:05,248
Ms. Jeong.

379
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:12,047
The documentary might be
your final task here.

380
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:14,632
Let's cooperate until the end.

381
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:23,767
As the only daughter of Dyan Group,

382
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:26,019
you must get a lot of blind date offers.

383
00:27:26,102 --> 00:27:28,980
Why did you apply for
the Marriage Morale Boost Team?

384
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:32,484
I do get endless offers for blind dates.

385
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:36,738
But those blind dates
were business-oriented.

386
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:38,365
I had to choose someone

387
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:40,784
that would be suitable
for Dyan Group, not me.

388
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:44,913
But isn't that a more practical choice?

389
00:27:47,248 --> 00:27:48,375
It's boring.

390
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:51,169
I don't like the practical choice.

391
00:27:52,128 --> 00:27:55,048
I have a marriage fantasy, you see.

392
00:27:55,965 --> 00:27:57,592
- Let's go again.
- Excuse me.

393
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:01,930
Hello?

394
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:05,392
Oh, now?

395
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:09,104
<i>Oh In-a has the composure
that comes with money.</i>

396
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:11,731
<i>It does look cool.</i>

397
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:13,858
Okay, I understand.

398
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:16,277
I'm sorry.

399
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:18,113
We'll have to stop here today.

400
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:19,781
What?

401
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:22,409
But we just got here.

402
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:25,286
You wanted to go over
the on-site operations of Dyan Market too.

403
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,747
I wanted to, but my plan just changed.
I'm sorry.

404
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:29,290
Thank you. See you tomorrow.

405
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:32,419
But…

406
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:41,636
Ji-won, you're alone.

407
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:44,764
What's that document?

408
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:47,142
It's the QA list Mr. Yang requested.

409
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:50,228
Why are you back so early?

410
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:52,021
Didn't you go for the interview?

411
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:56,985
In-a suddenly had to go somewhere,
so we stopped halfway.

412
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:58,695
Oh, dear.

413
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:02,449
Where is Mr. Yang?

414
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:06,244
Mr. Yang answered a call
and left in a hurry.

415
00:29:14,794 --> 00:29:17,505
"How to prepare for emigration quickly"?

416
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,515
- See you again.
- See you again.

417
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:33,062
Gosh, Ms. Jeong. When did you come back?

418
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:35,565
I called you just now.

419
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:36,941
You called?

420
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:41,321
I left my phone at the café.

421
00:29:58,421 --> 00:30:01,049
Only this much? Goodness.

422
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:06,095
There are a lot
of fine boarding schools in the UK.

423
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:07,764
I guess.

424
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:11,059
You do know San-i likes soccer, right?

425
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:15,146
Anyway, I'm very glad
Cheol-hui is dating someone

426
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:17,524
as nice as you.

427
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:21,903
It doesn't look like he'll have a 50-50
marriage and end up divorced like me.

428
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:23,488
Of course not.

429
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:26,241
We're of a different genre.

430
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:30,787
You are helping me in the form of

431
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:32,872
a monthly subscription plan, right?

432
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:35,708
People like me who have a hard time
making ends meet

433
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:38,503
live in the genre of survival adventure.

434
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:47,011
Wouldn't that depend
on how you behave, Brother-in-law?

435
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:53,142
Then I'll prepare for emigration quickly.

436
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:57,689
The faster, the better.
Right, Sister-in-law?

437
00:31:40,106 --> 00:31:43,026
You look like you're dying to know,
Ms. Jeong.

438
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:46,446
Why did you meet with Cheol-hui's brother?

439
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:47,614
Does Cheol-hui know?

440
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:51,451
I hope you'll see it
as a thoughtful gesture for Cheol-hui,

441
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:53,453
since he'll be entering my world.

442
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:56,164
You should discuss it
with him first, at least.

443
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:58,791
You're basically paying him
to take back the kids.

444
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:01,920
Jeong Ha-na.

445
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:05,089
Stop acting like
you're living in a bubble.

446
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:09,677
Can't you see that this is better
for both Cheol-hui and the twins?

447
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:13,348
You and Gi-jun's marriage fell through

448
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:16,225
for practical reasons.

449
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:20,104
If you both believed your marriage
would be fine without money,

450
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:23,358
would you have become
so against marriage now?

451
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:28,988
Practical issues aren't
always about money.

452
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:32,533
Thinking the one marrying you
will live happily

453
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:34,452
because you're rich isn't right.

454
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:39,582
Cheol-hui wanted to be responsible
for his niece and nephew until the end.

455
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:42,293
He wanted someone
to share that responsibility.

456
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,754
That was when he didn't have a choice.

457
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:47,924
- That...
- Do you know why his brother divorced?

458
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:51,552
Living expenses, house chores,
and parenting.

459
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:54,389
They thought they'd be happy
if they split everything in half.

460
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:58,226
They call it a 50-50 marriage
nowadays, apparently.

461
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:02,355
But how long can that 50-50 marriage last?

462
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:06,567
The way they live,

463
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:09,946
one person won't be able
to afford their half entirely.

464
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:12,782
As of that moment,
their marriage is ruined.

465
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:14,617
They even abandon their kids.

466
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:18,871
When you get married,

467
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:22,208
difference in personality, habits,
and responsibilities…

468
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:25,920
I know all sorts of things
can become issues.

469
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:29,924
But I'll make sure
money doesn't become an issue.

470
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:36,639
And I want to start from scratch,
just the two of us.

471
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:41,602
I want to protect

472
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:44,856
my marriage fantasy too.

473
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:54,699
WHY YOU SHOULDN'T MARRY
WITHOUT MONEY

474
00:33:54,782 --> 00:33:57,410
I DID 50-50 MARRIAGE
THEN DIVORCED

475
00:33:57,493 --> 00:33:59,287
<i>When you get married,</i>

476
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:03,082
<i>you clash over dozens of trivial things.</i>

477
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:07,962
<i>If issues related to money disappear,</i>

478
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:12,133
<i>can your marriage fantasy last longer?</i>

479
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:18,097
I'll make sure
money doesn't become an issue.

480
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:22,518
And I want to start from scratch,
just the two of us.

481
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:25,146
I want to protect

482
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:28,107
my marriage fantasy too.

483
00:34:31,277 --> 00:34:33,946
I'll tell Cheol-hui
I met with his brother.

484
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:39,494
I don't want Cheol-hui
to feel apologetic to me from the start.

485
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:43,831
I'm sure Cheol-hui will feel grateful too.

486
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:49,712
As the person in charge,
please cooperate, for our future.

487
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:52,048
Okay?

488
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:02,100
How did she find Cheol-hui's brother?

489
00:35:03,726 --> 00:35:05,603
The second floor?

490
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:07,355
Hold on. The second floor…

491
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:08,856
Oh, yes. Okay.

492
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:12,693
"How to prepare for emigration quickly"?

493
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:28,918
Yeong-eun...

494
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:31,504
You can't suddenly quit
because you're dating.

495
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:34,465
I didn't say anything.

496
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:36,634
I'm glad it's not about that.

497
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:40,596
I was really worried
In-a would make you quit your job.

498
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:44,392
I'm the one who decides that.

499
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:47,019
I hope you can. I'll root for you.

500
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:50,273
What did you want to say?

501
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:51,774
Right.

502
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:55,194
Why did you get a divorce?

503
00:35:56,779 --> 00:35:58,239
What's wrong?

504
00:35:58,322 --> 00:36:00,158
Did you hurt yourself?

505
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:02,952
I suddenly remembered my marriage days.

506
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:06,831
What was it like?

507
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:12,336
We started off pretty rich,

508
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,130
so I thought we'd live very well.

509
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:17,008
But we fought over
the smallest things every day.

510
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:21,220
We had lived differently
for more than 20 years.

511
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:23,139
We tried to change that,

512
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:24,557
but in the end…

513
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:27,852
we ended up like this.

514
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:32,106
What did you want to change?

515
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,859
I told him to shower at night,

516
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:38,404
but he wanted to shower in the morning,
so we fought over that.

517
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:40,531
It seems like no big deal,

518
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:44,035
but you end up hating each other
and fight over where he leaves his socks.

519
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:47,788
I thought it wasn't worth living together
when we were so different.

520
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:55,296
Then why do you want to get married again?

521
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:01,594
I'm starting to understand now.

522
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:06,807
I got rid of the thought
that my partner must compromise for me.

523
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:10,686
I also learned
money didn't solve everything.

524
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:13,522
Then,

525
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:17,443
what kind of person
do you want to marry next?

526
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:23,324
Someone that I don't need to do
something with when we're together.

527
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:25,576
Someone comfortable to be with.

528
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:31,749
Someone comfortable to be with?

529
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:45,429
How do you display the imported goods?

530
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:47,932
We're having a promotional event.

531
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:50,309
You're lucky, Ms. Jeong.

532
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:52,270
That's out of nowhere.

533
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:54,355
The mayor wants to see you this afternoon.

534
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:56,899
What a nice man.

535
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:58,818
He sticks to his promises.

536
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:01,279
Are you that excited?

537
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:04,532
I'll let you know about my farewell party.

538
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:14,917
- We're filming Ms. Oh In-a nicely.
- Thank you.

539
00:38:17,753 --> 00:38:18,671
Let's go.

540
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:33,477
What's happening?

541
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:42,486
What's happening?

542
00:39:08,637 --> 00:39:10,389
You shouldn't stop so suddenly.

543
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:13,684
Why are you here now?

544
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:15,144
I should be asking you.

545
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:16,896
I…

546
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:20,816
I asked first.

547
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:24,987
I followed Mr. Yang.

548
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:28,866
Aren't you following him
since he's acting suspicious...

549
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:31,452
Be quiet.

550
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:00,606
Bye.

551
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:10,408
It's filmed nicely, right?

552
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:14,870
Yes. Dyan's PR team came over
and pressured me a lot.

553
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:38,727
I'm sorry that only my relationship
is working out smoothly.

554
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:41,272
Can I cry?

555
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:44,275
The farewell is right around the corner.

556
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:46,360
Goodness.

557
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:52,032
After Cheol-hui's documentary,
will Ha-na join another department?

558
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:53,451
Yes.

559
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:57,121
Why did you have to fall for Cheol-hui?

560
00:40:57,705 --> 00:41:00,124
I can't believe this.

561
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:02,042
You're blaming me for it?

562
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:07,715
Put this in first.

563
00:41:09,925 --> 00:41:12,636
<i>It's boring.</i>

564
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,972
<i>I don't like the practical choice.</i>

565
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:20,644
Do destined relationships really exist?

566
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:23,022
I didn't expect you to ask that, Mr. Han.

567
00:41:25,232 --> 00:41:29,695
Isn't marriage more or less the same,
even if people don't talk about it?

568
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:35,659
But my husband looks really cute,

569
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:36,744
so I don't get angry.

570
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:40,623
Even when I'm about to get angry,

571
00:41:40,706 --> 00:41:44,418
I look at his face,
and I lose my will to fight.

572
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:50,841
Would it be possible for Mr. Han?

573
00:41:52,718 --> 00:41:53,928
I don't want that either.

574
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:59,517
Director, are you interested
in getting married?

575
00:42:00,392 --> 00:42:02,019
I'm neither for nor against.

576
00:42:02,102 --> 00:42:03,521
Why not?

577
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:06,982
Fill out the application form
before you leave.

578
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:09,026
Mr. Yang, the form…

579
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:11,487
Where did he go?

580
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:13,948
- I don't know.
- He was here just now.

581
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:15,032
He was.

582
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:36,971
1 IMAGE FROM AN UNKNOWN USER

MARRIAGE MORALE BOOST TEAM
IS CORRUPT - DISSOLVE THE TEAM

584
00:42:56,448 --> 00:42:58,909
Hello, this is Yang Seung-gu.

585
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:02,830
I got the envelope you sent to me.

586
00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:06,041
You should've spent more
while you were at it.

587
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:08,335
That's not what I mean.

588
00:43:10,504 --> 00:43:11,714
I…

589
00:43:14,466 --> 00:43:15,467
Mr. Choi.

590
00:43:17,553 --> 00:43:19,179
Who were you calling?

591
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:22,391
Why suddenly…

592
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:27,229
How can you do this, Mr. Yang?

593
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:29,398
Don't tell me…

594
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:49,752
What…

595
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:58,719
SPONSORING INJEONG CITY HALL'S
MARRIAGE MORALE BOOST TEAM

596
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:01,639
I utilized my sales skills
after a long while,

597
00:44:02,389 --> 00:44:04,141
but bribery?

598
00:44:04,224 --> 00:44:06,352
I was just totally misunderstood.

599
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:09,980
I got Dyan Group

600
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:13,525
to sponsor our project.

601
00:44:14,526 --> 00:44:16,654
- A sponsorship?
- Yes.

602
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:19,239
Marriage is reality.

603
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:21,408
Some people start off with enough money,

604
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:23,202
but some don't.

605
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:26,538
Since In-a's company owns a supermarket,

606
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:28,415
I thought it was a good opportunity.

607
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:30,751
To those who believed in us and applied,

608
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:32,961
we might not be able to give them a lot,

609
00:44:33,045 --> 00:44:36,507
but it'd be great to provide them
with practical things at least.

610
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:41,178
Mr. Yang, you should've told us
stuff like that in advance.

611
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:43,931
Who sent such a letter?

612
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,100
I'm sorry I suspected you.

613
00:44:53,565 --> 00:44:57,945
You're doing such a great job,

614
00:44:58,028 --> 00:45:00,614
so it'd be nice
if you could stay on the current team.

615
00:45:00,697 --> 00:45:02,157
It's such a shame.

616
00:45:03,283 --> 00:45:05,953
But I thought you'd keep the promise

617
00:45:06,036 --> 00:45:07,871
you made to me.

618
00:45:07,955 --> 00:45:11,166
Of course. Promises are meant to be kept.

619
00:45:14,503 --> 00:45:15,504
Here.

620
00:45:22,469 --> 00:45:25,722
PERSONNEL TRANSFER

621
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:36,483
I prepared everything for you nicely.

622
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:39,445
So wrap everything up on your side too.

623
00:45:40,487 --> 00:45:41,655
Yes, sir.

624
00:46:08,974 --> 00:46:11,727
<i>The promotional article
will be released tomorrow.</i>

625
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:14,480
<i>The documentary will go on-air next week.</i>

626
00:46:14,563 --> 00:46:16,315
<i>I'll be transferring after two weeks.</i>

627
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:19,985
DEPARTMENT TRANSFER

628
00:46:20,068 --> 00:46:23,322
<i>The day of returning to my old life
is just around the corner.</i>

629
00:46:25,407 --> 00:46:29,453
<i>Then my love cells will
go back to normal too.</i>

630
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:37,669
Actually, until five years ago,
I worked as a firefighter.

631
00:46:38,253 --> 00:46:40,923
You must remember my sister forever.

632
00:46:41,006 --> 00:46:42,508
I never forgot her.

633
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:45,802
Because I blamed myself every day.

634
00:46:45,886 --> 00:46:48,722
I wanted to forget
because it was painful, but I couldn't.

635
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:56,104
<i>Yes, I hope Cheol-hui will be happy too.</i>

636
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:00,567
I should hurry.

637
00:47:05,447 --> 00:47:07,699
Uncle, you look cool today.

638
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:10,744
But aren't you going to style your hair?

639
00:47:10,827 --> 00:47:12,913
I did style it.

640
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:15,040
I see.

641
00:47:15,123 --> 00:47:16,667
Do you have another shoot today?

642
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:19,419
Yes. It's for a documentary today.

643
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:22,422
Is it because it's for a documentary?

644
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:25,425
Your face looks very realistic.

645
00:47:26,134 --> 00:47:27,636
What?

646
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:30,847
Wasn't the previous one for a drama?

647
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:33,934
What drama?

648
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:36,186
A soap opera.

649
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:38,522
Stop talking.

650
00:47:39,606 --> 00:47:42,776
Uncle, aren't you going
to style your hair?

651
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:45,445
I did style it.

652
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:47,781
- He did apparently.
- I see.

653
00:47:48,574 --> 00:47:50,617
Will you be back home late?

654
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:52,995
No, I'll come back as soon as it's over.

655
00:47:53,078 --> 00:47:56,957
No. You can take your time.

656
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:00,586
Ba-da and I will be fine.
Don't worry about us.

657
00:48:00,669 --> 00:48:02,212
Yes.

658
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:05,299
Are you living your second life
or something?

659
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:07,134
Okay. Go and play.

660
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:08,343
Okay.

661
00:48:12,097 --> 00:48:13,807
Cheol-hui, you're a good cook,

662
00:48:13,890 --> 00:48:16,101
so your bride will really like it.

663
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:19,521
How is it? Does this look decent?

664
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:21,607
It looks so delicious.

665
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:25,152
Do you plan to be in charge of
house chores when you get married?

666
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:27,404
I think that's what In-a wants.

667
00:48:27,487 --> 00:48:30,949
We're just getting to know each other.
We'll figure it out along the way.

668
00:48:31,033 --> 00:48:34,286
I have my life on the island,

669
00:48:34,369 --> 00:48:37,122
and my niece and nephew are precious too.

670
00:48:37,205 --> 00:48:40,667
Then what kind of married life
do you dream of?

671
00:48:42,294 --> 00:48:43,795
My married life?

672
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:47,299
We come home from work,

673
00:48:47,382 --> 00:48:50,302
talk about the day,
and have a meal together.

674
00:48:50,385 --> 00:48:52,804
We walk around the neighborhood
in slippers.

675
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:57,559
Someone who's fun and relaxing to be with.

676
00:48:57,643 --> 00:49:01,480
I want my marriage to be
filled with those ordinary days.

677
00:49:02,689 --> 00:49:07,235
Still, don't you have
a more romantic marriage fantasy?

678
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:10,656
We're going to be together forever,
not just date, so that's not important.

679
00:49:10,739 --> 00:49:13,700
You'll be disappointed
if you expect something special.

680
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:17,621
Someone who finds my downsides cute too.

681
00:49:17,704 --> 00:49:20,749
It's my dream to get married
to someone like that.

682
00:49:20,832 --> 00:49:22,959
- I see.
- Have a look at this.

683
00:49:24,002 --> 00:49:25,462
Will there be more blind dates?

684
00:49:28,173 --> 00:49:30,342
The next blind date is scheduled…

685
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:43,689
In-ah.

686
00:49:46,066 --> 00:49:50,070
Your coming here wasn't in the plan.

687
00:49:51,113 --> 00:49:52,280
Oh.

688
00:49:52,364 --> 00:49:55,158
It's better to have more shots
of me and Cheol-hui together.

689
00:49:56,284 --> 00:49:58,412
I can get to know Cheol-hui more too.

690
00:50:05,627 --> 00:50:07,754
The shoot is almost over today.

691
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:09,506
Let's just stick to the plan.

692
00:50:11,466 --> 00:50:13,719
I came from work and didn't even eat

693
00:50:13,802 --> 00:50:15,429
in order to get here quickly.

694
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:18,682
Are you really going to end it?

695
00:50:18,765 --> 00:50:22,436
Since you're here anyway,

696
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:27,107
why don't we film In-a and Cheol-hui
drinking and talking?

697
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,863
- Drinking and talking?
- Yes.

698
00:50:38,243 --> 00:50:40,412
- <i>The person you called is unavailable.</i>
- Goodness.

699
00:50:40,495 --> 00:50:42,122
Why aren't they picking up?

700
00:50:47,586 --> 00:50:48,920
What's wrong?

701
00:50:50,839 --> 00:50:55,886
Well, I didn't tell the twins
I was going to be late.

702
00:50:57,012 --> 00:50:59,473
They must still be waiting for me.

703
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:01,099
But they aren't picking up.

704
00:51:01,767 --> 00:51:03,685
I'm worried about them.

705
00:51:04,686 --> 00:51:06,605
I'll go to your place and check.

706
00:51:09,149 --> 00:51:11,318
Will you do that for me?

707
00:51:11,943 --> 00:51:12,944
Sure.

708
00:51:29,294 --> 00:51:30,879
Ba-da, San-i.

709
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:54,444

HA-NA

712
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:12,879
Let's toast.

713
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:15,841
- Okay. Cheers.
- Cheers.

714
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:20,387
Try this.

715
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:22,430
I cooked this for him just now.

716
00:52:22,514 --> 00:52:23,807
You made this yourself?

717
00:52:25,642 --> 00:52:27,269
It came out better than usual.

718
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:30,313
It's so delicious.

719
00:52:34,276 --> 00:52:37,696
- She didn't tell Cheol-hui.
- <i>The person you called is unavailable.</i>

720
00:52:37,779 --> 00:52:39,281
Oh In-a, seriously…

721
00:52:41,741 --> 00:52:44,619
<i>There are a lot
of fine boarding schools in the UK.</i>

722
00:52:44,703 --> 00:52:47,956
Then I'll prepare for emigration quickly.

723
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:52,752
The faster, the better.
Right, Sister-in-law?

724
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:54,212
Oh.

725
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:02,929
San-i, you like soccer.

726
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:06,349
I'm going to send you
to a boarding school in the UK.

727
00:53:07,893 --> 00:53:09,477
Are we going to the UK?

728
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:13,481
Will we not get to see Cheol-hui again?

729
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:15,734
No, you won't.

730
00:53:20,322 --> 00:53:24,159
Does Uncle know you came to take us?

731
00:53:24,242 --> 00:53:27,245
Of course. He was happy when I told him.

732
00:53:27,829 --> 00:53:29,497
You're lying.

733
00:53:29,581 --> 00:53:31,374
Cheol-hui needs to get married too.

734
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:33,752
You guys shouldn't get in the way.

735
00:53:33,835 --> 00:53:37,213
Uncle said he would live with us
even when he got married.

736
00:53:37,297 --> 00:53:39,966
How can we just leave like this?

737
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:42,177
Stop the car. I'm not going.

738
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:43,261
Hey.

739
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:47,140
I'm not going.

740
00:54:04,574 --> 00:54:06,117
It's okay. Don't cry.

741
00:54:07,452 --> 00:54:12,582
San-i and Ba-da,
you guys like flying, right?

742
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:16,503
Board the plane
with the flight attendant here.

743
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:19,464
Once you arrive, a teacher
from the school will pick you up.

744
00:54:20,048 --> 00:54:22,175
Aren't you coming with us?

745
00:54:22,258 --> 00:54:24,386
No. I'll join you later.

746
00:54:24,469 --> 00:54:26,179
You guys go ahead.

747
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:28,431
Then I won't go.

748
00:54:29,182 --> 00:54:30,392
What?

749
00:54:30,475 --> 00:54:33,895
Sir, the gates will close soon.

750
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:35,480
Okay, I just need a moment.

751
00:54:36,439 --> 00:54:37,440
Goodness.

752
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:43,238
If I must go,
I wanna at least say goodbye to Uncle.

753
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:46,616
What's wrong with you?

754
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:48,743
Get up now.

755
00:54:48,827 --> 00:54:50,870
- I'm not going either.
- What?

756
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:54,290
You guys must leave
for your uncle to be happy.

757
00:54:54,374 --> 00:54:56,793
- Stand up now. Please wait.
- I'm not going.

758
00:54:56,876 --> 00:54:58,878
I'm not going.

759
00:54:58,962 --> 00:55:01,464
- I'm not going.
- Get up.

760
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:03,383
Bong Cheol-hui never said that.

761
00:55:17,272 --> 00:55:19,482
Who are you? Do you know them?

762
00:55:22,402 --> 00:55:24,654
Guys, let's go. Cheol-hui is waiting.

763
00:55:25,363 --> 00:55:27,490
Goodness. Wait.

764
00:55:29,284 --> 00:55:32,245
I am their dad.

765
00:55:35,206 --> 00:55:38,084
She is Cheol-hui's real girlfriend.

766
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:40,879
She's going to live with us later!

767
00:55:42,797 --> 00:55:44,674
If you're their dad,
you shouldn't do this.

768
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:46,760
If you accepted the money,
take care of them.

769
00:55:48,053 --> 00:55:49,262
What do you know?

770
00:55:51,139 --> 00:55:52,307
If you were unashamed,

771
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:54,559
you wouldn't have taken them
behind his back.

772
00:55:55,685 --> 00:55:57,896
<i>Dongeun Air to London, UK,</i>

773
00:55:57,979 --> 00:56:02,067
<i>the gate for SU4340 will close soon.</i>

774
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:03,151
Darn it.

775
00:56:03,234 --> 00:56:04,944
<i>Dongeun Air to London, UK…</i>

776
00:56:05,028 --> 00:56:08,156
- You ruined Cheol-hui's life too.
- <i>It will close soon.</i>

777
00:56:09,908 --> 00:56:12,535
Don't worry. I'll be responsible for him.

778
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:15,163
<i>Go to Gate 15.</i>

779
00:56:15,246 --> 00:56:16,664
You must've been startled.

780
00:56:17,290 --> 00:56:18,458
Don't cry.

781
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:20,710
Don't cry.

782
00:56:22,003 --> 00:56:24,339
Can you two toast?

783
00:56:24,422 --> 00:56:25,507
Okay.

784
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:27,801
- Cheers.
- Cheers, yes.

785
00:56:37,185 --> 00:56:38,686
Can you toast one more time?

786
00:56:39,771 --> 00:56:41,314
- It's for the shoot.
- Yes.

787
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:43,942
Cheol-hui, have another glass.

788
00:56:49,531 --> 00:56:52,951
In-a, give me that. I'll drink it.

789
00:57:15,890 --> 00:57:19,144
I hope you'll see it
as a thoughtful gesture for Cheol-hui

790
00:57:19,227 --> 00:57:21,062
since he'll be entering my world.

791
00:57:21,146 --> 00:57:23,022
I want to protect

792
00:57:24,232 --> 00:57:25,817
my marriage fantasy too.

793

<i>Marriage cannot be accomplished
with just one person's fantasy.</i>

794

<i>Money doesn't make
a marriage complete either.</i>

795
00:57:39,038 --> 00:57:42,709
<i>A marriage is maintained only when</i>

796
00:57:43,418 --> 00:57:45,336
<i>you can accept your partner's downsides</i>

797
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:47,213
<i>and difficult situations.</i>

798
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:50,508
<i>Because marriage is reality.</i>

PERSONNEL TRANSFER

800
00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:03,480
I prepared everything for you nicely.

801
00:58:03,563 --> 00:58:06,441
So wrap everything up on your side too.

802
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:08,651
Yes, sir.

803
00:58:15,909 --> 00:58:17,160
Cheers.

804
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:22,248
If we drink this,
we'll officially start dating.

805
00:58:22,832 --> 00:58:25,168
We'll be an official couple.

806
00:58:25,251 --> 00:58:27,962
It's cemented. You can't go back on it.

807
00:58:28,796 --> 00:58:30,632
Dang, ding, dong.

808
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:36,721
Hey.

809
00:58:47,023 --> 00:58:48,566
- Bong Cheol-hui.
- Yes?

810
00:58:50,985 --> 00:58:52,445
I'm against this match.

811
00:58:56,908 --> 00:58:58,826
I can't send you off with her.

812
00:59:01,496 --> 00:59:03,414
Jeong Ha-na, what's wrong?

813
00:59:05,667 --> 00:59:06,960
Ha-na.

This isn't what you promised.

818

What is this about?

819
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:39,701
Ask In-a to explain.

820
00:59:45,915 --> 00:59:48,251
Explain properly. What are you getting at?

821
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:50,628
Didn't you hear?

822
00:59:51,337 --> 00:59:53,047
I'm against this match.

823
00:59:54,007 --> 00:59:55,842
I can't let Cheol-hui do this.

824
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:57,802
So why not?

825
00:59:58,386 --> 01:00:00,680
