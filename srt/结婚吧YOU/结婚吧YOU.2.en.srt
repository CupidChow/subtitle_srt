ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND PLACES ARE FICTITIOUS

00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:39,289
FILMING OF CHILD ACTORS DONE
UNDER BROADCASTING GUIDELINES

3
00:00:46,045 --> 00:00:49,007
{\an8}You can stay single by choice.

4
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:51,134
{\an8}I choose to get married.

5
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:53,386
{\an8}You said I needed to be qualified, right?

6
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:59,100
{\an8}Then let's see if I'm qualified
to get married or not.

7
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:02,645
{\an8}- Okay, I'll give it my best shot.
- Okay.

8
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:05,315
{\an8}That's it. Get back to work.

9
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:08,359
{\an8}Wait, Cheol-hui.
How about a cup of coffee?

10
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:10,111
But…

11
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:15,492
Ha-na.

12
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:23,833
<i>There's no one at this place
who could call me by my name</i>

13
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:25,835
<i>in such a friendly way.</i>

14
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:41,017
It's been a while.

15
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:47,607
What brings you here?

16
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,652
I was transferred.

17
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,029
I see.

18
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:57,075
But you don't seem very surprised.

19
00:01:57,158 --> 00:01:59,160
I tried calling earlier
because I was worried.

20
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:03,373
<i>Because it's a small world,</i>

21
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:08,211
<i>I did think there was
a chance we'd cross paths again.</i>

22
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:13,007
<i>Although I never thought
today would be that day.</i>

23
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:16,761
- Ha-na...
- You can't call me that anymore.

24
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:17,971
What?

25
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:19,472
Anyway, this is perfect.

26
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:21,599
Let's consider this our closure.

27
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:23,560
Our closure?

28
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:35,905
I should've done that three years ago.
Apologies for the tardiness.

29
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,742
Ha-na, what's wrong? What happened?

30
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:42,036
Well?

31
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:46,499
Oh, right. Let me introduce you.

32
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:50,879
- We're getting married.
- Yeah… What?

33
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,301
We're getting married?

34
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:02,473
I see. You're getting married.

35
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:08,146
I apologize for the intrusion.

36
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:10,815
Yes. Right. Sure.

37
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:14,193
I owe a great debt to Ha-na.

38
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:15,612
Really?

39
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,780
Then I guess you deserved to be slapped.

40
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:21,910
Yes. It was quite a slap.

41
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:25,371
I think we can consider my debt paid now.

42
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:30,001
I'm sure occupying the same space
will lead to a lot of interactions.

43
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:33,212
I hope we can get along, Ms. Jeong Ha-na.

44
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:35,465
Yes, I look forward to it.

45
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,593
It was a pleasure. Until next time.

46
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:39,928
Me?

47
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:43,348
I doubt we'll ever meet again.

48
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:47,393
I think we will.

49
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:48,811
What?

50
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:50,980
Well then.

51
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:02,700
<i>There's no way a single slap could provide
complete closure for the past.</i>

52
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:05,286
<i>But, at the very least,</i>

53
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:10,416
<i>I wanted him to know that he couldn't call
me by my name like that, ever again.</i>

54
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,293
Ha-na?

55
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:16,756
Ha-na!

56
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,549
Yes?

57
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:19,550
Are you okay?

58
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:21,344
Yes, I'm fine.

59
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:24,889
If you're still upset,
I could go and beat him up.

60
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:26,557
No, that won't be necessary.

61
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:28,726
I can just tell from his vibe.

62
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:31,479
He's with a pyramid scheme, right?

63
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:35,191
- What…
- Chief Park got screwed over, too.

64
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:38,111
He's acting all gentlemanly
to sell you some snake oil.

65
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:40,822
No, it's nothing like that.

66
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:45,368
By the way,

67
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,705
when are we getting married?

68
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:53,501
I said that because I was
so flustered earlier.

69
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:55,003
Whatever!

70
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:56,629
Let's hurry up and set a date.

71
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:59,590
I never knew how talented
our civil servants were.

72
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:02,635
I submit the form to get married,
and you solve it on the same day?

73
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:04,512
That's amazing.

74
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:06,264
Well, it's...

75
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:10,184
With full faith in you, I'll hurry back
and tell everyone the good news.

76
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:11,561
Then return to get hitched.

77
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:14,856
Until then, you should plan the wedding.

78
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:16,816
- Wait…
- I almost forgot.

79
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:20,945
Next time, I'll bring some
of that homemade food you liked.

80
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:22,780
I'll make some side dishes and stuff.

81
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:25,992
I saw your slap earlier.
To make it sting even more,

82
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:27,702
you'll need the power of good food.

83
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,830
We're all set. I'm off.

84
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,070
It's nice to meet you.

85
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:04,614
I'm Choi Gi-jun, your new team manager.

86
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,742
- Nice to meet you.
- Welcome!

87
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:11,245
My goodness.
We've been waiting for you forever.

88
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:13,498
Are you married, Mr. Choi?

89
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:17,376
Right. It's the most important question
in the Marriage Morale Boost Team.

90
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,590
No, I'm still single.

91
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:26,344
Then how about handing in an application?

92
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:29,972
How is the mayor's assignment
coming along?

93
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,268
Are you talking about Mr. Bong Cheol-hui?

94
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:36,854
Yes. That Mr. Bong.

95
00:06:38,397 --> 00:06:40,733
Do you already have some good news for us?

96
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:44,821
No, I don't.

97
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:47,406
We just received his application form.

98
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,326
Any noteworthy details?

99
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:54,539
It seems he was hesitant
because of his young niece and nephew.

100
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:56,707
Then,

101
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:59,669
it won't be easy for him
to come off of the island just for a date.

102
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:00,837
That's true.

103
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,213
I'll take care of that.

104
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:05,299
Okay, thank you.

105
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:08,678
We also need some applicants
from the general public. How's that going?

106
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:13,057
We're already promoting it
on the official city website.

107
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:15,560
And what about the application forms?

108
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:17,437
We also need a questionnaire.

109
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,357
Mr. Han, can you draft one
tailored for the 20s and 30s crowd?

110
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,359
Yes, sir. I'll give it my best shot.

111
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:26,821
The rest of the team can
review it afterwards and give their input.

112
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:28,406
Let's end today's meeting here.

113
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:30,408
- Sure. Thank you.
- Thank you, everyone.

114
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:33,119
- Goodness.
- Be careful.

115
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,166
Ms. Jeong.

116
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:45,715
Why don't we have Mr. Bong stay
in our staff housing for the time being?

117
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:47,717
Staff housing?

118
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,470
Yes, it'll save him the travel time

119
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,805
and make his life a bit easier for him.

120
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,515
I'm sure there's an empty unit.

121
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:56,809
Okay. I'll look into it.

122
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,650
Thank you.

123
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:06,861
Come again.

124
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:16,871
I heard Choi Gi-jun is
your new team manager.

125
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,165
Yeah.

126
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:21,918
That's it?

127
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,087
What else could there be?

128
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,255
I mean, that bastard…

129
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:30,218
He didn't say anything to you?
And you're fine with it?

130
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:32,512
I got closure with a slap.

131
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:33,554
You slapped him?

132
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:36,224
That's unbelievable. You slapped him?

133
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:38,392
I should've done it ages ago.

134
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:41,896
Wow. When did you become so cool?

135
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:44,482
It's all thanks to you.
You taught me well.

136
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:48,861
This won't do.
Maybe we go to a pickup bar tonight?

137
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:51,239
No, this is
my first singing lesson in forever.

138
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:54,784
And aren't you tired of picking up guys?

139
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,994
How can I find a husband without sampling?

140
00:08:57,078 --> 00:09:00,081
Husband? You were dying
to get divorced when you had one.

141
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:01,791
I only have one under my belt.

142
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:04,835
And they say, "The more, the better,"
when it comes to men.

143
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:09,924
Aren't you getting tired of that?

144
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:12,051
Go home and cook yourself a meal.

145
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:13,970
The food here has such rich flavors.

146
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:18,182
I know the MSG makes it taste rich, but…

147
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:19,809
How much do I owe you?

148
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:22,895
Wait.

149
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:23,980
What?

150
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:25,982
My phone.

151
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,445
FROM MAYOR IM GU-SIK

152
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:37,827
How did I forget this?

153
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:48,588
I thought you went home already.

154
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:50,590
I left this behind.

155
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:53,050
Okay. See you tomorrow.

156
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:54,135
See you.

157
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:58,973
Sir.

158
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:00,182
Yes?

159
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:03,853
The mayor promised me

160
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:06,439
a department transfer
if I succeeded with Mr. Bong.

161
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:08,399
I'm aware of that.

162
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:09,483
Good night.

163
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:13,487
Ha-na.

164
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:23,831
What happened back then…

165
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,890
I don't feel a thing anymore.

166
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:51,651
No matter what you do…

167
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:59,408
I don't feel any emotion of any kind.

168
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,371
Am I too late?

169
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:07,833
I'm actually thankful for what you did.

170
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:11,921
If that didn't happen three years ago,

171
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:14,173
I would've never realized
what I really want.

172
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:21,931
I now know it's not marriage, at least.

173
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:52,378
Gi-jun.

174
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,714
I promise to make you happy.

175
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:57,716
Okay.

176
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:21,115
Uncle! Where did my underwear go?

177
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:23,200
How would he know that?

178
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:24,952
Stop fighting, you two!

179
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,343
Hey, Ha-na.

180
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,471
<i>Hey, Cheol-hui. Are you all packed?</i>

181
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:46,182
The apartment comes
with most basic necessities.

182
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,476
You just need to pack
a few changes of clothes.

183
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:50,102
Okay, but...

184
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:52,229
<i>Ba-da and San-i
are coming with you, right?</i>

185
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:53,981
Yes, but...

186
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:55,441
<i>Then, I'll see you tomorrow.</i>

187
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:58,486
Hello?

188
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:01,030
Hello?

189
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:06,452
She just says what she has to say
and hangs up?

190
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:10,164
Did she learn her manners from wolves?

191
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:19,840
Who am I packing all this for?
It's all useless.

192
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:24,345
Take this out. Take this out, too.
All useless.

193
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:28,891
Uncle! Where in the world is my underwear?

194
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:31,560
Check the second drawer.

195
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,562
Second one from the bottom.

196
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:50,955
Who could that be?

197
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:53,165
Who is it?

198
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:58,879
Yes?

199
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,550
Oh, I was just on my way back
from an out-of-office meeting.

200
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:04,218
I wanted to lend a hand.

201
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:09,056
Checking in on my team members is
a part of my duties.

202
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:18,023
What's wrong with him?

203
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:20,442
It's not bad.

204
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:23,237
Where should I start?

205
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:27,449
There's nothing for you to do.
It's my project. I'll take care of it.

206
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:29,618
It's our department's project.

207
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,120
Two will be faster than one.

208
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:33,747
I'm already done.

209
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:38,377
Still, is there anything I can do?

210
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:40,713
Can you…

211
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:49,013
I used to change
the bulbs at your place, too.

212
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,351
It's done.

213
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:03,360
Then you should clock out.

214
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:15,623
Wait.

215
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:18,500
If you're free,
we could have dinner together.

216
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:21,795
I should get going.

217
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,145
What is all this?

218
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:40,314
Are you trying
to make our bellies explode?

219
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:42,399
A full belly is essential for dating.

220
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:47,321
So, are you moving in with
that pretty young lady from last time?

221
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:50,616
Who knows? I'll know when I get there.

222
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:51,909
Don't come back.

223
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:56,080
This is your chance.
Get married and settle on the mainland.

224
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:58,374
You don't need to worry.

225
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:00,209
Please take good care of the island

226
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:02,920
on my behalf while I'm on the mainland.

227
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:04,171
Sure.

228
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:08,175
BONG JIN-SIK
LEE GYEONG-SUK

229
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:17,643
It's been a while, hasn't it?

230
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,441
Your son, Bong Cheol-hui…

231
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:28,737
has made up his mind.

232
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:32,825
Watch over me.

233
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:44,545
<i>This is the address.
See you there tomorrow.</i>

234
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:30,466
Cheol-hui.

235
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,468
Hey, Ha-na. When did you get here?

236
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:34,511
I've been here since yesterday,

237
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,306
waiting for our Ba-da and San-i.

238
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:40,225
I missed you, too.

239
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:41,852
Is that so?

240
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:48,275
But what is all that?

241
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:50,778
Oh, this?

242
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,529
It's nothing special.

243
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:54,740
Just some dried fish the kids like

244
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:57,743
and a few wild green side dishes
from the aunties.

245
00:17:57,826 --> 00:18:00,120
The ones that you enjoyed last time.

246
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:05,918
You'll have to stay here
for a long time to finish them all.

247
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:07,127
Is that okay?

248
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:08,337
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

249
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:12,549
I brought the kids because you insisted,

250
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:15,260
but do I need them here to get married?

251
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:17,638
It's a school break anyway.

252
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:21,183
You can take care of doctor visits
and all other mainland errands in one go.

253
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:24,853
I see you thought this through.

254
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:28,482
But it's just until
the end of their break.

255
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:30,609
They have to go back
to school in the spring.

256
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,987
Of course, just during the school break.

257
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:39,493
But if things don't work out
for me by then,

258
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:42,329
you'll stay by my side forever, right?

259
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:45,165
What? That won't happen.

260
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:46,875
I told you to trust me.

261
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,252
Let me take this.

262
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:49,545
You don't need to.

263
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,100
Come on in.

264
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:06,478
Wow.

265
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:10,149
Wow. Is this where we'll be living?

266
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:11,358
It's so nice.

267
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:14,153
Are we really allowed to live here?

268
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:15,237
Of course.

269
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:18,615
- I want to try it out.
- Don't run!

270
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:20,659
It's so big.

271
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,287
But, Ha-na,

272
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:25,581
isn't this too much?

273
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:28,625
I used my influence
to make it especially nice for you.

274
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:31,128
I'm so grateful,
I don't even know what to do.

275
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,968
I want to sleep with you.

276
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:39,928
Where are you going to sleep?

277
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:44,141
I should sleep in my own bed at my place.

278
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:47,686
Then you better come over often.

279
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,813
Okay.

280
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:51,315
I'm hungry, Uncle.

281
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:53,442
Okay. I'll whip you up something.

282
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:56,361
Chinese food is customary
for a move-in day, no?

283
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:59,698
Chinese food? Please.
A home-cooked meal is the best.

284
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:02,159
You should join us.
I'll make it in a jiffy.

285
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:03,702
I should get going now.

286
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,123
Take your coat off.

287
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:12,377
They say you must share meals
to become a real family.

288
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:15,923
That's right.

289
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:40,447
This is so tasty.

290
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:51,041
San-i and Ba-da really like you.

291
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:52,668
I'm glad.

292
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:58,048
That was such a delicious meal.

293
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,218
I thought that you maybe starved
for three days.

294
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,096
Stop by whenever you want
some homemade food.

295
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:05,514
Sure. Sounds great.

296
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:19,278
Oh, right.

297
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:21,697
Let me introduce you.
We're getting married.

298
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,212
Leaving already, baby?

299
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:39,423
Can't you stay a bit longer?

300
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:42,342
What the…

301
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:46,346
He looks so familiar.

302
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:48,724
Hold on, Cheol-hui.

303
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:51,143
Isn't he that man from last time?

304
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:52,352
The pyramid scheme man!

305
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:56,857
Pyramid scheme?

306
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:58,483
Wait...

307
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:01,695
What are you doing here?

308
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:03,905
Do you still have
snake oil left to sell? Well?

309
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,907
Snake oil? Me?

310
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:10,162
I guess that slap wasn't painful enough.

311
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:12,414
Still not thinking straight? Well?

312
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:17,461
Do you know what Ha-na,
my future bride, does for work?

313
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:21,089
She is a civil servant.
A government official!

314
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:23,467
Do you know what that means?

315
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:26,344
If you try to pull another con,

316
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:30,265
the government will step in!

317
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:36,480
Hello, I'm Team Manager Choi Gi-jun
of the Marriage Morale Boost Team.

318
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:38,940
Right, so stop trying
to bust up this marriage!

319
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:39,941
Cheol-hui.

320
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:42,611
Not "bust" but "boost."

321
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:44,821
Right, so why is he trying to bust that?

322
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:47,157
Boost…

323
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:49,242
Morale boost?

324
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:52,454
He's my team manager.

325
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:53,538
What?

326
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:58,001
Team manager?

327
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:02,214
I think the lack of a proper introduction
led to a misunderstanding.

328
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:05,842
I wanted to thank you for entrusting
our team with your marital matchmaking.

329
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,512
Yes, sir.

330
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:12,724
Right, and I live in Unit 205
in this building.

331
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:15,560
I moved in yesterday.

332
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:18,438
I couldn't find a place
because my transfer was so sudden.

333
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:23,026
Feel free to let me know
if there's anything you need.

334
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:26,238
No need. Ms. Jeong has been
taking such good care of me.

335
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:27,989
Anyhow, thank you so much.

336
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,660
Are you leaving now?

337
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,204
Yes. I'll see you on Monday.

338
00:23:37,415 --> 00:23:39,000
Right. Sorry about earlier.

339
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:41,128
Wait for me!

340
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:54,266
As you can see, the application has been
streamlined and divided

341
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:57,018
into education level, occupation,
salary, car ownership,

342
00:23:57,102 --> 00:24:00,021
and housing type to ensure easy analysis.

343
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:04,734
This feels a bit qualifications-heavy.

344
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:09,739
This isn't any different from companies
that make matches based on ranking.

345
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:13,160
- Right.
- I see.

346
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:19,624
Then, Ms. Jeong, you can revise
the questionnaire portion.

347
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:23,461
Has anyone applied
to have a date with Mr. Bong?

348
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:25,630
A few have, and we're reviewing them.

349
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:28,758
Mr. Bong Cheol-hui

350
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:31,178
needs to start strong, you know.

351
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:33,096
Exactly.

352
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,515
We can't exactly hold
a good luck ritual for him.

353
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:36,933
My thoughts exactly.

354
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:39,728
This has to go well.

355
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:43,398
WHO IS BONG CHEOL-HUI?
THE SUPERMAN OF CHEONGDO

356
00:24:48,695 --> 00:24:50,906
My goodness. This is unbelievable.

357
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:54,784
Goodness me. Her ideal type is
above 180 cm and a DINK.

358
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:57,704
They all make so much money.

359
00:24:57,787 --> 00:24:59,497
I make more than her.

360
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:01,249
Right.

361
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,043
What's this now?

362
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:07,505
She asked, "Will we receive some sort
of financial aid if we're successful?"

363
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:11,676
This applicant asked,
"Can we have the date at my shop?"

364
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,012
What's wrong with these people?

365
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:17,098
This is a serious matter.
They shouldn't use it like that.

366
00:25:18,516 --> 00:25:22,562
Sniffles, you shouldn't date
anyone like this, okay?

367
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:27,484
It'll be a lot of work, but it seems
we need to conduct in-person interviews.

368
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:30,862
That's the only way we'll know
if they're serious or not.

369
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:39,412
It must be uncomfortable
to work with Mr. Choi.

370
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:42,165
That was him, right?

371
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:46,169
You know, the bastard you told me about
back on the island.

372
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:48,672
Yes.

373
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:53,802
I guess I wasn't completely wrong.

374
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:56,096
He did bust up a marriage.

375
00:25:58,598 --> 00:26:00,016
You were awesome.

376
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:02,978
You didn't avoid it and faced it head-on.

377
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:04,729
So awesome.

378
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:12,654
I thought I was emotionally over it,

379
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:16,449
but I got so angry
when he popped out of nowhere.

380
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:20,036
The heart will always have its way.
It's okay.

381
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:25,375
Anyway, if I successfully find you
a match,

382
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:27,043
I can escape this department

383
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:29,879
and return to my peaceful life.

384
00:26:30,463 --> 00:26:32,257
So please, review this carefully.

385
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:34,509
What is this?

386
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:37,429
A questionnaire?

387
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:39,014
Credentials are important,

388
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:41,891
but so is one's approach to marital life.

389
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:44,144
So I came up with
this "Would you rather?" game.

390
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:49,107
I thought finding out about one's values
was a good place to start.

391
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:51,693
Okay. Sure.

392
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:55,238
- So, please fill this out for me.
- Okay.

393
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:07,375
- Excuse me for a moment.
- Sure.

394
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:16,760
What about all this?

395
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:18,553
Go.

396
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:21,348
- Go on.
- Are you sure you can handle it?

397
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:23,475
- Go on.
- Geez.

398
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:25,518
Bye.

399
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:33,068
Someone who needs their alone time.

400
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:36,613
Or someone who always wants
to be together.

401
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:40,533
Someone who needs their alone time.

402
00:27:41,659 --> 00:27:45,497
Someone who enjoys special events
with their partner.

403
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:49,292
Or someone who enjoys sharing
their everyday life with their partner.

404
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:52,212
SOMEONE WHO ENJOYS SHARING
EVERYDAY LIFE WITH THEIR PARTNER

405
00:27:52,295 --> 00:27:54,422
Someone who empathizes.

406
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:57,384
Or someone who solves problems.

407
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:01,679
Empathy.

408
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:03,515
WHAT IS MARRIAGE TO ME?

409
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:05,141
MARRIAGE IS…

410
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:07,894
What is marriage to me?

411
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:12,482
Well…

412
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:19,656
- Are you done?
- What?

413
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:21,658
Just a second.

414
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:31,084
Okay.

415
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:33,920
Come by for a meal later.

416
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:37,215
I think I'll end up working late today.

417
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:43,096
Great. You filled it all out.

418
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:44,264
Thanks.

419
00:28:45,765 --> 00:28:47,142
Get back safely.

420
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:49,227
Thanks. Don't forget to eat.

421
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:52,188
- Yes, sir.
- Have a good one.

422
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:55,900
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

423
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:02,073
Is the Bong Cheol-hui project
coming along?

424
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:04,951
Yes, sir. We're preparing
for the first match.

425
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:11,916
Let me ask you something.
You were happily working overseas,

426
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,294
so why did you apply for this transfer?

427
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:16,504
The timing felt right.

428
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:19,299
I couldn't put it off anymore.

429
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:21,634
Timing…

430
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:26,806
All right, I have high hopes for you
since you volunteered for the job.

431
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:32,145
If we get more applicants,
love will flourish throughout Injeong,

432
00:29:32,228 --> 00:29:35,732
and it'll warm the hearts
of all of us, don't you agree?

433
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:38,693
Yes, sir. I'll give it my best shot.

434
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:40,111
Good.

435
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:43,656
Mr. Choi, give it all you got. Okay?

436
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:48,369
Ms. Lee A-reum.

437
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,000
- It's nice to meet you.
- Hello.

438
00:29:55,710 --> 00:30:00,256
Tell us, was there a particular reason
why you applied for this program?

439
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:05,804
To meet someone right for me.

440
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:07,680
I see.

441
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:11,434
Then what do you think
about Mr. Bong Cheol-hui?

442
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:15,563
Well…

443
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:18,274
By chance,

444
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:21,402
are you A-reum the YouTuber?

445
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,239
- That's me.
- Really?

446
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:26,574
What? This is incredible.

447
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:29,118
I watched one of your videos
before bed yesterday.

448
00:30:31,412 --> 00:30:33,039
This is crazy. Unbelievable.

449
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:34,916
I'm a real fan.

450
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:37,544
- Promotion…
- What?

451
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:41,714
She's doing it to promote her channel.
To promote herself.

452
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:43,758
Oh, promotion.

453
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:46,052
All right.

454
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:09,033
What are we going to do?

455
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:11,202
Should we just start over?

456
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:14,205
Don't we have one more?

457
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:17,000
We do. Ms. Cha Min-ji.

458
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:19,419
But she said she'd be a bit late.

459
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:23,631
Excuse me.

460
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:42,650
I feel like the bags under my eyes
are dragging on the floor.

461
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:47,572
But still, we got one.
It feels like we accomplished something.

462
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:51,826
I hope she and Cheol-hui are a good match.

463
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:54,704
I know, right?

464
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,839
It must be something fun.

465
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:06,549
"Mission complete."

466
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:14,515
It's not clean at all,
yet he says he's done cleaning.

467
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:20,897
He is quite high-maintenance.

468
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:24,275
What?

469
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:26,444
What now?

470
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:28,863
He's here to pick me up.

471
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:30,031
Wow.

472
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:32,075
Wait, Ms. Lee.

473
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:34,452
The bags under your eyes
have suddenly disappeared.

474
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:39,791
Don't be ridiculous.

475
00:32:39,874 --> 00:32:41,501
I am feeling a bit envious.

476
00:32:42,251 --> 00:32:45,922
That's why you two should
also get married as soon as possible.

477
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:57,392
I'm home.

478
00:33:02,605 --> 00:33:05,775
<i>Sometimes, I imagine
what it would be like.</i>

479
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,868
Welcome home. You must be hungry.

480
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:17,537
Just a second.

481
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:22,166
That smells so good.

482
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:24,043
It's cold out, isn't it?

483
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:27,547
<i>The smell of a stew that tickles my nose.</i>

484
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:29,298
Eggs, just like how you like them.

485
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:32,677
<i>The smell of a warm home-cooked meal.</i>

486
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:36,848
<i>Feeling the warmth in the air</i>

487
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:40,685
<i>of someone who had been
waiting for me to come home.</i>

488
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:47,233
<i>What my life could've been
if that didn't happen three years ago…</i>

489
00:34:27,648 --> 00:34:31,903
<i>But that doesn't mean
I regret the choices I've made.</i>

490
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:36,741
<i>I might be curious about it,
but it's still not a path I want to take.</i>

491
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:40,411
BECOME A GOOD PERSON
IF YOU WANT TO MEET ONE

492
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:58,888
{\an8}SOMEONE SENT YOU A HEART
CHA MIN-JI, 31

493
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:08,981
HA-NA

494
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:13,986
<i>Hello?</i>

495
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:15,738
Hey, Ha-na.

496
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:20,243
How about working late with me tomorrow?

497
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:21,327
<i>Pardon?</i>

498
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:23,496
My date is the day after tomorrow.

499
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,624
I should at least be presentable,

500
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:29,418
but it turns out I have nothing to wear.

501
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:31,921
Just a second.

502
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:36,843
Tomorrow…

503
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:39,428
<i>It's fine if you're too busy.</i>

504
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:40,596
<i>Never mind.</i>

505
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,849
I can just go buck naked. It's fine.

506
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:46,519
Sounds like a plan.
Show off that nice body.

507
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:50,314
<i>Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.</i>

508
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:52,066
All right, you will.

509
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,234
<i>All right.</i>

510
00:35:58,197 --> 00:36:00,116
She's got the Chungcheong accent down.

511
00:36:17,091 --> 00:36:18,301
Ha-na.

512
00:36:18,384 --> 00:36:19,468
Did you pick one?

513
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:25,516
What do you think?

514
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:28,311
I feel good.

515
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:31,814
<i>I had completely forgotten…</i>

516
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:34,734
<i>that I had to get that face married off.</i>

517
00:36:37,403 --> 00:36:38,613
Follow me.

518
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:48,789
I think this color will suit you.

519
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:52,376
Your girlfriend has a good eye.

520
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,170
No, I'm not.

521
00:36:54,795 --> 00:36:57,006
She's not my girlfriend.

522
00:36:57,089 --> 00:36:58,841
She proposed marriage to me.

523
00:37:01,677 --> 00:37:03,095
Just go and try this on.

524
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:13,314
Ha-na, I think this one is too small.

525
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:15,608
Really? Hold on.

526
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:21,656
Here's another one.

527
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:33,084
Can you close that
if you're not going to come in?

528
00:37:36,295 --> 00:37:39,298
I just wanted to give you this shirt.

529
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:58,693
Don't be too nervous
about tomorrow's blind date.

530
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:00,778
And you're looking for a life partner,

531
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:02,989
so you can take your time
before you decide.

532
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:06,242
I'm not nervous in the least.
I know I'll do well.

533
00:38:07,034 --> 00:38:08,619
I'm sure you will.

534
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:10,329
After all, you went shopping today

535
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:13,249
and watched etiquette videos on YouTube.

536
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:18,129
If I'm being honest,
I am a little nervous,

537
00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:20,464
but I'm not worried one bit.

538
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:21,966
Really?

539
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:23,342
That's good to hear.

540
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:25,761
I don't need to look far.

541
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:29,098
If it doesn't work out,
you can just become my partner.

542
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:30,224
What?

543
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:31,350
Don't you remember?

544
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:36,605
"We're getting married."
Didn't you say that?

545
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:38,357
Stop teasing me already!

546
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:40,776
- What? That is what you said.
- Unbelievable.

547
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,903
You said we were getting married.

548
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:44,447
We linked arms and everything.

549
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:47,241
- You know why I said that…
- Am I wrong?

550
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:49,493
You can't go back on your word.

551
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:53,914
You should go inside now.

552
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:56,542
I live here. You leave first.
Step on that gas pedal.

553
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:59,211
- I'll be sure to do that.
- Make sure it's not in reverse.

554
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,531
DYAN MART
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OH IN-A

555
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:33,329
So hot!

556
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:35,164
Come in.

557
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:39,085
Is that a new release?

558
00:39:39,668 --> 00:39:42,046
Yes. It looks like another hit,
doesn't it?

559
00:39:43,005 --> 00:39:45,174
I hope your date will be a hit too.

560
00:39:47,301 --> 00:39:48,386
What do you think?

561
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:52,598
The chairman insisted you meet him
because he's excellent husband material.

562
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,310
When will my dad give up already?

563
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:01,399
So hot.

564
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:12,952
<i>Please help me.</i>

565
00:40:13,035 --> 00:40:14,036
IN-A

566
00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:26,882
How would you like your hair done?

567
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:30,469
Ma'am, I have
a very important meeting today.

568
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:31,720
I see.

569
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:33,681
Just take my hair

570
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:36,267
and straighten every last darn inch of it.

571
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:39,061
Show me what you got.

572
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:53,993
This door is huge.

573
00:40:54,076 --> 00:40:55,744
My goodness. I can't believe it.

574
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:57,163
Just look at that.

575
00:40:57,246 --> 00:41:00,833
What an adorable teddy bear!

576
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:04,712
My goodness, Mr. Choi.

577
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:07,590
Just as I expected of you.
This place is perfect.

578
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:10,134
I called in a favor.

579
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:15,723
So, we need to be the servers
and extras in the background, right?

580
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:17,183
Yes, please.

581
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:20,895
Mr. Han, maybe you can call
your girlfriend to help?

582
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:24,565
No girlfriend or even a friend
who's a girl to call.

583
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:29,570
Come on now. Don't bring down the mood.

584
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:32,656
- We can just take care of it all.
- Sure.

585
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:35,701
Then you two can pretend
to be a couple, right?

586
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:38,078
- Well, I don't want...
- I'd love to.

587
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:44,210
Do we need to take it that far?

588
00:41:47,254 --> 00:41:49,882
If you're not crazy about being a couple,

589
00:41:49,965 --> 00:41:51,050
how about ex-lovers?

590
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:59,934
Ms. Lee, you call this direction?

591
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,149
Darn it. I laughed.

592
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:10,861
Let me see here.
If we're going to be servers…

593
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:13,072
Over there, we should…

594
00:42:13,155 --> 00:42:15,533
Then I think we can sit
over there somewhere.

595
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:16,450
Okay.

596
00:42:17,743 --> 00:42:21,914
{\an8}<i>I'm interested in falling in love,
not marriage.</i>

597
00:42:21,997 --> 00:42:23,916
{\an8}<i>Please tell my dad that we met up.</i>

598
00:42:23,999 --> 00:42:25,876
ARRANGED DATE

599
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:29,964
Watch out!

600
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:13,966
Watch out for the water!

601
00:43:14,466 --> 00:43:15,634
No!

602
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:34,361
Oh, no.

603
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:37,031
Are you okay?

604
00:43:41,368 --> 00:43:42,369
Yes.

605
00:43:43,245 --> 00:43:44,997
I'm okay.

606
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:47,041
Are you okay?

607
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:48,709
I'm fine.

608
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:51,795
But you don't seem okay.

609
00:43:53,255 --> 00:43:54,715
Don't worry about me.

610
00:43:56,508 --> 00:43:59,053
But you're hurt there. Are you okay?

611
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:03,766
It may just look like a scratch,
but it'll hurt a lot later

612
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:05,517
if you just leave it like that.

613
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:06,769
Here it is.

614
00:44:08,687 --> 00:44:09,938
Could I compensate you?

615
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:11,940
Forget it. Compensation? Please.

616
00:44:12,941 --> 00:44:15,027
Just let this go as a stroke of bad luck

617
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:16,779
and enjoy the rest of your day.

618
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:22,284
I should hurry up.
A quick shower or I'll be late.

619
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:23,952
I'm off. Bye.

620
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:25,037
Wait…

621
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:32,586
I'd call that good luck.

622
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:41,387
Oh, Cheol-hui.

623
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:51,688
What's with the outfit and hair?

624
00:44:53,315 --> 00:44:55,734
The curly hair issue is back.

625
00:44:58,821 --> 00:45:00,489
- Come here.
- What?

626
00:45:00,572 --> 00:45:02,783
Hello. Hello there. Hello.

627
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:04,034
- Come here.
- Okay.

628
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:11,041
Surprised?

629
00:45:11,708 --> 00:45:14,128
I did get ready properly,

630
00:45:15,629 --> 00:45:17,214
but the journey here was rough.

631
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:19,633
I can see that.

632
00:45:19,716 --> 00:45:22,010
But still, it's nice to be natural.

633
00:45:22,636 --> 00:45:23,679
Yes, well…

634
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:28,642
I actually prepared some jokes,
just in case it gets awkward.

635
00:45:28,725 --> 00:45:29,893
No.

636
00:45:30,477 --> 00:45:32,312
Don't do it. Whatever it is.

637
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:34,481
Just be your normal self.
That will be enough.

638
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:36,108
Okay.

639
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:39,486
How about hearing one, just in case?

640
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:43,282
How does a car say goodbye?

641
00:45:43,782 --> 00:45:46,118
- How does a car say goodbye?
- Yes.

642
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:47,661
How?

643
00:45:47,744 --> 00:45:48,662
Oil be seeing you!

644
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:52,749
Oil be a hoot.

645
00:45:59,548 --> 00:46:01,341
Ms. Cha has arrived.

646
00:46:02,342 --> 00:46:04,553
Ms. Jeong, we should take our places.

647
00:46:05,762 --> 00:46:08,140
- Cheol-hui, good luck!
- Okay.

648
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:12,186
Everyone, take your places!

649
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:14,730
- Okay.
- Hurry up. This way.

650
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:23,113
Enjoy.

651
00:46:27,993 --> 00:46:31,663
That's right. Min-ji, I heard you cook?

652
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:36,376
Yes. I run a small Italian restaurant
in my neighborhood.

653
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:38,045
An Italian restaurant?

654
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:40,464
That's so amazing.

655
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:45,135
I didn't have formal training,
but I enjoy traveling

656
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:48,180
and spent about two years
in the Italian countryside.

657
00:46:48,847 --> 00:46:50,557
I picked up a few things back then.

658
00:46:51,141 --> 00:46:52,851
It's nothing special.

659
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:55,938
What do you mean it's nothing special?
That's truly incredible.

660
00:46:56,897 --> 00:46:58,565
Gosh.

661
00:46:59,608 --> 00:47:00,609
Oh, right.

662
00:47:00,692 --> 00:47:03,695
Talking about Italy
reminds me of something.

663
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:05,113
What is it?

664
00:47:05,197 --> 00:47:08,158
Do you know how
the Italian Terminator says goodbye?

665
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:12,579
The Italian… No.

666
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:15,082
The Italian Terminator goes,

667
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:16,625
"<i>Pasta la vista</i>, baby!"

668
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:19,545
Oh.

669
00:47:21,046 --> 00:47:22,548
"<i>Pasta la vista</i>, baby!"

670
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:30,722
- This is your favorite.
- I'm good.

671
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:38,981
I just remembered
we used to make it at home.

672
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:41,400
I actually don't like clams.

673
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:43,527
You don't?

674
00:47:47,739 --> 00:47:50,826
It was the one dish you knew how to make,

675
00:47:50,909 --> 00:47:54,288
and I wanted to be accommodating
for the man I liked back then.

676
00:47:55,414 --> 00:47:57,249
I had no idea.

677
00:47:58,917 --> 00:47:59,960
Sorry.

678
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:03,505
Then what do you like now?

679
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:09,261
Do you share your likes with your boss?

680
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:23,984
Those two make
a surprisingly good couple, don't they?

681
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:26,612
Who? Mr. Bong and Ms. Cha?

682
00:48:26,695 --> 00:48:28,739
No, the couple over there.

683
00:48:34,369 --> 00:48:36,705
Here is some water for you.

684
00:48:38,373 --> 00:48:40,500
I think it's going well over there.

685
00:48:41,293 --> 00:48:42,919
What did you two talk about?

686
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:45,631
- We were…
- Food.

687
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:47,841
About what we normally eat.

688
00:48:47,924 --> 00:48:50,886
Oh, food? Yes, that is important.

689
00:48:50,969 --> 00:48:52,846
Then I'll leave you to it.

690
00:49:01,229 --> 00:49:04,566
What do you like to do on dates?

691
00:49:06,151 --> 00:49:12,074
I enjoy serving a warm home-cooked meal.

692
00:49:14,701 --> 00:49:15,994
I also like home cooking.

693
00:49:16,078 --> 00:49:17,496
Really?

694
00:49:19,206 --> 00:49:22,793
I want to meet a man
who is like a home-cooked meal.

695
00:49:26,171 --> 00:49:28,382
A precious meal between two people.

696
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:33,011
A man who would find that
special and precious.

697
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:37,182
I'd like to get married
to somebody like that.

698
00:49:38,558 --> 00:49:40,727
Home cooking is my specialty.

699
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:44,523
If the chance ever arises,
I'll show you what I got.

700
00:49:44,606 --> 00:49:45,857
Sounds good.

701
00:49:49,277 --> 00:49:51,822
How often do you leave the island?

702
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:54,282
There's no set schedule.

703
00:49:54,366 --> 00:49:57,035
We evacuate when there's a storm coming.

704
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:58,412
I see.

705
00:49:58,495 --> 00:50:02,666
If we run out of red pepper paste,
I rush out and go grocery shopping.

706
00:50:02,749 --> 00:50:06,128
This talk about the island
reminds me of something funny.

707
00:50:06,211 --> 00:50:07,587
Do you mind if I share?

708
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:09,256
I do.

709
00:50:09,881 --> 00:50:11,758
Let me cut this up for you.

710
00:50:24,938 --> 00:50:26,398
I should've paid for this.

711
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:33,280
I'm so nervous.

712
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:35,031
I hope it went well.

713
00:50:41,997 --> 00:50:46,460
Please… Please let there be a second date.

714
00:50:47,836 --> 00:50:49,087
Here we go.

715
00:50:49,171 --> 00:50:52,591
"Ms. Cha and Mr. Bong just parted ways."

716
00:50:53,675 --> 00:50:56,511
"He watched her leave and turned around."

717
00:50:56,595 --> 00:50:57,429
- "But"…
- "But"…

718
00:50:59,681 --> 00:51:02,684
It's so frustrating. Darn it.

719
00:51:08,523 --> 00:51:11,693
Hey, Mr. Han.
Hurry up and tell me what happened.

720
00:51:11,777 --> 00:51:15,030
They shook hands and agreed to be friends.

721
00:51:15,113 --> 00:51:16,323
Friends?

722
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:17,532
- What?
- What?

723
00:51:28,043 --> 00:51:31,213
8 P.M. SINGING LESSON
DON'T MISS IT TODAY

724
00:51:33,632 --> 00:51:35,884
I should get going now.

725
00:51:35,967 --> 00:51:37,803
Good job today.

726
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:00,659
INCOMING CALL
HA-NA

727
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:07,207
Hey, Ha-na.

728
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:08,500
<i>Where are you?</i>

729
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:12,379
Me? I'm at the bus stop.

730
00:52:13,046 --> 00:52:15,799
<i>You probably didn't eat much on the date.</i>

731
00:52:15,882 --> 00:52:18,093
<i>Let me treat you to a home-cooked meal.</i>

732
00:52:19,594 --> 00:52:20,846
A home-cooked meal?

733
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:25,225
That looks so good.

734
00:52:30,021 --> 00:52:31,481
Hey, over here.

735
00:52:40,156 --> 00:52:41,157
But…

736
00:52:41,908 --> 00:52:43,660
there's a home-cooked meal here?

737
00:52:44,244 --> 00:52:46,413
Were you lied to your whole life?
Take a seat.

738
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:48,039
Okay.

739
00:52:48,123 --> 00:52:49,124
Your honored guest?

740
00:52:51,251 --> 00:52:52,252
Do you know her?

741
00:52:53,378 --> 00:52:55,672
Yeong-eun and I do share a long history.

742
00:52:58,091 --> 00:52:59,259
Thank you.

743
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:01,845
Thank you.

744
00:53:05,098 --> 00:53:07,058
But what is this? It looks like…

745
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:09,686
I don't think it's on the menu.

746
00:53:09,769 --> 00:53:12,105
You can call it a dish
only the regulars know about.

747
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:14,900
Try it.

748
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:19,279
But this doesn't look like
a homemade meal at all.

749
00:53:19,362 --> 00:53:21,239
Just hurry up and try some. It's good.

750
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:22,949
Okay.

751
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:34,419
Ma'am, your food is so tasty.

752
00:53:35,754 --> 00:53:37,172
You're too kind.

753
00:53:37,255 --> 00:53:39,090
I'm going to go get some groceries.

754
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:40,216
Sure.

755
00:53:41,509 --> 00:53:43,053
Wow.

756
00:53:47,849 --> 00:53:49,851
- Isn't it good?
- Yes.

757
00:53:51,853 --> 00:53:53,688
This is homemade food to me.

758
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:56,691
There's no rule
you need to eat it at home.

759
00:53:57,692 --> 00:54:01,237
I think the important part is eating it
with someone you're comfortable with.

760
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:02,697
Whatever it may be.

761
00:54:04,282 --> 00:54:08,203
You know how you come home
and you're just alone?

762
00:54:08,912 --> 00:54:10,747
Those aren't home-cooked meals.

763
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:12,999
You should cook the meal with someone

764
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:17,170
and talk about how tiring the day was
because of a complaint and stuff.

765
00:54:17,253 --> 00:54:19,506
A meal you share while chatting away.

766
00:54:23,259 --> 00:54:24,761
I envy you.

767
00:54:25,345 --> 00:54:26,888
You have Ba-da and San-i.

768
00:54:26,972 --> 00:54:29,599
And you're an excellent cook.

769
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:35,397
Well, I will gladly teach you
if you ever want me to.

770
00:54:37,273 --> 00:54:40,610
That's why I always try
to have my meals before I go home.

771
00:54:42,195 --> 00:54:44,447
I have a friend
who's like a sister to me here.

772
00:54:47,325 --> 00:54:48,535
You're right.

773
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:51,955
About what?

774
00:54:52,038 --> 00:54:54,624
This is home cooking for you.

775
00:54:56,376 --> 00:55:00,880
Actually, home-cooked meals are
really important for me too.

776
00:55:02,215 --> 00:55:06,761
MARRIAGE IS A HOME-COOKED MEAL

777
00:55:07,512 --> 00:55:09,556
I was really worried
when I wrote that down.

778
00:55:10,056 --> 00:55:12,267
I wasn't sure how it would be perceived.

779
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:14,519
But seeing you right now,

780
00:55:15,228 --> 00:55:17,772
I'm glad I wrote that down.

781
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:23,570
I was late when I arrived,

782
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:26,156
but he silently offered
a glass of warm water.

783
00:55:27,949 --> 00:55:30,452
I know because I'm a cook myself,

784
00:55:30,535 --> 00:55:34,706
but warm water is better absorbed
by the body than cold water.

785
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:42,380
<i>He didn't make a big deal out of it.</i>

786
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:46,926
<i>I could feel how considerate
and thoughtful he was toward me.</i>

787
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:55,143
You're right. That's who he is.

788
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:01,191
What's with that look?

789
00:56:02,484 --> 00:56:04,027
Wait a darn second.

790
00:56:04,694 --> 00:56:06,529
You look like you want to marry me.

791
00:56:09,282 --> 00:56:13,078
I'm just kidding.
Marriage isn't child's play.

792
00:56:14,829 --> 00:56:19,501
Ms. Cha wrote down that she was looking
for a man who was like a home-cooked meal.

793
00:56:20,668 --> 00:56:23,088
That's why I thought you two could work.

794
00:56:24,714 --> 00:56:29,135
For me, a home-cooked meal is
something you see in your everyday life.

795
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:31,846
A meal that you can
comfortably share with whoever.

796
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:34,307
And for Ms. Cha, it was a meal

797
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:37,143
that was especially prepared
for someone precious.

798
00:56:38,853 --> 00:56:41,106
We just had different definitions.

799
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:43,942
- Eat up.
- Okay.

800
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:50,865
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

801
00:56:58,373 --> 00:57:01,668
You've been appointed to a new position.
Of course, we should celebrate.

802
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:05,004
As if. You just invited me out
so you wouldn't have to eat alone.

803
00:57:05,588 --> 00:57:08,591
Hey, can't you just be nice and play dumb?

804
00:57:09,968 --> 00:57:10,969
Fine.

805
00:57:11,052 --> 00:57:13,221
How's the new department?

806
00:57:13,304 --> 00:57:14,806
And Jeong Ha-na is there, too?

807
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:17,517
Yeah.

808
00:57:21,146 --> 00:57:23,857
Did you tell her
the truth about that night?

809
00:57:58,057 --> 00:57:59,684
You can toss these out.

810
00:58:07,525 --> 00:58:08,985
Are you sure about this?

811
00:58:11,946 --> 00:58:13,072
Just leave it.

812
00:58:26,794 --> 00:58:30,048
I can't clear the air or explain myself
if she has no feelings for me.

813
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:33,801
She could be lying.

814
00:58:33,885 --> 00:58:35,428
As if I don't know her?

815
00:58:38,306 --> 00:58:42,477
If she knew how to pretend,
we would've never broken up.

816
00:58:44,103 --> 00:58:45,355
Is that so?

817
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:52,111
But it looks like
you still have a lot of feelings left.

818
00:58:52,612 --> 00:58:53,988
There you go again.

819
00:58:54,948 --> 00:58:58,076
But why do you refuse to be set up?

820
00:58:59,077 --> 00:59:01,996
I'm sure your father wants
his amazing daughter to meet and marry

821
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:04,040
someone even more amazing.

822
00:59:04,123 --> 00:59:05,917
You too?

823
00:59:06,793 --> 00:59:11,130
At the very least, I'll choose
who I marry, when I'm ready.

824
00:59:12,215 --> 00:59:13,591
Aren't you surrounded by guys?

825
00:59:13,675 --> 00:59:15,969
Just date someone
you're really attracted to.

826
00:59:16,636 --> 00:59:18,888
I can't ever tell if those men

827
00:59:18,972 --> 00:59:21,891
like me or just my money.

828
00:59:22,725 --> 00:59:24,394
So complicated. You should just…

829
00:59:24,477 --> 00:59:25,979
Yeah. Find someone on the street.

830
00:59:26,062 --> 00:59:28,106
- What?
- On the street.

831
00:59:28,189 --> 00:59:29,399
On the street?

832
00:59:40,535 --> 00:59:41,953
I think I met one today.

833
00:59:42,036 --> 00:59:43,371
Who is it?

834
00:59:51,754 --> 00:59:52,839
This man.

835
00:59:54,882 --> 00:59:56,926
Thank you for that home-cooked meal.

836
00:59:57,010 --> 01:00:00,054
But what's happening with my next date?

837
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:02,015
I'll make sure it goes well.

838
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:05,977
Okay. I'll just continue trusting you.

839
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:07,729
Okay, let's go.

840
01:00:07,812 --> 01:00:08,813
Okay.

841
01:00:15,987 --> 01:00:18,990
{\an8}K. PILATES
FOR A BODY YOU CAN BRAG ABOUT

842
01:00:20,158 --> 01:00:22,702
It's been forever
since I've felt this relaxed.

843
01:00:22,785 --> 01:00:25,330
You've been working so much.
Did you work the weekend, too?

844
01:00:25,997 --> 01:00:28,916
Yeah. It's not easy making a living.

845
01:00:29,959 --> 01:00:32,086
How did Cheol-hui's date go?
Was it a success?

846
01:00:33,671 --> 01:00:35,173
It was a successful failure.

847
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:37,842
What does that mean?

848
01:00:38,551 --> 01:00:41,304
I, at least, got to see
his potential this time.

849
01:00:41,387 --> 01:00:45,600
Right. So you'll have to
keep working late.

850
01:00:47,018 --> 01:00:51,439
Then I guess we'll never know
when your peaceful life will return.

851
01:00:52,023 --> 01:00:53,858
Stop it. I will succeed.

852
01:00:53,941 --> 01:00:55,318
I'm sure you will.

853
01:01:01,616 --> 01:01:02,825
I want to ride that.

854
01:01:04,952 --> 01:01:07,372
That's for babies and groceries.

855
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:08,748
Me too!

856
01:01:08,831 --> 01:01:10,833
I'm going first.

857
01:01:10,917 --> 01:01:14,420
Say what now? You're going to get hurt.
What's wrong with you two?

858
01:01:17,215 --> 01:01:18,508
Look over there.

Okay, I'll do that.

861
01:01:34,607 --> 01:01:36,734
The car must've broken down.

862
01:01:38,152 --> 01:01:39,487
What are they going to do?

863
01:02:05,805 --> 01:02:08,683
Hi! So cute!

864
01:02:10,685 --> 01:02:12,854
Wait, isn't that our Dyan Mart cart?

865
01:02:15,314 --> 01:02:16,816
That's so cute.

866
01:02:20,403 --> 01:02:23,156
- We're almost at the Injeong branch.
- Okay.

867
01:02:28,077 --> 01:02:30,371

869
01:02:32,415 --> 01:02:33,416
- Wait.

Hey, Ha-na.

873
01:02:41,174 --> 01:02:42,300
It's Ha-na!

874
01:02:42,383 --> 01:02:45,470
- Ha-na! Hello!
- Hello!

875
01:02:46,095 --> 01:02:48,222
What's going on here?

876
01:02:48,306 --> 01:02:51,642
Their car broke down after their trip,
so we're on our way

877
01:02:51,726 --> 01:02:52,977

878
01:02:56,981 --> 01:02:58,608

889
01:03:50,284 --> 01:03:51,536
That teddy bear?

890
01:03:56,666 --> 01:03:57,875
I can't believe this.

891
01:04:01,337 --> 01:04:03,923
TEAM GROUP CHAT

892
01:04:05,383 --> 01:04:06,676
Damn it.

893
01:04:10,388 --> 01:04:13,599
<i>This is unbelievable. Bong Cheol-hui is
a star on social media.</i>

894
01:04:13,683 --> 01:04:15,309
THE TRENDING PIED PIPER
CART MAN

895
01:04:15,393 --> 01:04:17,770
<i>It's even on the news.</i>

896
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:20,565
<i>He's been gaining followers nonstop.</i>

897
01:04:20,648 --> 01:04:22,108
<i>What do we do now?</i>

898
01:04:22,191 --> 01:04:24,735
<i>What if he becomes really popular and…</i>

899
01:04:26,362 --> 01:04:28,364
Why is everyone freaking out?

900
01:04:29,824 --> 01:04:32,076
<i>Maybe Mr. Bong doesn't need
to get married here?</i>

901
01:04:34,287 --> 01:04:35,371
She's right.

902
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:39,208
Just get Mr. Bong married.

903
01:04:39,292 --> 01:04:43,421
Then, I'll gladly fulfill that promise
and transfer you to another department.

904
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:47,341
Hold on.

905
01:04:57,643 --> 01:04:58,853
Who are you?

906
01:05:02,356 --> 01:05:03,733
Hello.

907
01:05:04,317 --> 01:05:05,318
Did something happen?

908
01:05:08,195 --> 01:05:09,697
Do you have a guest?

909
01:05:15,703 --> 01:05:16,871
Jeong Ha-na.

910
01:05:18,414 --> 01:05:19,624
It's been a while.

911
01:05:25,129 --> 01:05:26,130
Oh In-a?

912
01:05:31,302 --> 01:05:34,597
Choi Gi-jun, so this is
where you moved to?

913
01:05:42,021 --> 01:05:43,022
What brings you here?

914
01:05:43,856 --> 01:05:44,982
Hold on.

915
01:05:46,233 --> 01:05:48,235
I don't like leaving my debts unpaid.

916
01:05:48,819 --> 01:05:51,781
What? What debt?

917
01:06:32,446 --> 01:06:36,450
<i>Mr. Bong and I could be fate.</i>

918
01:06:36,534 --> 01:06:38,619
<i>A third-generation chaebol with Mr. Bong?</i>

919
01:06:38,703 --> 01:06:39,829
{\an8}<i>No, I'm against it.</i>

920
01:06:39,912 --> 01:06:42,873
{\an8}<i>I just want him to meet someone nice.</i>

921
01:06:42,957 --> 01:06:46,002
{\an8}<i>And there's no chance
that Ms. Oh could be that person?</i>

922
01:06:46,085 --> 01:06:48,379
{\an8}<i>We have an applicant
hoping to match with you.</i>

923
01:06:48,462 --> 01:06:50,297
{\an8}<i>It's someone you know already.</i>

924
01:06:50,381 --> 01:06:51,924
{\an8}<i>If things work out between them,</i>

925
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:53,926
{\an8}<i>Mr. Bong will be hitting the jackpot.</i>

926
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:58,389
{\an8}<i>Have you ever imagined yourself
marrying someone really rich?</i>

927
01:06:58,472 --> 01:06:59,557
{\an8}<i>That would be great.</i>

928
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:01,142
{\an8}Hi, Cheol-hui.

929
01:07:01,225 --> 01:07:03,060
{\an8}<i>What sort of person is Ms. Oh?</i>

930
01:07:03,144 --> 01:07:05,855
{\an8}<i>Something clearly happened
between you two in the past.</i>

931
01:07:06,564 --> 01:07:09,066
{\an8}<i>But what was Ha-na doing
at Mr. Bong's place?</i>

932
01:07:09,150 --> 01:07:10,943
{\an8}<i>Maybe they need to be separated?</i>

933
01:07:11,027 --> 01:07:12,069
{\an8}When did that go flat?

934
01:07:12,153 --> 01:07:14,405
{\an8}<i>Did it just happen?</i>

935
01:07:14,905 --> 01:07:16,490
{\an8}<i>Where is he going?</i>

936
01:07:16,574 --> 01:07:18,200
{\an8}<i>What did you want to tell me?</i>

937
01:07:18,284 --> 01:07:20,202
{\an8}- <i>Well…</i>
- Go on. What is it?

938
01:07:20,286 --> 01:07:21,328
{\an8}Well…

939
01:07:24,290 --> 01:07:26,167
What's with the long pause?

940
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:28,753
<i>By the way, all good on your end?</i>

941
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:34,925
