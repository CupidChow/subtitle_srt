Please don't disrupt my peace. I beg you.

00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:34,469
Damn it.

00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:36,971
TEAM GROUP CHAT

10
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:38,056
<i>This is unbelievable.</i>

00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:40,767
<i>Bong Cheol-hui is a star on social media.</i>

12
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,018

{\an8}THE PIED PIPER CART MAN

{\an8}<i>He's been gaining followers nonstop.</i>

00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:47,524
{\an8}<i>What do we do now?</i>

16
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:49,859
{\an8}<i>What if he becomes really popular and…</i>

17
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:53,571
{\an8}Why is everyone freaking out?

18
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:56,783
{\an8}<i>Maybe Mr. Bong doesn't need
to get married here?</i>

19
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:00,703
She's right.

20
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,672
Take a seat.

21
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:19,556
Here.

22
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,892
What brings you here, out of the blue?

23
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:25,145
Do you know that you became a star?

24
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:26,271
What?

25
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:29,399
A star?

26
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:33,486
Take a look.

27
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:38,616
{\an8}THE TRENDING PIED PIPER CART MAN

28
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,618
Oh, that?

29
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:44,164
Those kids were stranded.
I couldn't just ignore them.

30
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:47,500
But did they get my good side?

31
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:50,628
Look.

32
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:58,887
Geez. My schedule will fill up
when TV stations start calling.

33
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:05,977
What's with the face?

34
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:08,980
What?

35
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:10,481
You don't want me to be a star?

36
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:13,693
In case I might leave you?

37
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,404
Are you really going to?

38
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:20,283
You'll continue your marital
matchmaking with us, right?

39
00:03:23,202 --> 00:03:25,121
You make me so sad.

40
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:28,708
What sort of person do you take me for?

41
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:33,922
I'm the type of person who never wants
to leave someone behind ever again.

42
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:37,425
And where would I go when you're here?

43
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:39,427
We have a special bond.

44
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:42,430
Right? We have a special bond.

45
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:49,938
I have so many guests today.

46
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:51,481
- I'll be back.
- Okay.

47
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:53,441
Who is it?

48
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:56,736
Who could that be?

49
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:03,701
Who are you?

50
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,539
Hello.

51
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:10,124
Is something wrong?

52
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:14,504
Do you have a guest?

53
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:21,678
Jeong Ha-na.

54
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:24,430
It's been a while.

55
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:30,311
Oh In-a?

56
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:41,698
<i>I never thought in my wildest dreams
that I would ever see this two shot again.</i>

57
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:47,870
<i>Erasing the memory
of that event three years ago</i>

58
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,330
<i>took no less than two years.</i>

59
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:51,582
So this is where you moved to?

60
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,302
<i>Now, the only difference is</i>

61
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:04,721
<i>that this soap opera has…</i>

62
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:11,352
<i>a new character added.</i>

63
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,315
What brings you here?

64
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:17,525
Hold on.

65
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:21,279
I don't like leaving my debts unpaid.

66
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:22,363
What?

67
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:24,699
What debt?

68
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:27,577
<i>She hasn't changed one bit.</i>

69
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:31,664
<i>Still as bullheaded as ever.</i>

70
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:34,083
I'm Oh In-a,
Executive Director of Dyan Mart.

71
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,377
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OH IN-A

72
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:40,048
Okay.

73
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:43,509
Thanks to you giving those kids
a ride in a cart from Dyan Mart,

74
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:45,887
my company experienced
a splurge of good press.

75
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,930
This is for you.

76
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:51,017
You didn't need to do all this. Goodness.

77
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:56,731
When you said "debt," I thought
I was in trouble for using that cart.

78
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:58,691
Not at all.

79
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,401
I apologize if I startled you.

80
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:02,403
No, it's fine. I wasn't startled.

81
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:04,489
If anyone is startled…

82
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:07,408
I think it's these two.

83
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:16,501
I'm glad I came today.

84
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:18,753
I get to see all these happy faces.

85
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:23,633
You should get going if you're done here.

86
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:29,263
I just came to say thank you.
I didn't mean to stay this long.

87
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:31,766
I should get going.

88
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:33,559
Okay. Goodbye.

89
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:37,396
See you next time.

90
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,440
I doubt it.

91
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:43,736
I'll say goodbye here, too.

92
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,571
Okay. Bye.

93
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:57,750
Were you bothered by the group chat?

94
00:06:58,793 --> 00:06:59,627
Yes.

95
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:01,337
Ha-na, listen...

96
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,047
I'm going to head out.

97
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:05,424
- I'm off.
- Okay.

98
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:26,571
This reunion took so long to happen.
We can't end it so soon.

99
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:49,469
Am I still just some
heinous bitch in your eyes?

100
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:54,098
Our last interaction wasn't so great.

101
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:56,100
Thinking of apologizing?

102
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:02,356
That has nothing to do with me anymore.

103
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:06,861
I'm oddly disappointed to hear that.

104
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,322
Let's ignore each other's existence.

105
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:11,991
We have no reason to cross paths anyway.

106
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:14,452
I mean,

107
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:18,539
I thought that as well,

108
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:22,793
but I suspect that we'll see
more of each other.

109
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,839
That's not my concern, Ms. Oh.

110
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:30,343
Ms. Oh?

111
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:32,595
Wow.

112
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:35,890
Am I some senior colleague?

113
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:39,143
You're clear with the form of address.

114
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:44,482
{\an8}Are you avoiding the question on purpose?

115
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:47,735
{\an8}That incident three years ago.

116
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:56,244
If that's why we're here,
I'm not interested.

117
00:08:57,328 --> 00:09:00,581
I'm not the least bit curious
about what happened

118
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:02,041
between you and Mr. Choi.

119
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:08,047
Could it be the dread…

120
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,303
of hearing the real reason?

121
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,376
<i>Could it be the dread</i>

122
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,170

133
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:42,827
What's this?

134
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:46,872
What is that?

135
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:55,339
See you next time.

136
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:57,133
I doubt it.

EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OH IN-A

138
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:08,018
They definitely didn't look like friends.

139
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:23,576
What's this?
Didn't you already say goodbye earlier?

140
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:27,580
I thought I might have
sent you off too coldly before.

141
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:29,748
Is that so?

142
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:34,044
I thought that you called me out
to ask what Ha-na and I talked about.

143
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:37,214
You gave her no nonsense, right?

144
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:44,972
Breathe. I gave her no nonsense.
Don't worry.

145
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:52,146
But what was Ha-na doing
at Mr. Bong's place this late?

146
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:54,148
She's in charge of him.

147
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:56,275
What? "She's in charge of him"?

148
00:12:56,358 --> 00:13:00,905
He's participating in the program
my Marriage Morale Boost Team is running.

149
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:04,783
- Is he now?
- Why are you so curious?

150
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,037
Hey.

151
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:12,625
Why don't you match him with me?

152
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:16,754
You and Mr. Bong?

153
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,840
You make it sound so easy.

154
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:21,634
Do you really believe any guy

155
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:24,678
will go out with you
just because you have money?

156
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:26,138
Listen carefully.

157
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:28,224
This is marital matchmaking. Marital.

158
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:32,019
Right, so I want to be matched up
with Mr. Bong in that marital matchmaking.

159
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:33,896
I'm in no mood to mess around today.

160
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:40,152
Do you remember that man
I met on the street?

161
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,654
The teddy bear bandage guy?

162
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:46,158
And what if Mr. Bong was that guy?

163
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:47,243
What?

164
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:57,044
There's a chance
Mr. Bong and I could be fate.

We have six new ones.

168
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:16,021
What? We only got six?

169
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:20,276
I thought there was an influx
after what Mr. Bong did.

170
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:23,946
There's an influx of interest
but not applicants.

171
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:28,117
Deciding to get married is no easy feat.

172
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,452
People are starting to complain

173
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,663
about this being
a waste of public resources.

174
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:34,456
This is a serious issue.

175
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,917
Wait. We just got another one.

176
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:38,836
That makes it seven.

177
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,379

Wait, she was born in 2004?

00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:46,969
Hold on. Scroll all the way down.

181
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:49,847
Go on. Keep scrolling.

182
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:52,975
"Desired qualities in a match.

183
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:56,395
High net worth, high salary,
prestigious profession."

184
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:02,985
So cynical at such a young age.

185
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:06,572
She wouldn't be
a good match for Mr. Bong, either.

186
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:08,991
I have someone.

187
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:11,785
Someone hoping to match with him.

188
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:14,079
That's our team manager for you.

189
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,123
Who is it?

190
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:18,751
Executive Director Oh In-a of Dyan Mart.

191
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,341
A third-generation chaebol with Mr. Bong?

192
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:31,055
Sir, the objective
of this project is marriage.

193
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:32,556
You're aware of that, right?

194
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,644
What exactly would be the issue?

195
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:40,940
I believe assessing
the candidates to rank their potential

196
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:42,858
and misinterpreting their intentions

197
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,945
are things we must never do
on this task force.

198
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:49,448
After that video was released,

199
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:53,327
it seems dangerous to let them meet
without knowing her true motives.

200
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:56,956
It seems Mr. Bong once saved Ms. Oh
when she was in harm's way.

201
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,749
She became interested in him then.

202
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:04,088
It seems Ms. Jeong is being
overly cautious because she's worried

203
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:05,965
about Mr. Bong getting hurt.

204
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:08,008
When it comes to spouses,

205
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:11,553
you know the moment
when you set your eyes on them.

206
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:14,056
It was like that for me, too.

207
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:20,020
For all we know, Ms. Oh might have
experienced such feelings.

208
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:22,356
Good for Mr. Bong.

209
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:26,235
But will someone of Ms. Oh's background

210
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:29,238
be able to have a conversation with him?

211
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:32,950
They do live in very different worlds.

212
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:37,413
Hold on, but considering his credentials,
if things work out between them,

213
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,665
Mr. Bong will be hitting the jackpot.

214
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:44,545
Anyway, I'm against it.

215
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:47,923
- Wait…
- Ms. Jeong…

216
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:53,595
Maybe she's going through something?

217
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:56,473
What exactly is the issue here?

218
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:58,475
They live in completely different worlds.

219
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,602
In the end, Mr. Bong will get hurt.

220
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,771
You said not to judge
based on qualifications,

221
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:06,025
but aren't you ranking
and judging the candidates right now?

222
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:09,737
I just want him to meet someone nice.

223
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:13,073
And there's no chance
that Ms. Oh could be that person?

224
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:16,910
Do you truly believe that?

225
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:22,458
Clearly, you misunderstood her…

226
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:23,542
Watch it.

227
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:27,588
"Watch it"?

228
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,924
I misunderstood? Are you kidding?

229
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:35,012
The affair with her wasn't enough?
She even gets follow-up service?

230
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:36,430
What's your goal here?

231
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:37,806
For you to be happy!

232
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:42,061
You want to escape this department.
I'm offering you help here.

233
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:52,029
Now, you want to pretend to care about me?

234
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:56,992
Whether it's my happiness or life,
it's my business.

235
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,077
Ha-na.

236
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:02,706
I can't match Mr. Bong
with just anyone for my own good.

237
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:05,584
Excuse me.

238
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,855
Can I help you?

239
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,358
Is this the Marriage Morale Boost Team?

240
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:30,567
Yes, it is.

241
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:33,070
I followed the instructions
and filled this out.

242
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:36,198
I was wondering why
my profile card hasn't registered yet.

243
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:39,785
There's a screening process involved.

244
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:42,162
You're one of our younger applicants,

245
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:45,707
and all the criteria you set for a match
pertained to their finances.

246
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,127
- And what's wrong with that?
- Pardon?

247
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:52,923
I mean, without such conditions met,
why would I get married at this age?

248
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:56,426
Well, what I meant was…

249
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:59,596
Ms. Na, your age isn't the issue.

250
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,182
It's just that marriage is
a delicate matter,

251
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:05,144
and our screening protocols reflect that.

252
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,856
Always going on about protocols.

253
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:10,941
That's what civil servants always say...

254
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:16,155
I see. You just want to clock out on time.

255
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:19,074
Going home on time is
more important than a public complaint?

256
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:22,161
No, that's not true. We were just…

257
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:23,579
Pardon me for a moment.

258
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,792
Ms. Na Ji-won, born in 2004?

259
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:30,252
Yes, that's me.

260
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,881
- Is it because of my age...
- You can get married.

261
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,008
Pardon?

262
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:41,054
During the Joseon dynasty, you would
already be married with five kids.

263
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:43,473
Shameful rascals!

264
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:45,642
Ms. Na,

265
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:48,020
I'm the section chief here.

266
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:52,149
I'll make sure this gets processed
and match you up swiftly.

267
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:54,526
You're all set here.

268
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:58,572
Right. You should go
and shop for a date outfit. Okay?

269
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:00,199
What I said earlier wasn't wrong.

270
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:01,533
Of course not.

271
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:04,912
Did you say section chief?

272
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:07,080
Section Chief Yang Seung-gu.

273
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:10,584
I'll stop here for today for your sake.

274
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:13,337
Okay. Take care.

275
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:17,049
Shameful rascals!

276
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:25,557
Five.

277
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:26,892
Four.

278
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:28,060
Three.

279
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:29,269
Two.

280
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:31,146
One.

281
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,564
Ding.

282
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,858
I'm going to head out. Good job today.

283
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:37,861
I can't be late for my wife's birthday.

284
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:40,864
You used that excuse last time!

285
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:42,032
Did he?

286
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:46,286
I guess he has two wives.

287
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:01,343
{\an8}EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OH IN-A

288
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:09,017
{\an8}Yes?

289
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,103
{\an8}<i>You have a guest, ma'am.</i>

290
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:14,439
{\an8}Do I? Who is it?

291
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:18,277
<i>He says he's here
to return a shopping cart?</i>

292
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:23,198
Let him in.

293
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:30,247
Hi, Cheol-hui.

294
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:34,209
I returned the cart.

295
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,586
You didn't need to do that.

296
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:38,755
Anyhow, welcome.

297
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:42,301
I was hoping to see you again.

298
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:44,303
It's nothing serious.

299
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:46,596
It's about this.

300
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,474
That's just a small gift to thank you.

301
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:51,518
It's not enough…

302
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:55,063
This is chump change.

303
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,273
Don't you agree?

304
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:57,399
Pardon?

305
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:01,528
- Then…
- Never mind.

306
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:05,073
How could it have been enough?
A thank you from the heart is priceless.

307
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:09,870
Right.

308
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:12,289
This is nowhere near enough.

309
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,500
Take it back.

310
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:18,712
I'm off.

311
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:20,839
- How about some tea?
- Get back to work.

312
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:33,310
He's totally my type.

313
00:22:57,834 --> 00:23:00,003
<i>If that didn't happen three years ago,</i>

314
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:02,297
<i>I would've never realized my true desires.</i>

315
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:05,509
<i>Definitely not marriage.</i>

316
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:10,180
I misunderstood? Are you kidding?

317
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:13,642
The affair with her wasn't enough?
She even gets follow-up service?

318
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:15,185
What's your goal here?

319
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:16,770
For you to be happy!

320
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:30,367
Yeong-eun.

321
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:33,453
Look.

322
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,626
I want to apologize.

323
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:27,215
I won't ask you to forgive me.

324
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:31,678
An apology?

325
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:36,766
It's already all in the past.

326
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:44,191
Did you ever consider the possibility
that easing your guilt could hurt me more?

327
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:46,902
Even now, I want to set things right.

328
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:54,201
I want to free you from the trauma
you experienced because of me.

329
00:24:57,412 --> 00:24:58,788
That's all history now.

330
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:02,459
What is there to set right at this point?

331
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:06,171
My dad even sold off our place.

332
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:16,890
Our wedding was around the corner,
and my family was in financial ruin.

333
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:21,102
I just couldn't handle it.

334
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:27,234
That's why I asked In-a to do that.

335
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:33,615
To make you leave me.

336
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:37,827
Why would you…

337
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:40,830
I lacked the confidence.

338
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:44,918
Do you remember what you said
was the hardest part…

339
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:49,089
of working in a matchmaking agency?

340
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:52,676
You said the bottom-ranking ones

341
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:56,304
only had despair waiting for them
after they got married.

342
00:25:58,765 --> 00:26:01,351
But that's what I have become.

343
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:03,937
How could you not tell me?

344
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:07,274
Ha-na.

345
00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:13,697
Ha-na…

346
00:26:15,448 --> 00:26:16,658
What was that?

347
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:18,076
What's going on here?

348
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:20,036
Are you okay?

349
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,121
What's wrong with him?

350
00:26:21,204 --> 00:26:25,500
Hello? Excuse me.
Sir, this is no way to behave.

351
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:27,085
He's out of it.

352
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:30,130
What? What's going on here?

353
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:32,799
Hey, Cheol-hui.

354
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:35,051
Isn't that Mr. Pyramid Scheme?

355
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,679
Did you already knock him out?

356
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:40,390
Perfect timing, Mr. Bong.

357
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:43,518
- Can you clear this away for me?
- What?

358
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:54,070
You must be exhausted.

359
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:57,824
Gosh. Not at all. If anyone is exhausted,
it's the man who's knocked out.

360
00:26:58,366 --> 00:26:59,784
I'm fine.

361
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:02,662
Wait, isn't this your place?

362
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:03,747
Go inside.

363
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:04,998
I can come with you.

364
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:06,750
Come with me where?

365
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:10,670
Don't tell me you want to go to his place.

366
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:13,048
No, of course not.

367
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:16,384
I'll take care of him today. Go on inside.

368
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:20,263
- Okay. Get back safely.
- Go on. Bye.

369
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:23,475
Bye.

370
00:27:32,233 --> 00:27:33,485
I hope you understand.

371
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:36,905
I definitely didn't set you down
because you were heavy.

372
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:43,912
Also, you can still hear me, can't you?

373
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:48,416
Let's be honest.

374
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:53,296
We're not close enough
for me to carry you all the way home.

375
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:55,048
Am I wrong?

376
00:27:56,424 --> 00:27:59,177
- No.
- Quick response.

377
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:02,680
And what's your deal? Pyramid scheme?

378
00:28:04,265 --> 00:28:05,475
No.

379
00:28:05,558 --> 00:28:06,810
No?

380
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:09,020
Regardless,

381
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:12,607
Pyramid scheme or not,
you still did something terrible to Ha-na.

382
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:13,858
Am I wrong?

383
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:15,485
No.

384
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:17,904
So…

385
00:28:18,988 --> 00:28:22,575
I'll just do as much
as my heart will allow.

386
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:25,912
You have to be understanding.

387
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:28,331
Come on.

388
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:32,460
Please save me. Please…

389
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:55,066
What you said was the hardest part
of working in a matchmaking agency…

390
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:57,610
You said the bottom-ranking ones

391
00:28:57,694 --> 00:29:01,406
only had despair waiting for them
after they got married.

392
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:06,077
But that's what I have become.

393
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:12,000
<i>If he had been honest
about everything with me back then,</i>

394
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:17,005
<i>would I have been able to handle all that?</i>

395
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:24,304
<i>Would I have been able to start
my marital life penniless?</i>

396
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:57,879
I don't even like him.

397
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:08,473
I want to go back, Ha-na.

398
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:17,065
You can't turn back time.

399
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:29,452
<i>Have you changed your mind?</i>

400
00:30:43,132 --> 00:30:44,717
He must be very sick.

401
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:47,178
He looks fine.

402
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:55,520
What happened yesterday?

403
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:57,730
No idea.

404
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:09,617
Who are you?

405
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:12,453
Sir, don't be scared.

406
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:14,289
Try taking a deep breath.

407
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:23,715
Sir.

408
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:27,802
You've hurt your butt really badly.

409
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:30,054
My butt?

410
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:34,225
What's that?

411
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:38,479
That's enough fooling around.
Tell him to get washed up.

412
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:41,107
You heard him, right?
Go and get washed up.

413
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,359
Mr. Bong?

414
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:47,822
You need to cure
that hangover before work.

415
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:49,616
But what am I doing here?

416
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:51,743
And how did I end up with this?

417
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:02,128
Shall I share with you

418
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:05,840
the tale of how I carried you here
because you were so wasted last night?

419
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:13,056
No, that won't be necessary.

420
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:24,943
Say goodbye.

421
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:26,861
See you next time.

422
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:42,585
- Cheol-hui.
- My goodness!

423
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:46,965
I nearly jumped out of my skin.

424
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:49,175
Did you get home safely?

425
00:32:49,258 --> 00:32:51,761
Yes, I got home safely last night.

426
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:55,014
And you dropped him off?

427
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:59,060
Well… He had no problem
taking himself home.

428
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:01,229
Sorry you had to go through that.

429
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:04,023
But what are you doing here this early?

430
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:05,775
Oh, right.

431
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:07,860
Here.

432
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:09,362
What's this?

433
00:33:09,862 --> 00:33:10,947
A boxed lunch?

434
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:13,950
You're in charge of finding my partner.

435
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:16,160
I can't have you hungover and out of it.

436
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:19,247
I wasn't that bad.

437
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:21,207
I was just a bit upset.

438
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:23,543
It's hangover soup.

439
00:33:23,626 --> 00:33:27,797
It'll settle your stomach in no time
and soothe your upset heart.

440
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:32,010
- Cheol-hui.
- Yes?

441
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:38,933
By chance, have you ever imagined yourself
marrying someone much richer than you?

442
00:33:41,644 --> 00:33:43,021
That'd be great.

443
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:43,938
What?

444
00:33:44,897 --> 00:33:46,315
Is that who you really are?

445
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:52,196
You said your ideal type was someone
you clicked with, kind-hearted and so on.

446
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,574
I thought you just wanted a good person.

447
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:59,287
And so on? What are you saying right now?

448
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:02,123
I'm just surprised. That's all.

449
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:08,296
Why would I be biased
against someone's finances?

450
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:11,632
If it was reversed, a lower class
wouldn't make that person any less.

451
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:15,762
Some people are rich in heart.

452
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:20,349
But when did you get this flat tire?

453
00:34:21,517 --> 00:34:24,312
What? It was fine yesterday.

454
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:27,190
Did it just happen?

455
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:28,941
Really?

456
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:32,737
That dashcam is recording, right?

457
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:52,048
Do you see something?

458
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,426
No, well…

459
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:59,097
Just a few stray cats.

460
00:35:05,853 --> 00:35:08,106
{\an8}HANGOVER CURE

461
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:28,000
Hello.

462
00:35:33,422 --> 00:35:34,966
I'm here with an application.

463
00:35:42,765 --> 00:35:44,433
{\an8}LOOKING FOR A MAN
WITH BRONZE SKIN,

464
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:46,269
{\an8}CURLY HAIR, ACCENT,
AND GOOD WITH KIDS.

465
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:48,229
IDEAL TYPE:
1. BRONZE SKIN, CURLY HAIR

466
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:49,689
{\an8}2. GOOD WITH KIDS
3. ATTRACTIVE ACCENT

467
00:35:49,772 --> 00:35:51,566
{\an8}I tried my best
to be as honest as I could.

468
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:52,650
{\an8}Is there an issue?

469
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:56,863
- These traits…
- It leaves me with Mr. Bong.

470
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:01,367
There are really no other criteria?

471
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:04,120
What more could I ask for
if it's meant to be?

472
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:05,997
Also, I'm comfortable financially.

473
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:11,919
Well, maybe we first need to
clear the air between us

474
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:14,046
for you to look at me with kind eyes?

475
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:16,799
I heard what happened three years ago.

476
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:17,884
Really?

477
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:20,011
I'm so relieved.

478
00:36:20,094 --> 00:36:22,680
I couldn't say anything
because Gi-jun freaked out

479
00:36:22,763 --> 00:36:24,473
and insisted that I couldn't.

480
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:28,519
But that's not going to change anything.

481
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:30,771
Why not?

482
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:33,566
We still shared some memories in college.

483
00:36:33,649 --> 00:36:36,944
I hope you can put in a good word for me
as my friend with Mr. Bong.

484
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:40,698
I don't think we were ever that close.

485
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:43,618
Really?

486
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:46,204
Then, we can take
this chance to change that.

487
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:49,582
I have a lot of questions about Cheol-hui.

488
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:55,671
After we verify your personal information,

489
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:58,341
your official profile card
will be uploaded.

490
00:36:58,424 --> 00:37:01,260
Regarding Mr. Bong,
there will be some additional steps,

491
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:02,511
so I'll be in touch.

492
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:06,891
Thank you, Ms. Jeong.

493
00:37:12,104 --> 00:37:15,900
- I need to get promoted this time.
- Totally.

494
00:37:15,983 --> 00:37:19,445
My wife's nagging has only gotten worse.

495
00:37:19,528 --> 00:37:21,447
- It's gotten worse?
- Yeah.

496
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:26,410
Shouldn't you pick that up?

497
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:30,790
That's Ms. Na Ji-won calling.

498
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:35,670
She calls every half hour.

499
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:38,422
To ask when her match
with someone rich will happen.

500
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:47,348
Why is a 20-year-old college student
in such a rush?

501
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:52,144
There is someone who meets her criteria,

502
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:56,190
but we haven't even finished
screening him yet.

503
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:58,150
I'm afraid to suggest him just yet.

504
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:03,155
She's only looking
at the finances of her match.

505
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:07,994
Even if both parties are on the same page,
she still needs to be chosen by him first.

506
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:09,245
That's also true.

507
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:14,125
Why is your line still busy?

508
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:16,877
Who are you talking to all day?

509
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:19,422
No one is…

510
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:30,099
I just need those criteria met.

511
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:33,352
Is that so difficult?

512
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:38,065
You just need to introduce me
to the man with the best credentials.

513
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:43,154
Before we suggest a match,
we not only look at finances

514
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:45,823
but also consider
personal values and traits.

515
00:38:45,906 --> 00:38:47,783
We only suggest one after that review.

516
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:49,910
Everyone is the same anyway.

517
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:52,997
In a capitalistic society,
you need these criteria met.

518
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,499
Love won't last that long.

519
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:59,837
Anyway, I don't care about anything else.

520
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,839
You can easily tell a man by his shoes.

521
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:03,758
His shoes?

522
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:07,803
Not many people can worry about
their shoes on top of everything else.

523
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:10,473
You can tell where he stands
in society by his shoes.

524
00:39:11,974 --> 00:39:16,020
Not everyone can afford designer goods.

525
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:23,319
But designer goods don't mean
a good character, right?

526
00:39:23,402 --> 00:39:25,654
People who can't afford it
use that excuse.

527
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:26,989
Do you really believe that?

528
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:27,990
Yes.

529
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:29,950
Why?

530
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:38,376
BONG CHEOL-HUI

531
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:42,671
Pardon me. I need to take this.

532
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:55,101
Ms. Na, as you can see,
we have plenty of applicants.

533
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:56,185
So, for now…

534
00:39:56,268 --> 00:39:58,312
The screening… Is it hard?

535
00:39:58,396 --> 00:39:59,563
I'll just do it.

536
00:40:01,023 --> 00:40:02,191
KOO HAE-JUN, 41

537
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:05,736
Stop. Give that back.

538
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:08,322
You can't do that.

539
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:11,158
- Okay.
- Pardon?

540
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:14,328
I'll give you some more time.

541
00:40:14,995 --> 00:40:16,580
I'm pretty busy, too.

542
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:18,332
I have an appointment. Excuse me.

543
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,924
What was that about?

544
00:40:28,717 --> 00:40:31,345
<i>Hey, Cheol-hui.
Did you take the twins to the dentist?</i>

545
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:35,850
Yes, all thanks to you.

546
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:39,520
Is everything good on your end?

547
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:42,815
On my end? I think so.

548
00:40:43,315 --> 00:40:45,401
When are you done with work today?

549
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:48,988
<i>I think it'll be
another late night for me.</i>

550
00:40:49,071 --> 00:40:52,491
Let's have dinner together
when you're done.

551
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:54,493
<i>Okay. I need to tell you something, too.</i>

552
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:56,495
Okay. Bye.

553
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:30,404
Excuse me.

554
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:32,031
Behind you.

555
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:37,870
- Oh, come on.
- Seriously?

556
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:14,490
About yesterday…
I think I was a bit drunk.

557
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:17,159
You don't need to remember it.

558
00:42:18,494 --> 00:42:20,788
Forgetting might benefit us both.

559
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:25,584
If you're uncomfortable with it,

560
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:27,878
I can tell Ms. Oh
to withdraw her application.

561
00:42:28,837 --> 00:42:30,339
No, it's fine.

562
00:42:30,422 --> 00:42:32,925
Even if I was,
I don't have the right to block her.

563
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:52,152
CHEF WANTED
WORKING HOURS: NEGOTIABLE

564
00:43:03,872 --> 00:43:05,207
Pardon me.

565
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:25,811
What's going on?

566
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:52,921
That's amazing.

567
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:56,592
Seriously incredible.

568
00:43:57,426 --> 00:43:58,927
Here's your raw fish platter.

569
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:00,012
That looks so good.

570
00:44:01,388 --> 00:44:02,556
Cheol-hui?

571
00:44:03,515 --> 00:44:04,850
Hey, Ha-na.

572
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:07,436
Hey. Say hello to my new hire.

573
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:09,438
- Excuse me.
- Coming!

574
00:44:09,521 --> 00:44:11,607
When did you learn how to do all this?

575
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:14,026
Even the twins are taking singing lessons.

576
00:44:14,109 --> 00:44:15,819
I'll only get bored by myself.

577
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:18,739
And if I'm here,
I also get to see you often.

578
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:20,199
Yes, that's true.

579
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:23,160
He's the best.
We made the best sales ever.

580
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:26,705
You two, chat. I'll go and attend
to those pretty boys over there.

581
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:27,790
Okay.

582
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:33,170
Ha-na.

583
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:35,297
Try this.

584
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:37,091
I can't eat raw fish.

585
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:39,218
Oh, you can't?

586
00:44:39,301 --> 00:44:40,678
Because there's never enough.

587
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:48,143
By the way, was everything okay
on your way here?

588
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:52,648
Was everything okay?
Didn't you ask that earlier, too?

589
00:44:53,899 --> 00:44:57,152
If not, never mind. Eat up.

590
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:01,448
Sir, can we get another platter?

591
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:02,950
Coming right up!

592
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:15,421
Stop staring at that phone.

593
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:18,674
You can send hearts to be matched, right?

594
00:45:19,716 --> 00:45:20,717
Yes.

595
00:45:25,722 --> 00:45:26,849
Then, what's wrong?

596
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:32,604
What if Mr. Bong feels
uncomfortable about me?

597
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:34,273
Why?

598
00:45:34,356 --> 00:45:37,734
What do you think? I'm pretty stacked.

599
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:41,113
Hey,

600
00:45:42,114 --> 00:45:45,576
do you also think he'll turn me down
because of my background?

601
00:45:52,374 --> 00:45:55,919
I'm not sure.
I think Mr. Bong doesn't matter as much.

602
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:59,423
I think Ha-na's mediation will play
a huge part in this.

603
00:46:01,508 --> 00:46:03,135
Jeong Ha-na…

604
00:46:04,052 --> 00:46:05,929
Do you think she'll
put in a good word for me?

605
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:09,391
Maybe they need to be separated?

606
00:46:09,475 --> 00:46:11,894
My thoughts exactly.
They're always together recently.

607
00:46:11,977 --> 00:46:14,313
I'm sure they're together right now.

608
00:46:19,818 --> 00:46:21,737
I want to see Cheol-hui, too.

609
00:46:22,529 --> 00:46:24,740
Gosh, I want to see Ha-na, too.

610
00:46:28,368 --> 00:46:30,078
Good job today.

611
00:46:32,164 --> 00:46:33,790
Thanks, Ha-na.

612
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:37,044
So what did you want to tell me?

613
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:40,756
Right, so…

614
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:41,882
Yes?

615
00:46:45,802 --> 00:46:46,803
Well…

616
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:49,348
Go on. What is it?

617
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:53,977
Well…

618
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,481
Yes?

619
00:47:06,073 --> 00:47:08,158
What's with the long pause?

620
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:09,785
The curiosity is killing me.

621
00:47:10,536 --> 00:47:11,870
Spit it out. What is it?

622
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:15,290
We have an applicant
hoping to match with you.

623
00:47:17,209 --> 00:47:18,335
I see.

624
00:47:19,461 --> 00:47:22,297
But it's someone you know already.

625
00:47:23,423 --> 00:47:24,716
What?

626
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:28,845
It's Ms. Oh In-a,
the granddaughter of Dyan Group.

627
00:47:30,472 --> 00:47:31,807
I see.

628
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:34,810
You don't seem very surprised.

629
00:47:36,478 --> 00:47:38,522
You don't feel uncomfortable about her?

630
00:47:38,605 --> 00:47:39,940
Why should I?

631
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:42,234
Because she's a chaebol?

632
00:47:43,235 --> 00:47:47,447
Who cares about that?
The person is what's important.

633
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:50,784
You asked me last time.

634
00:47:50,867 --> 00:47:53,078
What I thought about
marrying a rich person.

635
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:56,665
Yes, I did.

636
00:47:57,249 --> 00:48:00,419
Then, in your eyes,

637
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:02,588
ignoring her background…

638
00:48:03,922 --> 00:48:05,716
What sort of person is Ms. Oh?

639
00:48:06,758 --> 00:48:08,010
Is she a decent person?

640
00:48:13,348 --> 00:48:16,977
What's important is if she can marry
someone without credentials, right?

641
00:48:18,604 --> 00:48:20,397
Something clearly happened

642
00:48:21,898 --> 00:48:23,525
between you two in the past.

643
00:48:26,778 --> 00:48:28,572
So, you must know her well.

644
00:48:37,289 --> 00:48:39,207
The misunderstanding got cleared up.

645
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:41,376
She's not a bad person.

646
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:48,717
- Okay then.
- What does that mean?

647
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,386
You said she was fine,

648
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:55,849
so I'll seriously consider her
as a potential match.

649
00:49:07,402 --> 00:49:08,820
SELLING MEN'S DESIGNER SHOES

650
00:49:08,904 --> 00:49:11,365
<i>I know we're supposed to meet today,</i>

651
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:13,950
<i>but unfortunately,
I need to raise the price a bit.</i>

652
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:17,704
Is he kidding me?

653
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:40,060
Na Ji-won?

654
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:54,658
- What do you do?
- I have my own business.

655
00:49:55,951 --> 00:49:58,495
- Annual revenue?
- Around 20 billion won.

656
00:50:02,791 --> 00:50:05,377
Do you rent or own your place?

657
00:50:06,712 --> 00:50:08,004
I own.

658
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:08,922
And your car?

659
00:50:09,005 --> 00:50:10,465
You're asking how many?

660
00:50:11,591 --> 00:50:13,510
I have a total of five.

661
00:50:15,637 --> 00:50:17,305
Do you have an ideal type?

662
00:50:17,389 --> 00:50:19,266
Just someone rich?

663
00:50:20,892 --> 00:50:23,812
When it comes to money,
the more, the better.

664
00:50:25,939 --> 00:50:29,484
I guess your family is struggling a bit.

665
00:50:30,819 --> 00:50:32,779
Are you here to marry up?

666
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:37,868
Is that a bad thing?

667
00:50:40,912 --> 00:50:42,414
So that's why.

668
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:45,834
Pardon?

669
00:50:45,917 --> 00:50:48,253
Those don't look like this season.

670
00:50:48,962 --> 00:50:51,798
A neutral color to wear them every day
without people noticing.

671
00:50:52,424 --> 00:50:56,344
With those reinforced soles,
you plan to wear them for a long time

672
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:58,722
to get your money's worth.

673
00:50:58,805 --> 00:50:59,806
Am I wrong?

674
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:07,439
Do the twins like chocolate cake?

675
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:10,358
I like strawberry cake.

676
00:51:10,942 --> 00:51:12,986
- Then, let's get both.
- Sounds good.

677
00:51:14,988 --> 00:51:15,989
Wait.

678
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:17,908
Mr. Han?

679
00:51:19,201 --> 00:51:20,243
What?

680
00:51:26,291 --> 00:51:27,417
Hello.

681
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:29,544
What are you doing here?

682
00:51:30,545 --> 00:51:34,007
I think Ms. Na Ji-won is…

683
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:41,181
What?

684
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:48,897
I was curious.

685
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:51,191
I wondered why you reached out first.

686
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:54,653
I have a meeting
with the agent in charge tomorrow,

687
00:51:54,736 --> 00:51:56,530
which means my profile isn't live yet.

688
00:51:57,739 --> 00:51:59,699
How did you get my number?

689
00:52:02,869 --> 00:52:03,870
How…

690
00:52:04,913 --> 00:52:06,164
What are you talking about?

691
00:52:06,832 --> 00:52:09,376
- I applied at the city hall...
- You're aware that

692
00:52:10,168 --> 00:52:12,754
it's a violation of privacy laws, right?

693
00:52:14,881 --> 00:52:16,424
It's okay.

694
00:52:17,717 --> 00:52:19,886
They just need to fit my criteria.

695
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:22,055
I couldn't care less about anything else.

696
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:26,893
What are the criteria?

697
00:52:30,063 --> 00:52:33,942
First, maintain a weight of 45 kg.

698
00:52:34,526 --> 00:52:36,778
I despise married women
who let themselves go.

699
00:52:37,362 --> 00:52:39,281
And no short hair.

700
00:52:39,364 --> 00:52:41,324
I prefer long, straight hair.

701
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:44,536
- What?
- I'll take care of the money.

702
00:52:44,619 --> 00:52:47,706
I'm asking you to take care of your body.

703
00:52:47,789 --> 00:52:50,083
We can satisfy each other's needs.

704
00:52:51,418 --> 00:52:53,545
- Are you done?
- No.

705
00:52:54,588 --> 00:52:59,426
Since our deal is still up in the air,
how about we confirm the goods today?

706
00:52:59,509 --> 00:53:01,011
What did you just say?

707
00:53:02,053 --> 00:53:04,139
- I'm not done speaking yet.
- Let go of me!

708
00:53:04,222 --> 00:53:05,682
What are you doing?

709
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:11,187
Who are you?

710
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:18,820
I'm Jeong Ha-na from Injeong City's
Marriage Morale Boost Team.

711
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:26,703
It looks like you're forcing her to stay
when she doesn't want to.

712
00:53:26,786 --> 00:53:28,788
What's your deal? Pyramid scheme?

713
00:53:30,582 --> 00:53:33,877
Would you like a taste firsthand
of the scary world we live in?

714
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:42,052
I don't know how this woman got my number,

715
00:53:43,011 --> 00:53:45,221
but she reached out first.

716
00:53:46,348 --> 00:53:51,269
How could the city be so careless
with a person's personal information?

717
00:53:56,149 --> 00:53:58,193
We were actually
about to reach out to you.

718
00:53:58,276 --> 00:54:01,905
We fact-checked
the application you submitted

719
00:54:01,988 --> 00:54:05,075
and discovered your 20 billion
in assets don't exist.

720
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:09,829
So, this is how it's going to be?

721
00:54:10,413 --> 00:54:14,501
Shall I tell you in detail what happens
when you lie on an official document?

722
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:17,545
Or you can just withdraw
your application now

723
00:54:17,629 --> 00:54:19,381
and pretend like this didn't happen.

724
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,468
Gosh. Are you looking for the door?

725
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:25,470
The exit is right there.

726
00:54:30,892 --> 00:54:32,185
Move aside.

727
00:54:34,187 --> 00:54:37,399
Call me if you want your hand held.
I'll do it for you.

728
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:55,834
So embarrassing.

729
00:54:55,917 --> 00:54:58,503
Did you get his number
from his application?

730
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:01,297
This is a crime.

731
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:04,050
I didn't think this would happen…

732
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:11,391
But still, you must have been startled.
Are you okay?

733
00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:16,646
Can I ask why you care
so much about credentials?

734
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:19,774
Doesn't everyone?

735
00:55:24,362 --> 00:55:26,072
Credentials are important.

736
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:28,158
I thought that too, at one point.

737
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:32,954
I thought a man with a good background
could embrace and protect me.

738
00:55:33,038 --> 00:55:35,165
I even almost married him.

739
00:55:36,207 --> 00:55:40,170
But in the end, we broke up
because he lost those credentials.

740
00:55:41,713 --> 00:55:43,798
I only realized this afterward.

741
00:55:45,633 --> 00:55:49,387
One's credentials can disappear
at any moment.

742
00:55:53,558 --> 00:55:55,602
I was actually a bit startled today.

743
00:55:56,519 --> 00:56:01,524
I just thought I'd be set if I married
the man who ranked the highest.

744
00:56:01,608 --> 00:56:07,030
But seeing him demand these
unbelievable things for the same reason…

745
00:56:10,909 --> 00:56:15,371
That's why the ranking
of a person doesn't matter.

746
00:56:16,247 --> 00:56:20,210
What matters is finding someone
you can be happy with

747
00:56:20,919 --> 00:56:23,505
for a long time.

748
00:56:24,839 --> 00:56:26,049
Okay.

749
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:35,266
I believe you're perfectly capable
of shining on your own merit.

750
00:56:36,684 --> 00:56:38,895
Are you trying to console me?

751
00:56:38,978 --> 00:56:40,522
In that awkward way?

752
00:56:43,858 --> 00:56:45,318
If you smiled, it's good enough.

753
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:57,956
I think you're a really good person.

754
00:56:58,998 --> 00:56:59,999
What do you mean?

755
00:57:01,126 --> 00:57:03,336
I'm just saying. I'm home.

756
00:57:05,338 --> 00:57:07,507
I get praised just for walking you home?

757
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:08,800
It's nice.

758
00:57:09,676 --> 00:57:10,677
Here.

759
00:57:13,304 --> 00:57:14,472
Enjoy.

760
00:57:15,223 --> 00:57:16,683
I'm off.

761
00:57:16,766 --> 00:57:19,060
- It's cold. Get back safely.
- Okay.

762
00:57:22,522 --> 00:57:25,942
<i>Even while saying
people shouldn't be ranked,</i>

763
00:57:26,025 --> 00:57:32,824
<i>I, too, could actually not help myself
from categorizing and rating them.</i>

764
00:57:33,533 --> 00:57:35,910
<i>Qualifications are definitely important,</i>

765
00:57:35,994 --> 00:57:41,040
<i>but they can change at any moment.</i>

766
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:44,502
<i>You never know
until you experience it yourself.</i>

767
00:57:44,586 --> 00:57:45,712
Hurry inside!

768
00:57:52,343 --> 00:57:57,474
<i>For that man who sets someone
rich in heart as his one criterion,</i>

769
00:57:57,557 --> 00:58:01,769
<i>what value could rankings
made by the world ever hold?</i>

770
00:58:01,853 --> 00:58:05,023
{\an8}CHEF'S SPECIAL
KATSUDON

771
00:58:05,607 --> 00:58:06,608
Here.

772
00:58:07,609 --> 00:58:09,402
This is on the house.

773
00:58:11,029 --> 00:58:12,572
Thank you.

774
00:58:12,655 --> 00:58:16,826
You haven't made a dent in your food
when lunchtime is almost over.

775
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:18,119
Do you not like it?

776
00:58:18,203 --> 00:58:21,331
No, it's not that.
I was just thinking about something.

777
00:58:21,414 --> 00:58:23,082
What had you so deep in thought?

778
00:58:25,793 --> 00:58:27,253
Someone told me

779
00:58:28,213 --> 00:58:31,341
that one's shoes show
where he stands in society.

780
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:37,805
So, I was trying to figure out
how close I was to the bottom.

781
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:40,683
Really?

782
00:58:42,435 --> 00:58:45,647
I'm always curious about people
who use one thing for a long time.

783
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:52,362
Don't you think they'd treat everything
in their life as if it were precious?

784
00:58:53,696 --> 00:58:55,323
Anyway, that's what I think.

785
00:58:56,115 --> 00:58:57,617
Take your time.

786
00:59:03,164 --> 00:59:06,084
SELLING MEN'S DESIGNER SHOES

787
00:59:06,167 --> 00:59:09,295
{\an8}<i>Are you still interested
in buying the shoes?</i>

788
00:59:09,796 --> 00:59:11,464
{\an8}<i>I'll knock off 50,000 won.</i>

789
00:59:12,215 --> 00:59:13,925
Sure. Right.

790
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:16,302
There's nothing wrong with my shoes.

791
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:19,347
No, thanks. I'm good.

792
00:59:32,068 --> 00:59:34,487
It seems Mr. Bong has no biases
against Ms. Oh.

793
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:36,406
I'm glad to hear it.

794
00:59:36,489 --> 00:59:39,867
Ms. Oh was worried
that Mr. Bong would feel burdened

795
00:59:39,951 --> 00:59:42,579
by the differences in their backgrounds.

796
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:45,415
I guess she could request a match now.

797
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:50,169
Mr. Bong actually cares more
about whether or not this connection

798
00:59:50,253 --> 00:59:52,463
could last, beyond qualifications.

799
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:00,138
I thought about that, too.

800
01:00:12,859 --> 01:00:14,694
I think I can do that now as well.

801
01:00:16,029 --> 01:00:17,155
Ms. Jeong.

802
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:28,207
Would that be all?

803
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:29,417
What?

804
01:00:32,587 --> 01:00:33,796
Yes.

805
01:00:36,549 --> 01:00:38,009
Am I free to leave?

806
01:00:39,427 --> 01:00:40,595
Sure.

807
01:00:41,721 --> 01:00:42,764
Okay.

808
01:00:51,022 --> 01:00:52,315
Unbelievable.

809
01:00:53,441 --> 01:00:54,776
What am I going to do?

810
01:00:55,902 --> 01:00:58,821
He's just so cute. I'm about to lose it.

811
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:02,325
Should I just press it?

812
01:01:02,408 --> 01:01:04,702
He won't think
my feelings are disingenuous, right?

813
01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:06,871
Are you okay?

814
01:01:06,954 --> 01:01:10,291
It might just look like a scratch,
but it'll hurt a lot later

815
01:01:10,375 --> 01:01:12,043
if you just leave it like that.

816
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:14,879
Should I…

817
01:01:14,962 --> 01:01:16,673
{\an8}What should I do? Just press it.

818
01:01:16,756 --> 01:01:18,591
{\an8}I can't. Just do it.

819
01:01:19,425 --> 01:01:21,094
{\an8}Press it. Just press it.

820
01:01:21,177 --> 01:01:23,179
I can't believe I pressed it.

821
01:01:23,262 --> 01:01:25,515
What do I do now? I pressed it.

822
01:01:27,767 --> 01:01:29,644
Oh, no. I can't cancel it.

823
01:02:03,803 --> 01:02:04,804
What?

824
01:02:09,976 --> 01:02:11,102
Cheol-hui?

825
01:02:15,898 --> 01:02:17,483
Where is he going?

826
01:02:50,933 --> 01:02:54,437
CHAIRMAN JIN SI-WAN

827
01:03:35,019 --> 01:03:36,145
Excuse me.

828
01:03:37,396 --> 01:03:38,815
<i>Try to find the courage.</i>

829
01:03:38,898 --> 01:03:42,610
<i>Being able to predict where
the other one will be is a positive.</i>

830
01:03:42,693 --> 01:03:45,279
{\an8}<i>We can avoid
unnecessary misunderstandings.</i>

831
01:03:45,363 --> 01:03:47,949
{\an8}<i>Suspicion leads to misunderstanding.</i>

832
01:03:48,032 --> 01:03:52,203
{\an8}<i>And when misunderstandings
start piling up, the trust is lost.</i>

833
01:03:52,787 --> 01:03:55,957
{\an8}<i>And relationships are completely ruined.</i>

834
01:03:56,666 --> 01:03:58,209
{\an8}<i>I can't log on.</i>

835
01:03:58,292 --> 01:04:01,379
{\an8}<i>Someone has logged into the server
and is stealing information.</i>

836
01:04:01,462 --> 01:04:04,006
{\an8}<i>I guess he wasn't
on the island five years ago.</i>

837
01:04:04,090 --> 01:04:06,133
{\an8}<i>Cheol-hui, don't tell me you have secrets.</i>

838
01:04:06,717 --> 01:04:09,554
{\an8}<i>Are the twins actually your kids
or something?</i>

839
01:04:10,555 --> 01:04:14,058
{\an8}<i>After doubt suddenly sets in,
I can't get it under control.</i>

840
01:04:14,141 --> 01:04:16,686
{\an8}But didn't you come here
to tell me something?

841
01:04:17,395 --> 01:04:19,105
{\an8}I was just taking a late-night walk.

842
01:04:19,188 --> 01:04:22,483
{\an8}Wow. Let's tear it up today.

843
01:04:22,567 --> 01:04:23,901
{\an8}<i>Are you sure you're okay?</i>

844
01:04:23,985 --> 01:04:25,319
{\an8}I'm going to trust you.

845
01:04:26,362 --> 01:04:27,738
{\an8}<i>I need to be honest.</i>

846
01:04:27,822 --> 01:04:30,157
<i>Secrets lead to misunderstandings.</i>

847
01:04:30,783 --> 01:04:33,452
<i>I have something to confess to you, Ha-na.</i>

848
01:04:34,495 --> 01:04:36,205
<i>Ha-na, is that okay with you?</i>

849
