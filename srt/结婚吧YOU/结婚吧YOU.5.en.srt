00:00:02,446 --> 00:00:09,558
(Marry YOU)

(Production supported by the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, Korea Creative Content Agency)

3
00:00:12,341 --> 00:00:13,709
(All places, organizations, and characters
in this drama are fictitious.)

4
00:00:13,709 --> 00:00:15,144
(Guidelines for the protection of minors
were kept when filming with child actors.)

5
00:00:16,345 --> 00:00:16,948
(Episode 5)

6
00:00:16,972 --> 00:00:18,647
Mister Cheol Hee.

7
00:00:18,915 --> 00:00:20,683
What is it? It's so late.

8
00:00:22,852 --> 00:00:24,153
Miss Ha Na.

9
00:00:24,487 --> 00:00:25,788
Yes?

10
00:00:25,855 --> 00:00:29,225
I came because I have something
that I have to tell you.

11
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:31,927
What is it?

12
00:00:32,562 --> 00:00:33,863
This...

13
00:00:35,298 --> 00:00:38,534
I can tell you only because I trust you.

14
00:00:41,871 --> 00:00:44,473
I have something to confess to you.

15
00:00:45,808 --> 00:00:47,243
Confess?

16
00:00:49,045 --> 00:00:50,446
I...

17
00:00:53,015 --> 00:00:54,984
What? Who's that?

18
00:00:55,651 --> 00:00:56,952
Who is it?!

19
00:01:02,925 --> 00:01:04,727
Mister Cheol Hee, what is it?

20
00:01:16,107 --> 00:01:19,710
(Get lost)

21
00:01:23,279 --> 00:01:27,249
The culprit was caught on your dashcam...

22
00:01:27,383 --> 00:01:30,619
but because he's wearing an umbrella,
it's hard to see his face.

23
00:01:30,853 --> 00:01:33,623
It's been popular among teenagers lately
to vandalize cars.

24
00:01:33,623 --> 00:01:35,424
It's highly likely that
this was another simple case...

25
00:01:35,424 --> 00:01:37,660
caused by them.

26
00:01:38,161 --> 00:01:39,395
But...

27
00:01:39,395 --> 00:01:42,264
that security camera seemed fine
up until yesterday.

28
00:01:42,765 --> 00:01:45,634
I'll check the dashcam footage
from the cars parked nearby...

29
00:01:45,668 --> 00:01:48,270
and get back to you.

30
00:01:48,638 --> 00:01:49,939
Okay.

31
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:52,074
- Let's go.
- Okay.

32
00:02:06,656 --> 00:02:08,524
What on earth is happening?

33
00:02:08,991 --> 00:02:10,993
Something's been feeling off lately.

34
00:02:13,996 --> 00:02:15,364
By the way, Mister Cheol Hee.

35
00:02:15,364 --> 00:02:16,365
Yes?

36
00:02:16,365 --> 00:02:18,467
What were you going to say earlier?

37
00:02:18,801 --> 00:02:21,337
Well...

38
00:02:24,273 --> 00:02:25,574
The thing is...

39
00:02:29,712 --> 00:02:32,214
It's about my past.

40
00:02:33,583 --> 00:02:37,953
I wanted to be honest with you.

41
00:02:40,623 --> 00:02:41,957
Your past?

42
00:02:42,992 --> 00:02:44,360
The truth is...

43
00:02:44,961 --> 00:02:48,063
I was a firefighter
up until five years ago.

44
00:02:51,467 --> 00:02:54,937
A big accident happened back then,
and I ended up quitting.

45
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:59,542
Since then,
I've been living on the island.

46
00:03:01,511 --> 00:03:06,081
The scars on my back
are also from back then.

47
00:03:12,855 --> 00:03:14,423
We are en route to the site.

48
00:03:14,423 --> 00:03:16,992
Currently searching the offices
in the upper floors.

49
00:03:17,393 --> 00:03:20,196
Requesting the support team to start
from the CEO's room on the lower floor.

50
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:22,765
Injeong 08 will arrive
within five minutes.

51
00:03:22,765 --> 00:03:24,667
I repeat, Injeong 08 will arrive
within five minutes.

52
00:03:33,822 --> 00:03:36,817
(Da Bin)

53
00:03:37,213 --> 00:03:38,781
Hi, Da Bin.

54
00:03:39,448 --> 00:03:41,417
Where are you? Why aren't you here yet?

55
00:03:42,852 --> 00:03:44,420
What can I say?

56
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,756
An emergency situation
has happened here...

57
00:03:46,756 --> 00:03:49,024
so I don't think I can make it.

58
00:03:49,592 --> 00:03:52,395
We've postponed the meeting
between our families twice now.

59
00:03:52,395 --> 00:03:54,130
Is there no one else to put out the fires?

60
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:55,965
Come on, I'm sorry.

61
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,669
I'll explain to them properly, so...

62
00:03:59,669 --> 00:04:01,537
You're always like this.

63
00:04:01,771 --> 00:04:04,173
You don't deserve to get married.

64
00:04:04,173 --> 00:04:07,376
You keep doing what you want to.
I don't have it in me to keep dating...

65
00:04:09,645 --> 00:04:12,849
- What?
- Injeong 08, hurry up. Mayday.

66
00:04:12,849 --> 00:04:15,518
- Da Bin?
- Person in need of rescue spotted.

67
00:04:15,518 --> 00:04:18,287
Where are you, Injeong 08? Hurry.

68
00:04:23,793 --> 00:04:27,663
But why did the people in suits come?

69
00:04:29,599 --> 00:04:31,133
You saw?

70
00:04:34,403 --> 00:04:36,706
They're the secretaries...

71
00:04:36,706 --> 00:04:38,808
of the company president that I saved.

72
00:04:40,076 --> 00:04:43,546
He said he was happy to see me
on social media after so long.

73
00:04:43,546 --> 00:04:45,781
I went to say hello.

74
00:04:52,622 --> 00:04:55,391
One survivor on the third floor.

75
00:04:55,391 --> 00:04:56,692
Sir.

76
00:04:58,928 --> 00:05:00,229
Sir, are you okay?

77
00:05:06,102 --> 00:05:07,403
Sir.

78
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:29,091
Sir.

79
00:05:29,692 --> 00:05:31,227
Pass beneath me.

80
00:05:42,538 --> 00:05:44,773
That's how I saved President Jin.

81
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:48,144
However, I found out later that day...

82
00:05:48,144 --> 00:05:50,012
that my girlfriend died in a car accident.

83
00:05:58,054 --> 00:06:01,223
I thought there must be reason...

84
00:06:01,591 --> 00:06:04,426
why it's so hard for you
to date someone again.

85
00:06:07,163 --> 00:06:10,833
Something like a memory
that's painful to remember.

86
00:06:12,134 --> 00:06:14,203
Just like me three years ago.

87
00:06:18,608 --> 00:06:22,144
Anyway, you're a good person,
not a bad one.

88
00:06:23,312 --> 00:06:25,314
A rescuer, not a mobster.

89
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:37,626
Thank you for trusting me.

90
00:06:38,794 --> 00:06:39,896
It's nothing.

91
00:06:39,896 --> 00:06:43,065
I'm grateful that you trusted me
and told me something difficult like that.

92
00:06:44,534 --> 00:06:47,370
Sorry for making you see
something so scary.

93
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:50,439
I'll look into this again tomorrow.

94
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,775
Okay. Then I'll be heading back now.

95
00:06:52,775 --> 00:06:54,076
Okay.

96
00:07:22,471 --> 00:07:24,673
Why's he so kind?

97
00:07:26,561 --> 00:07:29,097
(Get lost)

98
00:07:33,483 --> 00:07:36,418
The graffiti isn't the issue
with this car.

99
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:38,488
Pardon?

100
00:07:38,488 --> 00:07:40,289
It's way too old.

101
00:07:41,557 --> 00:07:42,858
I see...

102
00:07:43,659 --> 00:07:47,496
You've been riding such an old car.

103
00:07:48,364 --> 00:07:50,032
Look at this.

104
00:07:50,433 --> 00:07:51,834
This car is too old.

105
00:07:51,834 --> 00:07:55,338
Sir! My Sony will hear you.

106
00:07:55,338 --> 00:07:57,173
Who?

107
00:07:58,441 --> 00:07:59,809
My car.

108
00:08:01,277 --> 00:08:02,578
Right...

109
00:08:04,313 --> 00:08:07,016
Even if I fix this, it'll probably
keep having issues.

110
00:08:07,016 --> 00:08:09,051
So? Do you want me to fix it?

111
00:08:12,555 --> 00:08:14,023
This is your first car, isn't it?

112
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:16,292
That's right.

113
00:08:17,426 --> 00:08:20,429
People usually hesitate
if it's their first car.

114
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:24,533
But even your first love
has an expiration date.

115
00:08:26,836 --> 00:08:28,571
Try getting a new car.

116
00:08:29,071 --> 00:08:30,739
You'll be really excited all over again.

117
00:08:39,849 --> 00:08:41,884
People, things, and relationships...

118
00:08:42,151 --> 00:08:44,687
all have an expiration date.

119
00:08:46,689 --> 00:08:49,458
But to say that something is expired...

120
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:52,962
the memories you've made
may be too precious.

121
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:58,167
But even so, no one hates a new thrill.

122
00:08:59,569 --> 00:09:00,870
This is hard.

123
00:09:01,771 --> 00:09:05,440
Is this the end of me and Sony?

124
00:09:06,472 --> 00:09:07,811
(Episode 5)

125
00:09:07,835 --> 00:09:10,477
(Love's Expiration Date)

126
00:09:13,483 --> 00:09:14,817
Uncle.

127
00:09:14,817 --> 00:09:16,052
You're awake?

128
00:09:16,052 --> 00:09:18,187
Come sit down. Come on.

129
00:09:24,594 --> 00:09:26,061
Here.

130
00:09:27,763 --> 00:09:29,131
Let's eat.

131
00:09:30,032 --> 00:09:33,235
Why did you come back so late yesterday?

132
00:09:35,738 --> 00:09:38,140
There's a lot to explain...

133
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:41,811
but there was an issue
with Miss Ha Na's car.

134
00:09:43,513 --> 00:09:45,848
You shouldn't ask things like that.

135
00:09:45,848 --> 00:09:48,217
Uncle has his own private life.

136
00:09:50,453 --> 00:09:52,455
Let's eat. Let me give you some.

137
00:09:53,089 --> 00:09:54,490
I just want a little.

138
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:56,325
Why? What's wrong?

139
00:09:56,325 --> 00:10:00,172
My stomach doesn't feel great.
I'm constipated.

140
00:10:00,196 --> 00:10:01,997
Yuck.

141
00:10:03,099 --> 00:10:05,067
Hang on. Let me see.

142
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:10,239
- Does anywhere else hurt?
- No.

143
00:10:10,239 --> 00:10:13,241
I'll be fine once I poo.

144
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:19,281
Good morning.

145
00:10:33,629 --> 00:10:36,966
Miss supervisor, set the date
for my blind date right now.

146
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:38,667
Right now?

147
00:10:39,302 --> 00:10:40,870
Tomorrow's good, right?

148
00:10:41,537 --> 00:10:43,005
It's the weekend.

149
00:10:43,206 --> 00:10:45,174
No.

150
00:10:45,174 --> 00:10:47,677
I need to give him a day
to prepare his body and mind.

151
00:10:47,677 --> 00:10:49,812
Okay. Please tell him to meet me
on Sunday.

152
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,782
I also need to check
Mister Cheol Hee's schedule...

153
00:10:52,782 --> 00:10:54,750
Can I pick the location?

154
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,385
No.

155
00:10:56,385 --> 00:10:58,855
Should I ask Mister Cheol Hee too?

156
00:10:58,855 --> 00:11:00,389
No.

157
00:11:00,389 --> 00:11:02,358
He might be uncomfortable with it.

158
00:11:02,358 --> 00:11:03,659
I'll just take care of it.

159
00:11:03,659 --> 00:11:05,895
Anyway, I leave it up to you,
Miss supervisor.

160
00:11:06,028 --> 00:11:08,397
Also, I heard that during the date...

161
00:11:08,998 --> 00:11:11,901
you all come to help and stuff.

162
00:11:12,201 --> 00:11:14,370
What to do? I hate that.

163
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:15,938
That makes me so uncomfortable.

164
00:11:16,472 --> 00:11:20,076
It's like I'm stealing
their weekend pay...

165
00:11:20,076 --> 00:11:21,477
so I feel a bit bad.

166
00:11:21,477 --> 00:11:24,113
Tell them they can relax
this weekend. Okay?

167
00:11:24,113 --> 00:11:25,448
Bye!

168
00:11:29,886 --> 00:11:32,455
I'm the supervisor,
but there's nothing for me to supervise.

169
00:11:35,091 --> 00:11:38,647
Don't worry about me. Do well at work.

170
00:11:39,729 --> 00:11:41,297
You don't have a fever.

171
00:11:42,732 --> 00:11:44,834
I'll come back early today.

172
00:11:44,834 --> 00:11:46,868
Let's go to the hospital
if you keep feeling sick.

173
00:11:47,267 --> 00:11:47,813
Okay?

174
00:11:47,837 --> 00:11:49,005
Uncle.

175
00:11:49,005 --> 00:11:53,909
It's not his stomach that's in pain.
It's his heart.

176
00:11:54,243 --> 00:11:55,678
That's not true.

177
00:11:55,678 --> 00:11:59,091
It is true. Aren't you being like this
because you fell in love again?

178
00:11:59,115 --> 00:12:01,517
Did you fall for someone new?

179
00:12:01,517 --> 00:12:03,185
That's not true!

180
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,988
You sure you're not scared and in pain...

181
00:12:05,988 --> 00:12:08,124
worrying that you won't be able
to ask her out like last time?

182
00:12:08,257 --> 00:12:10,560
I said that's not true! It's not!

183
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,896
You can't ask her out and you can't poo!

184
00:12:13,896 --> 00:12:16,132
- No!
- San I don't run, you'll get a fever.

185
00:12:16,132 --> 00:12:18,300
- Come over here.
- San I.

186
00:12:24,807 --> 00:12:25,942
So why'd she come?

187
00:12:25,942 --> 00:12:28,845
Oh, she came to set a date
for her date with Mister Cheol hee.

188
00:12:28,845 --> 00:12:30,947
I see.

189
00:12:30,947 --> 00:12:32,915
She sure is enthusiastic.

190
00:12:33,783 --> 00:12:36,952
If one falls in and out of love quickly,
it'll cause issues.

191
00:12:38,888 --> 00:12:40,990
- You're back, sir?
- Yes.

192
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:43,292
What did the mayor want to talk about?

193
00:12:43,292 --> 00:12:45,027
To celebrate our first couple...

194
00:12:45,928 --> 00:12:47,930
he increased
our business operating expenses.

195
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:49,298
Is that so?

196
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,335
As for Mister Cheol Hee
and Miss In A's official date...

197
00:12:52,335 --> 00:12:55,070
- he has high expectations.
- As expected.

198
00:12:59,408 --> 00:13:01,577
Was it caught on the security camera?

199
00:13:01,577 --> 00:13:05,181
The security camera that was in front
really was smashed by the guy.

200
00:13:05,181 --> 00:13:07,583
Afterward, he disappeared
into a blind spot,

201
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:10,052
so he wasn't caught
on other security cameras, but...

202
00:13:10,386 --> 00:13:11,687
But what?

203
00:13:12,388 --> 00:13:15,991
We got footage from the dashcam
of another car that was parked far away.

204
00:13:16,092 --> 00:13:17,760
Did it get a shot of the culprit?

205
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,795
What does he look like?

206
00:13:20,696 --> 00:13:23,833
It's late at night, so it's hard to see.
I'll send it to the identification team.

207
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,136
How tall is this man?

208
00:13:27,236 --> 00:13:29,005
More than 175 cm?

209
00:13:29,005 --> 00:13:31,540
But all the kids are that tall these days.

210
00:13:32,775 --> 00:13:36,479
Please reinforce the patrols in that area
just in case.

211
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:39,348
There's nothing to do "just in case."

212
00:13:40,216 --> 00:13:42,518
Anyway, I'll call you
if anything else comes up.

213
00:13:44,387 --> 00:13:45,688
You can go now.

214
00:13:50,359 --> 00:13:52,027
Jeez.

215
00:13:56,933 --> 00:13:58,567
You scared me!

216
00:13:59,535 --> 00:14:02,805
What's with that look in your eye?
It's scary.

217
00:14:02,805 --> 00:14:04,106
Mister detective.

218
00:14:04,874 --> 00:14:08,277
If you don't do a good job,
I'll do it myself.

219
00:14:08,277 --> 00:14:09,712
Do what yourself?

220
00:14:09,712 --> 00:14:11,247
If anything comes up...

221
00:14:11,647 --> 00:14:14,416
you have to call me, okay?

222
00:14:15,718 --> 00:14:18,420
Okay...

223
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:23,759
Sheesh.

224
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:28,964
Welcome.

225
00:14:29,131 --> 00:14:30,132
Hey.

226
00:14:30,132 --> 00:14:32,468
Why are you here today?

227
00:14:33,836 --> 00:14:37,473
Is that really how you say thank you?

228
00:14:37,607 --> 00:14:42,111
Thanks to our wonderful and merciful boss
letting us borrow her shop...

229
00:14:42,111 --> 00:14:44,814
we were able to create our first couple.

230
00:14:45,414 --> 00:14:49,051
But are you not busy? It's quite early.

231
00:14:49,051 --> 00:14:50,553
I came to see Mister Cheol Hee.

232
00:14:50,553 --> 00:14:51,588
What?

233
00:14:51,612 --> 00:14:53,981
He said he'll be late
because he has something to do today.

234
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:56,358
I see.

235
00:14:57,326 --> 00:15:00,162
You sure work hard, Ha Na.

236
00:15:00,196 --> 00:15:03,766
So, is there anyone who would suit me?

237
00:15:04,567 --> 00:15:07,470
You were already married once.
Do you really want to be married again?

238
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:08,904
Of course!

239
00:15:09,038 --> 00:15:11,683
I was too young back then.

240
00:15:11,707 --> 00:15:15,511
I thought loving him was enough.

241
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:19,115
Was it not?

242
00:15:19,749 --> 00:15:21,551
In marriage...

243
00:15:21,551 --> 00:15:26,322
you need to have the mindset to maintain
a relationship forever...

244
00:15:26,589 --> 00:15:29,024
even if your love for them fades.

245
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,228
Forever?

246
00:15:34,363 --> 00:15:36,399
What's on Oh In A's mind...

247
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:39,401
as she makes these moves?

248
00:15:47,376 --> 00:15:48,677
Yes, Miss Ha Na?

249
00:15:48,911 --> 00:15:49,912
Hello.

250
00:15:49,912 --> 00:15:52,715
We're going to officially proceed
with your date with Miss Oh In A.

251
00:15:52,715 --> 00:15:54,850
Do you have time this weekend?

252
00:15:54,917 --> 00:15:57,119
Sure.

253
00:15:57,119 --> 00:16:00,122
Then I'll send you the time and address.

254
00:16:00,156 --> 00:16:02,324
Does that mean you're not coming?

255
00:16:02,525 --> 00:16:05,261
I'm not coming.

256
00:16:05,601 --> 00:16:09,504
Miss Oh In A requested
the two of you meet by yourselves.

257
00:16:09,932 --> 00:16:12,034
Then what are you doing this weekend?

258
00:16:12,502 --> 00:16:15,070
- Me?
- Yes.

259
00:16:15,571 --> 00:16:17,974
It's just that I feel like I'm always
talking about myself.

260
00:16:17,974 --> 00:16:20,075
I never asked about the things you do.

261
00:16:22,578 --> 00:16:25,830
Well, weekends are the same for me.

262
00:16:27,049 --> 00:16:29,418
I'll go singing...

263
00:16:29,418 --> 00:16:31,086
and I have some things to buy.

264
00:16:32,388 --> 00:16:34,657
It'll be the first peaceful weekend
in a while.

265
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:39,094
I'm planning to wrap up my weekend
with good news from you.

266
00:16:40,096 --> 00:16:43,299
As expected, you have it all planned out.

267
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:46,669
So you better focus on the plan...

268
00:16:46,669 --> 00:16:48,537
so that you can tell me good news.

269
00:16:48,571 --> 00:16:51,173
Okay. Don't worry.

270
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:53,576
Keep up the great work.

271
00:17:08,391 --> 00:17:09,725
Yes.

272
00:17:10,126 --> 00:17:11,794
Okay.

273
00:17:12,128 --> 00:17:13,529
I'll leave it in your care.

274
00:17:13,963 --> 00:17:15,264
Okay.

275
00:17:24,354 --> 00:17:25,441
(Miss Ha Na)

276
00:17:25,441 --> 00:17:26,742
Today's style...

277
00:17:26,742 --> 00:17:29,979
should be a dandy outfit
that suits a restaurant with a jazz vibe.

278
00:17:35,418 --> 00:17:37,053
Did I come too early?

279
00:17:37,053 --> 00:17:38,521
Ha Na!

280
00:17:40,089 --> 00:17:41,290
What?

281
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:43,159
It's not Ha Na.

282
00:17:46,128 --> 00:17:48,230
What are you two going outside for?!

283
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,932
Mister Cheol Hee.

284
00:17:51,167 --> 00:17:52,969
You're here early.

285
00:17:52,969 --> 00:17:56,539
Of course I should be quick
when there's someone I want to see.

286
00:17:57,974 --> 00:18:00,142
These are my nephews.

287
00:18:00,476 --> 00:18:02,478
Hello.

288
00:18:02,478 --> 00:18:03,913
They're so cute!

289
00:18:03,913 --> 00:18:04,914
Say hello.

290
00:18:04,914 --> 00:18:07,049
- Hello.
- Hello.

291
00:18:07,049 --> 00:18:09,385
Auntie Young Eun
will come get you guys soon...

292
00:18:09,385 --> 00:18:11,787
so go inside. I'll be back.

293
00:18:11,787 --> 00:18:13,222
- Okay.
- Okay.

294
00:18:13,556 --> 00:18:15,090
Goodbye.

295
00:18:15,224 --> 00:18:17,393
See you two next time.

296
00:18:19,629 --> 00:18:20,930
Let's go.

297
00:18:22,498 --> 00:18:23,833
Go inside!

298
00:18:32,608 --> 00:18:36,011
Hurry and head inside. I'll be back.

299
00:18:39,015 --> 00:18:43,252
Where's Ha Na? Who's that?

300
00:18:43,252 --> 00:18:45,788
If it goes like this
then it turns into soap drama.

301
00:18:59,702 --> 00:19:02,037
How long has it been since I got a break?

302
00:19:05,007 --> 00:19:06,876
Come take a look at your car tomorrow.

303
00:19:11,514 --> 00:19:14,049
A big accident happened back then,
and I ended up quitting.

304
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:18,220
Since then,
I've been living on the island.

305
00:19:18,421 --> 00:19:23,025
The scars on my back
are also from back then.

306
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:27,196
I wonder if their date is going well.

307
00:19:28,998 --> 00:19:31,133
He's a person with a lot of wounds.

308
00:19:33,669 --> 00:19:35,671
Why did it have to be Oh In A?

309
00:19:36,572 --> 00:19:38,908
No. Come to your senses, Ha Na!

310
00:19:39,242 --> 00:19:43,112
If things go well with Mister Cheol Hee,
I'll be able to go back to my normal life.

311
00:19:43,412 --> 00:19:44,980
That's a good thing.

312
00:19:48,584 --> 00:19:51,687
As for today, I'll have some fun!

313
00:20:08,171 --> 00:20:09,572
This is my first time.

314
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,541
What is?

315
00:20:13,242 --> 00:20:16,412
This is my first time
having a man in this car...

316
00:20:16,412 --> 00:20:18,347
that's not my secretary.

317
00:20:20,116 --> 00:20:23,753
But it seems it hasn't been long
since you changed your car.

318
00:20:23,753 --> 00:20:25,354
Is this new?

319
00:20:25,354 --> 00:20:28,124
You could've pretended to not notice.

320
00:20:29,525 --> 00:20:32,495
I'm also going to be new starting today.

321
00:20:32,495 --> 00:20:35,164
What does that mean?

322
00:20:35,898 --> 00:20:38,701
Since you're being so honest to me...

323
00:20:38,701 --> 00:20:40,669
I should be honest with you too.

324
00:20:40,937 --> 00:20:44,172
Did you really have a secret?

325
00:20:44,507 --> 00:20:47,143
Well, I wouldn't call it a secret.

326
00:20:47,977 --> 00:20:49,278
The thing is...

327
00:20:50,413 --> 00:20:53,048
five years ago...

328
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:55,851
I was a firefighter.

329
00:20:56,786 --> 00:20:58,154
911?

330
00:20:59,055 --> 00:21:00,422
Yes.

331
00:21:00,756 --> 00:21:02,024
I see.

332
00:21:02,024 --> 00:21:05,427
Your occupation
was set as a fishery manager right now.

333
00:21:05,828 --> 00:21:07,530
But why did you quit?

334
00:21:07,997 --> 00:21:10,700
Well...

335
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,735
Because it wasn't good money?

336
00:21:12,735 --> 00:21:14,670
I heard from somewhere...

337
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:17,740
compared to how dangerous the job is,
they pay you very little.

338
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,608
Well...

339
00:21:19,909 --> 00:21:22,311
They should give you
a lot more hazard pay.

340
00:21:22,311 --> 00:21:24,513
That's why they lost such a talent.

341
00:21:24,714 --> 00:21:25,982
That's right.

342
00:21:25,982 --> 00:21:27,283
So?

343
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:29,685
Did you quit altogether?

344
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,788
Now, I like living
as an island bachelor more.

345
00:21:36,792 --> 00:21:38,961
You really did become more honest.

346
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:41,964
I like you more now.

348
00:21:54,477 --> 00:21:58,079

349

350
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:05,021

352
00:22:08,024 --> 00:22:09,757
She's getting worse and worse.

353
00:22:10,026 --> 00:22:11,560

356
00:23:15,446 --> 00:23:17,814
Why is there no one else here?

357
00:23:18,115 --> 00:23:20,584
This restaurant might go out of business
by tomorrow.

358
00:23:21,652 --> 00:23:22,953
This restaurant?

359
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,532
It's hard to make reservations here.

360
00:23:25,556 --> 00:23:26,957
Really?

361
00:23:30,527 --> 00:23:33,463
I guess Miss Ha Na
reserved the entire restaurant.

362
00:23:34,264 --> 00:23:35,599
I did.

363
00:23:36,567 --> 00:23:39,369
I wanted to spend quality time,
just the two of us.

364
00:23:42,773 --> 00:23:44,074
Quality...

365
00:23:48,512 --> 00:23:49,813
Thank you.

366
00:23:51,048 --> 00:23:52,349
Thank you.

367
00:23:52,916 --> 00:23:54,318
Miss In A.

368
00:23:55,185 --> 00:23:56,586
Have some of this.

369
00:23:57,087 --> 00:23:58,388
Thank you.

370
00:23:58,689 --> 00:24:02,459
So, what kind of person do you like,
Mister Cheol Hee?

371
00:24:05,429 --> 00:24:06,730
I...

372
00:24:08,132 --> 00:24:10,167
like people who put me at ease.

373
00:24:10,167 --> 00:24:11,468
Really?

374
00:24:12,369 --> 00:24:14,571
I've never heard someone say that before.

375
00:24:14,838 --> 00:24:18,685
You know how people work hard
in the beginning to look good?

376
00:24:18,709 --> 00:24:20,477
It's exciting.

377
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:24,148
I want a relationship...

378
00:24:24,148 --> 00:24:28,252
where we're stable
and planning for the future...

379
00:24:28,252 --> 00:24:30,354
even once that excitement goes away.

380
00:24:31,322 --> 00:24:35,158
After all, marriage is
a once-in-a-lifetime thing.

381
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:40,964
I like someone who's fun to be around.

382
00:24:42,566 --> 00:24:45,135
And...

383
00:24:45,602 --> 00:24:47,237
you're fun
because you make me curious.

384
00:24:48,405 --> 00:24:49,806
Miss In A.

385
00:24:51,175 --> 00:24:54,511
Can you guess, what the name
of a line only fisherman can go to?

386
00:24:55,746 --> 00:24:58,282
A line only fisherman can go to?

387
00:24:58,682 --> 00:25:01,051
Is this something to do
with your future plans?

388
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:03,720
Fin...

389
00:25:05,689 --> 00:25:06,990
ish line.

390
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,495
Finish Line.

391
00:25:12,062 --> 00:25:13,730
That's funny...

392
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:16,000
(A Year in the Mediterranean)

393
00:25:22,965 --> 00:25:27,330
(I wanted to come here
at least once in my life.)

394
00:25:46,964 --> 00:25:49,500
She sang 15 songs at the music academy.

395
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:53,237
It was one song that I sang 15 times.

396
00:25:53,237 --> 00:25:56,306
They were all the same song...?

397
00:26:06,617 --> 00:26:09,086
- I...
- Who are you and why are you stalking me?

398
00:26:09,086 --> 00:26:11,388
You did that to my car, didn't you?

399
00:26:11,388 --> 00:26:13,123
Why on earth are you stalking me?!

400
00:26:13,123 --> 00:26:14,992
- Who are you?!
- I'm not that kind of person...

401
00:26:20,497 --> 00:26:22,299
I was caught.

402
00:26:22,299 --> 00:26:23,600
Okay.

403
00:26:24,635 --> 00:26:25,936
Here.

404
00:26:29,306 --> 00:26:30,607
Miss Ha Na.

405
00:26:31,008 --> 00:26:32,376
Mister Cheol Hee?

406
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:35,579
That's right!

407
00:26:35,579 --> 00:26:39,183
Now, here's a division question.

408
00:26:39,183 --> 00:26:41,285
What's eight divided by four?

409
00:26:44,054 --> 00:26:45,389
Eight...

410
00:26:45,965 --> 00:26:49,569
- Imagine you guys have 80 dollars.
- Yes.

411
00:26:49,593 --> 00:26:53,030
But you have to invest it in four places.

412
00:26:53,364 --> 00:26:55,966
How much can you invest in each place?

413
00:26:55,966 --> 00:26:58,202
Do I have to invest it in four places?

414
00:26:58,202 --> 00:26:59,646
I don't even have that much money.

415
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:02,873
How about splitting it in half
and putting it in two places?

416
00:27:06,644 --> 00:27:09,079
I want to eat half-half chicken.

417
00:27:09,179 --> 00:27:10,480
Seriously.

418
00:27:11,015 --> 00:27:12,416
Welcome...

419
00:27:14,218 --> 00:27:15,719
- What?
- What?

420
00:27:20,557 --> 00:27:23,327
Don't worry about me. Enjoy your date.

421
00:27:23,327 --> 00:27:25,729
If he shows up, I'll seriously...!

422
00:27:25,729 --> 00:27:27,865
This is why I had him follow you around.

423
00:27:27,865 --> 00:27:29,400
I was worried.

424
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,934
Jeez.

425
00:27:31,602 --> 00:27:34,247
All right, I get it.
I'll call you when I'm done.

426
00:27:34,271 --> 00:27:35,572
Okay.

427
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:46,383
It would've been good if you were just
honest from the beginning.

428
00:27:46,383 --> 00:27:48,885
He told me to watch you and make sure
you don't find out...

429
00:27:49,386 --> 00:27:51,755
You were so obvious.

430
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:56,259
Then you'll be
going with me for today, right?

431
00:27:57,494 --> 00:27:58,929
Let's go!

432
00:27:59,096 --> 00:28:00,397
Okay.

433
00:28:08,639 --> 00:28:10,374
Sorry about that.

434
00:28:12,609 --> 00:28:14,011
Was it Ha Na?

435
00:28:15,112 --> 00:28:16,413
Did she say something happened?

436
00:28:16,413 --> 00:28:18,081
It wasn't too serious.

437
00:28:18,382 --> 00:28:20,951
I didn't tell Miss Ha Na...

438
00:28:20,951 --> 00:28:23,053
that I asked someone I know
to watch over her.

439
00:28:23,053 --> 00:28:25,122
That's why.

440
00:28:25,556 --> 00:28:26,857
Ha Na?

441
00:28:27,458 --> 00:28:28,859
You asked someone to watch over her?

442
00:28:28,859 --> 00:28:31,128
Not Ba Da and San I?

443
00:28:31,495 --> 00:28:34,029
Ba Da and San I can protect themselves.

444
00:28:34,098 --> 00:28:35,966
Miss Ha Na is the problem.

445
00:28:38,836 --> 00:28:40,671
I guess you two got really close.

446
00:28:40,671 --> 00:28:41,805
Sorry?

447
00:28:41,805 --> 00:28:46,176
You've been constantly checking
your messages since earlier.

448
00:28:47,544 --> 00:28:50,347
You kept doing that as if someone
was going to contact you.

449
00:28:51,548 --> 00:28:52,849
I see...

450
00:29:02,726 --> 00:29:05,029
You must've seen the sign out front.

451
00:29:05,029 --> 00:29:06,897
I came in because I was hungry...

452
00:29:10,467 --> 00:29:14,438
I'm reminded of the idiom,
"kill them with kindness."

453
00:29:29,086 --> 00:29:31,755
Why are Mister Cheol Hee's nephews here?

454
00:29:31,755 --> 00:29:34,892
You should know Mister Cheol Hee
is on his date today.

455
00:29:34,892 --> 00:29:36,894
Their daycare isn't open today
because it's a holiday.

456
00:29:36,894 --> 00:29:40,909
The kids' cafe was closed
because the owner was busy.

457
00:29:41,165 --> 00:29:42,499
I see...

458
00:29:43,367 --> 00:29:46,003
In order to help Ha Na escape...

459
00:29:46,003 --> 00:29:47,471
this is the least I can do.

460
00:29:50,607 --> 00:29:52,576
I wonder if Ha Na isn't coming today...

461
00:29:53,677 --> 00:29:55,078
Young Eun!

462
00:29:55,646 --> 00:29:56,947
Speak of the devil.

463
00:30:01,719 --> 00:30:03,020
You're here!

464
00:30:07,324 --> 00:30:08,959
Who's this?

465
00:30:15,933 --> 00:30:17,534
You seem to be doing well.

466
00:30:17,534 --> 00:30:19,534
It's not what you think.

467
00:30:20,904 --> 00:30:22,239
Hello.

468
00:30:22,239 --> 00:30:25,609
Hello, I'm Ha Na's closest friend...

469
00:30:25,609 --> 00:30:27,645
- and the owner of this place.
- I see.

470
00:30:27,645 --> 00:30:29,747
I heard this place is popular
for its homely food.

471
00:30:29,747 --> 00:30:32,983
It seems Ha Na said something
that's very accurate.

472
00:30:35,853 --> 00:30:37,688
What's Ki Jun doing here?

473
00:30:37,721 --> 00:30:39,790
It seems he's not done yet.

474
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:41,591
With what?

475
00:30:47,197 --> 00:30:49,299
What is this now?

476
00:30:49,767 --> 00:30:51,535
Probably revenge for the affair.

477
00:30:52,036 --> 00:30:54,538
This is going to create problems.

478
00:30:54,538 --> 00:30:55,839
Yeah.

479
00:30:59,443 --> 00:31:01,645
If you're done eating, you should pay up.

480
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:05,649
I'm not done eating yet.

481
00:31:05,649 --> 00:31:07,451
You basically are.

482
00:31:09,386 --> 00:31:12,489
Kids, go play outside with him.

483
00:31:12,489 --> 00:31:15,492
- I just started eating...
- No, you're done.

484
00:31:16,093 --> 00:31:18,495
Go play outside, kids.

485
00:31:18,495 --> 00:31:20,464
Why are you doing this all of a sudden...?

486
00:31:20,464 --> 00:31:22,066
Wait...

487
00:31:22,066 --> 00:31:23,800
Take a hint and get out.

488
00:31:24,068 --> 00:31:26,270
- But...
- Hurry and leave.

489
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:28,038
Have fun, kids!

490
00:31:44,455 --> 00:31:45,756
What are you doing?

491
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:49,826
Did your butt wounds from that day heal?

492
00:31:51,628 --> 00:31:52,630
Right...

493
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:54,198
It hurt a lot, didn't it?

494
00:31:54,198 --> 00:31:57,467
No, it's all better now
thanks to you guys.

495
00:31:57,768 --> 00:32:01,271
But why is Ha Na meeting with
a different guy?

496
00:32:01,405 --> 00:32:02,706
What?

497
00:32:03,641 --> 00:32:06,310
Why is uncle meeting with another girl?

498
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:09,179
Did the two of them fight or something?

499
00:32:09,913 --> 00:32:12,115
The thing is,

500
00:32:13,651 --> 00:32:15,686
in the world of adults...

501
00:32:15,953 --> 00:32:20,157
there are some things that are
too hard to explain to children.

502
00:32:22,726 --> 00:32:25,162
It's even worse in the world of children.

503
00:32:26,263 --> 00:32:30,834
Even my partner cheated on me
the day before yesterday too.

504
00:32:31,735 --> 00:32:34,571
That's why he's been in pain.
He couldn't poo.

505
00:32:35,773 --> 00:32:37,641
What'd you say that for?

506
00:32:37,641 --> 00:32:39,443
I was just worried about you.

507
00:32:39,443 --> 00:32:40,744
Come on, enough of that.

508
00:32:40,978 --> 00:32:44,591
Anyway, don't worry.
It's not what you guys think.

509
00:32:44,615 --> 00:32:45,849
Right?

510
00:32:45,849 --> 00:32:48,519
Ha Na is uncle's partner.

511
00:32:48,519 --> 00:32:50,220
There's no way they'd do that.

512
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:54,491
"Partner"...

513
00:33:00,164 --> 00:33:03,434
Is this the tanghulu I've seen on TV?

514
00:33:03,434 --> 00:33:04,901
That's right.

515
00:33:05,002 --> 00:33:08,472
This is the tanghulu that's been trending.

516
00:33:08,839 --> 00:33:10,150
How is it?

517
00:33:10,174 --> 00:33:11,842
- It's the best.
- It's the best.

518
00:33:13,243 --> 00:33:17,247
Doesn't this remind you of when
we went to Everland with dad?

519
00:33:17,247 --> 00:33:18,491
Yeah.

520
00:33:18,515 --> 00:33:20,017
Dad?

521
00:33:20,017 --> 00:33:24,088
He's somewhere in Seoul
trying to find success.

522
00:33:24,088 --> 00:33:27,057
He said he'd come get us
once we turn ten years old.

523
00:33:27,458 --> 00:33:28,759
Right...

524
00:33:29,193 --> 00:33:30,927
How old are you guys now?

525
00:33:31,595 --> 00:33:33,463
Ten.

526
00:33:51,415 --> 00:33:55,986
How did you end up
taking care of your nephews?

527
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,288
It must not have been easy.

528
00:33:59,657 --> 00:34:00,958
It was easy.

529
00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:03,160
They're my nephews, after all.

530
00:34:05,429 --> 00:34:07,998
My parents passed away from an accident
when I was young.

531
00:34:07,998 --> 00:34:09,967
Me and my brother grew up together,
just the two of us.

532
00:34:10,868 --> 00:34:12,703
They're my brother's kids.

533
00:34:12,703 --> 00:34:14,204
They're no different from my own.

534
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,341
Even so...

535
00:34:17,574 --> 00:34:20,844
they might make your future
more difficult.

536
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:23,347
It's thanks to them...

537
00:34:23,347 --> 00:34:25,625
that I'm living like a proper human.

538
00:34:25,649 --> 00:34:26,984
Oh no...

539
00:34:26,984 --> 00:34:29,052
I said something wrong, didn't I?

540
00:34:29,586 --> 00:34:31,154
That's not it.

541
00:34:31,255 --> 00:34:35,359
I'm just saying that
they give me the strength to live.

542
00:34:40,597 --> 00:34:46,103
You really are a kind and positive person.

543
00:34:47,838 --> 00:34:49,139
But...

544
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:55,612
are my nephews too much for you?

545
00:34:58,882 --> 00:35:00,484
Well...

546
00:35:11,362 --> 00:35:12,729
Move over.

547
00:35:16,266 --> 00:35:19,603
Mister Cheol Hee sure is attentive.

548
00:35:19,603 --> 00:35:21,972
He even had someone he knows
to watch over you.

549
00:35:22,512 --> 00:35:23,512
Yes.

550
00:35:24,578 --> 00:35:25,709
He sure is.

551
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:28,545
Is this a sign?

552
00:35:29,013 --> 00:35:30,314
Come on.

553
00:35:31,248 --> 00:35:32,950
What's your name?

554
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:34,718
I'm Jung Seong Chan.

555
00:35:34,718 --> 00:35:36,954
Even your name is pretty.
How old are you?

556
00:35:36,954 --> 00:35:37,988
I'm 25.

557
00:35:37,988 --> 00:35:41,058
That's perfect.
Do you have a girlfriend?

558
00:35:41,058 --> 00:35:43,994
- I don't.
- You don't? Even better.

559
00:35:43,994 --> 00:35:45,829
- What's perfect?
- What? This is perfect.

560
00:35:45,829 --> 00:35:47,698
I'm trying to help you.

561
00:35:47,698 --> 00:35:51,335
Mister Seong Chan, why don't you
sign up for our marriage scam team?

562
00:35:51,335 --> 00:35:53,437
It's a promotion team, not a scam team.

563
00:35:53,437 --> 00:35:54,838
Do you have any plans to get married?

564
00:35:54,838 --> 00:35:57,641
It's not that I don't want to.

565
00:35:57,641 --> 00:35:59,877
I just don't know if I should want to...

566
00:35:59,877 --> 00:36:01,011
Why?

567
00:36:01,011 --> 00:36:03,047
I'm not good at settling down...

568
00:36:03,047 --> 00:36:05,282
so my relationships don't last long.

569
00:36:05,282 --> 00:36:09,286
The feelings flare up
and die just as quickly.

570
00:36:09,286 --> 00:36:11,155
You're one of those bad boys.

571
00:36:11,155 --> 00:36:12,856
You'll hurt your partner's feelings.

572
00:36:12,856 --> 00:36:14,658
I take back asking you to sign up.

573
00:36:15,859 --> 00:36:17,160
By the way...

574
00:36:18,262 --> 00:36:20,297
did you apply for it?

575
00:36:22,299 --> 00:36:24,201
I'm a divorcee.

576
00:36:24,201 --> 00:36:25,403
Right...

577
00:36:25,427 --> 00:36:28,736
I guess you might not want to do it again.

578
00:36:29,306 --> 00:36:33,343
I want to. This time, I'll do a great job.

579
00:36:34,378 --> 00:36:38,081
Then will I be able to meet
people like you if I sign up?

580
00:36:38,882 --> 00:36:41,318
If you talk like that, I'll misunderstand.

581
00:36:41,318 --> 00:36:44,688
Why?
Do you think you can meet someone like me?

582
00:36:44,688 --> 00:36:45,723
Yes.

583
00:36:45,723 --> 00:36:48,659
If you look at me with those doe eyes,
my heart...

584
00:36:48,659 --> 00:36:50,227
Butterflies...

585
00:36:50,761 --> 00:36:53,297
can come even in a short amount of time.

586
00:36:54,598 --> 00:36:58,702
However, the amount of time
that they last...

587
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:01,305
depends on the person.

588
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:05,342
Once those butterflies fade away...

589
00:37:05,976 --> 00:37:10,247
with what feelings
should a relationship be maintained?

590
00:37:14,725 --> 00:37:17,903
(Team Leader Choi Ki Jun)

591
00:37:21,158 --> 00:37:23,460
I wonder if their date is over yet.

592
00:37:28,899 --> 00:37:30,801
Are you ready for our next destination?

593
00:37:31,568 --> 00:37:33,503
We're going to another place?

594
00:37:36,206 --> 00:37:39,409
Please send me the schedule ahead of time
the next time we meet.

595
00:37:40,611 --> 00:37:43,146
There's a bar that I like
in our neighborhood.

596
00:37:43,347 --> 00:37:44,648
Let's go there.

597
00:37:47,051 --> 00:37:49,453
But today...

598
00:37:49,453 --> 00:37:53,624
I'm tired from driving all day.

599
00:37:55,459 --> 00:37:58,161
You'll come with me, won't you?

600
00:37:58,562 --> 00:38:02,099
All right. I'll go.

601
00:38:09,673 --> 00:38:10,974
Ha Na?

602
00:38:18,115 --> 00:38:19,247
You're alone?

603
00:38:19,583 --> 00:38:21,385
Yes. Where are the twins?

604
00:38:21,585 --> 00:38:24,121
I played with them all day.
I dropped them off just now.

605
00:38:24,121 --> 00:38:26,056
Good job.

606
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:29,493
I think Mister Cheol Hee
will be late today.

607
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,362
You know the bar in front of In A's house?

608
00:38:31,362 --> 00:38:34,464
She doesn't take anyone there,
but she's taking him there.

609
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:39,369
Oh In A seems determined.
Well, that's a good thing.

610
00:38:40,771 --> 00:38:43,240
They're drinking this late at night?

611
00:38:44,908 --> 00:38:46,243
But...

612
00:38:47,211 --> 00:38:49,379
who was that guy from earlier?

613
00:38:50,047 --> 00:38:51,715
Him?

614
00:38:54,018 --> 00:38:55,319
I got a call.

615
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,555
Yes, I'm heading home.

616
00:38:59,923 --> 00:39:01,224
Yes.

617
00:39:01,659 --> 00:39:03,226
It sure is cold today.

618
00:39:06,563 --> 00:39:09,833
Make sure to lock your door properly.
Our neighborhood has been a mess lately.

619
00:39:10,434 --> 00:39:11,969
Okay, bye.

620
00:39:23,047 --> 00:39:25,349
I bet Oh In A is trying to make a move.

621
00:39:30,587 --> 00:39:32,222
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

622
00:39:54,912 --> 00:39:57,281
This is great.

623
00:39:58,682 --> 00:40:00,751
You should slow down.

624
00:40:04,021 --> 00:40:05,722
I think I was too nervous.

625
00:40:07,825 --> 00:40:09,126
Sorry?

626
00:40:09,326 --> 00:40:11,628
What did you just say?

627
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:15,766
I think I was too nervous.

628
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:17,668
Really?

629
00:40:17,935 --> 00:40:19,269
Wait...

630
00:40:21,605 --> 00:40:24,841
Hang on. I'll go get some water.

631
00:40:39,423 --> 00:40:41,024
See?

632
00:40:42,393 --> 00:40:44,895
Mister Cheol Hee is also nice to me.

633
00:40:51,068 --> 00:40:52,936
I'm only going to check.

634
00:40:53,337 --> 00:40:57,274
Since I'm his supervisor,
this is just simple risk management.

635
00:41:07,985 --> 00:41:09,386
By the way,

636
00:41:10,187 --> 00:41:13,757
I like how my heart beats like this...

637
00:41:13,991 --> 00:41:17,661
when I'm with you.

638
00:41:18,429 --> 00:41:19,830
I see...

639
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:26,937
So this is what it's like
to have butterflies.

640
00:41:27,871 --> 00:41:29,172
Right...

641
00:41:30,407 --> 00:41:32,409
Well...

642
00:42:01,939 --> 00:42:03,740
What is she doing?!

643
00:42:10,648 --> 00:42:11,949
What?

644
00:42:14,785 --> 00:42:16,687
What are you doing here?

645
00:42:17,655 --> 00:42:20,424
Why did you follow me?

646
00:42:20,591 --> 00:42:23,260
I made a promise with Cheol Hee...

647
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:25,162
to bring you home safely.

648
00:42:25,596 --> 00:42:28,198
What are you doing here?

649
00:42:28,365 --> 00:42:30,901
I...

650
00:42:30,901 --> 00:42:32,703
I'm Mister Cheol Hee's supervisor.

651
00:42:32,703 --> 00:42:36,140
I was going to see if his date
was going well.

652
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:38,809
Do you even know what time it is?

653
00:42:39,109 --> 00:42:40,811
Do government workers not clock out?

654
00:42:40,811 --> 00:42:43,280
I was going to.

655
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,482
I was technically home for a second.

656
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,661
Get in.

657
00:42:59,063 --> 00:43:01,365
- To Injeong-dong, sir.
- Okay.

658
00:43:13,143 --> 00:43:15,012
Why did I go there?

659
00:43:18,582 --> 00:43:20,917
They're not still together, are they?

660
00:43:25,990 --> 00:43:29,159
What on earth am I thinking about?

661
00:43:31,589 --> 00:43:34,225
(Injeong City Hall)

662
00:43:39,069 --> 00:43:40,871
Come in.

663
00:43:42,973 --> 00:43:44,708
Team Leader Choi.

664
00:43:48,278 --> 00:43:49,680
You called for me?

665
00:43:51,548 --> 00:43:52,916
Team Leader Choi.

666
00:43:54,952 --> 00:43:56,320
Did you see this?

667
00:44:00,824 --> 00:44:04,009
(Third-generation Chaebol
and Island Bachelor)

668
00:44:04,795 --> 00:44:08,529
I didn't think you were
that kind of person.

669
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:12,135
You...

670
00:44:13,337 --> 00:44:15,806
sure are great at your job!

671
00:44:16,373 --> 00:44:17,408
Pardon?

672
00:44:17,408 --> 00:44:21,545
After that post,
my followers increased by 103!

673
00:44:24,281 --> 00:44:26,784
You should strike while the iron is hot.

674
00:44:26,784 --> 00:44:27,951
Don't you think?

675
00:44:27,951 --> 00:44:30,254
I will work harder on the campaign.

676
00:44:30,254 --> 00:44:31,555
Okay.

677
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:39,296
I came to turn in my application form.

678
00:44:39,296 --> 00:44:41,131
I see!

679
00:44:41,598 --> 00:44:44,101
I'm glad you came.

680
00:44:45,602 --> 00:44:48,505
I'm Action Officer Lee Ji Kyung.
I'm in charge of offline applications.

681
00:44:48,505 --> 00:44:50,174
Hello.

682
00:44:50,174 --> 00:44:53,344
You sure got a nice photo.

683
00:44:53,344 --> 00:44:56,947
Let's talk about the details inside.

684
00:44:56,947 --> 00:44:59,750
- Okay.
- Come this way.

685
00:44:59,850 --> 00:45:01,318
Action Officer Han.

686
00:45:01,318 --> 00:45:02,653
Yes, right.

687
00:45:03,354 --> 00:45:07,024
My, whose son is this?

688
00:45:07,591 --> 00:45:09,092
Why did he come?

689
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,795
Isn't he too young?

690
00:45:12,463 --> 00:45:14,865
If I sign up...

691
00:45:14,865 --> 00:45:16,967
how many times can I go on dates?

692
00:45:18,602 --> 00:45:21,572
If I end up breaking up
with the person I meet...

693
00:45:21,572 --> 00:45:24,541
can I not meet other applicants?

694
00:45:25,275 --> 00:45:28,312
Mister Seong Chan.

695
00:45:28,312 --> 00:45:32,416
This is a place where
people who want to get married sign up.

696
00:45:32,416 --> 00:45:34,218
Marriage means...

697
00:45:34,218 --> 00:45:37,488
dedicating one's life to only one person.

698
00:45:37,488 --> 00:45:39,489
That's the rule.

699
00:45:39,590 --> 00:45:43,027
But...

700
00:45:43,027 --> 00:45:45,295
are you prepared for that?

701
00:45:45,929 --> 00:45:49,033
I think it might be because...

702
00:45:49,033 --> 00:45:51,168
I haven't found someone
I'm drawn enough to get married to.

703
00:45:52,736 --> 00:45:55,005
Being drawn to someone,
that is important.

704
00:45:55,339 --> 00:45:58,309
Now that I've gotten married,

705
00:45:58,309 --> 00:46:01,511
I realized that moments of danger come.

706
00:46:02,813 --> 00:46:05,682
You start missing the time
when your heart used to flutter.

707
00:46:06,116 --> 00:46:08,952
Your love is less intense than before...

708
00:46:09,386 --> 00:46:12,890
and you start worrying about...

709
00:46:12,890 --> 00:46:14,491
whether or not
you can maintain the marriage.

710
00:46:14,525 --> 00:46:17,294
Wouldn't that be because of your partner?

711
00:46:17,294 --> 00:46:19,630
I heard people change
once they get married.

712
00:46:21,432 --> 00:46:24,234
The moment you start
blaming your partner...

713
00:46:24,234 --> 00:46:26,169
is the moment misfortune begins.

714
00:46:27,905 --> 00:46:30,874
It's so different from dating.

715
00:46:31,208 --> 00:46:32,509
This is hard...

716
00:46:32,643 --> 00:46:36,780
They say a marriage
is held together through loyalty.

717
00:46:36,814 --> 00:46:38,215
From my experience,

718
00:46:38,215 --> 00:46:40,884
the butterflies...

719
00:46:40,884 --> 00:46:43,520
aren't enough to call something love.

720
00:46:43,687 --> 00:46:47,391
You have to realize this so that you can
avoid ending up in a crazy drama.

721
00:46:47,458 --> 00:46:50,658
Do you mean
loyalty is more important than love?

722
00:46:50,828 --> 00:46:54,298
I can't really say it's just loyalty.

723
00:46:54,298 --> 00:46:56,900
There's something else.

724
00:46:57,968 --> 00:47:00,938
Something that makes a strong connection.

725
00:47:01,305 --> 00:47:02,673
It's comfortable,

726
00:47:02,673 --> 00:47:03,841
reliable,

727
00:47:03,841 --> 00:47:05,509
and stable.

728
00:47:05,509 --> 00:47:08,912
Maybe it's somewhere in between
loyalty and love.

729
00:47:08,912 --> 00:47:11,782
I don't know exactly where.

730
00:47:12,983 --> 00:47:15,285
Anyway, I think...

731
00:47:15,285 --> 00:47:19,623
you should think about...

732
00:47:19,623 --> 00:47:22,936
whether or not
you're ready to get married...

733
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:25,095
and look at only one person
for your entire life.

734
00:47:33,203 --> 00:47:35,200
What did you bring all of this for?

735
00:47:35,272 --> 00:47:38,175
I brought it
since I'm stealing your lunchtime.

736
00:47:39,977 --> 00:47:41,311
Thank you.

737
00:47:42,413 --> 00:47:44,782
Also, Mister Seong Chan came by.

738
00:47:44,782 --> 00:47:46,083
Seong Chan did?

739
00:47:47,151 --> 00:47:48,452
That's a surprise.

740
00:47:48,452 --> 00:47:53,523
I've never seen him stay in a relationship
for more than 6 months.

741
00:47:54,758 --> 00:47:56,860
He came to turn in his application form...

742
00:47:56,860 --> 00:47:58,562
because he wanted to know if
he's someone who can get married.

743
00:47:58,562 --> 00:48:01,028
He left after confirming
that he's not ready yet.

744
00:48:02,666 --> 00:48:05,502
Injeong City sure is strict
with their verification process!

745
00:48:06,971 --> 00:48:10,741
Seong Chan doesn't understand
the multiple layers of love.

746
00:48:11,942 --> 00:48:15,176
Since you know about these layers,
did you have a good time yesterday?

747
00:48:16,113 --> 00:48:18,115
I saw a photo was even uploaded
on Instagram.

748
00:48:18,482 --> 00:48:20,548
Didn't you do it all to make me happy?

749
00:48:21,585 --> 00:48:24,588
I did my best
out of consideration for you.

750
00:48:24,588 --> 00:48:27,755
I can't pull out of a first date.

751
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:31,094
That's true...

752
00:48:33,597 --> 00:48:35,599
What time did you get home yesterday?

753
00:48:35,799 --> 00:48:37,100
Yesterday?

754
00:48:37,434 --> 00:48:40,337
Yesterday... Let's see...

755
00:48:40,804 --> 00:48:43,707
It wasn't yesterday. I came home today.

756
00:48:43,707 --> 00:48:47,144
You stayed out all night
on your first date?

757
00:48:47,144 --> 00:48:49,680
Isn't it today if it's past midnight?

758
00:48:53,550 --> 00:48:55,652
Here, have this and this.

759
00:48:56,153 --> 00:48:59,089
Miss In A and I decided to meet later.

760
00:49:00,224 --> 00:49:01,525
Again?

761
00:49:01,525 --> 00:49:05,095
Miss In A got drunk on her own yesterday,
so it was a struggle taking her home.

762
00:49:05,095 --> 00:49:08,098
She wanted to make up for that,
so I said okay.

763
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:11,702
Why is she making up for it so soon?

764
00:49:11,702 --> 00:49:13,437
She doesn't know how to play hard-to-get.

765
00:49:14,338 --> 00:49:17,274
What's wrong? Is there a problem?

766
00:49:18,509 --> 00:49:19,810
No.

767
00:49:21,812 --> 00:49:23,113
If not...

768
00:49:23,981 --> 00:49:25,382
try this.

769
00:49:27,584 --> 00:49:28,986
It's delicious.

770
00:49:31,143 --> 00:49:33,290
(Dyan Group's first daughter and Executive
Director is dating an island bachelor?)

771
00:49:33,290 --> 00:49:35,726
So they're meeting again today?

772
00:49:41,332 --> 00:49:43,600
Hello. You must be busy.

773
00:49:43,968 --> 00:49:46,470
Is this Miss Oh In A's secretary's office?

774
00:49:59,183 --> 00:50:01,251
No one should be coming by at this time.

775
00:50:09,026 --> 00:50:10,194
Who are you?

776
00:50:10,194 --> 00:50:13,263
Hello, I'm Inspector Park Seong Woo
from the Injeong Police Station.

777
00:50:13,497 --> 00:50:16,166
Don't you remember me from last time?

778
00:50:16,467 --> 00:50:20,637
Right! What brings you here?

779
00:50:21,105 --> 00:50:23,641
I went through the footage
from the dashcams of nearby cars.

780
00:50:23,641 --> 00:50:26,010
A suspicious man of the same physique...

781
00:50:26,010 --> 00:50:28,212
has been seen frequently
near the victim's house.

782
00:50:28,212 --> 00:50:29,313
Really?

783
00:50:29,313 --> 00:50:31,448
Did you find out who it was?

784
00:50:32,049 --> 00:50:34,351
I can't really see
because he's wearing a mask...

785
00:50:34,351 --> 00:50:36,286
- Yes.
- but it's him.

786
00:50:39,256 --> 00:50:43,027
Does she owe anybody anything?

787
00:50:43,027 --> 00:50:45,295
Did she have a bad breakup with anyone?

788
00:50:45,295 --> 00:50:46,497
Anything like that?

789
00:50:46,497 --> 00:50:48,799
If that's the case,
the case has to be handled differently.

790
00:50:48,799 --> 00:50:50,667
We'll have to start from the beginning.

791
00:50:55,406 --> 00:50:56,740
Okay.

792
00:50:59,443 --> 00:51:01,778
Thanks.

793
00:51:02,479 --> 00:51:03,981
Hey!

794
00:51:08,652 --> 00:51:10,120
After the paparazzi photos circulated...

795
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:13,290
there have been more and more
articles and SNS reshares.

796
00:51:16,427 --> 00:51:19,630
Could you find the first-person
who uploaded this photo?

797
00:51:19,630 --> 00:51:21,498
Should I take legal action?

798
00:51:22,199 --> 00:51:23,500
No.

799
00:51:24,335 --> 00:51:27,304
I want the original photo files.

800
00:51:27,538 --> 00:51:29,640
Preferably photos where we look close.

801
00:51:31,175 --> 00:51:32,476
Understood.

802
00:51:37,081 --> 00:51:38,649
I'm sorry, Miss In A.

803
00:51:39,350 --> 00:51:42,319
Something urgent came up,
so I can't make it today.

804
00:51:42,753 --> 00:51:44,254
See you next time.

805
00:51:45,689 --> 00:51:49,459
You can clock out here, sir.

806
00:51:50,728 --> 00:51:52,029
Right now?

807
00:51:53,030 --> 00:51:54,998
My dinner plans were canceled.

808
00:52:04,975 --> 00:52:09,046
<i>Hard days we've been through</i>

809
00:52:09,046 --> 00:52:12,349
<i>will hopefully make us shine one day</i>

810
00:52:12,349 --> 00:52:13,684
I'm so tired.

811
00:52:15,586 --> 00:52:17,054
I sure gave it my all.

812
00:52:22,126 --> 00:52:23,493
Who is it?

813
00:52:26,363 --> 00:52:27,798
There's a package for you.

814
00:52:28,866 --> 00:52:31,735
I'm not expecting any packages...

815
00:53:08,364 --> 00:53:11,942
(Cheol Hee and Da Bin,
Our love will last forever)

816
00:53:11,942 --> 00:53:13,892
(Get lost)

817
00:53:14,912 --> 00:53:17,381
The number you have dialed is busy.
Please leave a message after the...

818
00:53:17,381 --> 00:53:18,949
Why isn't she answering?

819
00:53:36,033 --> 00:53:37,334
Excuse me.

820
00:53:45,242 --> 00:53:46,543
Hey!

821
00:54:07,498 --> 00:54:08,799
Hey!

822
00:54:26,116 --> 00:54:28,819
Who are hell are you?!

823
00:54:38,062 --> 00:54:41,265
Jin Young?

824
00:54:46,904 --> 00:54:48,405
Why are you...?

825
00:55:01,852 --> 00:55:03,220
Why did you do it?

826
00:55:05,255 --> 00:55:06,990
Did you vandalize her car too?

827
00:55:09,226 --> 00:55:10,927
Do you know each other?

828
00:55:15,366 --> 00:55:17,567
He's my ex's little brother.

829
00:55:18,302 --> 00:55:20,070
Get it right.

830
00:55:21,805 --> 00:55:24,408
We would've been family
if you married my sister.

831
00:55:27,077 --> 00:55:29,146
If only she didn't die in an accident...

832
00:55:34,284 --> 00:55:36,286
I did it because I was furious.

833
00:55:38,555 --> 00:55:41,758
I hated seeing you doing campaigns saying
you were looking for a marriage partner.

834
00:55:46,096 --> 00:55:48,562
But why did you do that to me?

835
00:55:49,166 --> 00:55:51,168
What do I have to do with this?

836
00:55:51,702 --> 00:55:53,871
You convinced him.

837
00:55:53,871 --> 00:55:56,974
You convinced someone who was living
just fine on his own and brought him here.

838
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:04,281
I'm disgusted.

839
00:56:06,617 --> 00:56:08,752
How could you forget so easily?

840
00:56:15,259 --> 00:56:17,461
You said you wouldn't date anyone else.

841
00:56:19,163 --> 00:56:22,499
So why are you
looking for a marriage partner? Why?!

842
00:56:31,208 --> 00:56:32,976
I never forgot.

843
00:56:36,013 --> 00:56:38,148
I blamed myself every day.

844
00:56:40,284 --> 00:56:42,919
Even if I want to forget
because of the pain, I can't.

845
00:56:46,290 --> 00:56:48,558
If I had just kept my promise that day...

846
00:56:51,662 --> 00:56:53,897
I could've prevented the accident.

847
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:58,802
I can't stop thinking about it.

848
00:57:08,045 --> 00:57:10,647
Then you could've just stayed that way.

849
00:57:15,853 --> 00:57:18,522
You need to remember my sister forever!

850
00:57:35,639 --> 00:57:39,276
How can someone live while remembering
a tragic past forever?

851
00:57:42,146 --> 00:57:44,881
There has to be an expiration date
for pain as well.

852
00:57:48,585 --> 00:57:51,021
Living your whole life in misfortune
with wounds growing deeper with time...

853
00:57:51,689 --> 00:57:55,292
isn't the respectful thing to do
to your past love.

854
00:57:58,195 --> 00:57:59,963
I'm sure that even your sister...

855
00:58:01,799 --> 00:58:04,067
doesn't want that.

856
00:58:31,562 --> 00:58:33,363
It is so clean now!

857
00:58:33,664 --> 00:58:35,666
You think I only cleaned the words?

858
00:58:36,133 --> 00:58:39,069
I took care of the things
that seemed worrying.

859
00:58:39,303 --> 00:58:41,138
For the time being,
there won't be any issues.

860
00:58:41,505 --> 00:58:44,608
If any issues come up while you use it,
come right away.

861
00:58:45,175 --> 00:58:47,344
I guess the expiration date
has been extended by a lot.

862
00:58:47,344 --> 00:58:49,780
Thank you. I'll ride it carefully.

863
00:58:49,780 --> 00:58:51,081
Okay.

864
00:58:57,521 --> 00:59:00,657
Remembering a place of pain...

865
00:59:03,927 --> 00:59:08,065
means you shared that pain.

866
00:59:09,933 --> 00:59:13,070
As these things pile up,

867
00:59:14,571 --> 00:59:16,840
it forms a greater bond...

868
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:19,676
than the excitement of something new.

869
00:59:28,819 --> 00:59:32,923
Everything has an expiration date...

870
00:59:33,624 --> 00:59:38,328
but the only one who decides when it is,
is yourself.

871
00:59:47,304 --> 00:59:52,676
I decided to spend more time
with my car Sony.

872
01:00:04,755 --> 01:00:07,090
Did you send him off?

873
01:00:08,258 --> 01:00:09,258
Yes.

874
01:00:09,893 --> 01:00:11,528
It's all thanks to you.

875
01:00:14,531 --> 01:00:17,100
I guess it took five years to say goodbye.

876
01:00:17,935 --> 01:00:19,336
Thank you...

877
01:00:19,903 --> 01:00:21,271
Miss Ha Na.

878
01:00:24,675 --> 01:00:26,777
Then how about we start afresh?

879
01:00:28,178 --> 01:00:30,447
Okay.

880
01:00:33,784 --> 01:00:37,154
What's with this? Does it not come out?

881
01:00:37,154 --> 01:00:38,489
What's wrong? Is it not working?

882
01:00:38,489 --> 01:00:39,923
- This...
- Try doing it properly.

883
01:00:39,923 --> 01:00:42,526
Pull this. If you pull this...

884
01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:43,860
Like this...

885
01:00:51,801 --> 01:00:54,203
Put the belt on properly so we can go.

886
01:00:56,806 --> 01:00:59,742
What's with this? Is this for children?

887
01:01:00,977 --> 01:01:02,845
Do I put in my arm first?

888
01:01:03,879 --> 01:01:06,332
Isn't that Ba Da and San I?

889
01:01:06,356 --> 01:01:09,292
What's with this? Is this for children?

890
01:01:10,527 --> 01:01:12,395
Do I put in my arm first?

891
01:01:13,429 --> 01:01:16,899
Isn't that Ba Da and San I?

892
01:01:28,190 --> 01:01:29,148
Hang on a second.

893
01:01:29,172 --> 01:01:33,657
(Marry You)

894
01:01:57,056 --> 01:01:59,492
What kind of marriage life
do you wish for, Mister Cheol Hee?

895
01:01:59,492 --> 01:02:03,496
Marrying someone who will adore me
even at moments like these...

896
01:02:03,496 --> 01:02:06,199
is my wish.

897
01:02:06,199 --> 01:02:08,601
My ideal husband is someone
who waits for me to leave work...

898
01:02:08,601 --> 01:02:10,436
and makes me dinner.

899
01:02:10,436 --> 01:02:14,540
Marriage can't be made with just
one person's fantasies.

900
01:02:14,540 --> 01:02:16,342
After all, marriage is reality.

901
01:02:16,342 --> 01:02:17,944
Only rich people like you...

902
01:02:17,944 --> 01:02:20,446
can live doing whatever they want.

903
01:02:20,446 --> 01:02:22,181
Marriage is reality.

904
01:02:22,181 --> 01:02:24,016
I'm ready.

905
01:02:24,016 --> 01:02:25,451
You know my conditions, right?

906
01:02:25,451 --> 01:02:27,329
What brings you here?

907
01:02:27,353 --> 01:02:28,588
I'm leaving.

908
01:02:28,588 --> 01:02:30,056
Could it be?

909
01:02:30,423 --> 01:02:33,259
Jung Ha Na. Are you still going to act
like you don't know how the world works?

910
01:02:33,259 --> 01:02:35,628
Your marriage with Ki Jun was broken up...

911
01:02:35,628 --> 01:02:37,396
because of a realistic reason.

912
01:02:37,396 --> 01:02:38,631
I know...

913
01:02:38,631 --> 01:02:40,900
everything becomes a problem
once you get married.

914
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:43,636
But I'm going to make sure
there are no problems related to money.

915
01:02:43,636 --> 01:02:44,637
This is it?

916
01:02:44,637 --> 01:02:47,874
I'm saying your uncle can only be happy
with you guys gone!

917
01:02:47,874 --> 01:02:51,410
If you drink this,
this will be our first day as a couple.

918
