1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,480
I dare not let go of your hand

2
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,320
After letting go, the sky is clear

3
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,720
As long as fate is far away, it can no longer be kept

4
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:48,800
Losing love is the most painful

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,640
Episode 14

6
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,940
缬 raí cíJesus Ba wagon is the Emperor Wufeng

7
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,220
That's really great

8
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:24,180
The mysterious and mysterious Pavilion Master Qingexu Wufeng

00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,400
ten care dias he stuck in my eyes

10
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,480
Please calm down, Marchioness.

11
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,640
If we keep it real,

12
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,560
Lord Xuan's boon

13
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,280
will be made known.

14
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,080
He secretly controls the Five nacionalities' palaces

15
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,960
and openly opposes you.

16
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,880
The police conspire against him a lot.

17
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,920
He has no chance to make any broad call about it.

18
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,040
Qinglin,

19
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,360
you shall not

20
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,240
arrange such a Ko Drift thing.

21
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,680
I understand.

22
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,560
Your Highness, you're finally here.

23
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,360
Where's the Princess Consort?

24
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,160
She's not here.

25
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,040
She won't be here anymore.

26
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,320
Your Highness, how have you been?

27
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,240
Your Highness, you just recovered.

28
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,280
The Prince's Mansion hasn't opened yet.

29
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,680
What do you mean by that?

30
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,120
Madam Jin is in a critical condition.

31
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,360
The City Leader called on Lord Xuan

32
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,760
to visit the Palace.

33
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,600
Even if the Prince

34
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,880
visits the Palace,

35
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,000
he doesn't need to be so worried.

36
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,720
The Prince is seriously ill.

37
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,040
We're here to escort him.

38
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,480
Your Highness, are you all right?

39
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,840
Inform Liu Ruyue

40
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,120
to take the people of the Wu Ming Pavilion

41
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,120
out of the city.

42
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,080
What about you, Your Highness?

43
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,480
This is an order.

44
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,880
Just do as I say.

45
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,960
Then I'll have to trouble you

46
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,080
to guide me.

47
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,720
Where's the Princess Consort?

48
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,600
There she is!

49
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,160
Senior Sister.

50
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,120
is fully recovered.

51
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,520
As you see,

52
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,440
I just got out of bed.

53
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,920
But I'm worried about my mother.

54
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,560
So I rushed to see you.

55
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,640
You're really a lucky man.

56
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,080
You can even cure the disease of the sky.

57
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,440
You'll live a long life in the future.

58
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,520
Thank you for your concern.

59
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,920
I'm worried about my mother.

60
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,480
Can you go to the Jinchen Courtyard now?

61
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,320
Go?

62
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,000
You're really a good man.

63
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,680
But what about me?

64
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,200
I've been in bed for so many years.

65
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,080
It's really hard for you.

66
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,520
Wu Feng.

67
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,360
Wu Feng.

68
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,160
What else can you say?

69
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,360
It seems that

70
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,520
you want me to die here today.

71
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,440
Your Highness,

72
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,400
I don't want you to die.

73
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,720
But why do you always

74
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,240
oppose me?

75
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,240
You make me feel embarrassed.

76
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,120
You always say that my father is ungrateful.

77
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,280
But your face now

78
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,080
is no different from him.

79
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,480
What right do you have to blame me?

80
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,840
In this world,

81
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,280
the least qualified person to blame me

82
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,560
is you, Xie Ziyuan.

83
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,280
Okay.

84
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,120
Let me see

85
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,400
how capable I am.

86
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,360
I really didn't expect

87
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,600
that I've been looking for

88
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,040
the master of Wu Ming Pavilion for so many years.

89
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,160
He's actually my blood brother.

90
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,040
You're also the descendant of the Xie family.

91
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,680
Are you going to destroy Yunzhou yourself?

92
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,000
Sister, you're wrong.

93
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,880
You're the only one I've been targeting.

94
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,320
You're the one who has Yunzhou.

95
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,680
You're the one who has the chance

96
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,200
to destroy the Xie family for a hundred years.

97
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,400
Then you're out of the game.

98
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,600
You're out of the game today.

99
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,440
Sister,

100
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,920
Yunzhou is still

101
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,360
the world of Xie Zizhou

102
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,560
after I've killed you today.

103
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,600
Your world?

104
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,840
You're trying to take over the power

105
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,840
and make a new subject

106
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,880
without any means.

107
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,160
You're corrupting the house

108
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,560
and causing trouble to the people.

109
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,800
How can you deserve the position of the master?

110
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,840
I got this position

111
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,280
because of my ability.

112
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,080
Why can't I?

113
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,080
If I can't,

114
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,080
how can you,

115
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,080
a useless person,

116
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,160
deserve it?

117
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,600
Whether you deserve it

118
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,080
is a matter of life.

119
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,760
But if you're useless,

120
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,720
she's useless.

121
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,920
Then why admit the crimeyes

122
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,120
and spock from the plates and sticks

123
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,080
and beg for ignorance

124
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,680
if you deserve the role

125
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,600
of the empress.

126
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,240
Is it possible?

127
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,840
Go and make changes.

128
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,760
Then you'll know

129
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,880
anything I say.

130
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,320
Yan Li,

131
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,440
how could you but

132
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,520
Nature

133
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,800
can let you

134
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,880
do so?

135
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,440
Then

136
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,440
What can you change?

137
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,440
You can't escape death today.

138
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,940
It's a dead end.

139
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:54,940
Then let's see if I can break this dead end.

140
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,940
Uncle, with all this confidence,

141
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:00,940
you don't care about Madam Jin's life?

142
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:01,940
Zi Yuan!

143
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,940
Let my mother go.

144
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:04,940
I'll let you handle it.

145
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,440
Okay.

146
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,440
Then you can cut yourself off immediately.

147
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,940
Zi Yuan! No!

148
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:18,940
Zi Yuan! No!

149
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,940
Mother!

150
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,940
Mother!

151
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,440
If I die,

152
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,440
I won't have any more tears.

153
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,440
I don't need to be punished anymore.

154
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,440
Mother!

155
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,440
Mother!

156
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,440
Kill him.

157
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,440
Mother!

158
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,440
Kill him.

159
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:04,440
Why do I feel like something is happening?

160
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,440
You're still not fully recovered.

161
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,440
Why did you come to the back hill?

162
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,440
What if you catch a cold?

163
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,440
I'm not a child.

164
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,440
I'm not that fragile.

165
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,440
Besides,

166
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,440
I don't know how my herbs will grow

167
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,440
after all these days.

168
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,440
I'll go and see.

169
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,440
Don't worry.

170
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,440
They're all growing well with me.

171
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,440
They're all waiting for you to come back.

172
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,440
I'm waiting for you to come back too.

173
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,440
I'll go.

174
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,440
Thank you, Your Highness.

175
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,440
Dark and pale, the body is soft.

176
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,440
The love letter is a long distance, only the fragrance remains.

177
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,440
But in the autumn,

178
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,440
you can smell the fragrance of the osmanthus in the whole yard.

179
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,440
It's not that bad.

180
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,440
If you like it,

181
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,440
I'll plant osmanthus trees

182
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,440
in the garden for you.

183
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,440
What's wrong?

184
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,440
Nothing.

185
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,440
I'm thinking

186
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,440
of planting osmanthus trees.

187
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,440
osmanthus?

188
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,440
Yes.

189
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,440
When autumn comes,

190
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,440
the whole garden will be full of fragrance.

191
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,440
If you had

192
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,440
chosen to plant

193
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,440
rare osmanthus trees,

194
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,440
now,

195
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,440
you like these ordinary plants.

196
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,440
Although osmanthus trees

197
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,440
are not osmanthus trees,

198
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,440
they can be used as cakes and tea.

199
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,440
They're also very practical.

200
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,440
Report!

201
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,440
I'm here to send you a message.

202
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,440
What?

203
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,440
Is there anything else you want to say behind my back?

204
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,440
Lord Xuanping and his son

205
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,440
are trying to kill the emperor.

206
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,440
They're surrounded by the imperial guards.

207
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,440
Lord Xuanping.

208
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,440
Lord Xuanping.

209
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,440
Lord Xuanping.

210
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,440
Lord Xuanping.

211
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,440
Lord Xuanping.

212
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,440
Lord Xuanping.

213
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,440
Lord Xuanping.

214
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,440
Lord Xuanping.

215
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,440
Lord Xuanping.

216
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,440
Lord Xuanping.

217
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,440
Lord Xuanping.

218
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,440
Lord Xuanping.

219
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,440
Lord Xuanping.

220
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,440
Lord Xuanping.

221
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,440
Lord Xuanping.

222
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,440
Lord Xuanping.

223
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,440
Lord Xuanping.

224
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,440
Lord Xuanping.

225
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,440
Lord Xuanping.

226
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,440
Lord Xuanping.

227
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,440
Lord Xuanping.

228
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,440
Lord Xuanping.

229
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,440
Lord Xuanping.

230
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,440
Lord Xuanping.

231
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,440
Lord Xuanping.

232
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,440
Lord Xuanping.

233
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,440
Lord Xuanping.

234
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,440
Lord Xuanping.

235
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,440
Look back and it looks like

236
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,440
the beautiful scenery completed in the sky
