1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,480
Unreleased hands

2
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,440
After letting go, the sky is wavering

3
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,840
As long as fate is fated, it can no longer be kept

4
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:48,800
The love that has been lost is the most sorrowful

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Episode 16

6
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I heard from the servants that you went to Qifeng House today.

7
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,360
The prince has been losing sleep recently.

8
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,000
I am very worried.

9
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:31,640
I heard that Sister Xiaoyu has a secret Anxi incense.

10
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,000
It is the most favorite scent of the prince who used to stay in Qifeng House.

11
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,400
So...

12
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,600
So you went to find her for incense?

13
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,480
I did something wrong.

14
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,880
The prince is angry.

15
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,680
There are not so many rules in the Xueping Palace.

16
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,240
You can do whatever you want.

17
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Report to the master.

18
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,640
In the sachet, in addition to the usual medicine,

19
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,760
there is also a very rare dragon knot.

20
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,880
Since the princess cares so much about me,

21
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,240
I should also escape from violence.

22
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,120
Take you to a good place.

23
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,240
Qinglin is not monitoring me all day long.

24
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,760
It's monitoring Xie Ci Yuan.

25
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,760
It's not a way to go on like this.

26
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,160
I have to find a chance to get him away.

27
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:28,920
Go.

28
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,560
Your Highness, where are you going?

29
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,040
I'm going to take the princess out and have a date.

30
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,760
Don't tell me you will follow me even if you don't know the way?

31
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,400
Boss, have you seen this girl?

32
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,760
No.

33
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,800
Sell buns.

34
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,920
Freshly made buns.

35
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,400
Come and have a look.

36
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,880
I can't say anything, so I hide my feelings.

37
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:35,800
My feelings are still strong.

38
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,600
How should I say it?

39
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,560
Let each other go.

40
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:43,240
When the yearning is still moving.

41
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,600
I'm sorry. I got the wrong person.

42
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,120
Let go of my hand.

43
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,000
Let go of the hand and the sky is clear.

44
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,400
Only fate can't keep it.

45
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:04,000
Losing love is the most painful.

46
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,720
How did you find this place?

47
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,240
It's too hidden.

48
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,680
This is the secret place my mother gave me when I was a child.

49
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,560
I've never brought anyone here.

50
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,120
So no one knows this place.

51
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,400
You are the first one.

52
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,880
Why are you so nice to me?

53
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,520
Because you are different from others.

54
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,000
You are so talkative.

55
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:59,400
Maybe the entrance to Flower Valley is in Longji Mountain.

56
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:04,200
I don't know if I can remember anything when I get back to the familiar place.

57
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,400
What are you looking at?

58
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,800
Look, my lord.

59
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,000
There's a table of herbs.

60
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
It's called Tian Dou.

61
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Normally, the growth is at the peak of the cliff.

62
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,800
It needs to be under the tree.

63
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,200
The growth conditions are very high.

64
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,200
It's not easy to find the right one.

65
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,800
Since it's so rare,

66
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,000
I'll help you pick it back.

67
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,400
No.

68
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,800
It blooms in autumn and flowers in spring.

69
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,400
When it blooms, it's the real Tian Dou.

70
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,000
You know so much about herbs.

71
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,400
Have you learned medicine?

72
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,200
I've learned medicine?

73
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,200
I've learned medicine?

74
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,200
I've learned medicine.

75
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,200
I've learned medicine.

76
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,200
Learned medicine?

77
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,000
Yes.

78
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,800
I heard that there's a mysterious place in Longji Mountain.

79
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,000
It's called Flower Valley.

80
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
The people in the valley are all so rare.

81
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,600
It's rare to see them all.

82
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:11,000
I wonder if you've heard of it?

83
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,800
Flower Valley?

84
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,200
Do you remember anything?

85
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,200
Should I remember anything?

86
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:36,200
For example, your past, or your past.

87
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,200
My past?

88
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,200
Your Highness.

89
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,200
I don't remember. I don't remember anything.

90
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,200
I don't remember anything.

91
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,200
Okay. If you can't remember, don't think about it anymore.

92
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,200
I'll take you back now.

93
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,200
Your Highness, the carriage was tied up with several women a few days ago.

94
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,200
We have to find them as soon as possible.

95
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,200
I know. The head of the hall has sent someone to investigate.

96
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,200
I guess that the carriage will follow the road.

97
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,200
Which road?

98
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,200
The road?

99
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,200
It's one of the most prosperous and convenient cities in Yunzhou.

100
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,200
If those women were abducted,

101
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:29,200
the road would be a perfect place to transport them to other places.

102
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,200
According to the news of Wu Ming Pavilion,

103
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,200
the head of the road seems to be someone from Li Rui.

104
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,200
Li Rui is a man of great power.

105
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,200
If this is related to him,

106
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,200
we should investigate it thoroughly.

107
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,200
I'm warning you.

108
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,200
Don't think about going out again when you come in.

109
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,200
If anyone runs away, I'll beat him to death.

110
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,200
I've been very good to you.

111
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,200
That girl cried and tried to kill herself this morning.

112
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,200
So what?

113
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,200
You still have to be good to me.

114
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,200
I'll be a good hostess to you.

115
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,200
So I suggest that you all should behave.

116
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,200
You can make it easier for the poor.

117
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,200
Who are you?

118
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,200
It's the head of the royal family.

119
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,200
It's the head of the royal family.

120
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,200
Don't worry. I will send someone to escort you home.

121
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,200
Thank you, young master.

122
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:29,800
Young Master.

123
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,440
Thank you.

124
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,240
Thank you, Young Master.

125
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,120
Today,

126
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,200
I've searched several women

127
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,120
who were kidnapped from Ping City

128
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,480
and sent to Lu City.

129
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,520
I didn't find Young Master.

130
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,240
I'm incompetent.

131
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,680
Please punish me.

132
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,240
It's not your problem.

133
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,400
No one wants Xiao Wan to be in trouble.

134
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,960
For the past year,

135
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,840
we've been inquiring about her everywhere.

136
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,280
As long as we don't see her body,

137
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,800
it means Xiao Wan is still alive.

138
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,800
I'll find Young Master.

139
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:04,640
Well,

140
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,520
send the kidnapped girls

141
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,760
back to Ping City safely.

142
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,400
Anyway,

143
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,160
it's a great merit

144
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,960
that my daughter is still alive

145
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,720
and can save others' daughters.

146
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,680
Madam, don't be afraid.

147
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,000
Oh no.

148
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,040
A man

149
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,560
is here every day to listen to the walls.

150
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,960
He's really not a coward.

151
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,720
For Xie Cizhou,

152
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,920
let alone listening to the walls,

153
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,080
even if he jumps the tower,

154
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,880
he won't have any complaints.

155
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,840
He's gone.

156
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,520
What else do you want to do?

157
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,280
What do you think I want to do?

158
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,080
Your Highness,

159
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,720
you look a little disappointed.

160
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,200
Have a good rest.

161
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,400
I'll go out for a while.

162
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:49,880
You...

163
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:50,800
Where are you going?

164
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,720
He's always in the mansion

165
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,000
and is meddling in our affairs.

166
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,400
It's not a way out.

167
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,560
I have to get thisbelomax

168
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,560
out of my eyes.

169
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,280
What's the matter?

170
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,320
It's nothing.

171
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,480
It's because the City Leader

172
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,440
myself provoked me

173
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,520
and made me lose consciousness.

174
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,720
Don't be a bad boy.

175
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,720
Our story is gone.

176
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,720
The sweetness of the past is empty.

177
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:04,720
Now only the heartache is left.

178
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,720
Tears blur my eyes.

179
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,720
Can't see your back.

180
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,720
This separation can't be returned.

181
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,720
Only sorrow remains.

182
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,720
My heart is like a mountain.

183
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,720
Lost in the wild world.

184
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,720
No longer care about anyone.

185
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:33,720
Maybe it's a kind of fog.

186
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,720
The youth is like a flash.

187
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:40,720
Gradually being crushed by the years.

188
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:46,720
Who still remembers the love words in the breeze.

189
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,720
My heart is like a flash.

190
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,720
Lost in the wild world.

191
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,720
No longer care about anyone.

192
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,720
Maybe it's a kind of fog.

193
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,720
The youth is like a flash.

194
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,720
Gradually being crushed by the years.

195
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:15,720
Who still remembers the love words in the breeze.
