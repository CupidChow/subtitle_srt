1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Regarding Frankie's mother,

2
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,800
today our guest is allyou yourself.

3
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:40,000
The guest is too damaging and expect theВО will help us to get closer to the voters.

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,960
Change your final approach for singing.

5
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:58,480
No matter how

6
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,000
снова见

7
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:01,600
I'm sorry.

8
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:02,920
Sorry?

9
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,400
Sorry.

10
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,560
claw

11
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,160
Really?

12
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,480
Ok.

13
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,040
Great.

14
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,240
Ch faux.

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,880
Come in.

16
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:24,480
We're looking for Niu Amie.

17
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,640
Niu Amie?

18
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,520
Good.

19
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,240
I don't know how to do it.

20
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,240
It's okay.

21
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,120
I'll teach you.

22
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:53,640
How...

23
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,920
How do you do it?

24
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,200
Hold it.

25
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:11,280
The milestone of supplies is going down

26
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,160
and it's slowly turning to shadow.

27
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:21,040
Why are you still watching quietly?

28
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,160
statute idol

29
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,380
Services are owned by the come to face

30
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,780
People are wards meet

31
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,540
The heart never requested

32
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,140
Watch this

33
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,220
Wife

34
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:39,540
I write you a chess

35
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,860
Yin story

36
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:48,740
Your name everywhere

37
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,200
Bye.

38
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:11,080
music

39
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:11,920
zones

40
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:13,580
al al

41
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:47,580
I never thought that His Highness would know how to play the shadow.

42
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:50,580
He is indeed talented.

43
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:58,580
This official is really lucky.

44
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:03,580
Madam's beauty and beauty are very compatible with the exquisite jewelry in my palace.

45
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:07,580
Why not choose one or two for Madam?

46
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:12,580
I think these are indeed rare items.

47
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,580
Look at me.

48
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:19,580
How much is this jade pendant?

49
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:22,580
You have good taste.

50
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:25,580
This jade pendant is just a piece of cake.

51
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:28,580
If you like it, you can take it.

52
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:31,580
You can give it to me as you like.

53
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:39,580
It is indeed a good item.

54
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:45,580
A jade pendant is just a piece of cake.

55
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:48,580
Madam, you must be careful.

56
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,580
If it wasn't to keep my makeup,

57
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:54,580
you would be a useless person to mock me.

58
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,580
Thank you for your reminder, Your Highness.

59
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:00,580
You can't just say that you believe me.

60
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:09,580
This sachet of yours looks good.

61
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:12,580
I will use it to thank you.

62
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:16,580
If you don't mind, then you can keep it.

63
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:19,580
It is getting late. Let's go back to the manor.

64
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:23,580
Okay. I am tired from shopping.

65
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,580
Your Highness, you are still awake?

66
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:45,580
I made some sweet soup for you.

67
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,580
You have been out for a day.

68
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,580
Drink some to sleep.

69
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:53,580
Lord Xuanyuan is indeed the best of the best.

70
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,580
He has been working in the manor for a month.

71
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,580
He is really a man of his word.

72
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,580
So what?

73
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,580
He is the City Leader's sister.

74
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,580
He should be used to it.

75
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:05,580
I heard that the City Leader was a thief.

76
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,580
You are so stubborn.

77
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:09,580
Come on, drink.

78
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:11,580
Drink.

79
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,580
It works.

80
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,580
Which beauty of Qifeng House

81
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:29,580
made me lose my face?

82
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,580
I am here for the first time.

83
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:43,580
I hope that you can forgive me.

84
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:47,580
You fell into the hands of Xie Ci Yuan.

85
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:50,580
How can you run away?

86
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,580
Come on.

87
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,580
Come on.

88
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,580
Come on.

89
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,580
Come on.

90
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,580
Come on.

91
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,580
Come on.

92
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,580
Come on.

93
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:08,580
Come on.

94
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:13,580
What do you want to tell me?

95
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:18,580
I have a question for you.

96
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,580
Please go ahead.

97
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:33,580
What do you think freedom is?

98
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,580
Freedom is the moment

99
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:38,580
when you

100
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:41,580
brought me out of Qifeng House.

101
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,580
No.

102
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,580
I am so stupid.

103
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,580
Please give me a reason.

104
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,580
You are free

105
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:55,580
after you came to the manor from Qifeng House?

106
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,580
You clearly don't like

107
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:59,580
the civil and moral rules of the manor.

108
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,580
You also don't like my

109
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,580
path of leaving the capital.

110
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:03,580
You force yourself to accept

111
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,580
everything you don't like.

112
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:09,580
How can you be free?

113
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:14,580
Compared with Qifeng House,

114
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:16,580
I am free

115
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,580
when I am with you.

116
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,580
I am not saying this

117
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:23,580
to make you feel loyal.

118
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,580
I am just here for nothing.

119
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,580
Just talk.

120
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:29,580
What do you think

121
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,580
freedom is?

122
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:35,580
You have the right to make your own decisions.

123
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:36,580
For example,

124
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:38,580
this marriage.

125
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,580
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

126
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,580
I am sorry.

127
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,580
After drinking this

128
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,580
soup,

129
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,580
you should sleep.

130
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:21,580
News from the manor.

131
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,580
Many women have been missing recently.

132
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:24,580
It is different from the gift

133
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:26,580
that is responsible for city safety.

134
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:27,580
Tonight, Zixu

135
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:29,580
will leave the city through the east gate.

136
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,580
We must stop the horse carriage.

137
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,580
Who are you?

138
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:57,580
Let go of those girls.

139
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,580
You are not worthy of the order.

140
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:03,580
You are just a killer.

141
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:05,580
How dare you fight against us?

142
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,580
Listen up.

143
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,580
Arrest this traitor.

144
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,580
You will be rewarded.

145
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,580
Go.

146
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:28,580
Go.

147
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:56,580
You are playing this

148
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:58,580
dirty trick again.

149
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:00,580
You are fighting against a traitor.

150
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,580
Do you need to be so particular?

151
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,580
I am sorry.

152
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,580
I am sorry.

153
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:31,580
I am sorry.

154
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,580
I am sorry.

155
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,580
I am sorry.

156
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,580
I am sorry.

157
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,580
I am sorry.

158
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:41,580
I am sorry.

159
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:43,580
I am sorry.

160
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,580
I am sorry.

161
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,580
I am sorry.

162
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:49,580
I am sorry.

163
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:51,580
I am sorry.

164
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,580
I am sorry.

165
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,580
I am sorry.

166
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,580
I am sorry.

167
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,580
I am sorry.

168
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:01,580
I am sorry.

169
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,580
I am sorry.

170
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,580
I am sorry.

171
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,580
I am sorry.

172
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:09,580
I am sorry.

173
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,580
I am sorry.

174
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:13,580
I am sorry.

175
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:15,580
I am sorry.

176
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:17,580
I am sorry.

177
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:19,580
