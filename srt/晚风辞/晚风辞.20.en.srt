1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,640
Unreleased hands

2
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:37,560
Let go of the red stars and the sky

3
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:41,960
As long as fate is far away, it can no longer be maintained

4
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:48,800
Losing love is the most painful

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,200
Executive

6
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Why are you here?

7
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I heard that you were punished for staying up late to practice,

8
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
and you weren't allowed to eat dinner.

9
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I brought you some midnight snacks.

10
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Slow down. It's all your fault.

11
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
It's almost dawn.

12
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Hurry and go back and rest.

13
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
If Teacher finds out,

14
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
he will scold you again.

15
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It's already dawn anyway.

16
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Why do you still have to get up and practice?

17
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Why don't we go and see the sunrise?

18
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Okay.

19
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
What's wrong with you?

20
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I don't know that Xie guy

21
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
What are you doing?

22
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You're so confused.

23
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I fell in love with my mother at first sight.

24
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
My mother died early.

25
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I haven't married for more than 20 years.

26
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Is that called being confused?

27
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Can you compare this to love?

28
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Your mother and I are the most important things in this life.

29
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
We don't have any deception or benefits.

30
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
But even if you have deception and benefits,

31
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
then you will fall in love with someone.

32
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Father, I know I've been rude to your teachings.

33
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
But I really can't help

34
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
watching her die in front of me.

35
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I only want her to live.

36
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Even if we don't meet again in the future,

37
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
even if she's a high-ranking official,

38
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I can't do anything to help her.

39
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
So I just want her to live.

40
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Have you ever thought about how Shi'an feels?

41
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I owe him.

42
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I'll find a way to pay him back.

43
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Silly girl.

44
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
All the debts in this world

45
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
are the most difficult to pay off with love.

46
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
How can you pay him back?

47
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
How can you pay him back?

48
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I'll take care of the matter between me and Shi'an.

49
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Father, don't worry.

50
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
When Xie Ci Yuan is in jail,

51
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'll take him away immediately.

52
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I won't be rude to you.

53
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Daughter.

54
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
You're so stubborn.

55
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
You're like his dead mother.

56
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Daughter.

57
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Our daughter has grown up.

58
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Will you blame me for not taking good care of her?

59
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You shouldn't have come.

60
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
You're like this.

61
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I can't bear to hate you again.

62
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Daughter.

63
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I was too willful about the wedding.

64
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
You don't need to apologize to me

65
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
at any time.

66
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Even if you're not my wife,

67
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
you're my young master.

68
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I won't disobey any of your actions.

69
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Shi'an.

70
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Your life should be for yourself.

71
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
My life is for you.

72
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Mu Wan.

73
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Mu Wan.

74
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You said you didn't love Xie Ci Yuan.

75
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Do you only hate him?

76
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Whether I love him or hate him,

77
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
it's between us.

78
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I don't want to discuss it with you.

79
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
You said it's between you.

80
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
You put him in your own territory.

81
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
What about me?

82
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
What did I do wrong?

83
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
You excluded me from your life.

84
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
We clearly agreed to walk together.

85
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Don't force me to do it.

86
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
You've really changed.

87
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
If it was the past Fang Mu Wan,

88
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
she wouldn't have treated me like this.

89
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Sorry.

90
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
It's my fault.

91
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Xie Ci Yuan was missing at the wedding.

92
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Xie Ci Zhou will find him soon.

93
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
We must make a plan

94
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
to replace Hua Gu.

95
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I see.

96
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Why is it her?

97
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
What's so good about her?

98
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
She's not really good.

99
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
But it can only be her.

100
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I don't know.

101
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I don't know.

102
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I don't know.

103
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I don't know.

104
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I don't know.

105
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I don't know.

106
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I don't know.

107
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I don't know.

108
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I don't know.

109
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
There's no one else.

110
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Ah Yao.

111
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Ah Yao.

112
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Ah Yao.

113
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Ah Yao.

114
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Ah Yao.

115
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Ah Yao.

116
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Ah Yao.

117
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Ah Yao.

118
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Ah Yao,

119
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,720
Delicious.

120
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,680
You want to bark that thing off?

121
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:21,860
Ms. Tao,

122
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,960
one more thing.

123
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,140
Compatter is too delicate.

124
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,500
But,

125
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,980
You don't want to bite it.

126
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,180
Why didn't it work?

127
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,660
But only in dreams

128
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,300
can I hold you like this.

129
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:48,980
How could it be her?

130
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,140
She will never come back.

131
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,940
My A-Yao hates me.

132
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:56,860
She will never come back.

133
00:10:58,620 --> 00:10:59,580
Don't be silly.

134
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,940
I know I'm not qualified to be in love.

135
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:07,260
But I still want to be with you.

136
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:10,780
Even in dreams.

137
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,620
It's okay to be in a dream.

138
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,900
Don't leave me.

139
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:02,100
My eyes are confused.

140
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:05,820
I can't see your face clearly.

141
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:09,180
This love can never be returned.

142
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:13,220
Only sorrow remains.

143
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:17,180
My heart is like a sorrow.

144
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,740
You are in the wild.

145
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,620
No longer care about anyone.

146
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:27,860
Maybe it's a kind of invisible light.

147
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:31,340
Even in dreams.

148
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:34,940
It's okay to be in a dream.

149
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:41,100
Only sorrow remains.

150
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:45,460
My heart is like a sorrow.

151
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:49,220
You are in the wild.

152
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:52,180
No longer care about anyone.

153
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:56,420
Maybe it's a kind of invisible light.

154
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:59,940
Only sorrow remains.

155
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:03,500
You are in the wild.

156
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:09,980
No longer care about anyone.
