00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,040
So much love I lostrency

2
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:34,000
All I can do is put your hand on mine

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,300
Me and the stars drive our hearts together

4
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:44,180
If the soul meet mine We will be

5
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:51,360
So enforce Everybody want us

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,020
Episode 38

7
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,160
Commentsings

8
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,960
were collected by this bug.

9
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,240
Starting in a ves.

10
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,360
Yun'er.

11
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:01,840
You have an office with2021 F Statue of Water.

12
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,020
Didn't you hear of it?

13
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:06,940
So what?

14
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,440
How did it go?

15
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,640
When your meds r explained,

16
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,140
you have to concentrate less,

17
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:18,880
that day,

18
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,840
I went with my Smart Head to visit my father.

19
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,180
Father.

20
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,180
Today master of carrot�렬 praised me!

21
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,140
Father!

22
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,280
Father, father.

23
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,200
Father!

24
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,120
Your Highness!

25
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,520
Xie Cizhou,

26
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,400
you're so bold!

27
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,360
You even dared to do

28
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,760
something so unforgivable as a teacher!

29
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,000
Father,

30
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,400
in his eyes,

31
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,880
you're the only one

32
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,360
who is related to his son Xie Ciyuan.

33
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,360
And my daughter

34
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,160
is just a weapon to kill him.

35
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,400
He wants me to die for him

36
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,040
with the Wudu Bone.

37
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,040
Why don't I kill him?

38
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,720
The world is mine anyway.

39
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,120
Since the bone can help the Goddess,

40
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,600
it can reduce the pain.

41
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,200
Then let his beloved son try

42
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,760
whether it's really as he said

43
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,360
so useful.

44
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,360
Mother.

45
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,920
What do you want?

46
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,360
Mother!

47
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,360
I won't let you get away with it.

48
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,360
Gu Chong

49
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,760
Gu Chong

50
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,760
has improved my martial arts.

51
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,760
But at the same time,

52
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,760
once I get hurt,

53
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,760
it's extremely hard to recover.

54
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,760
That's why I tried to improve my internal strength.

55
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,760
It's also to control the pain

56
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,760
Gu Chong has caused when he's in pain.

57
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,760
My beloved son

58
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,760
has now become

59
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,760
the most despicable person

60
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,760
in Yunzhou.

61
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,760
My mother is also in his hands.

62
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,760
But I can't do anything.

63
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,760
I want to live.

64
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,760
So,

65
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,760
I joined the Wu Ming Hall.

66
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,760
I hope that one day,

67
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,760
someone will overthrow his power.

68
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,760
But at the same time,

69
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,760
in order to live,

70
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,760
I must also

71
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,760
create a useless toy

72
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,760
and not pose any threat to him.

73
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,760
That day,

74
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,760
I went to the City Leader's Mansion

75
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,760
to see my mother.

76
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,760
Unfortunately,

77
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,760
it was not as I had hoped.

78
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,760
All this will end.

79
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,760
I believe it.

80
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,760
You must believe it too.

81
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,760
Since the beginning,

82
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,760
the City Leader has never admitted

83
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,760
that you are the master of Yunzhou.

84
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,760
The things you stole

85
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,760
are always not fair and not fair.

86
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,760
This year,

87
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,760
you know better than anyone

88
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,760
and you care more than anyone.

89
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,760
Isn't that right?

90
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,760
So what?

91
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,760
Even if I stole it,

92
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,760
it's still mine.

93
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,760
But your son

94
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,760
is suffering

95
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,760
the pain that shouldn't belong to him.

96
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,760
They say that the mother and son are connected.

97
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,760
At this moment,

98
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,760
Mrs. Jin is in pain.

99
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,760
What?

100
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,760
What?

101
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,760
What?

102
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,760
What should I do?

103
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,480
Well.

104
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:54,560
Your Highness.

105
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:56,680
Madam He was'...

106
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,600
Bailong was there.

107
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,200
Using my blood to take away Gu Chong...

108
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,200
mitigate your crime.

109
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,800
If you diedFl η

110
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,040
and brought Gu Chong back,

111
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,440
then you could vex him...

112
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,440
I've lost all my credit.

113
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,560
At least, it's not the time to tell the truth.

114
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:29,560
Actually, it's because of this.

115
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,920
Isn't this my sachet?

116
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,120
That's right.

117
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:37,640
There should be a special substance in this sachet

118
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:41,120
that can temporarily put an end to the ancient plague.

119
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,600
No. If it's because of the sachet,

120
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,600
then why did you...

121
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,600
You're playing with me.

122
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,600
I was just being impulsive.

123
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,600
How dare you play with me twice?

124
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,600
Just now, the Princess was the one who kissed me.

125
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,600
Shut up!

126
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,600
I shouldn't have worried about you.

127
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:12,600
You're going to kill the royal family.

128
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,600
Stop scaring me.

129
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,600
Stop scaring me.

130
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,600
I'm warning you.

131
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,600
You're not allowed to do this again.

132
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,600
Otherwise...

133
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,600
What else can I do?

134
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,600
You've been with me for so long.

135
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,600
You still don't understand me.

136
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,600
Although I don't like to be threatened,

137
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,600
I still have weaknesses.

138
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,600
For example, now,

139
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,600
you can try to be beautiful.

140
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,600
I will definitely listen to your advice.

141
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,600
Xie Ci Yuan, if you dare to play with me again,

142
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,600
I'll kill you.

143
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,600
What a pity.

144
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,600
There should be a couple less in this world.

145
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,600
A beautiful widow is needed.

146
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,600
You're shameless.

147
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,600
Who is your husband?

148
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,600
We're just pretending to do the task.

149
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,600
You're the one I worshiped the heaven and earth,

150
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,600
and passed through all the gods.

151
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,600
The Princess Consort of Xuanyuan, who is named Zheng Qu,

152
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,600
who told you it was fake?

153
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,600
Your Highness,

154
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,600
in the sachet,

155
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,600
apart from the usual medicine,

156
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,600
there is a rare dragon grass.

157
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,600
Dragon grass?

158
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,600
Dragon grass is also known as sea stone.

159
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,600
It's said that when a snake crosses the sea, it becomes a dragon.

160
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,600
It's a pity that it can't move after going to the ghost island.

161
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,600
If the dragon fails,

162
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,600
it will use the air in its mouth to spit out the stone.

163
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,600
In the past,

164
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,600
it used salt to spit out the stone into a mushroom.

165
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,600
And it was poisoned.

166
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,600
It's extremely poisonous.

167
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,600
It's actually a poison.

168
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,600
You don't know,

169
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,600
although dragon grass is extremely poisonous,

170
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,600
human food can be a poison-free substance.

171
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,600
It can cultivate the qi for a thousand years.

172
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,600
But only a thousand-year-old dragon grass can be consumed.

173
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:24,600
It's not enough to kill a thousand years.

174
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,600
It smells exactly like this sachet in its blood.

175
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,600
It's even stronger.

176
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,600
It turns out that it's dragon grass.

177
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,600
No wonder the sachet can only contain the dog's insect.

178
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,600
Its blood can let the insect rest for a long time.

179
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,600
Where can we find the thousand-year-old dragon grass?

180
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,600
According to what I saw,

181
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,600
the only place in the world where thousand-year-old dragon grass can be found

182
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,600
is the Flower Valley.

183
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,600
You mean the Flower Valley with poisonous poison

184
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,600
that we don't know where the poison is.

185
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,600
The Flower Valley?

186
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,600
Yes.

187
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,600
The Flower Valley is said to be a place where people can live and die,

188
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,600
and it's also known for its various poisons.

189
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,600
It's an amazing place.

190
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,600
Now that I see the dragon grass,

191
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,600
I know it's really extraordinary.

192
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,600
The Flower Valley?

193
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,600
It's an unexpected discovery.

194
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,600
The Flower Valley.

195
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,600
I entered the Wu Ming Pavilion a year ago.

196
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,600
My head was injured,

197
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,600
so I have no memory.

198
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,600
Does this woman have any other clues?

199
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,600
When I was on a mission a year ago,

200
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,600
I found her in the mountain of dragon grass

201
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,600
a hundred miles away from the city.

202
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:08,600
I didn't see anything else except this sachet and a few herbs.

203
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,600
When I woke up,

204
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,600
I gave her a new name and identity.

205
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,600
I trained her to become the Death of the Wu Ming Pavilion.

206
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,600
Her internal strength and martial arts are very outstanding.

207
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,600
I'm sure she's not from a simple background.

208
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,600
It seems that this mountain of dragon grass

209
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,600
may have some connection with the Flower Valley.

210
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,600
I'm here.

211
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,600
I'm here.

212
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,600
I'm here.

213
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,600
I'm here.

214
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,600
I'm here.

215
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,600
I'm here.

216
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,600
I'm here.

217
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,600
I'm here.

218
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,600
I'm here.

219
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,600
I'm here.

220
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,600
I'm here.

221
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,600
I'm here.

222
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,600
I'm here.

223
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,600
I'm here.

224
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,600
My heart is like a sand,

225
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,600
lost in the wild world.

226
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,600
No longer care about anyone,

227
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:40,600
but the trees are all without light.

228
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:44,600
The years are like sand,

229
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,600
gradually being washed away by time.

230
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:54,600
Who still remembers the love story in the breeze?

231
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,600
My heart is like a sand,

232
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:02,600
lost in the wild world.

233
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,600
No longer care about anyone,

234
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,600
but the trees are all without light.

235
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,600
The years are like sand,

236
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,600
gradually being washed away by time.

237
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:23,600
Who still remembers the love story in the breeze?
