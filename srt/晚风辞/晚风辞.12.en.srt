1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,340
Unaccom injuries

2
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:58,840
The set free surface

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Episode 16

4
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,400
Good.

5
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,680
Gentlemen,

6
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,480
I'd like to ask

7
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,920
where you are selling horses

8
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,960
in the city.

9
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,440
You want to buy horses too?

10
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,560
Yes.

11
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,960
Please give us a tour

12
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,200
and give us a guide.

13
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,400
I wonder

14
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,000
what kind of horses you like.

15
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,400
In my opinion,

16
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,200
you need a

17
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,880
large-sized horse.

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,640
Yes.

19
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,320
Is it funny?

20
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,800
Try again.

21
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,480
You're talking nonsense.

22
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,560
Miss Chongzhuang,

23
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,280
please forgive me.

24
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,040
I'll go now.

25
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:41,520
I'll go now.

26
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,080
Yes.

27
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:42,800
I'll go now.

28
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,520
I'll go now.

29
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,640
White stone hairpin.

30
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,080
I heard Lu Cheng is a good painter.

31
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,160
He likes to collect

32
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,600
the paintings of this antique shop.

33
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,360
You're a painter too.

34
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,880
If you don't collect them,

35
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,040
it's a pity.

36
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,520
They said they were here to buy horses.

37
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,760
But there are no horses in this place.

38
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,680
Besides, when they talk about buying horses,

39
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,880
they are rude and rude.

40
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,480
They are different from ordinary people.

41
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,120
I'm afraid

42
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,120
they are not horses.

43
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,040
Yes.

44
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:31,920
In my opinion,

45
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,520
they are not horses.

46
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,080
They are human slaves.

47
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,800
They are bad people.

48
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:39,760
Let's go.

49
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,320
We are familiar with Lu Cheng.

50
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,000
Let's see if we can see

51
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,320
the so-called big figure

52
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,680
in the mouth of the mute.

53
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,560
I heard that

54
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,840
Xie Zizhou sent Li Yan to Lu Cheng.

55
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,760
The show in Lu Cheng

56
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,280
is getting longer.

57
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,680
I wonder who will be the next one to come on stage.

58
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,360
This is Hao.

59
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,120
He is 14 years old.

60
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,120
He is young and slim.

61
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,720
I think you should like him.

62
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,740
I think you should like him...

63
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:26,480
I think it's hard for me to like him.

64
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,560
I think it's easier for you to love him.

65
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,960
If the Golden Lottery were here,

66
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,720
it would be hard to like you.

67
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,200
This is not the tim eine theta downstairs.

68
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,200
There is lots of gold and silver.

69
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,840
But this gold standard should be higher.

70
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,040
I don't know if we should do it.

71
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,320
The best Dig out Army of China

72
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,720
How dare you kidnap me?

73
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,760
You don't want to live anymore?

74
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,640
You're still stubborn even though you're dead.

75
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,360
Please spare me, Heroine.

76
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,440
I was being rude.

77
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,920
Please don't blame me.

78
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,560
If you want money,

79
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,040
I have some money with me.

80
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,040
Just take it.

81
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,360
If you don't have enough money,

82
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,920
I have a jade pendant with gold in it.

83
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,920
It's worth a lot of money.

84
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,360
I don't care about the money.

85
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,880
I'm here to ask you a question.

86
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,640
Heroine, please.

87
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,840
I heard that you keep two

88
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,280
most beautiful girls

89
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,760
for an adult.

90
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,400
Who is this adult?

91
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,680
Chief, don't be surprised.

92
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,960
I've known the things

93
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,840
you and the Li family did.

94
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,760
The girls were all caught.

95
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,920
Now, you just tell me

96
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,400
who this adult is.

97
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,520
I can give you a chance.

98
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,080
Who is he?

99
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,800
Wu Mingge?

100
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,240
Wu Mingge killed the traitor.

101
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,880
You're not the first.

102
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,560
You're not the last.

103
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,120
You're a girl with no family.

104
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,080
You're innocent.

105
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,480
But if you tell me

106
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,800
who this adult is,

107
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,000
I can break up with you.

108
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,440
You deserve to be punished.

109
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,960
You have a right to live.

110
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,000
What?

111
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,480
You want someone to save you?

112
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,360
I'm afraid you'll be disappointed.

113
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,240
After we parted ways,

114
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:39,960
I went to the gate of the city

115
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,160
to watch Li Yan.

116
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,680
The first thing Li Yan did

117
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,960
was to go to the Chief.

118
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,720
I didn't see this idiot.

119
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,920
So I took my horse

120
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,920
to save Qinglong.

121
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,600
It seems that Li Yan came to the city

122
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,520
to kill the girls

123
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,600
who were kidnapped.

124
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,240
It's a pity that he came late.

125
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,480
They were rescued

126
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,680
and sent to Ping City.

127
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,400
No.

128
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,320
What if they do something to those girls

129
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,200
on their way back to Ping City?

130
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,240
Don't worry.

131
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,520
I've sent people

132
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,120
to ensure the safety of those girls.

133
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,160
That's good.

134
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,440
It's a pity that

135
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,440
we still can't find Cui.

136
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,320
That's not easy.

137
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,160
I only give you one chance.

138
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,480
You can decide

139
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,280
whether to tell or not.

140
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,600
I really don't know anything.

141
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,600
Tell me.

142
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,280
Don't kill me.

143
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,240
I'll tell you.

144
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,000
I'll tell you.

145
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,720
The Chief promised me

146
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,280
that he would take the girls

147
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,320
who were kidnapped

148
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,480
to the city to entertain the nobility of Yunzhou

149
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,200
to win people's hearts.

150
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,440
But I don't know why

151
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,800
the Ping City thing

152
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,280
was stopped by your Wu Mingge

153
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,600
and the carriage to get out of the city.

154
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,880
The Li family is very cautious.

155
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,840
They asked me to find people

156
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,160
in the local city.

157
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,800
No wonder

158
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,720
the girls in the city

159
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,120
are also missing.

160
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,840
You haven't answered me yet.

161
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,840
Those girls who were not given

162
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,520
to the nobility

163
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,320
were sent away.

164
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,800
By the order of the Grand Tutor,

165
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,440
I'll leave each group of girls

166
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,560
who are the most talented

167
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,640
to the City Leader first.

168
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,240
Xie Zizhou is a man of great talent.

169
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,560
Why does he want these girls?

170
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,600
I really don't know.

171
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,880
I beg you not to kill me.

172
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,680
I don't want to die.

173
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,000
I really don't want to die.

174
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,280
You've betrayed Xie Zizhou.

175
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,240
If it's in his hands,

176
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,360
it's even worse than death.

177
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,160
Why don't you let me send you off?

178
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,400
Xie Zizhou,

179
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,200
Zi Yuan has been manipulated by you for so many years.

180
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,120
He has suffered so much for you.

181
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:50,960
Now,

182
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,160
you want to trap him

183
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,800
and let him die in my mansion.

184
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,160
Xie Zizhou,

185
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,600
you're not a human being.

186
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,720
Didn't you say

187
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,480
everyone knows my temper?

188
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,760
I even killed my biological father.

189
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,400
I'm not a human being.

190
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,760
I'm not a human being.

191
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,120
I'm not a human being.

192
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,360
I'm not a human being.

193
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,960
I killed him.

194
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,960
Besides,

195
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,960
I'm the younger brother of the same mother.

196
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,000
Mrs. Jin,

197
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,040
don't be too sad.

198
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,840
I was just joking.

199
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,360
His Majesty has a infectious disease.

200
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,680
It's a good time to get a blessing.

201
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,400
Besides,

202
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,840
he's my other life.

203
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:50,920
How can I watch him die?

204
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,720
I've ordered

205
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,080
to send him medicine and tonics every seven days

206
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,880
to comfort His Majesty.

207
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,800
But if His Majesty can't get through this,

208
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:10,120
and Mrs. Jin sends the black-haired man,

209
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:14,520
I'll definitely arrange a grand funeral for him.

210
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:18,440
I won't humiliate the Xie family.

211
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:21,640
Xie Zizhou, you...

212
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:27,960
I fell and cut my knee.

213
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,880
You're looking at me like this.

214
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:37,040
It's so ironic

215
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,560
what happened in the world.

216
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,240
Although I knew

217
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:46,120
I didn't have a source for myofascia,

218
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,640
I'm still playing with the ball of consciousness.

219
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,520
Even though I'm not the defect of a person,

220
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,480
I'm still a human being.

221
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:53,920
Even though huge included

222
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,160
I'm still a human being.

223
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:01,080
I have a physical body.

224
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:08,040
I want to..

225
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,480
I'm worried about Xiao Cui.

226
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,880
I think Xiao Cui's parents

227
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,080
are so anxious about this.

228
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,280
They must love him very much.

229
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,520
This kind of feeling

230
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,520
really makes people envy.

231
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,320
I want to help them reunite as a family.

232
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,400
But right now,

233
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,720
there's something else more important.

234
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,240
I want to help them reunite as a family.

235
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,280
I want to help them reunite as a family.

236
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,640
I want to help them reunite as a family.

237
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,120
You're making me worried.

238
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,720
You know a secret trick called Flower-Frozen Sand.

239
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,480
Flower-Frozen Sand?

240
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:46,680
That's right.

241
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,080
It's a very evil trick.

242
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,360
It can make a cook who's under 16

243
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,400
drop a chain of elixir.

244
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,160
Rumor has it that it can make people

245
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,440
live forever.

246
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,560
If Xiao Cui and those girls

247
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,080
are really given Xie Ci Zheng,

248
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,920
will they...

249
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,920
How could she do such a stupid thing?

250
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,960
Yunzhou is in a turmoil.

251
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,360
If at this time,

252
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,640
a missing girl appears,

253
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,600
it will only make her more popular.

254
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,160
No.

255
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,800
I was too hasty.

256
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,960
She doesn't care about the popularity.

257
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,600
You're right.

258
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,560
Since the person who sent Li Yan

259
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,160
to kill Lu Cheng is Xie Ci Zhou,

260
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:26,080
it means that she must know about this.

261
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,160
Xie Ci Zhou is arrogant and arrogant.

262
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,080
She wants to be satisfied with everything.

263
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,800
She wants to have

264
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,600
all the glory and status.

265
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,720
And she must have it.

266
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,440
That's why

267
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,400
she wants to marry a girl

268
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,680
to write the elixir.

269
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,440
Lu Cheng is dead.

270
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,440
This place will be in a mess.

271
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,120
Since we've got

272
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,040
the clues we want,

273
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,520
we should leave

274
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,640
and return to Ping City.

275
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,040
Find out the truth.

276
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,360
In case there's another girl

277
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,560
who's innocent.

278
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,400
Where's the sachet?

279
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:07,800
It's here.

280
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,280
Are you all right?

281
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,120
I'm okay.

282
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,480
I'm fine.

283
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,800
Wait for me here.

284
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,120
I'll go to the car shop to look for a carriage.

285
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,680
We'll return to Ping City tonight.

286
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,560
If Xie Ci Zhou

287
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,000
really sent the elixir

288
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,400
to the girl,

289
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:42,960
then she's more dangerous

290
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,800
than I thought.

291
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,120
She's more inhuman.

292
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,040
We must save her

293
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,360
and leave the City Hall.

294
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,320
Memories come back and forth like tide and waves.

295
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:14,040
Our story is no longer here.

296
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,480
The sweetness of the past is empty.

297
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,160
Now all that's left is the pain in my heart.

298
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:24,560
Tears flood my eyes.

299
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,280
I can't see your back.

300
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,720
This love can no longer be returned.

301
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,880
Only sorrow remains.

302
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:43,000
My happiness is leaving and I wander on the include deaf.

303
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:49,400
For whom should I

304
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:57,280
long for?

305
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,920
Time flies so quickly.

306
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:36,920
The Long Ballad

307
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:41,920
The Long Ballad

308
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:46,920
The Long Ballad

309
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:51,920
The Long Ballad

310
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:56,920
The Long Ballad

311
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:02,920
The Long Ballad
