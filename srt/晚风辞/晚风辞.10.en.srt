1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,480
Unreleased hands

2
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,440
After loosening, the sky is wavering

3
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,800
As long as fate is moving, it can no longer be soft

4
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:48,800
Losing love is the most painful

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Episode 16

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,800
Mother, that useless Li Yan only knows to eat, drink, and gamble.

7
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,800
This time, he has created such a big mess.

8
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:24,000
Why haven't you ordered the investigation to be carried out?

9
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Could it be because he is the son of the Grand Tutor?

10
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The right way is to be in full harmony.

11
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,600
You also know that a vessel is like sand.

12
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,000
For a subject, it is also like this.

13
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,400
As long as they are still under my control,

14
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:46,400
perhaps a short distance is not a means to control them.

15
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,400
Grand Tutor is here.

16
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:55,400
Master, I heard that your follower died last night.

17
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,400
I'm afraid that there is no one around you who mentioned it.

18
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:02,400
I especially found another one for you.

19
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:08,400
The spring is coming. You can leave first.

20
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,400
Yes.

21
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,400
Grand Tutor, since you are a subject,

22
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:26,400
do you know what is the standard and the law?

23
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,400
It's all my fault.

24
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,400
I have no right to teach my son.

25
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,400
In the future, I will surely let my son be loyal to me.

26
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,400
I will never let you worry again.

27
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,400
It's not easy to be loyal to your son.

28
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,400
You are a good son.

29
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,400
You are a good son.

30
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,400
It's not easy to be loyal to your son.

31
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,400
I heard that recently, a lot of young girls have disappeared from Ping City.

32
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,400
They were all secretly transported to Lu City.

33
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,400
Why don't you personally go there?

34
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,400
It's a good way to explain to the people of Yunzhou.

35
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,400
What? You don't want to?

36
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,400
I have already made a decision on behalf of my son.

37
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,400
I will surely let him investigate this missing case thoroughly.

38
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,400
I will surely let him investigate this missing case thoroughly.

39
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,400
I have already taken in the person.

40
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,400
You two can handle this matter on your own.

41
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,400
Don't forget your promise to me.

42
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:38,400
You will surely investigate this matter thoroughly.

43
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,400
I will surely let you do that.

44
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,400
Hurry and follow me.

45
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,400
You are ואפ tspingright?

46
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,400
I amτε 컸พ��pal.

47
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,720
You are�� vinyl gain pose

48
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,400
Are you get that?

49
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,600
It's all because of the world and the people.

50
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,360
You traitors,

51
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,680
you have lost your virtue.

52
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,480
One day, you will be punished.

53
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,240
Who are you?

54
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,640
Someone broke into the prison.

55
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,240
We don't have time.

56
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,120
We have no evil intentions.

57
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,040
Let's talk outside.

58
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,960
Who are you?

59
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,320
Wu Mingge?

60
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,320
Take her.

61
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,640
Go to any place within ten miles of Wu Mingge.

62
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,400
Find a hiding place.

63
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,520
Someone will help you.

64
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,520
I have been a guard for more than ten years.

65
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,480
But I never thought I would die unjustly.

66
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,760
I didn't expect

67
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,760
that I would be killed by the enemy.

68
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,600
The world is unfair.

69
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,560
That's why Wu Mingge is here.

70
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,320
I won't say thank you.

71
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,760
You two,

72
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,800
I hope you can be happy.

73
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,680
You two,

74
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,200
see you later.

75
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,240
I heard that

76
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,000
Wu Mingge is investigating the missing girl case.

77
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,520
I have a clue.

78
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,000
I wonder if it can help you.

79
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,480
Please tell me.

80
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,280
Lu Cheng and Li Rui are relatives.

81
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,480
They are both criminals and gold diggers.

82
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,680
They are also very experienced.

83
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,360
The singing and dancing workshop and the brothel are very important.

84
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,680
Li Yan once said something after drinking.

85
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,680
He said that there is a big business here.

86
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:22,680
I suspect that it has something to do with the missing girl.

87
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,160
Big business?

88
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,240
Li Yan is the commandant.

89
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,760
He holds the city's security.

90
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,280
He has the right to open the city gate.

91
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,760
Although the carriage is very crowded,

92
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,760
it is risky.

93
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,040
But he said that he would open the gate

94
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:50,760
when it's dark.

95
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,960
It won't attract attention.

96
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,560
That's right.

97
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,560
Shen Wuwei was the one who escorted the carriage out.

98
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,960
The commandant believed that

99
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,760
he would be involved in the case.

100
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,760
It's too unusual.

101
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,360
Besides,

102
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,360
the celebration in Lu Cheng is also very complicated.

103
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:18,160
Except for the old Shangyuan, Duanwu, and Qixi,

104
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,160
they will also select the first and the fifteenth

105
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:25,360
to hold a feast like the fire-striking festival.

106
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,960
They will gather officials to celebrate.

107
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,360
The officials are very expensive.

108
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,360
They only blame the gold-money.

109
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,760
It seems that the big business of the father and son

110
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,360
is involved in a lot.

111
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,760
Chief Dai, how should we handle this matter?

112
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,960
The father and son of the Li family have already involved in this case.

113
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,360
But the connections behind it are complicated.

114
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,560
How about this? You two go to Lu City

115
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,560
and investigate the people involved in this case.

116
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,760
When necessary,

117
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:01,160
none of them will be left.

118
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,360
I will obey.

119
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,960
I will obey.

120
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,560
Be careful.

121
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,960
Yes.

122
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,960
The whole night, it's already dawn.

123
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,960
I'm so sleepy.

124
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,560
Do you think the people of this mansion know

125
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,960
that the prince and the princess sleep until 3 a.m. every day

126
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,760
because they went out to be the sand in the middle of the night?

127
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:44,160
They only think that their prince and princess

128
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,560
have a deep relationship

129
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,960
and spend the night together.

130
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,960
Xie Ziyuan.

131
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,160
How is it?

132
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,960
How is it?

133
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,960
Maybe in the near future,

134
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,960
when the task is completed and the divorce is signed,

135
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,760
your princess will be someone else's.

136
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,160
You want to run away from me that badly?

137
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,560
What?

138
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,760
It sounds like you don't want to leave me.

139
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:17,160
Siyao, I've thought it through.

140
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,160
I don't want to divorce you.

141
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,760
What? Do we have to fight to get a divorce?

142
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,160
Are you the exact role model?

143
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,760
How do you know the date of my love?

144
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:44,160
I told you by looking at the myself on your photo

145
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,760
that I'm the one for you.

146
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,040
1, 2, 3.

147
00:09:49,040 --> 00:10:04,180
I have to say this,

148
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:17,180
from now on Bishop Suiktai really has nothing left

149
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:18,000
in the collapse.

150
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Your Highness, something terrible has happened!

151
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
The Sky Flower?

152
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Really?

153
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
It's true.

154
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I dare not lie to you.

155
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
The doctor has checked the pulse.

156
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
He said that Your Highness might have been infected with the Sky Flower.

157
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Right now, the whole of the Xuanyuan Palace is in a critical condition.

158
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Please give the order, Your Highness,

159
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
to save us, these poor servants.

160
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Where is that woman?

161
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
The Princess Consort is deeply in love with Your Highness.

162
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
She is unwilling to leave you for a while.

163
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
No.

164
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
No one in the manor dares to approach Your Highness.

165
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
They are still in the manor right now.

166
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Mother, the Sky Flower is extremely dangerous.

167
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
It's highly contagious.

168
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
If it's not treated well,

169
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
the whole of Ping City might suffer.

170
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
We need to make a plan soon.

171
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Qing Lin, go.

172
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Seal all the exits of the Xuanyuan Palace.

173
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Yes.

174
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
City Leader, this...

175
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
This...

176
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Whether they can live or not

177
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
depends on the fate.

178
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I heard that Xie Zizhou sealed the gate of the manor

179
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
and wanted to trap us inside.

180
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Your sister is really ruthless.

181
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
She can even kill her own father.

182
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
What can I, a brother of a mother and a father, do?

183
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Oh, right.

184
00:11:44,000 --> 00:12:05,980
The

185
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
