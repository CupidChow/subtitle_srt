1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,540
Your hand that's closed to open

2
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:37,480
Transfer and let go at the same time

3
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,940
As long as fate ponders over it

4
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:42,860
Lo-l net, the lost answer

5
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:48,520
Can only comfort those who longed for

6
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,320
Episode 24

7
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:25,020
This is clearly Duan Xuhua.

8
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,240
He actually has tongued this guy's power into this place.

9
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:43,840
Shuran's

10
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,600
fine

11
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,280
I'm going to go to the temple to pray for you.

12
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,680
I'm going to go to the temple to pray for you.

13
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,800
I'll wait for you.

14
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,400
I'll wait for you.

15
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,640
I'll wait for you.

16
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,200
You're right.

17
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,560
Why do you have to fight against him?

18
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,640
Can't you just keep the opportunity

19
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,160
to fight against Xie Cizhou?

20
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,280
I'll do my best to fight against Xie Cizhou.

21
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:14,960
But I'll protect you.

22
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,600
I'll never give up.

23
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,520
Don't be silly.

24
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,440
I don't need you to die for me.

25
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,640
I want you to live well.

26
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,160
It's a deal.

27
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,120
It's been a day and a night.

28
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,240
She's not talking or moving.

29
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,440
I have to say,

30
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,400
she's really pretty.

31
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,880
Even if she's like a piece of wood,

32
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,720
she'll still look pretty when she's standing here.

33
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,560
She's the prisoner of City Leader.

34
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,880
If you don't want to be killed,

35
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,040
don't have those unethical thoughts.

36
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,440
We're just talking about our brother.

37
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,640
I just can't boss around anymore.

38
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,280
Besides,

39
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,640
you shouldn't give your brother any of your love.

40
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,360
Okay?

41
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:05,980
Mom,

42
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,860
she already died for me.

43
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,640
Please forgive me.

44
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,280
Okay?

45
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,960
Thank you, Dad.

46
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,120
OTH liberals.

47
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,200
Please nod.

48
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,680
Please.

49
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,080
Father,

50
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,080
You won't give me this?

51
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,560
Thank you, brother.

52
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,800
I'm very grateful.

53
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:56,120
Touch gather us.

54
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:20,460
Transилось of Director,

55
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,600
I believe you not only want to kill her,

56
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,080
but also yourself

57
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,800
should be punished with death.

58
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,320
I can't control the rest.

59
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,600
But this woman

60
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,640
can't enter my Flower Valley.

61
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,520
Otherwise, I can't guarantee

62
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,040
whether my fan can withstand it or not.

63
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,520
Master.

64
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,640
Ru Yue is back.

65
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,280
Go to see Chu Yi

66
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,760
and gather at Wuming Pavilion.

67
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,360
It's time for me to leave.

68
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,240
I heard Liu Ru Yue is here.

69
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,480
Shi An didn't let her in.

70
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,280
But she wrote it in her heart.

71
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,160
She just followed the order.

72
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,160
It's my fault.

73
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,240
You care about her.

74
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,880
I only have the master and servant.

75
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,240
Nothing else.

76
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,120
Do you think

77
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,360
I care?

78
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,680
You should care about her.

79
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,520
I shouldn't have cared about her.

80
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,600
I don't want to talk about the past.

81
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,920
I don't want to

82
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,240
have any grudges

83
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,680
between Si Yao and Xie Ci Yuan.

84
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,200
What matters most now

85
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,840
is to solve Xie Ci Zhou's problem.

86
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,320
Three days later

87
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,000
is my father's death anniversary.

88
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,040
At this time of year,

89
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,320
Xie Ci Zhou will hold a memorial service.

90
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,560
I think

91
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,600
this is the best chance

92
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,800
to do it.

93
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,560
Xie Ci Zhou is interesting.

94
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,120
He wanted to take the throne

95
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,920
but he was afraid of being ordered by his ex-husband.

96
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,080
He made a big memorial service.

97
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,680
I wonder

98
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,000
if he was comforting the dead

99
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,120
or playing a trick on the living.

100
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,760
Who knows?

101
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,760
I've been with him secretly for so many years.

102
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,000
I know him well.

103
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,240
But in the end,

104
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,440
I found I knew nothing about him.

105
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,600
Do you think you can come back alive?

106
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,480
If I die,

107
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,360
will your hatred

108
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,200
dissipate?

109
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,200
No.

110
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,480
I've said it before.

111
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,280
If you die,

112
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,800
I'll hate you more.

113
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,160
Because you made my sacrifice meaningless.

114
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,080
I've been raising the heartache blood to save you for so many years.

115
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,040
You must live.

116
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,320
I swear to you,

117
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,480
I'll live without any pain.

118
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,280
Okay.

119
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,680
I promise you.

120
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,000
I'll never forget you.

121
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:45,800
Yun.

122
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,240
Yun.

123
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,400
Father, what happened?

124
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,080
The soldiers of Ping City are encircled.

125
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,120
What happened?

126
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,640
Xie Ci Zhou didn't enter the Flower Valley from any direction.

127
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,320
Now it's surrounded by groups.

128
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,880
We can only retreat from the rear mountain.

129
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:03,760
You go first.

130
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,000
I want to protect the disciples in the valley.

131
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:05,960
You can't go.

132
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,000
Leave with him first.

133
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,480
What are you talking about?

134
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,680
My young master is afraid of death.

135
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,600
Let's take people to the back of the mountain.

136
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,680
You take Xiao Wan away.

137
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,640
Remember.

138
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,400
You must protect my daughter.

139
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,480
As a reward for saving my life.

140
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,760
Don't worry, Senior.

141
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,320
I'll live with you.

142
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,440
I wonder if Liu Ru Yue

143
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,280
is loyal.

144
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,720
Don't worry, Cheng Zhu.

145
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,040
For Xie Ci Yuan,

146
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,040
he will definitely do as you wish.

147
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,520
He is the most proud subordinate of Wu Feng.

148
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,920
He is also the best killer of Wu Ming Pavilion.

149
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,000
I really want to see

150
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,320
what kind of expression Xie Ci Yuan will have

151
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,520
if he knows he betrayed him.

152
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,600
Will you betray me?

153
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,800
Qing Lin, I will never betray you.

154
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,000
Even if you die,

155
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,040
you can still live.

156
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:09,720
Qing Lin.

157
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:22,880
You are awake.

158
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,560
How is the painting shop?

159
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,040
Where are my father and Shi An?

160
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,160
Senior Fang was caught by Xie Ci Zhu.

161
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,600
Shi An's whereabouts are unknown.

162
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,840
But I have sent someone to find him.

163
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,920
Shi An should be fine.

164
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,120
I have to go save my father.

165
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,160
Don't worry, An Yang.

166
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,000
Although my father is good at using poison,

167
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,000
his martial arts are not very good.

168
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,720
If the poison of self-protection

169
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,200
is also taken by the Search God,

170
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,560
he is not Xie Ci Zhou's opponent.

171
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,640
Xie Ci Yuan.

172
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,240
I have to save him.

173
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,440
I have to save him.

174
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,360
I know.

175
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,880
But you calm down first.

176
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,840
Cheng Zhu's mansion is heavily guarded.

177
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,520
Xie Ci Zhou is more prepared to deal with us.

178
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,680
If you go there rashly,

179
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,120
you will only put yourself in danger.

180
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,640
Then I can't just do nothing.

181
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,200
And,

182
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,000
believe me.

183
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,520
I will think of a way.

184
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,200
Sir,

185
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,480
I do not have branches.

186
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,080
Seeing you already can do nothing.

187
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,440
I will see you later, Sir.

188
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,840
Alright, listen to me,

189
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,800
there is more something waiting for you at the well.

190
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,640
Lord?

191
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,400
Is Lord Xuan

192
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,640
dead?

193
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,240
What a long story.

194
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,800
Leader Lu,

195
00:10:59,080 --> 00:10:59,760
I have media for you.

196
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,160
Where did you come from, Your Highness?

197
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,280
I never have seen you before.

198
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:08,520
I'm the master of Wu Ming Pavilion, Wu Feng.

199
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,320
You?

200
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,120
No wonder.

201
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,920
No wonder you could find me.

202
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,520
I came today

203
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,320
to ask you for a favor.

204
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,920
You don't have to be polite.

205
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,120
Just tell me what you want.

206
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:25,320
I'll do whatever you ask.

207
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,320
What's wrong?

208
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,520
Master was ambushed by Xie Si Zhou.

209
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,120
The assassin is still alive.

210
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,520
Impossible.

211
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,120
Didn't he say that he wouldn't act rashly

212
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,520
before the time comes?

213
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,320
How could he be ambushed by Xie Si Zhou?

214
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,520
Where is he now?

215
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,720
In Chengzhou.

216
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,520
I don't know the details.

217
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,120
Would you like to go with me

218
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,320
to investigate?

219
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,120
Let's go.

220
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,720
I've taught you

221
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,520
not to trust anyone.

222
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,520
The water is flowing.

223
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,120
Our story is gone.

224
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:44,520
The past is empty.

225
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,320
Now there's only pain in my heart.

226
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,720
Tears blind my eyes.

227
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,520
I can't see your back.

228
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,920
This part is irreversible.

229
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:03,120
Only sorrow remains.

230
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:06,720
My heart is like a sand.

231
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,520
You are in the wild.

232
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,320
I don't care about anyone.

233
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:17,520
Maybe it's a fog.

234
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,120
Time flies.

235
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:24,920
Time flies.

236
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:31,120
Who remembers the beautiful scenery?

237
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,320
My heart is like a sand.

238
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:39,120
You are in the wild.

239
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,120
I don't care about anyone.

240
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:46,320
Maybe it's a fog.

241
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,920
Time flies.

242
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,520
Time flies.

243
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:59,720
Who remembers the beautiful scenery?

244
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:06,120
Time flies.

245
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:11,320
Time flies.

246
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:16,520
Time flies.
