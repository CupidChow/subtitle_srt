1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Unable to let go of your hand, let go and swim in the sky

2
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
As long as fate is too far away, it can't be continued

3
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The love that has been lost is the most sorrowful

4
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Episode 16

5
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Where is Si Yao?

6
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
There is no Si Yao here. I'm afraid that you are not well.

7
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm sorry.

8
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Then, what about your young master?

9
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The young master's status is very important.

10
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Not every patient of Flower Valley needs to be taken care of by him.

11
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
What?

12
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
You think that I'm not well-treated?

13
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Then why don't you leave as soon as possible?

14
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It's good for us.

15
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'm sorry.

16
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
If you really feel sorry, then deal with your own grudges.

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Don't drag the Flower Valley into this.

18
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm leaving now.

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
You...

20
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
What happened?

21
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Get up.

22
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
How is it?

23
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Are you hurt?

24
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I'm fine.

25
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
No water?

26
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I didn't do it.

27
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I did it.

28
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I insisted on leaving.

29
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It has nothing to do with Young Master Shi An.

30
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You're lucky.

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Even Lord Yan doesn't accept you.

32
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It's because you're a master.

33
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Wait for two days.

34
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Then you can go back to your room.

35
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I'll wait for you.

36
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'll wait for you.

37
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I'll wait for you.

38
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I'll wait for you.

39
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I'll wait for you.

40
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'll wait for you.

41
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'll wait for you.

42
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'll wait for you.

43
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
After two days,

44
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
you can go back to your room.

45
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Let the Qi blood pass through the Qi Jing and the Eight Veins.

46
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
It's good for your recovery.

47
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Thank you, Senior.

48
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'll never forget your kindness.

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
No need.

50
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Kid, I'll be honest.

51
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I don't like you at all.

52
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I don't want to save you.

53
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It's my daughter who doesn't want you to die.

54
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I don't want her to be sad.

55
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'm sorry.

56
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Xiaowan has never asked me for anything since she was a child.

57
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,000
You're the only one who can make her bow to me.

58
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
After you're recovered,

59
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
leave here quickly.

60
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Don't bother my daughter again.

61
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I know I don't deserve your forgiveness.

62
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Don't worry, Senior.

63
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I've informed my subordinates.

64
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'll leave as soon as they arrive.

65
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
的

66
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
The thing that Xie Siyuan fell on the ground yesterday

67
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
has nothing to do with me.

68
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I know.

69
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,840
I know.

70
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,520
Didn't you say that?

71
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,560
But when you came in,

72
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,240
you still suspected me, right?

73
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,800
In your heart,

74
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,240
I'm actually that kind of person.

75
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,320
You're not that kind of person.

76
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,120
I know

77
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,760
you don't have any bad feelings for Xie Zi Yuan.

78
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,480
I do.

79
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,560
What?

80
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,480
I said

81
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,000
I had a lot of bad intentions for Xie Zi Yuan.

82
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,040
But because he's the one in your heart,

83
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,880
even if I can't wait to punish him,

84
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,120
I won't really hurt him.

85
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:08,960
Mu An,

86
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,800
in my eyes,

87
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,560
nothing is more important than you.

88
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,320
Where on earth am I?

89
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,560
Is it worth it to treat me like this?

90
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:35,840
Speaking of which,

91
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,640
it's not that good.

92
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,120
But it can only be you

93
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,320
and no one else.

94
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,580
Chow Yun yaşe

95
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,520
As expected.

96
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,000
The more beautiful the microscopy is,

97
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:18,880
the better the

98
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,420
blood Pakistania

99
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:22,260
I still let him die.

100
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:41,380
I'll ask you one last time.

101
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,840
Ha pantビ

102
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,580
Ha pantビ

103
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,080
He wADA me

104
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,920
He wADA me

105
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:50,940
Lets go

106
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,400
Xia Ciyuan

107
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,420
ded me

108
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,460
detTe

109
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,720
We are Knight

110
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,720
I

111
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,600
I

112
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,560
Is it possible?

113
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,440
The master of Yucheng

114
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,600
should have protected the people.

115
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,520
But you are so heartless

116
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,080
and despise the people.

117
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,360
What a good word.

118
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,400
In order to train a killer,

119
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,480
how many people have you sacrificed?

120
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,640
Have you counted?

121
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,200
For the great cause of Yucheng,

122
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,160
someone has to sacrifice.

123
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,640
You are right.

124
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,360
You are so right.

125
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,280
So these stupid women

126
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,760
can sacrifice for me.

127
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,280
It's their great honor.

128
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,360
You are a lunatic.

129
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,800
So what?

130
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,160
This is a good color.

131
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,320
Don't let her die too soon.

132
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,160
Yes.

133
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,520
Daughter.

134
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,440
What?

135
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,760
I have a bad appetite.

136
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,640
Are you worried about

137
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,120
that guy named Xie?

138
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,200
Don't worry.

139
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,160
As long as he practices martial arts,

140
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,720
he will recover soon.

141
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,080
Yes.

142
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,440
I see.

143
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,320
You are afraid that

144
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,400
he will take revenge on Xie Cizhou

145
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,400
after he recovers.

146
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,680
It will be more dangerous.

147
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,240
Xie Cizhou

148
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,360
is even more heartless

149
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,600
than we thought.

150
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,400
Father.

151
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,160
Do you remember when you were

152
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,680
looking for me in Lu City?

153
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,760
Did you save some girls who disappeared?

154
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,320
I remember.

155
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,720
Those girls were very poor.

156
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,520
They were all

157
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,240
sold as goods for trade

158
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,680
and were bribed by those courtiers.

159
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,840
They were sold far more than them.

160
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,160
There are many people

161
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,080
who can't live or die.

162
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,160
Really?

163
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:16,760
I remember

164
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,080
there is a book in the library of Flower Valley.

165
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,720
It recorded a secret trick

166
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,480
to use the blood of girls

167
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,520
to protect youth.

168
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,560
You mean

169
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,080
the flower-shaped sand?

170
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,080
Yes.

171
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,360
I don't know where Xie Cizhou

172
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,800
found this secret trick.

173
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,040
He secretly found a lot of girls

174
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,160
and released blood.

175
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,360
It has been a long time.

176
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,080
But he found it recently.

177
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,640
How could this be?

178
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,360
How could this be?

179
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,480
Impossible.

180
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:49,920
Impossible.

181
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,760
This is impossible.

182
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:54,920
Father.

183
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,680
Do you know something?

184
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,360
Where did you get the book?

185
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,000
The flower-shaped sand

186
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,880
is well-trained

187
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,240
and not only makes people look younger,

188
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,520
but also makes them

189
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,160
improve their skills.

190
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,440
Actually, my daughter,

191
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,960
I made this book

192
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,920
when I was young.

193
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,920
I was just trying to make a name for myself.

194
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:19,720
But I forgot that

195
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,640
practicing evil tricks is not the right thing to do.

196
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,840
After I discovered the flower-shaped sand,

197
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,040
I traveled around the world.

198
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,240
I once met a mysterious girl

199
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,560
and talked to her

200
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,440
about this trick.

201
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,320
But

202
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,520
I think

203
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,280
it's just a nonsense

204
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,480
when I was young.

205
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,120
It's all my fault.

206
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:43,800
Such a coincidence?

207
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,360
Anyway,

208
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,280
I can't blame her.

209
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,560
Father.

210
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,040
It's not the time to blame yourself.

211
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,720
If you really want to end this tragedy,

212
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,000
we can't just stand by

213
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,280
Xie Ciyuan's return to the capital.

214
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,680
You're right.

215
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:04,720
Now,

216
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,400
killing Xie Cizhou

217
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,440
is a good thing

218
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,480
for the world, the people,

219
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,400
and the innocent girls who died.

220
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:14,840
How about this?

221
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,400
You go with me to get the flower-shaped sand

222
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,480
and give it to the boy named Xie.

223
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,240
The flower-shaped sand

224
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,760
is only one of the seeds.

225
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,920
It can increase the power of a family.

226
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,200
Father, are you sure you want to give it to him?

227
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,840
Maybe it's destiny.

228
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,440
The key is the flower.

229
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,120
Only those with broken heart can take it.

230
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,400
It happens that Xie

231
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,200
is the best choice.

232
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,080
I hope

233
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:45,800
we can end this evil debt as soon as possible.

234
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,720
The flower is so beautiful.

235
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,920
It's so beautiful.

236
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
It's so beautiful.

237
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,120
It's so beautiful.

238
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,200
It's so beautiful.

239
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,280
It's so beautiful.

240
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,360
It's so beautiful.

241
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,440
It's so beautiful.

242
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,520
It's so beautiful.

243
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,600
It's so beautiful.

244
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,680
It's so beautiful.

245
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,760
It's so beautiful.

246
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,840
It's so beautiful.

247
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:17,920
It's so beautiful.

248
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
It's so beautiful.

249
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,080
It's so beautiful.

250
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,160
It's so beautiful.

251
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,240
It's so beautiful.

252
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,320
It's so beautiful.

253
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,400
It's so beautiful.

254
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,480
It's so beautiful.

255
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,560
It's so beautiful.

256
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,640
It's so beautiful.

257
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,720
It's so beautiful.

258
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,800
It's so beautiful.

259
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,880
It's so beautiful.

260
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,960
It's so beautiful.

261
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,960
It's so beautiful.
