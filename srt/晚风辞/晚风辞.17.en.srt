1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,480
Unreleased hands

2
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,320
Let go of the sky and swim

3
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,720
Only let fate never be able to stay

4
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:48,600
Losing love is the most sorrowful

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Episode 16

6
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,080
Report!

7
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,640
I'm here to send a message.

8
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,200
What?

9
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,520
Is there anything else you want to say behind my back?

10
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,920
The two of them are trying to kill the Emperor.

11
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,120
They are surrounded by the Imperial Guards.

12
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,000
They are trying to kill the Emperor.

13
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,480
Today, I want your life.

14
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,120
Xie Ci Yuan.

15
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,120
Xie Ci Yuan.

16
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:14,520
Pleasefor

17
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,280
My good brother.

18
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
That's what you're doing to me.

19
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It seems you would like to hear the story of Lü create her god from rodzimu Skinparc

20
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
So I brought tripot Latex

21
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
equip they're combined

22
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Then it's carry rain

23
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
preview

24
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
midsummer

25
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
jade

26
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
ok

27
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
thank you

28
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
you're welcome

29
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,700
great

30
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Xie Zi Yuan!

31
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,240
Xie Zi Yuan is dead?

32
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,400
Master said that you were too worried.

33
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,600
So he prescribed a sedative for you.

34
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,600
Drink it while it's hot. I added some dried herbs. It won't be bitter.

35
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,000
I didn't mean anything else.

36
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:04,200
I just want to know if Xie Zi Yuan is dead or not.

37
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,400
You want him to be dead or alive?

38
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,600
He lied to me so much.

39
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,600
I want him to die in a place where he can't be buried.

40
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,200
Congratulations. You've fulfilled your wish.

41
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,400
Mu An, I don't know what you and Xie Zi Yuan have been through.

42
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,800
But it was just a dream.

43
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,600
Now, you should return to your life.

44
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,200
Look at yourself.

45
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,200
Look at your eyes.

46
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,600
The person by your side is me.

47
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,200
The person who will be with you in your life and death is me too.

48
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,600
You've been too tired these days.

49
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,000
You should rest.

50
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,600
When you've recovered, I'll travel around with you.

51
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,200
I'll see the mountains and waters you want to see.

52
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,800
As for other things,

53
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,200
let's not think about it anymore.

54
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,400
Leave everything to me and Master.

55
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,400
Okay?

56
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,200
The news said that Xie Zi Yuan was killed because of Wu Feng's sedative.

57
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:30,400
The news said that Xie Zi Yuan was killed because of Wu Feng's sedative.

58
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,000
Is this related to the Flower Valley?

59
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,600
It doesn't matter.

60
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,800
It's very important!

61
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,600
Yes.

62
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,400
It was the Flower Valley that betrayed the Wu Ming Pavilion.

63
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,200
So what?

64
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,400
He caused you so much trouble.

65
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,800
We're just going back to the capital.

66
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,000
You have thousands of ways to kill him.

67
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,200
You have thousands of ways to kill him.

68
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,400
I won't interfere with you.

69
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:22,000
But why do you use the Wu Ming Pavilion's clue that I got to betray him?

70
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
In the end, I became the traitor of the Wu Ming Pavilion.

71
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,600
How do you want me to hate him from the bottom of my heart?

72
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,400
If you don't hate him,

73
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,000
then forget him completely.

74
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
That's even better.

75
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,740
The Gui Hua Tree

76
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,440
The Gui Hua Tree I want...

77
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,840
Please hurry and get someone to send it.

78
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,440
Okay.

79
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,440
I'll send someone to do it.

80
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,440
Don't think of the flower in the breeze.

81
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,840
Bring it back to the City Hall.

82
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,840
If there's a resistance, take it down on the spot.

83
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,040
Yes.

84
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,440
I'll go.

85
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,440
Your Highness.

86
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,440
I told you to send a message to Liu Ru Yue to ask him to leave.

87
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,640
Why would the Seven Phoenix Pavilion still have so many people?

88
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,040
Forgive me, Your Highness.

89
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,040
I did bring the message to Chief Dai.

90
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,440
But Chief Dai is worried about you.

91
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,640
He's determined not to leave.

92
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,440
So...

93
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,040
But other sites have been evacuated.

94
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,280
Only here and the Seven Phoenix Pavilion

95
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,880
are still left with some people.

96
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,880
It's not a big loss.

97
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,280
Leave a group of people

98
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,080
and leave a city.

99
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,520
If anyone escapes,

100
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,520
we'll take them all.

101
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,280
If you can't escape,

102
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,280
remember to take care of yourself.

103
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,580
The Chief just opened the Gui Du.

104
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,420
His heart is unstable.

105
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:22,620
If he had fought with someone today,

106
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:25,620
he would have been seriously injured.

107
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,620
It's all because of the Chief's internal force.

108
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:31,620
Otherwise, he would have been punished.

109
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:35,620
But if he doesn't deal with it as soon as possible,

110
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,620
he might be injured.

111
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,620
Then you opened the prescription.

112
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,620
Is there anything difficult?

113
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,660
If you want to regenerate your heart,

114
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,660
you need to go to the Flower Valley.

115
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:52,660
There are many rare herbs in the Flower Valley.

116
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,660
There are also many high-quality dietists

117
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,660
to keep you healthy.

118
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:58,660
If I calculate it,

119
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:01,660
he should have returned to the Flower Valley.

120
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:03,660
Your Highness,

121
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:06,660
I heard that the message from Wu Ming Ge...

122
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:08,660
It can't be him.

123
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:09,660
He said

124
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,660
he wouldn't let me die so easily.

125
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:12,660
But the evidence is clear.

126
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,660
The one who sent the message to Xie Zi Zhou

127
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,700
is the Flower Valley.

128
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,700
It's not revenge.

129
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,700
Even if it's him,

130
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:20,700
I have nothing to say.

131
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,700
I owe him.

132
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:25,700
Don't worry, Chief.

133
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,700
I'll prescribe some medicine for you

134
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,700
to stabilize your injury

135
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,700
and make more plans.

136
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:32,700
Thank you, Physician Qin.

137
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,700
Your Highness,

138
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,700
the city is in a bad shape.

139
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:43,700
It's hard to get away.

140
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,700
Xie Zi Zhou made a huge mistake

141
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,700
and pretended to be you

142
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,700
and hung a corpse on the gate.

143
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,700
I don't know what he meant.

144
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:53,700
Killing Jing Hao.

145
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:55,700
After this,

146
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,700
all the officials who were interested in him

147
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,700
in the court

148
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,700
dared not speak.

149
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:01,700
They were afraid that the fire would burn them.

150
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,700
After all, even his brothers and companions

151
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,700
could kill him.

152
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:08,700
The world is in a storm.

153
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:10,700
Wu Feng is going to die.

154
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:13,700
Wu Ming Ge is in a mess.

155
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,740
He can take advantage of the situation

156
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,740
and kill the King Yi.

157
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:19,740
What should we do

158
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:20,740
between the King Yi and me?

159
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:22,740
We'll wait for a good opportunity

160
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:25,740
to leave the city.

161
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:47,740
Memories come back like water.

162
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:50,740
Our story is gone.

163
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:54,740
The sweetness of the past is empty.

164
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:58,740
Now only the heartache remains.

165
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:01,740
Tears flood my eyes.

166
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:05,740
I can't see your back.

167
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:08,740
The love is gone.

168
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:12,740
Only sorrow remains.

169
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:16,740
My heart is sad.

170
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:20,740
You are in the wild.

171
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,740
No one cares about you.

172
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:27,740
The story is a fog of fog.

173
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:31,740
The years are like sand.

174
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:34,740
Gradually, time is washed away.

175
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:41,740
Who still remembers the love in the breeze?

176
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:44,780
My heart is sad.

177
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:48,780
You are in the wild.

178
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:51,780
No one cares about you.

179
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:55,780
The story is a fog of fog.

180
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:59,780
The years are like sand.

181
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:02,780
Gradually, time is washed away.

182
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:09,780
Who still remembers the love in the breeze?

183
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:14,780
The story is a fog of fog.

184
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:18,780
The years are like sand.

185
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:21,780
Gradually, time is washed away.

186
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:28,780
Who still remembers the love in the breeze?
