1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,480
The hand that will not let go

2
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:51,640
After letting go,ева

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Episode 16

4
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,440
I heard that Xie Zizhou

5
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,880
sealed the gate of the mansion

6
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:09,840
and wanted to trap us

7
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,080
inside.

8
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,560
Your sister

9
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,800
is really ruthless.

10
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,400
She can even kill her own father.

11
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,160
I'm her brother.

12
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,400
I'm nothing.

13
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:23,800
By the way,

14
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,640
the interview is in two days.

15
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,160
The nobles from all the counties

16
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,160
will come to the city.

17
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,400
I believe that

18
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,240
we will gain a lot of money.

19
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,760
What are you doing?

20
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,840
Sir, please.

21
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,720
Our daughter is missing.

22
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,400
Go and check.

23
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,120
Stop the car.

24
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,600
We haven't seen the nobles for three days and three nights.

25
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,440
Please help us find them.

26
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,080
You just lost someone.

27
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,720
You've been missing for years.

28
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,480
We don't have so many people to help you.

29
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,360
Hurry up.

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,920
You're wasting our time.

31
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:58,720
Sir.

32
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,680
Sir.

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,560
Please.

34
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,440
Help us find them.

35
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,240
Sir.

36
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:03,920
Sir.

37
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,120
You two are so serious about finding them.

38
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:13,560
I believe

39
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,440
you will gain something.

40
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,160
I hope so.

41
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,480
But I don't know

42
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,120
how our village is doing now.

43
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,560
Let's go to another place and find them.

44
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,520
Let's go.

45
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,080
In the past,

46
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,080
the girl who lost her in Ping City

47
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,240
was sent to Lu City.

48
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,520
Now,

49
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,440
why are all the girls in Lu City

50
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,280
missing?

51
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:44,920
I'm afraid

52
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,080
we can only find those girls

53
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,040
who are missing

54
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:50,600
and reveal the truth.

55
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,400
Lu City

56
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,920
You've been very worried

57
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,480
since you met that couple.

58
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,840
Xiao Cui's parents are so close.

59
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,160
I think they must love their daughter very much.

60
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,520
Such a relationship

61
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,960
is really attractive.

62
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,200
I didn't know who my parents were

63
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,520
and where they were since I was a child.

64
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,120
If possible,

65
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,600
I want to help their family reunite.

66
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,360
It's also a way to help others

67
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,480
and comfort myself.

68
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,640
Don't worry.

69
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,240
We will do our best

70
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,120
to help them.

71
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:40,720
Okay.

72
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,280
Let's go and check

73
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,680
the bottom of these people tonight.

74
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,760
Look at these goods.

75
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,360
They are all good goods.

76
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,640
They...

77
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,200
Playing nice.

78
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,000
Good.

79
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,920
Looks big.

80
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,760
Wei Bi,

81
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,400
well, it's on me.

82
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,880
How organized you are!

83
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,160
Congratulations.

84
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,400
op!

85
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,000
What a dirty vice they kept!

86
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,280
Damn it!

87
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,400
Nobody knew at all!

88
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,520
I don't know

89
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,440
What's the matter?

90
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,080
You two want to save people?

91
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,200
My partner saw the signal

92
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,040
and destroyed all the goods in his hands.

93
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,400
None of those women can survive.

94
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,000
Don't stop me.

95
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,120
He deserves to die.

96
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,840
He deserves to die.

97
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,280
But not now.

98
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,880
When I get the clues on him,

99
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,800
I'll kill them myself

100
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,320
and make them pay for what they did.

101
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,000
Your Highness,

102
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,120
those women have been sent back

103
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,280
as you ordered.

104
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,200
One more thing.

105
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:07,640
Go ahead.

106
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,840
We haven't heard from the Chu's.

107
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,000
There are missing women in Ping City

108
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,880
who were sent back.

109
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,800
Who did it?

110
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,240
We don't know yet.

111
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,400
It's said that those women

112
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,520
were not hurt.

113
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,320
They were treated on purpose.

114
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,680
Treated on purpose?

115
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,120
Could it be

116
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,520
the Flower Valley?

117
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,640
What's the purpose

118
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,440
of saving these women?

119
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,800
I've just seen it.

120
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,240
There are no married women

121
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,440
in the carriage.

122
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,040
If only I could be faster.

123
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,480
If I could stop the signal from being sent,

124
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,040
wouldn't those women die?

125
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,680
I should be faster.

126
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,240
You've done a good job.

127
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,680
You've done a good job.

128
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,120
No one knows

129
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,040
how these people

130
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,640
will be so heartbroken.

131
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,760
It's not your fault.

132
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:16,600
But...

133
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,600
No buts.

134
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,040
We are human.

135
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,240
We have our weaknesses.

136
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:20,880
When we have weaknesses,

137
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,880
we can't do anything.

138
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,240
Sometimes,

139
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,440
we can only make

140
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,840
the smallest choice.

141
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,680
You've done your best.

142
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:29,960
I know.

143
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,160
I'm sorry.

144
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,440
Why are you so stupid?

145
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,360
On the skin,

146
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,680
you want to kill your husband again?

147
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,560
You're so stubborn.

148
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,000
I'm not as stubborn as you.

149
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,640
I'm very stubborn.

150
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,400
Don't move.

151
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,480
In Wu Ming Pavilion,

152
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,080
people are all in a bad mood.

153
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,320
This injury

154
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,400
is nothing.

155
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,680
It's just a little bit.

156
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,720
I know

157
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,440
the damage you caused.

158
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:21,960
Don't be so stubborn.

159
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,680
If you don't work as a killer,

160
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,080
you can open a clinic.

161
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,880
I'll keep an eye on the house.

162
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,920
You're talking nonsense again.

163
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,600
I'm going out to do something.

164
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,440
You should take a break.

165
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,640
We'll wait for the legendary

166
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,600
Lantern Festival.

167
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,560
Let's see if we can catch any big fish.

168
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,560
Illusion!

169
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:24,200
Jegей Rajrata,

170
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,640
you don't understand.

171
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,160
Have you made up your mind?

172
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,120
Are you going to tell me

173
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,120
I don't know.

174
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,120
I really don't know.

175
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,520
You really don't know?

176
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,520
My Lord.

177
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,320
My Lord.

178
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,520
Please forgive me.

179
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,520
I just want to make some money.

180
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,520
I promise.

181
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,520
I swear.

182
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,720
I will never do anything

183
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,120
that will harm the heaven or earth again.

184
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,920
Li Yan.

185
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,120
Tell those girls

186
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,120
who were kidnapped

187
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,120
to come here.

188
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,120
I can consider

189
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,120
giving them the list.

190
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,120
I only know her.

191
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,320
I'm just a delivery man.

192
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,720
How can I know what the list is?

193
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,120
Have you ever seen

194
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,120
a girl with tearful eyes and a tearful mouth?

195
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,120
Tearful eyes.

196
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,120
Tearful eyes.

197
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,120
I've never seen her.

198
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,120
I really have never seen her.

199
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,120
Please let me go.

200
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,120
Please let me go.

201
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,720
Please let me go.

202
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,120
Let me go.

203
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:59,120
Only Start-up fire Digital

204
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,120
It's your turn.

205
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,040
The last batch.

206
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,480
There's a crack in the corner.

207
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,040
It's very beautiful.

208
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,240
Where is he now?

209
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,880
He was taken away by a big figure.

210
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,440
How big is he?

211
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,440
He's in the same group with Li Rui.

212
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,880
I only know so much.

213
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:30,960
As for that big figure,

214
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,360
only the Governor Li has seen him.

215
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,800
How can I have the right to contact such a little person?

216
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,680
You can't say it out.

217
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,240
The law of Yunzhou is strict.

218
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,280
You must know

219
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,120
the law of Yunzhou.

220
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,440
Carriage,

221
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,760
spiritual pond,

222
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,600
and the ancient Yang Hui.

223
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,640
Please, spare my life.

224
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,360
I know I've said it all.

225
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,680
Please.

226
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,520
I remember I said

227
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,680
you can't live through tonight.

228
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,880
After dinner, I'll take you out for a walk.

229
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,720
The local people in Lu City

230
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,000
haven't seen it yet.

231
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,680
It's important.

232
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,080
Guess

233
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,640
how many horses I'm going to take this time.

234
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,800
Duocheng,

235
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,240
five horses.

236
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,000
You're really good at it.

237
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,240
I just don't know

238
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,040
if the other party has so many horses

239
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,000
to pick with you.

240
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,520
Where is Lu City?

241
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,200
As long as you have money,

242
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,400
you can never find a good horse.

243
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,440
Look,

244
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,960
you're an outsider.

245
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,000
I'm flattered

246
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,240
by your words.

247
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,120
Whether it's

248
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,560
a new horse,

249
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,360
or a pure horse,

250
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,200
you can get

251
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,080
a thousand miles of horses.

252
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,760
How can there be a horse farm

253
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,560
in the south of Lu City?

254
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,680
There must be something wrong.

255
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,040
Okay.

256
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,280
You two,

257
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,040
I'd like to ask

258
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,560
where is the place

259
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,600
where you sell horses?

260
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,040
You want to buy horses, too?

261
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,200
Yes.

262
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,600
Please make yourself at home

263
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,840
and give us a name.

264
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,040
I wonder

265
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,640
what kind of horse you like.

266
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,960
In my opinion,

267
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,720
you should like

268
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,440
a horse of a great breed.

269
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,640
Is it funny?

270
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,200
Try again.

271
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,200
I'm sorry.

272
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,200
I'm sorry.

273
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,200
I'm sorry.

274
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,200
I'm sorry.

275
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,200
I'm sorry.

276
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,200
I'm sorry.

277
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,200
I'm sorry.

278
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,200
I'm sorry.

279
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,200
I'm sorry.

280
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,200
I'm sorry.

281
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,200
I'm sorry.

282
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,200
I'm sorry.

283
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,200
I'm sorry.

284
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,200
I'm sorry.

285
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,200
I'm sorry.

286
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,200
I'm sorry.

287
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,200
I'm sorry.

288
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,200
I'm sorry.

289
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,200
I'm sorry.

290
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,200
I'm sorry.

291
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,200
I'm sorry.

292
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,200
I'm sorry.

293
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,200
I'm sorry.

294
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,200
I'm sorry.

295
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,200
I'm sorry.

296
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,200
I'm sorry.

297
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,200
I'm sorry.

298
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,200
I'm sorry.

299
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,200
I'm sorry.

300
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,200
I'm sorry.

301
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,200
I'm sorry.

302
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,200
I'm sorry.

303
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,200
