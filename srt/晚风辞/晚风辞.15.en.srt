1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,480
Unreleased hands

2
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,360
Let go and swim in the sky

3
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,800
As long as fate can't keep us together

4
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:48,800
Losing love is the most painful

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Episode 16

6
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
You're wrong. You belong to me from the beginning to the end.

7
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
No!

8
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Let go of her!

9
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Xie Ci Ren.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm going to kill you!

11
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You...

12
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Master, you're awake.

13
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Where's Si Yao?

14
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Doctor Qin has removed your bones.

15
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Please check if there's anything wrong.

16
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Xie Ci Ren

17
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
How did you remove my bones?

18
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Of course, I used Doctor Qin's method.

19
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Then, where's Si Yao?

20
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
She...

21
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Speak!

22
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
She...

23
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
She was taken away.

24
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You're just watching.

25
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
She was taken away?

26
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
If she's leaving, how are we going to come?

27
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
She's from the Flower Valley.

28
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
She doesn't belong to the Wu Ming Hall.

29
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
She doesn't belong to any place.

30
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
She only belongs to me and you.

31
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You still won't tell me the truth?

32
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
How did you remove my bones?

33
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Did you use Si Yao's heart blood?

34
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Speak!

35
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
So what if I did?

36
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I did take her heart blood.

37
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
She's a fake.

38
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
If you want me to kill her,

39
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
do it now!

40
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Master, what you did was to save you.

41
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
What's more, Si Yao was taken away by the Flower Valley.

42
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
The skills of the Valley Master Fang Yu

43
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
can kill people, flesh and bones.

44
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
She won't be harmed.

45
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
What?

46
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
The person who really wronged her

47
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
is me.

48
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Mu Wan, you're awake.

49
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Yes.

50
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm here.

51
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You remember me.

52
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You know who I am.

53
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
It hurts.

54
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
It's the wound, right?

55
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
The heart is bleeding.

56
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You need to rest well

57
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
to recover from this serious injury.

58
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I'll go find Master and give you acupuncture.

59
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Okay.

60
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
What's wrong?

61
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Where's Xie Zi Yuan?

62
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Why are you asking about him?

63
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
He tricked you while you were unconscious.

64
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
He even hurt you to such a point

65
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
that you didn't care about him at all.

66
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Do you still miss him?

67
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Do you know that if I'm late,

68
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
you'll die?

69
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Miss him?

70
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I really miss his death.

71
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
He tricked me.

72
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I was afraid that he died in such a painful way

73
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
that I didn't have the chance to avenge him.

74
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Don't worry.

75
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Xie Zi Yuan hurt you.

76
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I'll find him to clear this account.

77
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
But the most important thing now is

78
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
that you rest well.

79
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
We'll take our time.

80
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
It's all my fault

81
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
for making you suffer so much.

82
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I'm sorry.

83
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
You're better.

84
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
If you can practice martial arts

85
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
more diligently,

86
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
you won't lose to me.

87
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Stop nagging.

88
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Why should I do that?

89
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I have you by my side.

90
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It's enough that I'm by your side.

91
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
As for martial arts,

92
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
it's not a matter of one day.

93
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
We'll take our time.

94
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Remember,

95
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
this is your battle field.

96
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
You don't have time to learn.

97
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Only by killing people and becoming yourself

98
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
can you survive.

99
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Come on.

100
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
From today on,

101
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
you're the new assassin of Wu Ming Pavilion,

102
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Si Yao.

103
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Si Yao.

104
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It's all in the past.

105
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I won't let you get hurt again.

106
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I promise.

107
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I'll protect you.

108
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I promise.

109
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I'll protect you.

110
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Xie Zi Yuan.

111
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Wu Ming Pavilion.

112
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I won't let you get hurt again.

113
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Have a good rest.

114
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I'll tell Master that you're awake.

115
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Shi An.

116
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Yes.

117
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Tell my father

118
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
that I want to go home.

119
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Okay.

120
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Okay.

121
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Master.

122
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I heard it all.

123
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Xiaowan is awake.

124
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
It means she's feeling better.

125
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
We'll leave tomorrow morning

126
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
to return to the Flower Valley.

127
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Yes, Master.

128
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
The most important thing after you go back

129
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
is to take care of Xiaowan.

130
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
She has suffered a lot

131
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
over the past year.

132
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
The information about Wu Ming Pavilion

133
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
can be used to thank Si Yuan.

134
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I've already sent it to the City Leader's Mansion.

135
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
You have to pay a price

136
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
for hurting my daughter.

137
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Thank you.

138
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
How dare you come here?

139
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
This is the grudge between me and him.

140
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,720
and resolve them with my own efforts.

141
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,320
Sorry.

142
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,200
I'm sorry

143
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,080
about what happened in the valley.

144
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,680
Sorry?

145
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,920
You set a prime topic for yourself.

146
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,240
I owe you

147
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,480
huge gratitude.

148
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,640
Now I have wealth

149
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,000
that I need to earn with my own efforts.

150
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,680
TS you're finally sensationless.

151
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,360
worth your effort?

152
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,040
You made me relax

153
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,000
and let me tell the truth.

154
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,920
You didn't want to leave me

155
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,920
and kept me in the mansion

156
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,920
pretending to be a killer and kept me away from you.

157
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,240
But you never told me

158
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,760
that you were my mother

159
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,080
from the beginning to the end.

160
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,040
You were like a moon in the sky,

161
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,960
w IDEBLa.

162
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,680
What a smart plan.

163
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,240
And all the mess

164
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,440
that have led to our lives

165
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,160
when we're helping each other

166
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,120
are also just pike回去 ideas.

167
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,440
Am I too stupid

168
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,880
to ask?

169
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,440
Liu Ruoyue told me from the beginning

170
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,120
that if I want to become a killer,

171
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,880
I can't trust anyone.

172
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,760
But I trusted you.

173
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,960
Xue Ziyuan,

174
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,360
I won't kill you.

175
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,520
Because your life

176
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,760
was saved by my heart.

177
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,520
You don't deserve to die.

178
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,560
You must live for me.

179
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:13,040
But I will never forgive you for what you did.

180
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,320
Never.

181
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,760
If hating me

182
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,200
can make you feel better,

183
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,280
then hate me.

184
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,280
Your pipe monster

185
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:36,780
و

186
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:38,720
is standing in your way.

187
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,280
Only you signed the Silent Abyss.

188
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,320
Now it's just a Tang Tree.

189
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:58,760
No match for you.

190
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:02,040
It's okay until I was dead.

191
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:04,980
Marry me now,

192
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,520
tears can't separate us.

193
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,320
No sorrow between us

194
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,820
can make us love,

195
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,340
nor hurt me if we're apart.

196
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:25,800
My heart 대해

197
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:59,800
The Long Ballad

198
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:33,800
The Long Ballad

199
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:33,800
The Long Ballad

200
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:41,800
The Long Ballad
