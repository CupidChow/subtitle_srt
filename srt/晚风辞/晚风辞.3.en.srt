1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Unable to let go of your hand, let go and let the sky swim

2
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Only let fate play, but can't stay

3
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The lost love is the most beautiful

4
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Episode 16

5
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
City Leader, because of the assassin of Wu Ming Pavilion,

6
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
he sneaked into the Xuanyuan Palace.

7
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Lord Qinglin led his team to destroy the two strongholds of Wu Ming Pavilion

8
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
with the Commandant of the Command.

9
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
But we still need to re-examine the clues.

10
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Then continue investigating.

11
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I will soon be able to extract this poisonous flow.

12
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Yes.

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Reporting to City Leader,

14
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
there has been a new book in the city recently.

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The words in the book are fierce.

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
How dare you publicly slander City Leader's reputation

17
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
and spread false rumors to disturb the people's hearts.

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I think this matter must not be underestimated.

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
There was once someone who dared not be lonely in this world.

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
He tried to use the pen as a sword,

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
but he was too powerful.

22
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
City Leader is wise.

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
If we don't stop these nonsense

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
and use it to suppress the evil,

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm afraid it will cause a great disaster.

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I ask you to give the order

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
to stop the evil.

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I will not allow it.

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I will not allow it.

30
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I will not allow it.

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I will not allow it.

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I ask you to give the order

33
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
to investigate this matter thoroughly.

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Official Li, you are wrong.

35
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I don't need to know their whereabouts.

36
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I don't need to know their motives.

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
What they need is freedom.

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
But freedom

39
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
will have to pay a price.

40
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Give the order.

41
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
From today onwards,

42
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
all those who participated in the publication of this book,

43
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
the transmission, and the publishing of the book,

44
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
no matter what their official positions are,

45
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
their status,

46
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
their status as a noble,

47
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
and their status as a criminal,

48
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
they will be executed.

49
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Those who break the law will be exiled to the border.

50
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
They will never be allowed to return to Yunzhou.

51
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Yes.

52
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Under his order,

53
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
more than 300 people will be tortured.

54
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Prince, do you want to stop?

55
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Chu Yi, go and get the people.

56
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Save all the family members who were exiled.

57
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Yes.

58
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Your Highness,

59
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
the food is not to your taste.

60
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Nan Zhi,

61
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
do you know where Prince is?

62
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It turns out that the Princess is not eating

63
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
because she misses Prince.

64
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Such a big thing happened in the mansion last night.

65
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Prince went to the underground palace of the City Hall in the early morning.

66
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
He was so worried about Prince.

67
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
He was so worried about Prince.

68
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
He was so worried about Prince.

69
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
He was so worried about Prince.

70
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
He was so worried about Prince.

71
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Prince went to the underground palace of the City Hall in the early morning.

72
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
He was so worried about Prince.

73
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
He was so worried about Prince.

74
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
He even asked us not to go to Changning.

75
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Rumors spread that Xie Zi Zhou

76
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
adored and respected Xie Zi Yuan.

77
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
But Xie Zi Yuan's attitude

78
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
was very different.

79
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
He could beat the City Leader

80
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
for a girl from the brothel.

81
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
But he was afraid that Xie Zi Zhou

82
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
would be angry with him because of this sudden assassin.

83
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
What kind of feeling

84
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
does this person have for Xie Zi Zhou?

85
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Is it a brotherly love

86
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
or just a show?

87
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
There must be a secret in his body.

88
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Uncle has been waiting here for three hours.

89
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Uncle has been waiting here for three hours.

90
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Are you still not going back to the mansion?

91
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I want to wait a little longer.

92
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I have already taken the confession letter.

93
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
But I am busy today.

94
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I can't get a chance to see you.

95
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I can't get a chance to see you.

96
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
You should go back first.

97
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Today is the fifth day.

98
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I should be meeting my mother.

99
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
If you are not comfortable with me,

100
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I can go by myself.

101
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Uncle, you are joking.

102
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Without my mother's presence,

103
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I'm afraid you can't even enter the door of the City Hall.

104
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I'm afraid you can't even enter the door of the City Hall.

105
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I suggest you leave first.

106
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
After all, there is a new bride

107
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
waiting for you in this mansion.

108
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
After all, there is a new bride waiting for you in this mansion.

109
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Since you can't serve the City Hall,

110
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
it's good to ask for a couple's marriage.

111
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
You are right.

112
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Then I will ask for your help

113
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
to take care of my mother.

114
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
to take care of my mother.

115
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I will.

116
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Your Highness.

117
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It's already this time.

118
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Why hasn't His Highness returned yet?

119
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
But what happened in the City Hall today?

120
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
But what happened in the City Hall today?

121
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Don't worry, Your Highness.

122
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
The servants have reported that His Highness has left the City Hall.

123
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
That's strange.

124
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Then why hasn't he returned yet?

125
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Well...

126
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Just tell me what happened.

127
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
They said that His Highness

128
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
left the City Hall and went to the Seven Phoenix Brothel.

129
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Mother.

130
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
One day,

131
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I will take you away from Xie Zi Zhou

132
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
and this place

133
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
that is not yours.

134
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
and this place that is not yours.

135
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
and this place that is not yours.

136
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
His Highness is really here.

137
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Your Highness, you came just in time.

138
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Come.

139
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Drink with me.

140
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Come.

141
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Your Highness,

142
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
please.

143
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Drink with me.

144
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Why are you so bored?

145
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Did His Highness

146
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
punish you for what happened last night?

147
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I am in a good mood.

148
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Why would I be bored?

149
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Come.

150
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Let me show you

151
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
a treasure.

152
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
This is the four best

153
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
masters of the four great famous zither

154
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
that I have made

155
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
to come here.

156
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
It is said that the sound of the zither is clear.

157
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Because of the sound of the zither,

158
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
it has been left for three days.

159
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
It is said that the sound of the zither,

160
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
has been left for three days.

161
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Your Highness,

162
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
are you going to

163
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
stand here and watch the zither?

164
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Your Highness, are you going to

165
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
stand here and watch the zither?

166
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Why not?

167
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I am sorry for your loss.

168
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Please think twice.

169
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I am sorry for your loss.

170
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I am sorry for your loss.

171
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I am sorry for your loss.

172
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I know a little bit about music.

173
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Why don't you

174
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
play with me?

175
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Thank you,

176
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Your Highness.

177
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
This is the King of Xuanyuan and the Princess Consort?

178
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
How can I watch them

179
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
play the zither?

180
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Let's go and have a look.

181
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
This is...

182
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
The Night Run of the Wen Army?

183
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
That's right.

184
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
This is the Night Run of the Wen Army.

185
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
In the past, the four horses were like a stove

186
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
and one song was for the good of the family.

187
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
There is a story of the Wen Army

188
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
running around the stove and selling wine.

189
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Don't say it.

190
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
It seems that the King and the Princess Consort

191
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
are a perfect match.

192
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Yes.

193
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
They are a perfect match.

194
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
What a good song.

195
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
It's really good.

196
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I didn't know

197
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
the Princess Consort had such a memory.

198
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
This King of Chu

199
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
really is a traitor from the capital.

200
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I didn't know

201
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
the Princess Consort had such a memory.

202
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
What a good song.

203
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I didn't know

204
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
the Princess Consort had such a memory.

205
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I didn't know

206
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
the Princess Consort had such a memory.

207
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Oh no!

208
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Someone is dead!

209
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Sun Jun!

210
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Sun Jun!

211
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
This money

212
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
is enough for your second half of life.

213
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Don't be so arrogant.

214
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
My father is a courtier.

215
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
You didn't even get to sue him.

216
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
My grandson

217
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
was just a merchant

218
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
and a servant.

219
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
But this young man

220
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
took him back to his home.

221
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
He couldn't resist

222
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
and he was caught in a trap.

223
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Oh my god!

224
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
What kind of world is this?

225
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Where is the palace?

226
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Let me tell you.

227
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I am the palace.

228
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Do you understand?

229
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Is that what you want to do?

230
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Tian Wei is Wang Jie's man.

231
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Why should I be involved in this?

232
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I just felt

233
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
that she was pitiful.

234
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
It seems that pitiful people have their own hateful side.

235
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Their Xie family is

236
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
a perfect match.

237
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Let's go.

238
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Let's make her

239
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
look better.

240
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
What about Tian Wei?

241
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
The emperor has committed a crime

242
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
and you are the son of an official.

243
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
How can you be so cruel?

244
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
You are killing people.

245
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
What?

246
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
You want to go home with me?

247
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Fine.

248
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
You still have some dignity.

249
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Then go home with me.

250
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
You made my Zizhu fan dirty.

251
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Do you think you should die?

252
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Who am I?

253
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
It's Prince Xuanping.

254
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
What?

255
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
You are...

256
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
You are drunk and you are going to

257
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
the street to have a party?

258
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
You are the beautiful woman

259
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
that Qifeng House

260
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
is interested in?

261
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
But I like this girl first.

262
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Prince,

263
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
are you trying to take away my love?

264
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Take away your love?

265
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Do you know

266
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
that the person you just met

267
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
is my wife, Xuanping?

268
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
How many heads

269
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
do you have to insult her?

270
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Come on.

271
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Let's kill him.

272
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Prince,

273
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
please spare me.

274
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I was rude.

275
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I offended you.

276
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Please spare me.

277
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
What about them?

278
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Yes.

279
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I was too reckless.

280
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I deserve to die.

281
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I deserve to die.

282
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Just admit your crime.

283
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
If you are guilty, you will be punished.

284
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Do you want to be executed?

285
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Do you want to be executed?

286
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Let's go.

287
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Take care.

288
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Tingwei is my sister's new wife.

289
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Do you know the consequences of being involved in many things?

290
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
You are bullying people

291
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
and killing them.

292
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
You are just saying

293
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
something silly.

294
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I shouldn't have taken the initiative.

295
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Please forgive me.

296
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I helped you today.

297
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
How are you going to repay me?

298
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I will pay you back.

299
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I will pay you back.

300
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I will pay you back.

301
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I will pay you back.

302
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I will pay you back.

303
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I will pay you back.

304
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I will pay you back.

305
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I will pay you back.

306
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I will pay you back.

307
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I will pay you back.

308
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I will pay you back.

309
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I will pay you back.

310
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I will pay you back.

311
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I will pay you back.

312
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I will pay you back.

313
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I will pay you back.

314
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I will pay you back.

315
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I will pay you back.

316
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I will pay you back.

317
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I will pay you back.

318
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I will pay you back.

319
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I will pay you back.

320
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I will pay you back.

321
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I will pay you back.

322
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I will pay you back.

323
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I will pay you back.

324
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I will pay you back.

325
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I will pay you back.

326
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I will pay you back.

327
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I will pay you back.

328
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I will pay you back.

329
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000

00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I will pay you back.

00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I will pay you back.

335
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000

I will pay you back.

338
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I will pay you back.

339
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000

I will pay you back.
