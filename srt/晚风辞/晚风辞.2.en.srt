1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,500
The hands that cannot be let go

2
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,500
After letting go, the sky is swaying

3
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:42,000
Only to let fate that is always unwavering

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,500
The love that has been lost is the most heart-wrenching

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Episode 16

6
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The leader said that some people will kill the assassins.

7
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,500
We can be the main ingredients of the whole Liang City.

8
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,500
Tonight, we will be celebrating the good news.

9
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,500
secluded

10
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,500
Chongqing

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,640
Go.

12
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,520
There are assassins in the mansion tonight.

13
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,800
Search every room.

14
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:45,760
Yes.

15
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,760
Xie Zizhou finally found you.

16
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,160
observer

17
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,940
palace

18
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,900
This guy doesn't look like me.

19
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,140
Who?

20
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,600
Go.

21
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Get him back,

22
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
no matter what.

23
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,200
Yes.

24
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,200
Search.

25
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,840
Don't let him go.

26
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:26,600
Yes.

27
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,000
So fast.

28
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,640
Go.

29
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,000
Your Highness.

30
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,080
Your Highness.

31
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,120
Your Highness.

32
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,200
What's wrong?

33
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,880
The Governor suddenly rushed in.

34
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,920
I was afraid

35
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,600
and disturbed you.

36
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,800
Why is it you again?

37
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,440
Are you using

38
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,000
my sister's anger on you

39
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,000
to make things difficult for me?

40
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:56,760
Your Highness,

41
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,600
there are assassins attacking the city.

42
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,200
I'm here to investigate.

43
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,000
Assassins?

44
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,840
Is my sister in danger?

45
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,840
You're safe.

46
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,280
But the assassins

47
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,040
should still be in the mansion.

48
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,320
You may leave.

49
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,400
I'll be right back.

50
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,360
Your Highness.

51
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,480
There are assassins in the mansion.

52
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,480
Will the Governor

53
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,960
blame you?

54
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,360
The Princess is concerned about my safety.

55
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,240
I'm very relieved.

56
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,280
How about this?

57
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,720
You can go with me

58
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,160
to apologize to my sister.

59
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:34,760
What do you think?

60
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,320
Is my sister safe?

61
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,440
It's okay.

62
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,000
But the assassins are cunning.

63
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,680
They made her run away.

64
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,960
It's all my fault.

65
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,360
You didn't arrange the assassins.

66
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,360
What's your fault?

67
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,240
I shouldn't have invited my sister

68
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,000
to attend the wedding

69
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,560
for my sake.

70
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,840
I deserve to die.

71
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,440
There are many holes

72
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,760
in your guards.

73
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,360
I'm worried about you.

74
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,560
How about this?

75
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,640
Let Qinglin stay.

76
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,720
Qinglin stays.

77
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,360
If anything happens to the mansion,

78
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,960
you can take care of it.

79
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,240
Such a useless thing.

80
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,880
The assassins of the Taishou Mansion

81
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,960
can't be caught.

82
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,040
Even the assassins

83
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,120
who care about my sister's safety

84
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,240
can't be caught.

85
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,120
Your Highness, be careful.

86
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,200
I was talking nonsense.

87
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,000
What my sister gave me

88
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,640
is the best.

89
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,240
I thank the heavens.

90
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,640
It's settled.

91
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,960
Such a big thing happened tonight.

92
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,960
I can't stay here.

93
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,520
I'll take Chuan back to the City Leader's mansion.

94
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,280
Please take back the order

95
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,800
and send others to guard the mansion.

96
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,920
You're disobeying my order.

97
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,240
I dare not.

98
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,160
I'm just worried about your safety.

99
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,000
Qinglin,

100
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,520
you're the one I trust the most.

101
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,800
In this world,

102
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,160
the most difficult thing is the heart.

103
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,000
The most reliable thing is also the heart.

104
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,160
I only believe in you.

105
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,560
Shushan,

106
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,440
you're not a good person.

107
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,680
I won't let you down.

108
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,360
Qinglin, who is he?

109
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,120
I don't know.

110
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,720
Your Highness, you suffered

111
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,280
on the wedding night.

112
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,840
Your Highness, don't mind.

113
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,000
We're all fine.

114
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,280
We're fine now.

115
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,200
We won't know in the future.

116
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,640
Your Highness, go back and rest.

117
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,160
What about you?

118
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,840
After what happened,

119
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,840
I have to write the confession letter.

120
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,040
I'll stay in the study tonight.

121
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,680
Don't blame me.

122
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,440
I've neglected my family.

123
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,800
Please go back to your work.

124
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,040
I'll leave now.

125
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,400
Liu Rujue wants to kill you?

126
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:13,920
He knew you had

127
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,440
a blood-sucking poison in your body.

128
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,640
The wounds on the bones of the dead

129
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,720
are all grown by the bones.

130
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,080
If Siyao succeeds tonight,

131
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,360
it's not Xiezizhou who will die,

132
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,880
but you.

133
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,560
From what I know about Liu Rujue,

134
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,040
he didn't make the order tonight.

135
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,000
He won't do harm to me.

136
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,120
There must be a hidden reason.

137
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,000
But...

138
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,680
Just say it.

139
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,320
I'm stupid.

140
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,520
As the prince,

141
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,760
I don't know the graces of Liu Rujue.

142
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,080
It's easy to expose Siyao

143
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,280
if you keep her by your side.

144
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,680
What's your purpose in marrying her?

145
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,160
We all know

146
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,600
the power of the Purple Bone.

147
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,640
It's the only time in the past ten years.

148
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,880
The Purple Bone can be stopped

149
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,120
when it's out of control.

150
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,600
So this female killer

151
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,000
is not just a wandering girl.

152
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:54,080
Xie

153
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,720
You're injured.

154
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,640
Seeing me alive

155
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,840
alone, you must be very disappointed.

156
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,760
You are very smart.

157
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,760
You guessed it right.

158
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,760
The Chief of the Dai Ge House often says that

159
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,760
if you enter the Wu Ming Hall,

160
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,760
you are not allowed to betray.

161
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,760
But why did you deliberately betray me

162
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,760
in the test?

163
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,760
You sent a letter to the Prince of Xuanyuan's Mansion.

164
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,760
What does this mean?

165
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,760
As a killer,

166
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,760
only when you are betrayed

167
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,760
and isolated,

168
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,760
you can leave the place.

169
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,760
That's when you are out.

170
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,760
The Wu Ming Hall

171
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,760
does not allow betrayal.

172
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,760
But it does not guarantee that there will be no betrayal.

173
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,760
Your peers

174
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,760
may also be betrayed.

175
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,760
This is the last moment before you die.

176
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,760
Of course,

177
