1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,300
Unable to let go of your hand, let go and let go of the sky

2
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:41,800
As long as fate is so far away, it can't be continued

3
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:48,800
The love that has been lost is the most beautiful

4
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Episode 16

5
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
You are injured?

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Yes

7
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Although it's not a big deal to be injured to save the Princess

8
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
But being injured and being disliked

9
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
It really makes me feel sad

10
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
If you are sad

11
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Then soak yourself in the hot spring more

12
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It's warm

13
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The Prince has been in the prince's palace for many years

14
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
He is so elegant and honest

15
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
He doesn't look like a man

16
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
The practice of taking off clothes in the water

17
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
You must have been with the beauty

18
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
The Princess is wronged me

19
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
This hot spring is of a special nature

20
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Other members of the palace are injured

21
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
They will also come to borrow

22
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
But being with the beauty

23
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It's never been a mistake

24
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
The Princess is wronged

25
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
The Prince is wronged

26
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
The Princess is wronged

27
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
But it's never been a mistake

28
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Then, did the Chief Dai come?

29
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Just go as you say

30
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Is the Princess so grateful to her savior?

31
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I have this attitude towards the liar

32
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
If you want to say a lie

33
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I and the Princess are each other

34
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Then we have nothing to say

35
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Are you not even pretending now?

36
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I still like you

37
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You were gentle and considerate

38
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
That's a pity

39
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I'm afraid the Prince won't see it in the future

40
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
The Prince is honored

41
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'm a liar

42
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I don't deserve to be with you

43
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You'd better find a place to sleep tonight

44
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Don't destroy the room

45
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
This courage

46
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Much more than I imagined

47
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Madam

48
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Madam

49
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Prince

50
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
He is so disrespectful to you

51
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Why are you still trying to coax him?

52
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Because he has a secret

53
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
He is strong

54
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
He is not tough

55
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
If he is tough

56
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I'm afraid he can't get anything

57
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
So now

58
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I can only coax him

59
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
That's too much

60
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Compared to life

61
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Not worth mentioning

62
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Princess

63
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
These are all sent by the Prince

64
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Throw it away

65
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
What a pity

66
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
These are all

67
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I carefully selected one by one

68
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
The Princess doesn't have one of her favorite

69
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Are you angry?

70
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I'm afraid the Prince is annoyed

71
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
With my unreasonable behavior

72
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I'm thinking

73
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Why don't you send a gentle

74
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
And obedient guy?

75
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
You are thinking too much

76
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Since I married you

77
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
You are the only one I can trust

78
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
There is no one else

79
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
For the sake of my sincerity

80
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Don't be angry with me

81
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Don't forget

82
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
We are going to walk together

83
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Can you tell me

84
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Why do you help Wu Mingge

85
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
To fight against your sister

86
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
And why do you stop me when I hit you?

87
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
What are the two contradictions?

88
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
The answer to two questions

89
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Only one

90
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Because I want to live

91
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
OK

92
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Mother

93
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I have a report

94
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Uncle and that woman

95
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Have a fight

96
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
They have been sleeping separately

97
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
But Uncle is very diligent

98
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Everyday he thinks of a way

99
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
To make her happy

100
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Chuan'er

101
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
He and this Princess

102
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Are very close

103
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Chuan'er

104
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
What do you think of her relationship

105
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
With the new Princess?

106
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Mother

107
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
According to my speculation

108
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
That woman has a little affection for Uncle

109
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Uncle also seems to be sincere to her

110
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Maybe

111
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
She can be

112
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
In addition to Mrs. Jin

113
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Our new enemy

114
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I didn't expect you are still too young

115
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Can't see the love of a man and a woman

116
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I'm stupid

117
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Please, Mother

118
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Your uncle is making a fool of himself

119
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
When did you see him

120
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
So in love with a woman?

121
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
He acted too seriously

122
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
And too anxious

123
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
He said he loves Siyang

124
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
He said he would marry her even if he was against me

125
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
But think about it carefully

126
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
The consequences of angering me

127
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
How could he not know

128
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I don't kill him

129
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Doesn't mean I don't kill Siyang

130
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
If a man really loves a woman

131
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
How can he be the place of importance

132
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
And be in danger

133
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
So his love with this new Princess

134
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
How much is real

135
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
And waiting to be tested

136
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
You are wise

137
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Don't worry

138
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
It's ok

139
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I will teach you slowly

140
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I will be the next master of Yunzhou

141
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
But the most important thing now

142
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Is to let Qinglin keep an eye on the royal house

143
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I will find the clue of the assassin

144
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I will make this Wu Mingge

145
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Very quiet

146
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Madam Jin

147
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Ten years of future

148
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
You are so considerate

149
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Really admirable

150
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
A few days ago

151
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Your son should come to visit you

152
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
But he didn't come

153
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Don't you want to know why

154
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
As long as my wish is granted

155
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I will come to visit you

156
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I will be with you

157
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I will be with you

158
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
It doesn't matter if he is well or not

159
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
He is my only brother

160
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Of course I want him to be well

161
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
This

162
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
He got married a few days ago

163
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I attended the wedding in person

164
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Don't you want to know

165
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Which daughter he chose

166
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
He has his own choice

167
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I don't need to ask

168
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Yes

169
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
He rejected the marriage of the high-ranking family he chose

170
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
But he chose a woman who is capable of being a man

171
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
If the late king knew

172
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Would he be very angry

173
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Father

174
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Father

175
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I heard from the doctor that you coughed blood again

176
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
How do you feel now

177
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Si Zhou is here

178
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I am unfilial

179
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I haven't found the prescription you prescribed

180
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
If there is a way

181
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I will let you know

182
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I will let you know

183
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I will let you know

184
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
But my body is healthy

185
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Would you like to try

186
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I will not give up

187
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Good

188
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Good child

189
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Sit down

190
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
You must be tired from running here

191
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Come

192
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Drink this cup of tea

193
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Let's talk about the rest later

194
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Just take care of your filial piety to me

195
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
When I get better

196
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I will treat you well

197
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
What did you give me

198
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
No

199
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Poison

200
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Poison

201
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
This is a poisonless bone

202
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
It can only be used in blood

203
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
What you just took is a purple bone

204
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
When I take this mushroom

205
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Your life is connected to me

206
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
You can bear the pain of illness for me

207
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Pain of illness

208
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Poison of blood

209
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Why are you doing this to me

210
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Isn't this what you want to see

211
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Didn't you just say

212
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Never die

213
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Now it's time for you to serve your father

214
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Xian Ziyuan is also your child

215
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
You are a daughter

216
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Sooner or later, you will marry someone else

217
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
But this is different

218
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
She is the hope of my future

219
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,000
How can it be done by this ancient insect

220
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I will kill you

221
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I will kill you

222
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I will kill you

223
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I will kill you

224
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I will kill you

225
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I will kill you

226
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I will kill you

227
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I will kill you

228
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I will kill you

229
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I will kill you

230
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I will kill you

231
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I will kill you

232
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I will kill you

233
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I will kill you

234
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I will kill you

235
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I will kill you

236
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I will kill you

237
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I will kill you

238
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I will kill you

239
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I will kill you

240
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I will kill you

241
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I will kill you

242
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I will kill you

243
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I will kill you

244
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I will kill you

245
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I will kill you

246
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I will kill you

247
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I will kill you

248
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I will kill you

249
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I will kill you

250
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I will kill you

251
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I will kill you

252
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I will kill you

00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I will kill you

254
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I will kill you

255
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I will kill you

256
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I will kill you

257
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I will kill you

258
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I will kill you

259
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I will kill you

00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I will kill you

261
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I will kill you

262
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
You are in the wild world

263
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
No longer care about anyone

264
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Perhaps it is a kind of

265
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:20,340
No

266
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
No

267
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
No

268
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
No

269
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
No

270
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
No

271
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
No

272
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
