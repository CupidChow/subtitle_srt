1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Episode 16

2
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,440
Look at the chest.

3
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,520
The ancient insect has started to eat the heart vein.

4
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,000
If we don't do something about it,

5
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,320
I'm afraid

6
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,520
it will be more dangerous.

7
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,480
Reversal?

8
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,560
How could it be?

9
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:23,920
Before,

10
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,640
I fell into the fire.

11
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,360
Let's get better.

12
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,500
We can start to

13
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,000
collect the primordial fruit

14
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,160
if they stay in this temple.

15
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,640
God is so stupid.

16
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,560
Is it wrong to choose another life for survival?

17
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,800
It's a different life.

18
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,680
Whatever you're struggling for now,

19
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,400
it's all for nothing.

20
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Why?

21
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,640
Do you think

22
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,040
why he tried to approach you?

23
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:27,400
Why did he choose you as his wife?

24
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,000
Is it because he likes you?

25
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,240
Stupid.

26
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,200
Of course it's because your heart

27
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,200
can cure his bone poison.

28
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,320
All of this

29
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,920
is our game for you.

30
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,960
You don't know yet,

31
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,240
the man in front of you

32
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,280
is the real master of Wuming Pavilion.

33
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,400
Wu Feng.

34
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,440
Xie Zi Yuan.

35
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,800
If you want to live,

36
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,080
you must die.

37
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,480
Voracious והn

38
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,960
Dashes, long sleeves and short sleeves.

39
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,440
Dad, you should take it off.

40
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,760
How can you wear it?

41
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,840
It's Cheryl.

42
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:39,840
My daughter made it

43
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,120
for me for the first time.

44
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,240
She didn't even change anything.

45
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,600
Shi An.

46
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,040
Have an YJ.

47
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,360
I bought it from the mountains.

48
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,000
I want to try the sweet and sour for you.

49
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,640
Hurry up and try it.

50
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,440
How is it? Is it sweet?

51
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,760
Tian Dong?

52
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,160
It really is Tian Dong.

53
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,080
It's been a long time since it was born.

54
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,760
I must take it back today.

55
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,440
Oh no!

56
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,600
Turn out

57
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,520
I'm a pupa.

58
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,200
We've found out

59
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,160
that the man beside Mu Wan

60
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,480
is Prince Xuanping, Xie Ci Yuan.

61
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,680
But the strange thing is

62
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,520
according to the news from Ping City,

63
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,240
Xie Ci Yuan was imprisoned in the mansion

64
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,640
because of the illness of the Sky Flower.

65
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,520
Why did he appear in the city?

66
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:41,960
Prince?

67
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,920
How could Xiao An be involved

68
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,880
with the court officials?

69
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,000
There's something more strange.

70
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,320
I sent someone to find out

71
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,640
where Mu Wan was when she disappeared.

72
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,680
That place was actually related to the Wu Ming Pavilion.

73
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,640
It's not related.

74
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,560
You mean

75
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,280
Xiao Wan has been in the killer group

76
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,400
for these days?

77
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,080
It's possible.

78
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,640
After all, she can't remember anything.

79
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,040
It's really strange.

80
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,040
Since Xiao Wan has become a killer,

81
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,800
how could she be involved with the mansion?

82
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,840
I'm afraid her fate is not that simple.

83
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,480
The most important thing now

84
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,280
is to take her back to the Flower Valley.

85
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,800
If it's the mansion of Prince Xuanping

86
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,800
or the Wu Ming Pavilion,

87
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,800
it's very dangerous for her.

88
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,600
Master, bad news.

89
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,600
Young Master is in trouble.

90
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,720
How dare you hurt her?

91
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,240
Let Master take the blood.

92
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,240
Okay, I'll try to save her.

93
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,480
You can't be poor.

94
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,080
Trying to hurt her,

95
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,000
I'll get her out.

96
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,680
You borrowed the Heart understood this man's actions.

97
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,600
She must die today.

98
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,680
Take the Chief away first.

99
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,200
You've suffered.

100
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,800
I'll get justice for you.

101
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,240
Mu Wan...

102
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,600
How is it?

103
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,680
That bastard.

104
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,840
How dare he

105
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,080
take my blood?

106
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,040
I won't let him off.

107
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,840
I saw it with my own eyes.

108
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,920
Xie Ci Yuan was poisoned with the Purple-Blood Bone.

109
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,440
Mu Wan's blood was the only solution.

110
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,800
I've been eating

111
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,480
Longjie Grass since I was a child.

112
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,640
His blood can cure all kinds of bones.

113
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,880
Xie,

114
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,320
must have been deceived by me

115
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,480
by my memory loss.

116
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,760
He was so confused

117
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,720
that he became a princess.

118
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,960
His purpose was

119
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,800
to find the blood

120
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,480
that was on his body.

121
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,320
This time,

122
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,280
he was so anxious.

123
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,360
It's really bad.

124
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,760
One more thing.

125
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,280
Yesterday, I heard that girl from Wu Ming Pavilion

126
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,440
call her Chief.

127
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,120
You mean

128
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,680
Xie Ci Yuan

129
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,240
is the Chief of Wu Ming Pavilion?

130
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,320
Wu Feng?

131
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,480
No wonder I found out

132
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,600
that Xiao Wan

133
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,640
is the killer of Wu Ming Pavilion.

134
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,200
She went to the same place

135
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,240
with Lord Xuanping.

136
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,360
If Lord Xuanping is Wu Feng,

137
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,320
then everything is clear.

138
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,080
If Xie Zi Zhou knows

139
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,600
that he is a useless brother,

140
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,440
he is so scheming.

141
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,760
I wonder what he will do.

142
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,840
I will make him

143
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:20,440
know the true face of this chief.

144
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,520
Yes.

145
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,240
Well,

146
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,000
you keep an eye on Xiao Wan.

147
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,480
I'll go make the medicine.

148
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,040
I'll be in the next room.

149
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,000
If anything goes wrong with Xiao Wan,

150
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,520
report to me immediately.

151
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:33,840
Yes.

152
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,480
You're fine.

153
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,040
Don't worry.

154
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,520
When you come back to me,

155
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,600
I won't let you get hurt again.

156
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,040
You really want to leave with him?

157
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,680
Why can't I leave?

158
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,480
Because your bones haven't been removed.

159
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,320
What?

160
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:14,840
I was right?

161
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,680
You're asking me?

162
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,440
I'm not.

163
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,040
I'm not.

164
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:17,640
I'm not.

165
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,160
I'm not.

166
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:18,840
I'm not.

167
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,440
I'm not.

168
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,040
I'm not.

169
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,000
Let me explain.

170
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,600
Explain what?

171
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,280
You came to me

172
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,360
not for the result.

173
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,000
You wanted me to stay

174
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,240
because you really love me.

175
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,360
If I say...

176
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,840
Stop telling these ridiculous lies.

177
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,400
If one day,

178
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,760
you want to take my blood

179
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,960
and my life for the result,

180
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,520
do you want me to believe

181
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,640
you have your reasons?

182
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,200
Xie Zi Yuan,

183
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,640
we were wrong at the beginning.

184
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,000
Let me go.

185
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:48,960
Impossible.

186
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:50,920
Let me go.

187
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:51,680
Don't touch me.

You're my wife.

189
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,000
Why can't I touch you?

190
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,920
Zi Yao, don't forget.

191
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,360
You're my wife,

192
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,640
the Princess Consort of Xuanping.

193
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:01,960
You're crazy.

I'm Fang Mu Wu.

196
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,160
I'm not from the Wu Ming Pavilion.

197
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,240
I belong to the Flower Valley.

198
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,440
You're wrong.

199
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,040
You belong to me from the beginning.

200
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,040

201
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,760

208
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,920
Let her go.

209
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,000
