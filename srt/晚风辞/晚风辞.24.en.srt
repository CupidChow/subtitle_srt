1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,500
Un OFFICIAL

2
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,300
After coconalt ice

3
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:39,760
You know

4
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:42,860
코

5
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:43,860
made

6
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:45,760
no

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Episode 16

8
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,800
Are you okay?

9
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm sorry.

10
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,320
I'm late.

11
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:11,880
Let's go.

12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,640
Shen An.

13
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,680
Shen An.

14
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,360
Shen An.

15
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:37,720
Shen An.

16
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,480
Hang in there.

17
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,760
My father will save you.

18
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,080
Don't cry.

19
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,680
Shen An.

20
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,640
You promised me

21
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,680
you would always be with me.

22
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,360
You can't break your promise.

23
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,160
Don't kill me.

24
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,200
Live well.

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,880
I'm fine.

26
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:14,960
Shen An.

27
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,240
Shen An.

28
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,960
Wake up.

29
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,600
Shen An.

30
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,320
Shen An.

31
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,000
Shen An.

32
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,800
Shen An.

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Shen An.

34
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,280
Give up.

35
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,600
I'll get rid of Wu Ming Ge today.

36
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,240
Yun Zhou.

37
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,240
Yun Zhou of Jiang Shi Palace alone.

38
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,040
My good daughter.

39
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,200
The world of Yun Zhou

40
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,800
will be yours in the future.

41
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,280
Thank you, father.

42
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,000
Be good.

43
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,720
Ridiculous.

44
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,800
How can a woman be the City Leader?

45
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,960
For thousands of years,

46
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,560
there has been no such rule.

47
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,560
She's right.

48
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,360
How can she be the City Leader?

49
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,400
I learned the art of the emperor

50
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,360
and studied the Sun Tzu's Art of War.

51
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,160
My ability

52
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:52,080
is far superior to Xie Zi Yuan, who is just ten years old.

53
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,000
So what?

54
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,560
The world

55
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,720
is still my world.

56
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,400
If you don't agree,

57
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,800
go with the old City Leader.

58
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,760
Greetings, City Leader.

59
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,640
Father, look.

60
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,680
The daughter you don't want to give

61
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
has taken it by herself.

62
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,080
I...

63
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,160
I have no time.

64
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,480
Si Yao.

65
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,400
Si Yao.

66
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:44,880
Si Yao.

67
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,160
Xiao Wan.

68
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,800
Although your body is still weak,

69
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,880
if you want to go back to Flower Valley,

70
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,440
we can leave the city tomorrow.

71
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,120
Leave the city tomorrow?

72
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,160
Okay.

73
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,640
I'll wait for you outside.

74
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,760
Why are you leaving?

75
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,720
There is no obstacle between us.

76
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,800
Xie Zi Yuan.

77
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,200
I'm sorry.

78
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,040
I can't

79
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,360
walk with you in peace.

80
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,800
Why?

81
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,800
If you want to,

82
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,400
you are the most noble woman in Yunzhou.

83
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,280
No matter if you are Si Yao or Xiao Wan,

84
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,120
let's start over, okay?

85
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,440
I'm sorry.

86
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,520
I'm sorry.

87
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,600
I'm sorry.

88
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,720
I'm sorry.

89
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,560
Xiao Wan.

90
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,360
There are so many innocent people

91
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,440
who sacrificed themselves between us.

92
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,960
They all died because of us.

93
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,560
It's all in the past.

94
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,920
Shouldn't the living

95
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,360
deserve to live?

96
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,320
And it's not our fault

97
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,000
for what happened today.

98
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,160
It's not our fault.

99
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,680
You did it for Yunzhou

100
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,200
and the people.

101
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,400
You must go to that position.

102
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,720
And I...

103
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Who is this woman?

104
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,680
She makes me feel ashamed.

105
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,880
My 105th child is Sui這樣

106
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,640
in training at classicallas' mediation center.

107
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,200
traveler.

108
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,040
Look.

109
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,320
She wants to see you.

110
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,400
I don't know

111
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,680
that she knew?

112
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,440
I'm not saying I was wrong.

113
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,240
You are.

114
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:22,760
All right.

115
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,480
I want to be covered by sorrow

116
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,440
Philanthropyuly

117
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,600
Be careful

118
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:32,640
Madam

119
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,240
The heart xiangqi ...

120
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,640
Xinghuai

121
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,080
Is it fun? Madam

122
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:27,760
We've been through a lot together.

123
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:31,760
Without the choice to be alone in the past,

124
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,760
I said love needs a little bit of solitude.

125
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:38,760
But it's always a sudden concern.

126
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:43,760
I look back in my memory.

127
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,760
But I can never go back to the past.

128
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:50,760
I want to be with you forever.

129
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,760
Forever.

130
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:25,760
I believe that all this will end.

131
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,760
I believe that you will believe it too.

132
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:34,760
Now it's been a long time.

133
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,760
In the future, if you don't work as a killer,

134
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,760
you can open a clothing store.

135
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,760
I'll take care of your household.

136
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,760
You're talking nonsense again.

137
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,760
You still don't understand me.

138
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,760
Although I don't like to talk,

139
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,760
I still have weaknesses.

140
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,760
For example, now,

141
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,760
I can try the plum blossom.

142
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,760
I will definitely listen to the rules.

143
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,760
You've been to heaven and earth,

144
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,760
and seen all kinds of gods and people.

145
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,760
You're the princess of the Xuanping.

146
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,760
Who told you it was fake?

147
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,760
We'll end it here.

148
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,760
I'll be the princess.

149
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,760
Let's end it here.

150
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,760
Okay?

151
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:50,760
You've been taking care of me and pampering me since I was young.

152
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,760
Don't worry.

153
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:57,760
Now, I can also take charge.

154
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:03,760
I will take care of the Flower Valley and my father.

155
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:20,760
I'll take care of the Flower Valley and my father.

156
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:24,760
I'll take care of the Flower Valley and my father.

157
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:28,760
I'll take care of the Flower Valley and my father.

158
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:32,760
I'll take care of the Flower Valley and my father.

159
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:36,760
I'll take care of the Flower Valley and my father.

160
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:40,760
I'll take care of the Flower Valley and my father.

161
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:44,760
I'll take care of the Flower Valley and my father.

162
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,760
I'll take care of the Flower Valley and my father.

163
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,760
I'll take care of the Flower Valley and my father.

164
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,760
I'll take care of the Flower Valley and my father.

165
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,760
I'll take care of the Flower Valley and my father.

166
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,760
I'll take care of the Flower Valley and my father.

167
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,760
I'll take care of the Flower Valley and my father.

168
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,760
I'll take care of the Flower Valley and my father.

169
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,760
I'll take care of the Flower Valley and my father.

170
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,760
I'll take care of the Flower Valley and my father.

171
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,760
I'll take care of the Flower Valley and my father.

172
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,760
I'll take care of the Flower Valley and my father.

173
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,760
I'll take care of the Flower Valley and my father.

174
