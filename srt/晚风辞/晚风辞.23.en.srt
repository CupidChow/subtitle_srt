1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,480
Unreleased hands

2
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,280
Let go of the red sky

3
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,720
As long as fate can never be continued

4
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:48,800
Losing love is the most bitter

5
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:03,040
Episode 16

6
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,040
Impossible.

7
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,040
Didn't he say that the time has not come yet and he wouldn't act rashly?

8
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,040
How could he be ambushed by Xie Sizhou?

9
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,040
Where is he now?

10
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,040
I don't know the exact situation of the City Hall.

11
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,040
Are you willing to come with me to investigate the situation?

12
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,040
Let's go.

13
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,040
I've taught you long ago.

14
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:30,080
No one can believe you.

15
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,080
Where is Mu Wan?

16
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,080
Chu Yin!

17
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,080
Your Highness.

18
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,080
Where is Siyou?

19
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:59,120
The Chief of the Pavilion came and took away all the guards here.

20
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,120
Ordinary people don't know where the Flower Valley is.

21
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:07,120
It's clear that there's a mole among us if we're ambushed by soldiers.

22
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:12,120
And the one who betrayed us is the woman you've been protecting.

23
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,120
Your Highness.

24
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:18,120
This is your second time putting Mu Wan in danger.

25
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,120
Whether she's safe or not,

26
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,120
I'm going to kill Liu Ruoyue.

27
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,120
I'm going to kill her.

28
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,120
Siyou.

29
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,120
Liu Ruoyue.

30
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,120
You're doing this for Xie Sizhou.

31
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,120
So what if I'm doing this?

32
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,120
You'll do the same for me.

33
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,120
I didn't know before

34
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:14,120
that Princess Consort Xuan's blood is so precious.

35
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:17,120
It can be used as a poison-inducing medicine.

36
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,120
No wonder the Purple-Hatred Valley is so precious.

37
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,120
I'm sure it's because of you.

38
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,160
No wonder the Purple-Hatred Valley is so precious.

39
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,160
You really didn't disappoint me.

40
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:35,160
Do you still keep your promise?

41
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,200
I promise.

42
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:56,200
My blood is useless to you.

43
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,200
If you want to make the elixir,

44
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,200
I know someone.

45
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:06,240
Who is it?

46
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:11,240
It's the one who opened the Purple-Hatred Valley for you.

47
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,240
Where is he?

48
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,240
How about I make a deal with the City Leader?

49
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,240
What's your problem?

50
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,240
You can make a deal with me.

51
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,280
He's the young master of the Flower Valley.

52
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,280
Others can't enter his mountain.

53
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,280
Flower Valley?

54
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,280
I met the master a few years ago.

55
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,280
I heard that his poison-inducing technique

56
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:49,280
is really a sight for a eye.

57
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,280
I've sent someone to investigate it.

58
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,280
But no one knows

59
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,280
where his entrance is.

60
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,280
I can catch him for you.

61
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,320
But can you promise

62
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,320
to spare him?

63
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:08,320
You've done a lot of things.

64
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,320
It's not for yourself.

65
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,320
It's for Xie Ziyuan.

66
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,320
For him,

67
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,320
I can do anything.

68
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:26,320
What's so attractive about my good brother

69
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,320
that you can be so infatuated with him?

70
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,320
Fine.

71
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,320
If the horse you said

72
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,320
is really so valuable,

73
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,320
then

74
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,320
I'm in luck.

75
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,320
The fish and tiger are in a fight.

76
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,320
Be careful, you can't save your life.

77
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,320
I remember you said

78
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,320
that you can do anything for Xie Ziyuan.

79
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,320
Then I'll make it.

80
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,320
You...

81
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,320
Don't come over.

82
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,320
What are you doing?

83
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,320
You said it.

84
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,320
No.

85
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,320
You...

86
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,320
Actually,

87
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,320
you look down on me

88
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,320
like those men.

89
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,320
What?

90
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,320
If you want,

91
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,320
I can give you a new life.

92
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,360
You...

93
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,360
Save some energy

94
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,360
and you can live longer.

95
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,360
I'll go.

96
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,360
The blood of the thousand-year dragon grass

97
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,360
is really extraordinary.

98
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,360
City leader, I received the news

99
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,360
that Xie Ziyuan is gathering

100
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,360
the old cloths of Wu Mingge.

101
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,360
You're too arrogant.

102
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,360
Xie Ziyuan's heart is damaged.

103
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,360
You're the end of the strong-willed.

104
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,360
Wu Mingge's vital energy is badly injured.

105
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,360
What does he have to fight with me?

106
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,360
Since they want to die,

107
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,360
I'll help them.

108
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,360
Qinglin,

109
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,360
send a letter to Xie Ziyuan

110
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,360
and tell him that tomorrow afternoon

111
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,360
he will use the Fang Muwan to worship heaven

112
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,360
to tell the spirit of the late City Leader.

113
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,360
Yes.

114
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,400
My good brother,

115
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,400
these ten years of grudges

116
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,400
should be ended.

117
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,400
Go.

118
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,400
My good brother

119
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:11,400
really raised a group of loyal dogs.

120
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,400
I didn't expect

121
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,400
that Commander Lu would help you.

122
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,400
I'm not helping him.

123
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,400
I'm helping

124
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,400
the people under the control of the evil army.

125
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,400
Are you trying to rebel?

126
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,400
You're acting like a tyrant

127
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,400
and treating the people with respect.

128
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,400
This is a good thing.

129
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,400
I'm not a tyrant.

130
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,400
I'm a good person.

131
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,440
I'm treating the people with respect.

132
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,440
The country of Yunzhou

133
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,440
should be changed long ago.

134
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,440
Go.

135
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,440
Go.

136
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,440
Are you okay?

137
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,440
Sorry, I'm late.

138
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,440
Go.

139
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,440
Go.

140
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,440
Go.

141
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,440
Go.

142
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,440
Go.
