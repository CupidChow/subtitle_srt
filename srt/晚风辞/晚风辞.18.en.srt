1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Unable to let go, let go and the sky is swaying

2
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
As long as fate is endless, it can't be continued

3
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The love that has been lost is the most bitter

4
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Episode 16

5
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Your Highness, the city is in a bad shape.

6
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It's hard to get out of it.

7
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Xie Zizhou made a huge mistake and pretended to be you.

8
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
He hung a corpse on the city gate.

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I don't know what he did.

10
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Killing the Marquis Jing.

11
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Once this is done, the officials who were supposed to be in charge of his actions

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
all dare not speak.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
They're afraid that the fire will burn them.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
After all, even his brothers and his accomplices can kill.

15
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The martial arts world is full of ups and downs.

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Wu Feng is going to die.

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
The people of Wu Ming Pavilion will be in chaos.

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
He can then take advantage of the situation and attack the Jin State.

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
What should we do then?

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
We'll wait for a good opportunity to leave the city.

21
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'll go with you.

22
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Where is Young Master?

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
He has been in the back mountain since the afternoon.

24
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
He hasn't returned.

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Maybe it's because the butler sent someone to deliver the osmanthus.

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
He's busy with the inspection.

27
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I won't kill you.

28
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Because your life

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
was saved by my heart's blood.

30
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You don't deserve to die.

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You must live for me.

32
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
But I will never forgive you for what you did.

33
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I will never forgive you for what you did.

34
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I will never forgive you for what you did.

35
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I will never forgive you for what you did.

36
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I will never forgive you for what you did.

37
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
If hating me can make you feel better,

38
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
then I'll hate you.

39
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Jin夷

40
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Especially for four years,

41
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
she couldn't fall asleep.

42
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Our design couldn't be as good as your work.

43
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Considering that she has a parents,

44
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
it's not so bad as herhartJean's work.

45
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
But to be honest,

46
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
that's not the only reason.

47
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,240
The love in the wind

48
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,480
Till death I wait

49
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,400
From now on

50
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,840
No one can change

51
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:48,240
our relation

52
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,440
In the blink of an eye

53
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:56,040
Time and time again

54
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:02,040
Who still remembers the love in the breeze

55
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,040
You can't see the shadow all day today

56
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,840
You are drinking here secretly, right?

57
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:25,640
You are not feeling well

58
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,640
None of your business

59
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,640
I will

60
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,640
I don't want to see you now

61
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,640
Can you walk away and return it to me?

62
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:36,640
Why?

63
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:39,640
Did I make you angry?

64
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:42,140
Because you and I are both killers

65
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,640
The killer who killed Xie Ci Yuan

66
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:46,640
Tell me

67
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,640
Why do you always try to push me away?

68
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:51,640
We used to be different

69
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,140
Why?

70
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:56,140
People

71
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:59,140
Always blindly believe

72
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:02,140
What they think

73
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,640
Just like this moon

74
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,140
I thought I held it in my hand

75
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,140
That is to have it

76
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,640
But the truth is

77
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,640
Nothing

78
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:31,640
Everything is just a lie

79
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,640
All fake

80
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,140
What are you talking about?

81
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,140
Those people are just passers-by

82
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,140
Only I have been by your side

83
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,640
It's all over

84
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:10,140
We are still us

85
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,140
You

86
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:40,740
You

87
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,140
Just now

88
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,640
What do you want to do?

89
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,140
I just

90
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,020
I'm sorry, Your Highness.

91
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,660
I should be punished for my crime.

92
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:50,700
I shouldn't have

93
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:52,740
hurt you.

94
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,300
You really deserve to die.

95
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:58,540
All these years,

96
00:06:58,860 --> 00:06:59,740
you and Xiaowan

97
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,660
haven't taken a step forward.

98
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:04,980
Master.

99
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:07,940
Have you forgotten

100
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:11,020
why you came to Flower Valley?

101
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,220
Xiaowan, let's go home.

102
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,460
Father, there's someone down there.

103
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,300
You were bitten by bamboo leaves?

104
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,020
Leave me alone.

105
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,300
Father, let's take him back.

106
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,940
Otherwise, he'll die.

107
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,140
Why?

108
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,180
Because I want to save him.

109
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:52,100
Okay, I'll do as you say.

110
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,780
Don't worry. I'm here.

111
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,540
You'll be fine.

112
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,220
Mu Wan saved my life

113
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,740
and cured the birthmark on my face.

114
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:06,700
I was hurt

115
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,100
and I was living for Mu Wan.

116
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,140
If he's willing,

117
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,500
I'll live with him.

118
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:16,980
I'll live with him.

119
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,500
I arranged your marriage.

120
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,540
I told you ten years ago

121
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:31,060
that as long as you become the strongest security guard,

122
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,540
you'll be qualified to be Xiaowan's husband

123
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,580
and stay by his side to protect him.

124
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:39,060
But now,

125
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:41,620
you're living a life of misery

126
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:44,820
and you're pretending to be a man named Xie.

127
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:46,820
You're just a man.

128
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,500
You're not worthy of the title.

129
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:50,580
You're wrong.

130
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,700
No one can take care of him

131
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,540
if he's with a dead man.

132
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:01,820
Fine.

133
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,340
I can't interfere

134
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:06,660
with the relationship.

135
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,580
You should work harder.

136
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:11,300
At least, now,

137
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,540
Xiaowan is still with you.

138
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,180
Anyway, you should know

139
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:17,620
that I hope that you two

140
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,740
can be together forever.

141
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:22,060
I also hope that my daughter

142
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,660
can be happy.

143
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,340
I won't let you down.

144
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:36,340
Who's there?

145
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,100
My Lord.

146
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:43,340
My husband died of illness.

147
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:46,020
I'll take him back to his hometown to bury him.

148
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,180
How many days has it been?

149
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,500
My body is almost smelly.

150
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,460
These days,

151
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,900
I've been keeping my mouth shut and not allowed to enter and exit.

152
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,220
I really can't help it.

153
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,860
Please let me go.

154
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,300
If I delay it for a few more days,

155
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:09,020
my husband's body

156
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,820
will really be rotten into a piece of flesh.

157
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,260
You're so bad!

158
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,700
Stop talking. Let's go.

159
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,940
Thank you. Thank you, My Lord.

160
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,340
Thank you.

161
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:42,780
Doctor Qin.

162
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:45,380
How did you make this powder?

163
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:46,940
It stinks.

164
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,260
I almost died in the car.

165
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,220
Guard Chu, you don't know.

166
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,100
If it doesn't taste good enough,

167
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:56,180
we couldn't leave the city last night.

168
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,460
My Lord, we've left the city.

169
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,580
Where are we going next?

170
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:04,780
The people sent out

171
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,460
haven't found the entrance to the Flower Valley yet.

172
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:07,740
We need to keep looking.

173
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,380
We can't leave the city.

174
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:10,780
We can't leave the city.

175
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,060
Do we need to keep looking?

176
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:13,260
There's a small house

177
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:15,460
my mother sent me in Longji Mountain.

178
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,180
It's very secluded.

179
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,340
No one knows about it.

180
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:21,180
We can stay there for now.

181
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,340
As for the Flower Valley,

182
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,860
we don't have to force ourselves.

183
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,460
Let's just focus on our own safety.

184
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:29,580
Yes.

185
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:42,300
Please follow me.

186
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:03,620
Madam.

187
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:06,940
What's wrong with you?

188
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:09,860
I was listed in a accelerator task last night.

189
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:10,780
It doesn't matter.

190
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,260
The Princess Consort is born with a good will.

191
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,460
She looks good in everything.

192
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,660
But how can I go out and meet someone like this?

193
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,100
I have a way.

194
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:43,660
Memories come back like the tide

195
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:47,260
Our story is gone

196
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:50,780
The sweetness of the past is empty

197
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:54,460
Now only the heartache is left

198
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:57,780
Tears blind my eyes

199
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:01,460
Can't see your back

200
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:05,060
This love can't be returned

201
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:09,260
Only left the sadness in the night

202
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:12,860
My heart is like a sand

203
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:16,540
Lost in the wild

204
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:19,460
No longer care for anyone

205
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:23,660
The story is a fog of light

206
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:27,260
The time is like a sand

207
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:30,860
Gradually being buried by the years

208
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:36,860
Who will remember the love in the breeze

209
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:41,260
My heart is like a sand

210
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:44,860
Lost in the wild

211
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:47,860
No longer care for anyone

212
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:52,060
The story is a fog of light

213
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:55,660
The time is like a sand

214
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:59,260
Gradually being buried by the years

215
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:05,460
Who will remember the love in the breeze

216
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:10,260
My heart is like a sand

217
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:14,260
Lost in the wild

218
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:18,260
No longer care for anyone

219
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:22,260
The story is a fog of light

220
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:26,260
The time is like a sand

221
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:30,260
Gradually being buried by the years
