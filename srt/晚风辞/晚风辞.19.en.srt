1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,480
Unreleased hands

2
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,480
After loosening, the sky is wavering

3
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:41,880
As long as fate can never be continued

4
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:48,480
The lost love is the most beautiful

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Episode 16

6
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:17,600
Madam.

7
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,240
What's wrong with you?

8
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,920
I was wronged last night.

9
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,120
Someone scratched my face.

10
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:26,600
Come on.

11
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:27,720
Let me see.

12
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,360
Look.

13
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,440
How ugly it is.

14
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,280
It doesn't matter.

15
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,880
The Princess is born with a good will.

16
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:34,920
It's beautiful no matter what.

17
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,360
But how can I go out to meet someone like this?

18
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:41,680
I have a way.

19
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,000
Is it done?

20
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,400
Almost.

21
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,280
Done.

22
00:01:59,280 --> 00:01:59,840
Come on.

23
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,400
What are you thinking about?

24
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,160
Do you want to see?

25
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:35,760
It's nothing.

26
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:43,280
Druan Shui will not

27
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,440
need your help in this kind of thing.

28
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:58,880
style

29
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,280
Let's get married.

30
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,280
How did you find this place?

31
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,280
This is too secretive.

32
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,280
This is the secret lock

33
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,280
my mother gave me when I was a child.

34
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,280
I've never brought anyone here.

35
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,280
So, no one knows this place.

36
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,280
You're the first one.

37
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,280
Why are you so nice to me?

38
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,280
Because you're different from others.

39
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,280
What's the difference?

40
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,280
Do I have more eyes or less nose?

41
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,280
You're important to me.

42
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,280
That's why you're different.

43
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,280
You're so talkative.

44
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,280
You probably won't forgive me anymore.

45
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,280
But it's okay.

46
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,280
I'm destined to die with Xie Zizhou.

47
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:13,280
I don't care about you.

48
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,280
Master.

49
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,280
Master, please have a look.

50
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,280
This is the immortal life grass.

51
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,280
Although it's not as good as the dragon fruit,

52
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,280
it can also slow down your heart and pulse.

53
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,280
Thank you, Doctor Qin.

54
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,280
You're welcome.

55
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,280
I'll go back and get the medicine for you.

56
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,280
Wait.

57
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,280
Where does this grow?

58
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,280
It grows in the north of Longji Mountain.

59
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,280
It grows near the water source.

60
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,280
That's the man who changed the flower.

61
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,280
The man who changed the flower

62
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,280
has the smell of the immortal life grass.

63
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,280
Could it be that the entrance to the flower

64
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,280
is near the water source?

65
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,280
Master.

66
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,280
Let's get married.

67
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,280
Do you know what you're talking about?

68
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,280
I'm not talking about you.

69
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,280
I'm talking about you.

70
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,280
What are you talking about?

71
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,280
I know it clearly.

72
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,280
I wanted to marry you for ten years.

73
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,280
Now I don't want to wait.

74
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,280
This is what Master means.

75
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,280
You know it's hard to live.

76
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,280
I can't refuse my father's wish.

77
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,280
But you still force me.

78
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,280
Shi'an, you've really changed.

79
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,280
You're the one who changed, Muwan.

80
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,280
Your eyes are looking at me.

81
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,280
But who do you think of in your heart?

82
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,280
What's so good about him

83
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,280
that you care about him so much?

84
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,280
Even if he's dead, you can't let go.

85
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,280
I can't let go.

86
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,280
Then prove it to everyone.

87
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,280
I'm sorry.

88
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,280
I don't want to lose you again.

89
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,280
Don't be angry.

90
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,280
I won't force you again.

91
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,280
As long as you're happy,

92
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,280
you can do anything.

93
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,280
I promise you.

94
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,280
You can do whatever you want.

95
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,280
But don't ruin my future so much.

96
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:30,880
Youogo Design

97
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,280
Since department store?

98
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,280
I only have systems that I know about.

99
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:39,280
If it's rápido,

100
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,280
I can block it out.

101
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,280
Ruozhuangellu,

102
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,280
Ximian,

103
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,320
all the products

104
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,020
and nhius'

105
00:07:52,040 --> 00:08:04,020
For the good roads along the river

106
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:04,700
Yes.

107
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,300
Wait.

108
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,620
Who dares to come to Flower Valley to play tricks?

109
00:08:34,440 --> 00:09:01,980
You

110
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:06,660
May I ask why you trespassed into our Flower Valley?

111
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:10,420
I heard that Senior Fang of Flower Valley is very skilled in medicine.

112
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,420
I came to seek medical help.

113
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,600
Go!

114
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,320
Though my mother's skeleton was removed,

115
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,580
her heart and pulse were seriously injured and are weighing critical.

116
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,100
She must have a hard time trying to survive.

117
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,400
I DCW woman grab a bad opportunity.

118
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,680
Death cannot be customization for my Beauty.

119
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,560
It was just because my mother was assassinated,

120
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,560
But my mother was killed and I haven't avenged her.

121
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,560
I don't dare to risk my life for her.

122
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,560
Please allow me to do so.

123
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:53,560
Young man, today is my daughter's wedding day.

124
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,560
You suddenly broke into the room and ruined the mood of the guests.

125
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,560
How embarrassing!

126
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,560
Xie Ci Yuan,

127
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,560
you are no longer qualified to interfere with her life.

128
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:06,560
The only thing you have to do now

129
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,560
is to live on

130
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,560
and find Xie Ci Zhou to end this grudge.

131
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:15,560
Nothing else is important.

132
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,560
I was reckless.

133
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,560
Please don't blame me.

134
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,560
Fine.

135
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,560
How about this?

136
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,560
After my daughter and son-in-law finish their ceremony,

137
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,560
I will consider it.

138
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,560
After all, it's a wedding day.

139
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,560
We must do good deeds.

140
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,560
First, bow to heaven and earth.

141
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:49,560
Second, bow to the parents.

142
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:03,560
Husband and wife bow to each other.

143
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:08,560
Husband and wife bow to each other.

144
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,560
What are you doing?

145
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,560
Xie Ci Yuan.

146
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,560
Xie Ci Yuan.

147
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,560
Xie Ci Yuan.

148
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,560
Xie Ci Yuan, wake up.

149
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,560
I haven't forgiven you.

150
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,560
You can't die.

151
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,560
Your life is mine.

152
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,560
Wake up.

153
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,560
The host called her Xie Ci Yuan?

154
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,560
Xie Ci Yuan.

155
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,560
Lord Xunping, Xie Ci Yuan.

156
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,560
He died.

157
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:00,560
He was exposed to the public for seven days and seven nights.

158
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,560
And how could he be related to us?

159
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,560
Look at the young master's face.

160
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,560
They seem to...

161
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,560
Father.

162
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,560
Please help him.

163
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,560
Don't be confused.

164
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,560
I beg you.

165
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,560
I beg you.

166
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,560
Father, please help him.

167
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:24,560
If you want him to live,

168
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,560
let him go.

169
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:30,560
Let him go.

170
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,560
Our story is gone.

171
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,560
The past sweetness is empty.

172
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,560
Now only the heartache remains.

173
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,560
Tears blind my eyes.

174
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:15,560
I can't see your face clearly.

175
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,560
This love can't be returned.

176
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,560
Only sorrow remains.

177
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,560
My heart is like a flow of water.

178
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,560
You are in the wild world.

179
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,560
I don't care about anyone.

180
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:37,560
The story is a kind of fog.

181
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:41,560
The promise is like a flash.

182
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:44,560
Time and time again.

183
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:51,560
Who still remembers the love in the breeze?

184
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:55,560
My heart is like a flash.

185
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,560
You are in the wild world.

186
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,560
I don't care about anyone.

187
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:05,560
The story is a kind of fog.

188
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:09,560
The promise is like a flash.

189
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:12,560
Time and time again.

190
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:19,560
Who still remembers the love in the breeze?
