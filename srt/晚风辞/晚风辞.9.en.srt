1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,480
Unreleased hands

2
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,320
Let go of the sky and swim

3
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,680
As long as fate can no longer be kept

4
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:47,960
Losing love is the most painful

5
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,720
Episode 7

6
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,200
Just a dominant king

7
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,440
How dare you break into City House?

8
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,440
Drink.

9
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,200
The Chief is not good at fighting.

10
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,120
Let's go in.

11
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,640
He sure has a good see-through body.

12
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,640
No!

13
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,160
Don't talk back!

14
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,080
Paris!

15
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,480
Stop right there!

16
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,680
Take him down.

17
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,640
We have master andpectograph.

18
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,760
Why?

19
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:04,200
The mud principles?

20
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:06,020
I don't know if it's real him.

21
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,080
He used the emissary

22
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,640
to observe the assassin as he was singing.

23
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,440
Senior Back!

24
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,100
Senior Back!

25
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,280
Senior Back!

26
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,080
Senior Back!

27
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,020
Senior Back!

28
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:21,820
Senior Back!

29
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,240
Senior Back!

30
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:24,640
Senior Back!

31
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,240
haw!

32
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,240
Madam Jin, sorry for the inconvenience.

33
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,640
Wait.

34
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,920
You suspect that I'm hiding assassins.

35
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,360
Madam, you misunderstood.

36
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:37,000
We're just following orders.

37
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,520
After all, we can't catch the assassins.

38
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,840
It's hard to guarantee that

39
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,200
you can live in City Leader's mansion.

40
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:45,880
Let's go.

41
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,240
The Imperial Cemetery

42
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,960
You're the one who touched

43
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,680
the imperial tablet of City Leader Ye.

44
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,200
I...

45
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,440
Who are you?

46
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,840
You're the one who's here today.

47
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,360
You dare not touch the tablet.

48
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,040
I...

49
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,840
If you don't believe me,

50
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,800
just ask him to try.

51
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,520
It's hard to tolerate a father who kills his father to take the throne.

52
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,240
If he dares to touch the tablet,

53
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,560
he'll be punished by heaven.

54
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,680
Are you done?

55
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,640
Get out if you're done.

56
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,320
Let's go.

57
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,000
Let's go.

58
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:01,960
Let's go.

59
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,120
Don't worry.

60
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,400
I'll take you away.

61
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,280
Be careful.

62
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,360
I'll wait for you.

63
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,000
Mother.

64
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,880
Next time you come out,

65
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,560
can you take me to another place?

66
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,280
I heard that the lanterns in Lingzhou are very beautiful.

67
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,120
And the Sailongzhou lanterns in Huaizhou in the north.

68
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,680
I haven't seen them yet.

69
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,520
You have to walk a long way to read the scrolls.

70
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,720
Although I can't stay with you forever,

71
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,680
after you grow up,

72
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,240
you can go wherever you want.

73
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,240
Why can't you stay with me?

74
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,240
Mother, don't worry.

75
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,560
When I grow up,

76
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,640
I'll take you wherever you want.

77
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,280
Good. Good.

78
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,880
A father is a devil.

79
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,000
But he wants to kill himself to get rid of his grudge.

80
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,240
You must think about it.

81
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,800
I'm useless.

82
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,040
I can only help you here.

83
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,600
A bunch of useless people.

84
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,360
They escaped again.

85
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,160
Take them away.

86
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,240
Kill them all.

87
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:22,920
Yes.

88
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:23,960
Please spare us, City Leader.

89
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,120
Please spare us, City Leader.

90
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,440
Please spare us, City Leader.

91
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,240
Please spare us, City Leader.

92
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,600
Please spare us, City Leader.

93
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,240
City Leader.

94
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,080
Why are you back?

95
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,520
I heard that you were attacked.

96
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,000
So I rushed back.

97
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,240
Are you all right?

98
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,480
I've been with that thief for a few weeks.

99
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,920
He's innocent.

100
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,280
He's not guilty compared to you.

101
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,240
These days,

102
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,240
I've asked you to keep an eye on Xie Ci Yuan.

103
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,720
What's the matter?

104
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,480
You're usually in the mansion.

105
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,680
You're almost inseparable from the Princess Consort.

106
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,920
Before I rushed back to City Leader's mansion,

107
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,680
you and the Princess Consort were in bed.

108
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,560
You're too much.

109
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:07,800
City Leader.

110
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,680
I didn't notice anything wrong

111
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,720
in the mansion these days.

112
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,280
Instead of wasting time on me,

113
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,320
why don't you let me go back to you?

114
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,040
You've been attacked by the assassins of the Wu Ming Pavilion twice.

115
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,840
It's obvious that they're not good people.

116
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,520
I...

117
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:22,560
I...

118
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,920
I'm worried that

119
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,440
someone else will take care of your safety.

120
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,720
I'm sorry.

121
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,440
I shouldn't have doubted your decision.

122
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,040
I'll go back to the Xueping Mansion now.

123
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,200
Wait.

124
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,520
I know

125
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,040
that you care about my safety the most.

126
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,600
I won't blame you.

127
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,040
You don't have to go to the Xueping Mansion.

128
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,720
Just keep an eye on her.

129
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,480
Go and inform the Grand Tutor.

130
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,320
Tell him to come to the City Leader's mansion

131
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,120
before it's too late.

132
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:06,960
Yes.

133
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,840
This guy

134
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,440
should be familiar with the City Leader's mansion.

135
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,520
He's good at martial arts.

136
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,080
It shouldn't be a problem if he escapes.

137
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,080
It's okay.

138
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:35,640
But if he falls into the hands of Xie Zi Zhou,

139
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,960
I'm afraid it'll be more dangerous.

140
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:38,720
What's wrong?

141
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,560
How many times have you killed your own husband?

142
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,360
How is it?

143
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,280
Are you hurt?

144
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,680
I know you're worried about me.

145
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,120
So no matter how hard it is,

146
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,280
I'll come back.

147
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,360
You know

148
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,320
it's easy to get out of the City Leader's mansion.

149
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,680
You risked so much for a man who's a Qing Li.

150
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,280
No one knows Xie Zi Zhou better than I do.

151
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,840
As long as he's in danger,

152
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,720
Qing Ling will go to Xie Zi Zhou

153
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,880
and ask him to come back.

154
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,080
Then they'll

155
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,760
not be able to keep an eye on us.

156
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,800
What if you hurt him

157
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,000
and hurt yourself instead?

158
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,840
What's the difference between you and Zi Qiang?

159
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,160
I know what I'm doing.

160
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,280
You know what you're doing?

161
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,560
If I hadn't been worried about you,

162
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,800
you would have been

163
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,200
captured by Xie Zi Zhou.

164
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,640
Okay.

165
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,280
I was not thoughtful enough.

166
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,840
Thank you for saving me.

167
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,960
How should I

168
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,160
repay you?

169
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,280
How about we make a promise?

170
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Who cares?

171
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,640
I don't care.

172
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,720
I think everyone knows

173
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,120
about the assassination last night.

174
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,680
Commandant Li,

175
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,080
you're heavily guarded in the city.

176
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,040
You're protecting the city and protecting the safety.

177
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,320
But you let Wu Ming Ge's assassin

178
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,600
go wild.

179
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,920
Do you have anything to explain to me?

180
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,160
Your Highness,

181
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,040
we destroyed

182
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,040
Wu Ming Ge's several branches last night.

183
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,200
But Wu Feng was too cunning

184
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,320
and he was secretive.

185
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,120
I...

186
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,760
I haven't found his secret yet.

187
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,480
As for last night,

188
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,960
I've ordered Commander Lu to strengthen the guard.

189
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,800
But he was out of duty

190
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,920
and you're in danger.

191
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,040
You shouldn't be soYe

192
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:35,080
м

193
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,000
Why haven't you

194
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,800
left yet?

195
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,080
Commander Lu,

196
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,040
you've beenruit widget

197
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,160
and you have solid evidence in this case.

198
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,520
Eat up and apologise to Master this time.

199
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,040
There you have it.

200
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,200
What do you want for me?

201
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,400
Guards, take him away.

202
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,480
We'll have a trial in three days.

203
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:32,840
It's been a long time.

204
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,120
Thank you, Sir.

205
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,440
Lots of sauce, soft body

206
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,800
would smell of loved one.

207
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:59,440
But here in beautiful Kuihuamaybellum,

208
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,440
I don't feel like it.

209
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,220
If you like it,

210
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,240
I'll plant the garden

211
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,240
with the osmanthus tree for you.

212
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,440
Your Highness.

213
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,120
The goodsman in the east said

214
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,640
the peonies you asked for are out of stock.

215
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,040
He sent you this.

216
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,040
Thank you.

217
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,640
There's one more thing, Your Highness.

218
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,240
News from the City Hall.

219
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,840
Commander Lu was called to the office

220
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,240
and was sentenced to death.

221
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,640
He'll be beheaded in three days.

222
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,640
I'll go with you.

223
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,640
Yes.

224
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,840
The Chief gave the task.

225
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,840
He saved Lu Tong.

226
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,040
We can't let him die.

227
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,440
The sky is dry.

228
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:57,640
Be careful of the fire.

229
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,640
Shi'an, come on.

230
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,640
Have an orange.

231
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,040
I bought some fruits from the mountains.

232
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,440
I want to try the sweet and sour one for you.

233
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,240
Try it.

234
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,240
How is it? Is it sweet?

235
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,040
Yes.

236
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:03,440
Our story is gone.

237
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,240
The sweet past is empty.

238
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:10,840
Now all that's left is the pain in my heart.

239
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:14,240
The tears cover my eyes.

240
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,840
I can't see your back.

241
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:21,440
This love can't be returned.

242
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,640
Only sorrow remains.

243
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:29,240
My heart is like a mountain.

244
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:32,840
You're in the wild world.

245
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,840
I no longer care for anyone.

246
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:40,040
I'm just a piece of paper with no light.

247
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:43,640
Time flies like a flash.

248
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:47,240
Time flies like a flash.

249
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:54,240
Who still remembers the love in the breeze?

250
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,840
My heart is like a sand.

251
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:01,440
You're in the wild world.

252
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,440
I no longer care for anyone.

253
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:08,640
I'm just a piece of paper with no light.

254
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:12,240
Time flies like a flash.

255
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,840
Time flies like a flash.

256
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:22,040
Who still remembers the love in the breeze?
