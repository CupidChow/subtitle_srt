1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,480
I dare not let go of your hand

2
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,320
Let go of the red star and swim in the sky

3
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,680
Only fate can't keep the love that's lost

4
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:48,600
The love that's lost is the most sorrowful

5
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:08,700
City Leader of the Carpening

6
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:13,160
Episode 3

7
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,440
moms

8
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,160
Missed miss

9
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,480
Missed

10
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,380
Missed

11
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,820
Missed

12
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:29,160
Missed

13
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,760
and pull out the tree.

14
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:37,960
Master,

15
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,160
the newbies who came recently

16
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,560
have grown up quickly.

17
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:42,760
Among them,

18
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,360
there are some who are not good at it.

19
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,560
Find someone who is more clever

20
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,560
and send him to the Xueping Palace.

21
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,560
Master, didn't you say

22
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,360
that the Wu Ming Hall and the court

23
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,960
want the water of the well to be free of the river?

24
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,560
Now it's like this.

25
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,360
Isn't it inappropriate?

26
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,560
Are you questioning my order?

27
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,560
I dare not.

28
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,560
I'll do it now.

29
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:08,960
How about the female killer

30
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,360
who used the gooseberry to stab?

31
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,760
You mean Si Yao?

32
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,760
But she is still young

33
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,760
and may not be able to take the responsibility.

34
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,360
It's because she is a living person

35
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,760
that she is easier to deal with.

36
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:28,760
But...

37
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,560
Since I saved you back then,

38
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,960
you have been able to take the responsibility

39
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,160
in less than five years.

40
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,760
How do you know

41
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,560
that she can't do it?

42
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:40,960
Yes.

43
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,560
I'll do as you say.

44
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,560
Baby!

45
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,760
You really are...

46
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,360
Well done!

47
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,560
Well done!

48
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,700
Oh!

49
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,000
Well done!

50
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,560
So you really wanted to kill me.

51
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,260
Will you desert me?

52
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,140
Qin Stein Olá.

53
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,120
Qin blueberry.

54
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,800
Are you a servant now?

55
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,720
Bring new followers to find me.

56
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,720
I've arranged a new identity for you.

57
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,720
From this moment on,

58
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:22,620
you are the new flower

59
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,720
and the best chess piece.

60
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,720
You want to kill Xie Cizhou

61
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,720
and help Lord Xuanping

62
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,720
become a puppet?

63
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,720
If I can have such a chance,

64
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,720
it would be the best.

65
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,720
I understand.

66
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,720
Lord Xuanping is here.

67
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,720
I'll go.

68
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,720
Yuan,

69
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,720
I asked you to choose a concubine.

70
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,720
What do you mean?

71
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,720
I fell in love with Siyao at first sight.

72
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,720
I decided to marry her.

73
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,720
But I knew that you loved me.

74
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,720
So I asked you to order

75
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,720
to take all the family members

76
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,720
and Siyao into your house.

77
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,720
This...

78
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,720
Father.

79
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,720
You know it well.

80
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,720
You must not do this.

81
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,720
Don't you say that you are always

82
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,720
dreaming and making people gossip.

83
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,720
All of us are from a noble family.

84
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,720
How can a noble woman

85
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,720
share the same idea with a lowly woman?

86
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,720
If you say it,

87
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,720
people will laugh at you.

88
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,720
You will be humiliated.

89
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,720
You know that I am a man of the heart.

90
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,720
You don't look down on me.

91
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,720
Why do you make a fuss?

92
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,720
Besides,

93
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,720
my sister is the most powerful woman in the world.

94
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,720
Who is not afraid of death?

95
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,720
How dare you talk nonsense?

96
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,720
You...

97
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,720
Forget it.

98
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,720
You can leave.

99
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,720
Kneel.

100
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,720
It's all my fault.

101
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,720
Please don't be angry with me.

102
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,720
You don't have the right to talk.

103
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,720
Xie Ci Yuan,

104
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,720
do you know your fault?

105
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,720
I know my fault.

106
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,720
But it's hard to blame myself.

107
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,720
Although Siyao is from a noble family,

108
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,720
she is in love with me.

109
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,720
I am willing to be with her forever.

110
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,720
I will never forget it.

111
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,720
I will never forget it.

112
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,720
I will be with her forever.

113
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,720
Please allow me.

114
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,720
Nonsense.

115
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,720
How can a woman from the brothel

116
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,720
marry into our family?

117
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,720
I am willing to ask you to grant me a marriage.

118
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,720
Then Siyao will no longer be a lowly woman.

119
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,720
If you attend the wedding yourself,

120
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,720
who dares to forget it?

121
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,720
You are my only brother.

122
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,720
I won't kill you.

123
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,720
But you are my best friend.

124
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,720
You have challenged me many times.

125
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,720
Do you really think

126
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,720
I dare not kill you?

127
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,720
It's my fault.

128
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,720
I will kill you.

129
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,720
I will let you punish me.

130
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,720
Please forgive me.

131
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,720
I just want to work with Siyao

132
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,720
and ask for your permission.

133
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,720
Take your woman

134
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,720
and go back to your mansion.

135
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,720
You can think about it.

136
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,720
Without my permission,

137
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,720
no one is allowed to step out of the mansion.

138
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,720
Sister.

139
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,720
You don't understand

140
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,720
what I said, do you?

141
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,720
Yes.

142
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,720
I am sorry.

143
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,720
I am sorry.

144
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,720
I am sorry.

145
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,720
I am sorry.

146
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,720
I am sorry.

147
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,720
I am sorry.

148
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,720
I am sorry.

149
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,720
I am sorry.

150
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,720
I am sorry.

151
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,720
I am sorry.

152
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,720
I am sorry.

153
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,720
I am sorry.

154
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,720
I am sorry.

155
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,720
I am sorry.

156
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,720
I am sorry.

157
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,720
I am sorry.

158
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,720
I am sorry.

159
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,720
I am sorry.

160
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,720
I am sorry.

161
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,720
I am sorry.

162
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,720
I am sorry.

163
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,720
I am sorry.

164
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,720
I am sorry.

165
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,720
I am sorry.

166
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,720
I am sorry.

167
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,720
I am sorry.

168
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,720
I am sorry.

169
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,720
I am sorry.

170
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,720
I am sorry.

171
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:11,720
The bridegroom and the bridegroom, bow to heaven and earth.

172
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,280
To daughter off all the goodços!

173
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,160
Uphold the bounties!

174
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,540
Memoir the istedi thro

175
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,300
and not to forget to gib our spirits and persist with our dreams.

176
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,720
Bow to each other.

177
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,720
Bow to each other.

178
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,720
Bow to each other.

179
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,720
Enter the bridal chamber.

180
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,720
The smell of incense is quite unique.

181
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,720
It's just the smell of ordinary people.

182
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,720
I don't mind if you do.

183
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,720
Your Highness is so emotional.

184
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,720
How could I dislike it?

185
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,720
Your Highness.

186
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,720
The smell of the rouge

187
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,720
makes me miss Tian Qi Fen even more.

188
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:07,720
The memory is like a snowfall.

189
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:11,720
Our story is gone.

190
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,720
The past sweetness has become empty.

191
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,720
Now all that's left is the pain in my heart.

192
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,720
The tears flood my eyes.

193
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:25,720
I can't see your face clearly.

194
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,720
This part of me can't be returned.

195
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,720
The sadness is spreading.

196
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,720
The memories are like sand.

197
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,720
The past is gone.

198
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,720
I don't care about anyone.

199
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:47,720
The past is gone.

200
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:51,720
The memories are like sand.

201
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,720
The past is gone.

202
00:13:54,720 --> 00:14:00,720
Who still remembers the love in the poem?

203
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:05,720
My heart is like a gorge.

204
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,720
I'm lost in the wild.

205
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,720
I don't care about anyone.

206
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:15,720
Maybe it's just a dream.

207
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:19,720
The past is gone.

208
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:23,720
The past is gone.

209
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:30,720
Who still remembers the love in the poem?

210
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,720
The End
