1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,480
The hands I can't let go

2
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,320
Let go and the sky is clear

3
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,720
As long as fate can never be continued

4
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:48,320
The lost love is the most sorrowful

5
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,480
The Story of Ming Lan

6
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,980
There's actually another helper.

7
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:16,800
Just the取商 of both of you

8
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,880
I shouldn't think of leaving today.

9
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,160
Mmmm.

10
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:34,960
airline

11
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,400
Over there

12
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,020
sufficient

13
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,160
A little bigger

14
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:44,400
See

15
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:57,320
Or

16
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,560
Can pass

17
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,160
Send this batch of goods out first.

18
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,480
Yes.

19
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,960
They probably won't come after us.

20
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,560
Why are you helping me?

21
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,400
Anyway, thank you for tonight.

22
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,840
Can you spare my life?

23
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,280
I will repay you in the future.

24
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,280
You are from the Wu Ming Hall?

25
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,240
Since you are from the Wu Ming Hall,

26
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,200
why didn't you show yourself to the world?

27
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,960
And why did you stop me from

28
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,920
killing Xie Cizhou in the Xueping Mansion that day?

29
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,280
Why didn't you say anything?

30
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,720
Answer my question.

31
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,760
You are the one.

32
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,560
How did you recognize me?

33
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,680
The incense in the room

34
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,960
is the most familiar smell to me.

35
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,840
I saw you twice.

36
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,160
You are the most familiar smell to me.

37
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,360
You are the most familiar smell to me.

38
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,360
You are the most familiar smell to me.

39
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,280
I saw you twice.

40
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,840
You are the most familiar smell to me.

41
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,360
I won't admit my mistake.

42
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,800
I am curious.

43
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,440
You were poisoned.

44
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,640
But you are fine.

45
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,440
I don't know either.

46
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,600
These poisons only work

47
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,400
for a moment on me.

48
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,960
But you should answer my question first.

49
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,600
Why did you, the Prince of Xueping,

50
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,240
become the killer of the Wu Ming Hall?

51
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,800
This question

52
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,040
is the answer to my question.

53
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:09,840
What's wrong with you?

54
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,720
Help me.

55
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,520
What should we do?

56
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,680
What's wrong with you?

57
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,400
I asked Chief Dai.

58
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,040
I didn't know that you trusted me so much.

59
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,120
You thought I could

60
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,320
fight against the entire Shenwu Guards alone.

61
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,520
Chief Dai,

62
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,760
didn't you send me to help you?

63
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,280
Ciyuan is right.

64
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,280
Tonight's mission is important.

65
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,680
I can only send you two to help me.

66
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,440
I can only send you two to help me.

67
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,640
I can only send you two to help me.

68
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,840
I can only send you two to help me.

69
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,840
I can only send you two to help me.

70
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,840
I can only send you two to help me.

71
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,320
I can only send the one I trust to go.

72
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,600
This is the second question

73
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,720
I want to ask Chief Dai.

74
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,000
Why did the Prince of Xueping

75
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,520
suddenly become a member of the Wu Ming Hall?

76
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,600
And you never mentioned this to me.

77
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,360
Ciyuan's identity is special.

78
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,160
I'm not willing to reveal it

79
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,160
unless I have to.

80
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,640
So you mean

81
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,880
I was born and died for the Wu Ming Hall

82
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,320
and I'm an outsider after all?

83
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,280
That's not what I mean.

84
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,000
Because Ciyuan is a very important member

85
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,200
of the Wu Ming Hall,

86
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,120
so his wife

87
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,840
must be one of us.

88
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,120
This is also the reason why Chief

89
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,960
arranged the last mission for you.

90
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,280
What about Xie Cizhou?

91
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,280
You didn't know about this.

92
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,080
That's why you came out to stop us, right?

93
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,520
Xie Cizhou and I have a complicated relationship.

94
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,520
We can't touch her for a while.

95
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,000
But you have to believe

96
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,080
that we are on the same side.

97
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,480
Otherwise,

98
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,560
how could I risk my life to save you?

99
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,960
You can leave now.

100
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,080
I have something to say to Ciyuan.

101
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,080
Yes.

102
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,760
There's a hot spring in the backyard of the mansion.

103
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,080
The healing of spring water is very effective.

104
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,160
You can go back for a while.

105
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,240
It will help you with your injury.

106
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,720
I see.

107
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:45,720
Thank you.

108
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,400
I realize my mistake.

109
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,440
I failed to investigate the mission situation.

110
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:58,920
As usual,

111
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,280
for a mission like this,

112
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,400
only the top-訂閱ed sits

113
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,960
and the top fivenal Secrethave

114
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:07,400
can get the chance of leaving.

115
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,320
can get the chance of leaving.

116
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,720
so you sent admitting Dimension Demon fears his position.

117
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,480
Let me tell you

118
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:12,840
why.

119
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,840
She's not going to die.

120
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,840
She's clearly trying to kill herself.

121
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,000
Tell me why.

122
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,320
Ru Yue,

123
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,360
I remember I told you

124
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,840
that love is a killer's trick.

125
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,800
Ru Yue was confused for a moment.

126
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,800
Si Yao made the decision.

127
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,240
She almost hurt Master.

128
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,960
I just want to teach her a lesson.

129
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,400
I think

130
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,240
she's determined to kill herself.

131
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,360
I'm just being bold.

132
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,240
I want to ask you a question.

133
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,720
You let Si Yao go to the Xuamping Mansion

134
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,120
and risk her life

135
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,960
to save her tonight.

136
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,200
Isn't that also a matter of love?

137
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,040
I'm sorry.

138
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,920
Please forgive me.

139
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,840
She and I are indeed different.

140
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,720
I understand.

141
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,960
Because she can control the insects in my body,

142
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,320
Si Yao must live.

143
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,760
It's my fault.

144
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,800
I won't do it again.

145
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,080
I want you to recall it carefully.

146
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,360
When you find her,

147
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,120
is there any other clue

148
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,240
that can prove her identity?

149
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,200
She has

150
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,720
nothing special

151
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,040
except a beautiful sachet.

152
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,040
This one?

153
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,760
Yes.

154
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,240
Please.

155
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,480
I was kidnapped.

156
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,520
Let me go home.

157
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,520
You're laughing at me.

158
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,360
You're a person

159
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,880
who lives here.

160
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,200
Even if you die,

161
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,520
you must die here.

162
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,320
Do you think you can escape?

163
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,120
No.

164
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,480
I ran.

165
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,740
My life is up to

166
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:12,920
your responsibility.

167
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,360
Do you think

168
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,600
I can solve your problems?

169
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,200
What happened to Still person?

170
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,320
I was about to

171
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,560
die.

172
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,720
Do you regret

173
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,000
Thank you, sir.

174
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,000
By the way,

175
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,680
I heard them say that

176
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,960
there will be a woman here tomorrow.

177
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,600
Please save them.

178
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,240
Okay.

179
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,040
Master.

180
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,560
How is it?

181
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,160
Any news about Xiaowan?

182
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,440
We didn't find Mu Wan.

183
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,240
But I found out

184
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,240
that there will be a woman

185
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,200
taking her to the city.

186
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,040
I want to stay here for a while.

187
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:18,920
Okay.

188
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,600
You stay here.

189
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,520
I'll take someone

190
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,520
to the nearby village

191
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,520
to ask around.

192
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,200
Master.

193
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,120
We can find Mu Wan.

194
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,720
The city is in danger.

195
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,800
We can't go there.

196
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,800
We can't go there.

197
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,800
We can't go there.

198
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,800
We can't go there.

199
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,800
We can't go there.

200
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,800
We can't go there.

201
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,800
We can't go there.

202
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,800
We can't go there.

203
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,800
We can't go there.

204
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,800
We can't go there.

205
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,800
We can't go there.

206
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,800
We can't go there.

207
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,800
We can't go there.

208
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,800
We can't go there.

209
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,800
We can't go there.

210
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,800
We can't go there.

211
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,800
We can't go there.

212
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,800
We can't go there.

213
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,800
We can't go there.

214
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,800
We can't go there.

215
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,800
We can't go there.

216
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,800
We can't go there.

217
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,800
We can't go there.

218
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,800
We can't go there.

219
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,800
We can't go there.

220
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,800
We can't go there.

221
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,800
We can't go there.

222
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,740
Well,

223
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,460
I Lion King

224
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:11,640
the Black Cinnabar Prophecy War

225
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,280
depends on that Miao Yuan to help us.

226
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,520
Why are you here?

227
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,720
I brought you some supper for dinner.

228
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,720
Eat slowly. It's all yours.

229
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,720
It's almost dawn.

230
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,720
You should go back and rest.

231
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,720
If Master finds out,

232
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,720
he will punish you.

233
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,720
Anyway, I have to get up to practice martial arts even if it's dawn.

234
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,720
How about we go and see the sunrise?

235
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,720
Okay.

236
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,720
I haven't seen the sunrise I owe you.

237
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,720
I will find you.

238
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,720
This medicine

239
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,720
is really made by Xie Zi Yuan and the Princess Consort.

240
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,720
It really helps to get into the water.

241
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,720
Even the blood is boiling.

242
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,720
You...

243
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,720
How can you be so shameless?

244
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,720
We are husband and wife.

245
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,720
How can we be shameless?

246
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,720
What else should we talk about?

247
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,720
Besides, last time at the Seven Phoenix Tower,

248
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,720
did I not see anything else?

249
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,720
You are hurt?

250
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,720
Yes.

251
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,720
Although it's not a big deal to get hurt

252
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,720
to save the Princess Consort,

253
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,720
but I am really sad

254
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,720
that I am hurt and disliked.

255
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,720
If you are sad,

256
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,720
then soak yourself in the hot spring

257
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,720
and get warm.

258
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,720
I will go and get some water.

259
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,720
I will go and get some water.

260
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,720
I will go and get some water.

261
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,720
I will go and get some water.

262
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,720
I will go and get some water.

263
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,720
I am sorry.

264
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,720
I am sorry.

265
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,720
I am sorry.

266
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,720

00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,720
I am sorry.

268
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,720
I am sorry.

269
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,720
I am sorry.

270
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,720
I am sorry.

271
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,720
I am sorry.

272
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,720

00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,720
I am sorry.

275
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,720
I am sorry.

276
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,720
I am sorry.

277
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,720
I am sorry.

278
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,720
I am sorry.

279
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,720
I am sorry.

280
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,720
I am sorry.

281
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,720
I am sorry.

282
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,720
I am sorry.

283
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,720
I am sorry.

284
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,720
I am sorry.

285
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,720
I am sorry.

286
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,720
I am sorry.

287
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,720
I am sorry.

288
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,720
I am sorry.

289
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,720

00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,720
I am sorry.

00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,720
I am sorry.

294
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,720
I am sorry.

295
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,720
I am sorry.

296
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,720

299
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,720
