=Episode 10=

3
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:47,720
Bad man.

4
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,400
Annoying man.

5
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,600
Irritating man.

6
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,640
Have some rest.

7
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,960
If you keep running,

8
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,600
you won't even be able to swear.

9
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,160
Doesn't he deserve it?

10
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,040
Paranoid and changeful.

11
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,600
He's just like a woman.

12
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,760
People say a woman's mind
is hard to understand.

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,680
His mind is even harder

14
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,080
to understand.

15
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,080
He deserves it.

16
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,120
But

17
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,600
are you sure you want to divorce him?

18
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,240
That's the man you love the most.

19
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,120
I...

20
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,720
Of course I'm sure.

21
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,560
Alright.

22
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,240
I know you quite well.

23
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,680
You are impulsive.

24
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,640
If you really divorce Sheng Nanfang,

25
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,320
you will hold me

26
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,880
and cry very sadly.

27
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,000
I won't.

28
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,720
What else can I do?

29
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,200
I already said that.

30
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,720
I can't retract it.

31
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,320
You're not retracting it.

32
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,880
You'll be just moved

33
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,720
by his sincere apology

34
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,760
and reluctantly forgive him.

35
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,520
Alright.

36
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,720
I'll give him a chance.

37
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,200
If he behaves well,

38
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,600
maybe I'll change my mind

39
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,640
and be together with him again.

40
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:18,680
Little Moon.

41
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,600
If your mother and I

42
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,040
get divorced one day,

43
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,000
who do you want to live with?

44
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,680
You're getting divorced?

45
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:27,600
No.

46
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,480
I mean, "if".

47
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,440
I won't live with any of you.

48
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,440
Then no one will take care of you.

49
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:33,840
If you get divorced,

50
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,560
I'll go to an orphanage myself.

51
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,040
Little Moon.

52
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,200
Ms. Liu.

53
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,080
Buy another bunch
of lavender and put it in my room.

54
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,320
Ma'am.

55
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,160
Mr. Sheng bought
these flowers especially for you.

56
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,520
Just so-so.

57
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,680
Look at her.

58
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,520
The dish is going to burn.

59
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:17,216
(Let's make peace, just for the kid.)

60
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,560
No.

61
00:03:25,184 --> 00:03:26,880
(Calendar)

62
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,960
He finally comes to make up with me.

63
00:03:56,832 --> 00:03:59,008
(Happy Mother's Day.)

64
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,320
Sheng Nanfang, you're obtuse.

65
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,200
You're dull.

66
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:16,760
What's wrong?

67
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:17,400
You're having a cold?

68
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,520
It's Mom, not me.

69
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,160
She keeps sneezing,

70
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,080
and it seems she feels cold.

71
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:24,960
Sit here.

72
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:38,720
Give it to your mom.

73
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:39,840
Let her drink it before it's cold,

74
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,640
and tell her not to catch a cold.

75
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,920
- You can leave out the last sentence.
- Okay.

76
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,400
Whoops.

77
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,680
The cartoon is about to start.

78
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,360
I'm leaving.

79
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,520
(I'm not divorcing her.
It's for the kid,)

80
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,800
(not because I have feelings for her.)

81
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:08,800
Take the medicine.

82
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,600
I don't have a cold.

83
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,440
Why should I take medicine?

84
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:16,960
Be good.

85
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,080
Why do you care so much about me?

86
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,240
I think we're getting divorced.

87
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,880
In fact,

88
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,360
we don't have to divorce.

89
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,800
After all, Little Moon is still young.

90
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,800
Just for her?

91
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,560
Yeah.

92
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,800
Now I'm the one
who wants to divorce you.

93
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,960
You have no choice.

94
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,480
You marry me when you want

95
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:45,880
and divorce me when you want.

96
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,120
What do you take me for?

97
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,840
