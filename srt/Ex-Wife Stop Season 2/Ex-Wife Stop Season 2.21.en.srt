3
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:50,480
It's less than half.

4
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,360
The resolution is null and void.

5
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:00,840
It's enough now.

6
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,200
Are you crazy?
I didn't raise you this way.

7
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,040
Mom, stop it.

8
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,600
We can't win.

9
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,600
Nonsense.

10
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,520
Even you are talking nonsense.

11
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,840
I can't lose.

12
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,400
The resolution is now in force.

13
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:21,400
Ms. Song.

14
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:22,600
Oh.

15
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:23,640
Song Jiao.

16
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,600
Please leave the company now.

17
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,880
After all, irrelevant people
shouldn't be here.

18
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,200
Take a guess.

19
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,040
What have I got for you?

20
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,480
Cufflinks?

21
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,200
A ring?

22
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,320
That's not true.

23
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,400
Is it you?

24
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,160
Why?

25
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,320
You got a pair

26
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,640
of diamond earrings earlier for me.

27
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,880
You hid them very well,

28
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,640
but I still found them.

29
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,040
I didn't actually hide them.

30
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,880
This breastpin is the same brand

31
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,760
as the earrings.

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,040
They may be counted
as couple accessories.

33
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,600
I hope

34
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,880
our relationship will be as eternal

35
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,320
as a diamond.

36
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,280
Of course it will.

37
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:33,840
Mom.

38
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,600
I didn't see anything. You can go on.

39
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,080
Did you hear that?

40
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,160
She told us to go on.

41
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,880
Are you kidding?

42
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,000
Slow down, Little Moon.

43
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,720
Why are we going

44
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,840
to look at the stars now?

45
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:10,960
The teacher said

46
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,720
there would be a meteor shower tonight.

47
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,760
Let's go to the lake
to take a good look.

48
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,440
- Mom, hurry up.
- Slow down.

49
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,520
You woke up.

50
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,920
You scared me.

51
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,080
Have some water.

52
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,720
How do you feel?

53
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,360
Do you feel better?

54
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,400
I'm okay.

55
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,480
How's Little Moon?

56
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,800
She's fine.

57
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,680
She was just a little frightened.

58
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,440
I took two days off for her.

59
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,880
Now she is resting at home.

60
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,840
What happened last night?

61
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,880
We went to the lake
to watch shooting stars.

62
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,160
Slow down, Little Moon.

63
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,320
We'll get there soon.

64
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,360
(When we went out,)

65
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,680
(a car rushed toward us.)

66
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
As if it had been waiting for you there?

67
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,160
I'll get to the bottom of it.

68
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,040
I will not let go of anyone

69
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,880
who hurt you.
