3
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,800
Su Shaoyan!

4
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,400
I didn't mean to hug you,

5
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,680
let alone to touch you.

6
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,120
I've warned you.

7
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,760
Stay more than a meter
away from me at all times.

8
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,000
I have mysophobia.

9
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,160
I told you I didn't mean to do it,

10
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,640
and even if I meant to do it, so what?

11
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,680
We are husband and wife.

12
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,960
I accept your statement

13
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,400
and our relationship for now,

14
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,200
but it does not mean
I have feelings for you.

15
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,240
Let's talk about it
after you're fully recovered.

16
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,440
Rest assured.

17
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,560
I have plenty of time.

18
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,800
Ms. Su, you're finally here.

19
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,080
Have you thought
about the funding yet, Ms. Su?

20
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,880
Please be sure to help us.

21
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:09,960
Are you all beggars?

22
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,680
To the conference room. Now!

23
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:13,600
Ms. Su.

24
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,040
The Hechuan project

25
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,240
caused the company
to lose nearly one billion yuan.

26
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,960
Now the money we can use

27
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,360
is less than 50 million yuan.

28
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,040
Apply for a loan from a bank.

29
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:27,840
A loan?

30
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,480
Given our current financial situation,

31
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,640
which bank would be willing
to lend us money?

32
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,640
Actually, there is a quicker way

33
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,520
to save the group.

34
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,080
What do you mean?

35
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,480
With your relationship with Ms. Su,

36
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,560
we can get the money

37
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,680
very easily.

38
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,920
Yes, Mr. Sheng.

39
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,480
I know you have a strong personality.

40
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,480
But can't you sacrifice a little

41
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,240
for the company?

42
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,440
You're thinking for the company

43
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,560
or yourselves?

44
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,160
You want me to beg a woman?

45
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,080
In your dreams.

46
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:03,880
Mr. Sheng.

47
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,080
Dismissed.

48
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,560
What I want is coffee.

49
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,800
Caffeine stimulates nerves in the brain.

50
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,640
You should drink less coffee.

51
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:20,960
Su Shaoyan.

52
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,720
Do you think you're really something?

53
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,160
You want to get all up into my business?

54
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,000
I just care about you.

55
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,320
Save it.

56
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,200
Nanfang, I know
you're under a lot of pressure now.

57
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,560
But don't worry.

58
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,760
I will always be with you.

59
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,920
I can wait for you

60
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,280
to recover from your memory loss,

61
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,400
and I can help you with your work too.

62
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,160
Or

63
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,000
you can just stay home for a year or so.

64
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,120
I can afford it.

65
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,480
Don't you understand me?

66
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,600
I'm telling you.

67
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,680
It's none of your business.

68
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,880
Neither my body nor my company

69
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,760
has anything to do with you.

70
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,960
I'm just trying to help you.

71
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,720
How can you...?

72
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,480
(Ms. Su, the directors
came for it again.)

73
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,160
Got it. I'll be right there.

74
00:04:12,576 --> 00:04:13,160
(Acquisition Contract)

75
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:13,640
Ms. Su.

76
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,680
Let me get this straight.

77
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,240
About the acquisition of Sheng.

78
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,320
Why do you keep

79
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,320
putting it off?

80
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,880
I have my own reasons.

81
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,360
This acquisition

82
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,960
has been approved
in the shareholders' meeting.

83
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,040
Now you're saying
you have your own reasons?

84
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,240
Mr. Zhang.

85
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,160
Please calm down.

86
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,720
Everything I do now

87
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,440
is for the good of the company.

88
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,760
The businesses of the two groups
don't overlap that much.

89
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:39,680
So I think

90
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,680
the acquisition of Sheng

91
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,280
may not be as beneficial as you think.

92
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,880
We should form

93
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,400
a long-term partnership with Sheng,

94
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,000
which is more beneficial to us.

95
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:49,600
I object.

96
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,000
You have been the CEO

97
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,720
for less than a year, Ms. Su,

98
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,280
so it is inevitable
that you lack project experience.

99
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,640
You should listen
to the opinions of other shareholders.

100
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,360
Mr. Liu and Mr. Zhang

101
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,520
both have been in the company
for more than ten years.

102
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,880
You don't listen

103
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,800
to any of their opinions.

104
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,880
If a person can run a company well
as long as he's worked in it for years,

105
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,040
then I have no opinions.

106
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,960
But you guys all know

107
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,320
what the company was like

108
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,720
when I came here, don't you?

109
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,480
Nice language.

110
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,320
You refuse to sign it

111
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,520
because of Sheng Nanfang, right?

112
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:23,960
To be fair,

113
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,840
this project should be given to Mr. Su,

114
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,280
Su Tinghao.

115
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,760
What do you think, everyone?

116
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,120
Good.

117
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,320
A month.

118
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:34,960
What did you say?

119
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,360
Allow me one month.

120
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,640
I will show good results
from the cooperation

121
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,200
to prove that my decision is right.

122
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,080
By the way.

123
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,080
Don't forget it.

124
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,000
The current CEO of Tianqi Group

125
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,120
is me, Su Shaoyan,

126
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,600
not Mr. Su,

127
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,600
let alone Ms. Song.

128
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,880
You'd better remember it.

129
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,120
Dismissed.
