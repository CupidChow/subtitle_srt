00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,720
(Without further ado, I'll see you)

4
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,720
(in Youji Teahouse tomorrow afternoon.)

5
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,600
The general release date
will be the first day of next month.

6
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,400
New promos and print ads

7
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,440
are in the works.

8
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:03,920
On-site equipment

9
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:04,800
has been determined.

10
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,200
We've already selected
a host for the live stream.

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,880
Excuse me.

12
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,680
I need a minute.

13
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,640
Ms. Su.

14
00:01:20,704 --> 00:01:23,136
(Mr. Chen)

15
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,280
(Have you got what I need?)

16
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,160
Yeah.

17
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,040
I'll be there in ten minutes.

18
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,656
(Liang Xiaoxiao)

19
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,960
(Mr. Sheng, Ms. Su suddenly fainted.)

20
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,696
(File Folder)

21
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,160
Ms. Liu, how is she?

22
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,840
Dr. Xia said she'd been
under too much pressure at work recently

23
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,720
and failed to maintain
a regular schedule

24
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,400
or eat regular meals,

25
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,480
so she finally succumbed to exhaustion

26
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,360
and fainted.

27
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,320
Okay, I know.

28
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,280
You can leave now.

29
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,200
Su Shaoyan.

30
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,840
Why are you working so hard?

31
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,040
Xiaoxiao.

32
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,560
Where's Xiaoxiao?

33
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,280
I have something about work to tell her.

34
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,360
You drive me back to the office.

35
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,800
You care so little about yourself.

36
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,320
Do you know how worried I am?

37
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,280
You're yelling at me.

38
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,280
I promised you

39
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,760
I would create a new brand

40
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,240
to help you revitalize Sheng's Group

41
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,120
no matter how tiring it would be.

42
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,000
What you have done

43
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,960
is all for me?

44
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,880
Not exactly.

45
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,680
Actually, my father knew

46
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,520
Su Tinghao was not his own son,

47
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,480
so he found me on his deathbed

48
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,440
and let me inherit Tianqi.

49
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,800
It was his last wish
to hold on to Tianqi,

50
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,600
so I can't fall

51
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,640
or let it fall into anyone else's hands.

52
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,240
Nanfang.

53
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,280
Tianqi is as important to me

54
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,200
as Sheng's Group is to you.

55
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,600
You'll help me,

56
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:19,880
won't you?

57
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,160
(Sheng Nanfang.)

58
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,560
(What were you doing this afternoon?)

59
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,440
(Mr. Chen waited
for you for a whole hour.)

60
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,440
I've got a thing.

61
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,640
(Now the most urgent thing)

62
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,840
(is to remove Su Shaoyan from power.)

63
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:33,840
I'll deal with it.

64
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,680
(Song Jiao)

65
00:03:40,128 --> 00:03:42,368
(Block Contact)

66
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,360
Mr. Sheng, please take a seat.

67
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:02,640
Please.

68
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,512
(File Folder)

69
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,240
Are these the designs
for the new products

70
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,720
of Kiss of Eros this season?
