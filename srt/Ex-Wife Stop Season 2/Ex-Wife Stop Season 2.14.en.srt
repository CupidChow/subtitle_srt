00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,000
Ms. Su,

5
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:56,920
there are a lot of articles
on the Internet

6
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,400
accusing our new products of plagiarism,

7
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,720
and a large number of people
entered the live room to accuse us.

8
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,000
The public is accusing the Tianqi Group
of copying others.

9
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,360
Although the number of viewers

10
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,480
continues to rise,

11
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,480
most of them

12
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,920
are bystanders and haters,

13
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,880
and the growth in sales has stalled.

14
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:13,840
Mr. Sheng.

15
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,800
This is our joint brand
with the Tianqi Group.

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,360
Why aren't you worried?

17
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,040
I knew it would end up like this.

18
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:21,960
They

19
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,000
don't want to help us at all.

20
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,560
It's only a matter of time

21
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,200
before our relationship falls apart.

22
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,480
We have the initiative
only when we have resources

23
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,040
in our own hands.

24

34
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,000
What are you doing?

35
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,520
Nothing.

36
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,120
You changed it just now?

37
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,400
You've been
under lots of stress at work lately.

38
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:48,960
I think seeing Little Moon

39
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,840
will make you feel better.

40
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,440
Yeah.

41
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,680
I've been exhausted by the firm affairs.

42
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:56,720
But luckily,

43
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,080
you're by my side.

44
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,120
It will be over,

45
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,040
and I will always be with you.

46
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,000
Don't worry too much about it.

47
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,240
Are we there yet?

48
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,840
You've had a long day.

49
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,040
I want you to take a bath
and have a good rest.

50
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,360
The water temperature is just right.

51
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,600
You've had a long day too.

52
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,800
Maybe we can take a bath together.

53
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,760
How can two people

54
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,760
fit in such a small bathtub?

55
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,640
Maybe we can do it

56
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,880
in a different posture.

57
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,720
Just enjoy it alone.

58
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,720
Are you in a better mood now?

59
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,560
Yeah, much better.

60
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,400
I feel like

61
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,320
I've had a long holiday.

62
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,960
How's it going?

63
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:18,920
Have you figured out
the plagiarism thing?

64
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,920
I've confirmed
with the Design Department

65
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,280
that the Kiss of Eros products
are not copied from other brands.

66
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,560
I suspect it's Yugao who did it

67
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,440
because Yugao and Tianqi

68
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,320
have always been rivals.

69
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,080
Even if you clarify now,

70
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,520
the pre-sale volume will be affected.

71
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,040
What are you going to do?

72
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,760
The only ones
that have been accused of copying

73
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,880
are the two types of bags
that have already been released,

74
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,800
so I'm going to start
selling all the bags earlier

75
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,160
and make other bags the new flagships.

76
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,000
I'll be very busy.

77
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,240
Maybe I'll have to sleep in the office.

78
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,280
You.

79
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,240
Work will never be done.

80
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,720
No matter how busy and tiring it is,
you should take good care of yourself.

81
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,320
I know.

82
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,880
Don't treat me like I'm a child.
