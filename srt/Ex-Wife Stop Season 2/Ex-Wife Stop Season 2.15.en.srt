3
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,720
Mom!

4
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,320
You're a grown man now.

5
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,160
Can't you be more stable?

6
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,240
It's a very important thing.

7
00:00:58,760 --> 00:00:59,520
I just found out

8
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,600
Sheng Nanfang
has been secretly contacting

9
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,560
the Tianqi Group's clients.

10
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,280
I felt it was very strange.

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,720
And guess what?

12
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,000
Mr. Jiang was not the first one.

13
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,240
I thought they had

14
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,440
a strong relationship.

15
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,600
It turns out that he's already stabbed
her in the back.

16
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:19,920
Now,

17
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,360
it's time to have a talk with him.

18
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:31,680
Mr. Sheng.

19
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,040
The steak here is fantastic.

20
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,680
You must try it.

21
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,360
I've already had dinner.

22
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,040
Let's make it short.

23
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,000
Fine.

24
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,320
Let me be forthright.

25
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,160
I want to work with you

26
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,320
to drive Su Shaoyan
out of the Tianqi Group.

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,320
Did you forget it, Ms. Song?

28
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,120
Shaoyan is my wife.

29
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,960
Then Mr. Sheng, did you forget too

30
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,400
that you met Mr. Jiang here yesterday?

31
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:57,680
I don't think

32
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,120
she knows this.

33
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,200
You've seen the current situation

34
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,240
of Kiss of Eros.

35
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,680
She has her heart set
on taking over your group

36
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,320
and guaranteeing her tenure as CEO.

37
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,080
But I have no such intention.

38
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,760
I'm not interested in your group.

39
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,040
If you can help

40
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,960
make Tinghao the CEO,

41
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,680
I can guarantee that the Sheng's Group
will be back on its feet.

42
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,200
Why should I believe you?

43
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,040
I know you need 300 million now.

44
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,320
Can she give you so much money?

45
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,400
I've known the major shareholders

46
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,920
of the Tianqi Group for over a decade.

47
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,200
I say the word,

48
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,840
and the money will be sent
to the Sheng's Group's account at once.

49
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,560
That sounds like a good deal.

50
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:39,840
Sure.

51
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,280
Nice doing business with you.

52
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,120
Mr. Sheng.

53
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:57,880
Where's Ms. Su?

54
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,760
She is in a meeting.

55
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:02,840
I'll get back to work.

56
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,240
(As long as Yugao releases
new products before the Tianqi Group,)

57
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,480
(that means Kiss of Eros
would be copying from them.)

58
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:16,760
(Then)

59
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,240
(Su Shaoyan will have to
make good on her promise)

60
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,120
(and resign.)

61
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,840
Dad.

62
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,040
Hey.

63
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,600
Where's Mom?

64
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,040
She's working overtime at the office

65
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,080
and won't be back until late.

66
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,200
What's the matter?

67
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,520
She works overtime every day,

68
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,720
and I haven't seen her for several days.

69
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,720
Look.

70
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,320
This is Dad.

71
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,080
This is me.

72
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,360
This is Mom.

73
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,680
This is a pretty good drawing.

74
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,880
When can we go out to play together?

75
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,080
Little Moon.

76
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,160
Sit here.

77
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,520
After your mom is done,

78
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,400
we will take you
wherever you want to go.

79
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,040
Great.

80
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,640
- You aren't lying, are you?
- Here.

81
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,280
- Pinky swear.
- Pinky swear.

82
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,280
My phone is ringing.

83
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,480
Go on with your drawing.

84
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,000
(Have you got what I want,)

85
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,640
(Mr. Sheng?)

86
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,400
Yeah.

87
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,080
(Without further ado,)

88
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,200
(I'll see you tomorrow afternoon
in Youji Teahouse.)
