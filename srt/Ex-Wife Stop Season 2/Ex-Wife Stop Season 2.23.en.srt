3
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,680
What do you think?

4
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,520
Does it look good?

5
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,400
Yes.

6
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,000
Do I look better in this black one

7
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,880
or that blue one?

8
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,280
They both look good.

9
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,720
Don't be perfunctory.

10
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,760
I'm honest.

11
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,280
Take a closer look.

12
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,200
Nick is the CEO

13
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,480
of the world's top luxury group.

14
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:08,280
I managed

15
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,360
to get an invitation
to the private dinner banquet.

16
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,400
I have to be on my best behavior.

17
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,240
This one suits you better.

18
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,720
With this, you will look even better.

19
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,400
Song Jiao.

20
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,000
Let go of me.

21
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,520
Let go of me.

22
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:43,800
Are you insane?

23
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,240
What do you want to do?

24
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,680
You're not gonna kill me, are you?

25
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,480
It depends on you.

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,560
If you sign over your stake

27
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,680
in the Tianqi Group,

28
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,600
(Equity Transfer Agreement)
I'll let you out of here right now.

29
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,440
In your dream.

30
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,680
In the past ten years,

31
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,840
I have done so much

32
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,720
for the Su family

33
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,120
and for the group.

34
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,600
How can I let
a woman like you reap the benefits?

35
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,120
You're trying to get me
out of the country.

36
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,160
You're the one dreaming.

37
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,800
Song Jiao, my father was so good to you.

38
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,160
How could you do this to him?

39
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,600
I'm telling you.

40
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,440
I deserve the interests.

41
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,440
If you don't sign it,

42
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,440
you're gonna die here.

43
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,680
(Where are you, Nanfang?)

44
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,760
Guess who I saw yesterday.

45
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,680
It must be a big shot.

46
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,240
Don't keep us in suspense.

47
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,280
Tell us.

48
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,760
The director
of the world's top luxury group,

49
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,480
Nick.

50
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,680
It took me a lot of efforts to find out

51
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,240
he was invited
to a private dinner banquet.

52
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,680
I heard it would be held tonight.

53
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,640
Mr. Sheng, you were cheated.

54
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,720
I saw Nick with my own eyes yesterday.

55
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,280
After the banquet,

56
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,040
he went straight
to the airport to return to France.

57
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:38,800
Excuse me.

58
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,400
I'll leave you two.

59
00:03:44,928 --> 00:03:47,296
(Su Shaoyan)

60
00:03:48,448 --> 00:03:51,744
(Sorry, the person you have dialed
is temporarily unavailable.)

61
00:03:53,856 --> 00:03:56,800
(Sorry, the person you have dialed
is temporarily unavailable.)

62
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:02,960
Su Tinghao.

63
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,120
Is Song Jiao with you?

64
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,000
(No.)

65
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,200
(She refused to go with me.)

66
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:09,800
Yan is missing.

67
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,400
(Do you mean my mother...?)

68
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,600
If something happens to Yan,

69
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,200
I'll let her die.

70
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,400
(There is an abandoned warehouse
near our house,)

71
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:22,720
Over there.

72
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,600
(and Su Shaoyan
was once locked up there.)

73
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,720
(You can go there.)

74
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,400
Yan.

75
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,456
Yan.

76
00:04:52,864 --> 00:04:53,600
Be careful.

77
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,920
Su Shaoyan.

78
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,800
I will never stop!
