00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,680
The fall collection unveiled by Yugao

4
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,360
is almost identical to the products
that we will release soon.

5
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,000
If we go ahead
with the release as planned,

6
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,640
it'll make us adjudged to plagiarism.

7
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,320
That means

8
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,200
there's a mole inside the company.

9
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,120
Speak.

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,640
Don't you guys usually talk a lot?

11
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,800
Why are you all silent now?

12
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,280
You speak first.

13
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,440
Ms. Su.

14
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,040
What do you mean?

15
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,480
How can it be me?

16
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,720
I'm loyal to the group,

17
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,400
and everyone is my witness.

18
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,760
M-M-Ms. Su.

19
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,440
I...

20
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,880
I've never done
anything bad to the group.

21
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:35,600
You...

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,480
You have to believe me.

23
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,040
Why are you being hard on them?

24
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,240
Why don't you first investigate
your beloved one?

25
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,320
What do you mean?

26
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,640
I just want you to be impartial

27
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,320
and not protect the traitor.

28
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,760
I will get to the bottom
of this disclosure.

29
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,720
No matter who disclosed it,

30
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,680
I will not let him off.

31
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,040
Ms. Su.

32
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,640
Actually,

33
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,040
I saw Mr. Sheng
flipping through your things.

34
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,200
(What?)

35
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,520
Mr. Sheng once came to see you.

36
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,120
I told him you were in a meeting.

37
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,400
I didn't think much of it

38
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,480
or expect this to happen.

39
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,680
(I can't believe it's you.)

40
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,320
You changed it just now?

41
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,720
You've been
under too much pressure at work lately.

42
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,160
I think seeing Little Moon

43
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,160
will make you feel better.

44
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,880
(Everything he did to me)

45
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,360
(was for other purposes.)

46
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,320
Yan.

47
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,920
You came back from work so early today.

48
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,080
Something was stolen from my office.

49
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,920
I'm not in the mood to work.

50
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,560
What is it?

51
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,160
A watch.

52
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,800
Could you have been wrong?

53
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,880
No, I couldn't.

54
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,760
It was in the drawer under my desk.

55
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,200
Did you move my things

56
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,000
when you were in my office?

57
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,160
No.

58
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,440
You've been in my office a lot lately.

59
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,920
Are you sure
you haven't opened my drawers once?

60
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,080
Yes.

61
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,760
Just a watch.

62
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:18,760
I'll buy you another one.

63
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:19,960
Sheng Nanfang.

64
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,000
Do you know I hate people lying to me

65
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,080
as much as you do?

66
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,160
What exactly happened, Yan?

67
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,360
I am tired.

68
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,320
Let's talk about it at another time.

69
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:34,800
Yan.

70
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,640
I am wondering

71
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,800
if you have your letter
of resignation ready?

72
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,960
It's still under investigation.

73
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,240
Don't act like that.

74
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,080
It will be wise

75
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,360
for you to leave Tianqi.

76
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,840
It's not good for you or Sheng Nanfang

77
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,080
if you make it a big deal.

78
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,800
You knew it's him.

79
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,360
Yes.

80
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,120
The leaker is your beloved husband,

81
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,640
Sheng Nanfang.

82
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,720
The evidence is on your desk.

83
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,200
Take a good look at it.

84
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,600
(Mr. Sheng, please take a seat.)

85
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,000
(Are these the designs
for the new products)

86
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,160
(of Kiss of Eros this season?)

87
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:51,720
(Yes.)

88
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,240
(So it's really you, Nanfang.)

89
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,400
Yan, I don't agree
with your resignation.

90
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,120
Why?

91
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,000
Isn't that what you want?

92
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,880
Why would I want that to happen to you?

93
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,080
Enough. Stop acting.

94
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,600
Sheng Nanfang.

95
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,920
Let's get divorced.
