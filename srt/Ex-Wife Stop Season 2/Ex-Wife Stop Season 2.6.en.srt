3
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,360
What's the matter, Ms. Su?

4
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,520
Xiwen.

5
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,680
What should I do?

6
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,800
Sheng Nanfang doesn't buy that at all.

7
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,000
The moves are not wrong.

8
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,640
You just acted too strong.

9
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,440
Did I?

10
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,360
Did you forget

11
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,920
he lost his memory?

12
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,600
He thinks he's still
the mighty CEO of Sheng

13
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,600
who he was seven years ago.

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,760
But now,

15
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,640
he's outshined by you.

16
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,600
How can he feel good?

17
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,560
Men

18
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,240
always try to be macho.

19
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,720
Can you tell me

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,080
what I should do now?

21
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,920
(A woman in a veiled outfit
is the most seductive.)

22
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,000
(Take the opportunity
to show your weak and shy side.)

23
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,040
(He won't be able to resist it.)

24
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,240
What's wrong?

25
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,040
It hurts so much.

26
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,480
I sprained my ankle

27
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,560
and can't stand up.

28
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,520
Can you take me back to bed?

29
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,840
It really hurts.

30
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,240
I'll get you some ointment.

31
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,520
Su Shaoyan.

32
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,400
That's excellent acting.

33
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,400
You should be an actress.

34
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,520
It's not what you think. I...

35
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,200
I'm here to say sorry to you.

36
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,360
I shouldn't have embarrassed you

37
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,760
the other day at the restaurant.

38
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,080
I'm sorry.

39
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,600
If you accept my apology,

40
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,440
you shall drink this up.

41
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,000
(Just get him drunk,)

42
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,480
(and your chance comes.)

43
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,480
It's not a trampoline.

44
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,400
Stop it.

45
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,080
Watch out.

46
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,520
Alright.

47
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,120
- Get down.
- No.

48
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,720
I'm going to let go if you don't.

49
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,920
You won't.

50
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,920
Unless you give me a kiss.

51
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:33,920
You drank too much.

52
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,200
No, I didn't.

53
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,280
I'll prove it to you.
