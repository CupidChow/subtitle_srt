00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,200
(CEO's Office)

4
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,480
What are you doing?

5
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:50,840
Put them down.

6
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,880
All the stuff on the cabinet.

7
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:54,680
Move them out.

8
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,200
Song Jiao.

9
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,800
Don't push it.

10
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,840
I'm still the CEO

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,800
of the Tianqi Group.

12
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,440
You won't be the CEO for much longer.

13
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,360
You might as well

14
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,200
leave the office early.

15
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,120
Stop moving.

16
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,120
Su Shaoyan.

17
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,680
Being in this office

18
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,400
doesn't mean you're the CEO.

19
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,960
I'm telling you that If I don't see

20
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,560
your resignation letter
within the next three days,

21
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:20,960
I'll post the audio recordings
and photos

22
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:21,960
of Sheng Nanfang's shady behaviors

23
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,120
on the Intranet.

24
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,320
You'll be fired

25
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,200
by the shareholders.

26
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,960
Stop drinking, Yan.

27
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,960
You're gonna get drunk. Stop it.

28
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,080
Wen.

29
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,800
Now I really don't know

30
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,520
if I should trust him.

31
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,680
In fact, you want to trust him,

32
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,760
or you wouldn't be so sad.

33
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,800
Of course I want to.

34
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,560
But it makes me sad

35
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,680
when I realize he's been pretending

36
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,240
to be nice to me.

37
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,720
I understand.

38
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,800
I'm really sad.

39
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,040
Don't be that sad.

40
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,320
What if he was really set up?

41
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,640
Since he said

42
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,000
he'd prove his innocence
within three days,

43
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,880
we'll give him the time.

44
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,160
If he hasn't found evidence by then,

45
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,040
I'll fix him for you.

46
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:30,800
Wen.

47
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,720
I'm really scared.

48
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,520
Don't be scared. I'm here.

49
00:02:40,928 --> 00:02:42,368
(Jiang Jiayu)

50
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,760
Hello, what's the matter?

51
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,320
(Why is it so loud?)

52
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,160
I'm at the bar with Yan.

53
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,240
She's drunk.

54
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,040
I'll call you back later.

55
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,240
What took you so long? I'm exhausted.

56
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,600
Where are your hands?

57
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,320
It has nothing to do with you.

58
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,480
I'm telling you.

59
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,320
You're the person
she hates the most now.

60
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,240
Go away.

61
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,080
Go away.

62
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,360
You've done so much wrong,

63
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:27,720
and now you're hitting him.

64
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,920
You're hopeless.

65
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,920
I'll never forgive you
for the rest of my life.

66
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,600
Let's go, Jiayu.

67
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,560
Sheng Nanfang, hurry to find evidence

68
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,040
to prove your innocence.

69
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,240
Mrs. Liu.

70
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,280
Ms. Su.

71
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,520
Did Nanfang put the tea here for me?

72
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,480
No.

73
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,640
It was put by the young man

74
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,880
who drove you home yesterday.

75
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,240
(What do I expect from him)

76
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,520
(when I've already decided
to divorce him?)

77
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,600
My mom handed over

78
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,360
the designs of Kiss of Eros.

79
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,280
Su Shaoyan is your wife.

80
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,120
If your betrayal of our group

81
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,640
becomes known to the executives,

82
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,520
she will also be responsible for it.

83
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:21,800
And my mother was behind the conspiracy

84
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,960
against the Hechuan project.

85
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,440
She made a forgery

86
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,480
of evidence and asked me

87
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,520
to set Su Shaoyan up.

88
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,560
How could you not believe it?

89
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,320
What will happen to my mother

90
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,560
if I testify for you?

91
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,240
As long as you do what I say,

92
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,480
she won't be prosecuted.

93
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,600
As for her,

94
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,080
she'll be fine
if she hands over her shares

95
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,040
and leaves Tianqi.

96
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,720
This is an invitation
from the Universe team.

97
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,640
You can go to Europe
and fulfill your dream

98
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,440
as a racing driver.

99
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,240
(INVITATION)
As for your mother,

100
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,240
she'd better spend
the rest of her life abroad

101
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,120
and never return.
