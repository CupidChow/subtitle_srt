3
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,600
You marry me when you want

4
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:48,880
and divorce me when you want.

5
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,160
What do you take me for?

6
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,920
A tool to acquire the Sheng's Group?

7
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,200
This is pure slander.

8
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,480
I never thought of it

9
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,840
that way.

10
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,080
I heard what you said
on the phone in your room that day.

11
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,720
Now the share price
of the Sheng's Group is low.

12
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,680
It is indeed the best time
to acquire it.

13
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,920
It's true that someone in the company

14
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,400
suggested acquiring the Sheng's Group,

15
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,800
but I refused.

16
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,760
You've put tremendous effort
into the Sheng's Group.

17
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,760
How can I do anything to hurt you?

18
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,000
What about our marriage?

19
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,080
Do you really have no bad intentions?

20
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,040
Of course.

21
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,160
The only reason that I married you

22
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,400
was that I love you.

23
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,560
You think I see marriage

24
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,160
only as a tool of trade?

25
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,400
So everything I've done for you

26
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,920
seems like only a deal to you.

27
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,120
Now I get it.

28
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,880
(Divorce Agreement)
Love cannot be forced.

29
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,000
Here you are.

30
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,280
You can leave whenever you want.

31
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,760
(Divorce Agreement)
I won't pester you anymore.

32
00:01:39,264 --> 00:01:43,200
♪Come on, baby. I thought of you again♪

33
00:01:43,488 --> 00:01:46,656
♪I returned to the sad place before I knew it♪

34
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,960
Yan, I believe you.

35
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,440
At first, when I lost my memory,

36
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,240
I thought the world was strange

37
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,840
and nothing was reliable.

38
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,720
I was afraid of being deceived

39
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,360
and hurt,

40
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,040
so I refused to admit
my feelings for you.

41
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,880
Can we not get divorced?

42
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,200
In fact,

43
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,800
I have fallen in love with you.

44
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,240
Little Moon.

45
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,040
It smells good.

46
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:36,960
The food is ready.

47
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:41,840
Here's one for you.

48
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:47,720
You made up with each other?

49
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,600
Thumbs up.

50
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,640
(Mr. Sheng, how's the cooperation)

51
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,560
(with the Tianqi Group going?)

52
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,960
(Antai is pressing us for payment,)

53
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,120
(and if they don't get the money,)

54
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,120
(they're going to pull the plug.)

55
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,360
Don't worry.
I'll talk to Ms. Su right away.

56
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,600
(Be quick.)

57
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,000
(Our group can't afford
any more missteps at this point.)

58
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,680
Okay, I got it.

59
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:20,960
What's the matter?

60
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,200
Yan.

61
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,440
You said last time

62
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,440
you could provide
a sum of funds to the Sheng's Group.

63
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,400
When will the money come in?

64
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,200
How much do you need?

65
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:32,920
300 million.

66
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,560
That much?

67
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,600
It's out of my hands.

68
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,800
It requires the consent
of the shareholders' meeting.

69
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,840
Will they agree?

70
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:44,800
Don't worry about it.

71
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,560
I'll try to convince them.

72
00:04:00,864 --> 00:04:05,504
(Office building)

73
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:10,920
You seem to have forgotten something.

74
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:12,760
What is it?

75
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,200
A goodbye kiss.

76
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,120
We're at the gate of the company.

77
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,400
We're in the car. Don't be afraid.

78
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,560
I'll pick you up after work.
