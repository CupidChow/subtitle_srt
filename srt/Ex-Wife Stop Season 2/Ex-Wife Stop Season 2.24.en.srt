3
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,000
Where am I?

4
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,280
Yan, you woke up.

5
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,160
How do you feel?

6
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:55,920
Who are you?

7
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,720
Stay away from me.

8
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm Sheng Nanfang.
Don't you remember me?

9
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,120
I don't know you.

10
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,000
Why are you here?

11
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,840
We're a family.

12
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,080
Here is our house.

13
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,200
Here is my house.

14
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:08,400
I'm calling the police

15
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,360
if you don't get out.

16
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,640
I'm not a bad person.

17
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,480
- Get out of here.
- All right.

18
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,680
You're so bad.

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,920
I can't believe
you pretend to have amnesia.

20
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,280
I want him to know

21
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,240
how it feels.

22
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,240
I had a terrible time

23
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,480
when he lost his memory.

24
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:36,640
That's true.

25
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,880
But how long are you gonna keep it up?

26
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,640
A few more days.

27
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,320
After all, I've got
a big surprise for him.

28
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,200
What's the surprise?

29
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,400
I don't know you very well.

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,600
Please stay one meter away from me.

31
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,080
But we are a couple.

32
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,440
We may have been
through a lot of things,

33
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,440
but you're a stranger

34
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,920
to me now.

35
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,200
But...

36
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,400
Go over there.

37
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,000
Come in.

38
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,560
Mr. Sheng, this is...

39
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,040
Let's talk about it later.

40
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:40,760
Let me ask you.

41
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,240
What do two people need to experience

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,880
from falling in love to getting married?

43
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,080
It should be getting
to know each other first,

44
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,760
then confessing,

45
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,280
dating,

46
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,400
proposing,

47
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,800
and finally getting married.

48
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:57,880
Too much work.

49
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,120
I'll just pop the question.

50
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,400
Xiwen,

51
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,040
are you available this Saturday?

52
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,640
Could you ask Yan out for me?

53
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,200
(Why don't you do it yourself?)

54
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,440
She doesn't talk to me at all.

55
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:10,920
You ask her out,

56
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,600
and then I'll pretend to run into you.

57
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,160
(So that's your idea.)

58
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,680
(Okay. I'll call you then.)

59
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,120
Xiwen,

60
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:29,760
where are you?

61
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,320
(We're already here.)

62
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,720
(Go straight to your left.)

63
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,480
Our wedding was interrupted twice.

64
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,720
This time I'm going to give him

65
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,040
a memorable wedding.

66
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,040
Nanfang,

67
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,240
would you like to form a happy family

68
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,560
with me?

69
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:18,960
Yan.

70
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,320
So you planned it all.

71
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,680
I really thought you didn't remember me.

72
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,360
How could I not remember you?

73
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,000
I just wanted to surprise you.

74
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,840
I promise

75
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,840
every day

76
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,600
we will be as happy as we are now.

77
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,000
This kind of thing

78
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,840
should be done by men.

79
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,640
Miss Su Shaoyan,

80
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,440
do you take Mr. Sheng Nanfang
to be your husband?

81
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,440
Do you promise to love him

82
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,240
and be loyal to him,

83
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,480
for richer and for poorer,
in sickness and in health?

84
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:17,960
Yes, I do.

85
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,000
Mr. Sheng Nanfang,

86
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:27,120
do you take
Miss Su Shaoyan to be your wife?

87
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:32,040
Do you promise to love her

88
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,280
and be loyal to her,

89
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,640
for richer and for poorer,

90
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,640
in sickness and in health?

91
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:40,800
Yes, I do.

92
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,120
Yan, you must be happy forever.
