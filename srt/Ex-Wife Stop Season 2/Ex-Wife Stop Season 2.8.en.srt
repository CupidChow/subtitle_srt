3
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:56,920
Sorry, my baby.

4
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,680
I'll build

5
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,320
a new castle for you.

6
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,280
Forget it.

7
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,440
You'd better call Mom again.

8
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,960
If you don't act quickly,

9
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,080
Mom will be taken
by another handsome man.

10
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,240
Mr. Hu.

11
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,680
We won't walk you out.

12
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,320
It's rare to see an old classmate.

13
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,240
We want to have a chat.

14
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,080
Goodbye, Mr. Hu.

15
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,000
Be safe.

16
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,120
He's hard to deal with.

17
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,800
But are you sure what you did today

18
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,040
won't offend your superior?

19
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,080
If my dad

20
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,880
hadn't asked me to get experience
as a lower-level staff,

21
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,960
he wouldn't have been my superior.

22
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,000
Don't worry.

23
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,040
He won't dare to do anything to me.

24
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,440
Thank you for what you did just now.

25
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,760
You don't have to be so polite to me.

26
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,600
That's right.

27
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,040
But I really didn't expect

28
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,600
to see you here today.

29
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,880
Actually, I didn't plan

30
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,320
to be here today,

31
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,000
but then I heard you would be here,

32
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,080
so I came here to see you.

33
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,440
How many years has it been

34
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,560
since we saw each other last time?

35
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,120
Seven.

36
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,680
If my dad hadn't insisted

37
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,120
that I should study abroad,

38
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,200
maybe we would have...

39
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,600
Forget it.

40
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,560
Put down your hand.

41
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,040
Nanfang?

42
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,360
Why are you here?

43
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,280
I'm here on business, of course.

44
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,000
Zhao Xian, book me a ticket to Liucheng,

45
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:42,840
as early as possible.

46
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,360
And,

47
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,600
check Su Shaoyan's whereabouts

48
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:46,960
and then send
a message to me immediately.

49
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:53,760
On business?

50
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,720
This is Yan's seat.

51
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,520
I like her seat.

52
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,720
It's better

53
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,120
and feels warm.

54
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,760
I also like the chopsticks
and bowls she used

55
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,400
because food tastes better with them.

56
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,480
I've had enough.

57
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,800
Jiayu, let me introduce him.

58
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,160
This is my...

59
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,960
My fiancé, Sheng Nanfang.

60
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,440
Yes, I am her husband.

61
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,560
You're...

62
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,480
My name is Jiang Jiayu.

63
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,200
I have been her good friend
for more than ten years.

64
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,480
We can be called as
childhood sweethearts?

65
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,600
Yan.

66
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,880
Where were we just now?

67
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,960
Were we talking about school?

68
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,360
Yeah.

69
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,280
When you were at school,

70
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,000
you always cried
when the teachers scolded you.

71
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,560
And I got you to stop it every time.

72
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,440
Now she is with me,

73
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,080
and she never cries.

74
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,440
Because a capable man

75
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,120
never lets his beloved woman

76
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
shed a tear.

77
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,680
Let me drive you back
to your hotel, Yan.

78
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:22,800
Thanks.

79
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,200
I'm driving her back to her hotel.

80
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,920
I don't think we're going the same way.

81
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,240
We are a couple.

82
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,840
Of course we live together.

83
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,920
Jiayu, if it's too much trouble,

84
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,960
actually, we can take a taxi.

85
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:44,760
It's alright.

86
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,200
I'll take you there.

87
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,480
Be careful.

88
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,480
Thanks.

89
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,400
Yan.

90
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,080
I have something important to tell you.

91
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:14,960
Say it.

92
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,480
I need to speak to her alone.

93
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,640
Is there anything that I can't hear?

94
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,680
Even if you're a couple,

95
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,560
you should respect each other's privacy.

96
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:26,600
Or are you afraid

97
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,040
that I'll take her away?

98
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,240
I'm afraid?

99
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,600
Five minutes.

100
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,080
Not a second more.

101
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,000
Do you know that

102
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,960
actually,

103
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,320
you are always special to me?

104
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,200
Jiayu.

105
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,320
(Mr. Sheng.)

106
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,560
(There's indeed something wrong
with the Hechuan project.)

107
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,280
(The person who goes behind our back
is a person surnamed Su,)

108
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,880
(but the identity is not confirmed yet.)
