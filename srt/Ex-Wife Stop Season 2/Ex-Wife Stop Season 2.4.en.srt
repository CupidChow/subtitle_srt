=Episode 4=

3
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,200
I don't celebrate birthdays. Get out.

4
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:58,440
(Sheng Nanfang.)

5
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,560
(Do you know Yan did many things)

6
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,040
(just to let you restore your memory?)

7
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,160
(She's under so much pressure at work,)

8
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,720
(and you gave her that look at home.)

9
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,680
I didn't mean to do that yesterday.

10
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,680
(It was not her fault
that you got hurt and lost your memory.)

11
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,200
(You're so ungrateful.)

12
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,240
(You bad man.)

13
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,000
Mr. Sheng.

14
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,360
The gift you asked for is ready.

15
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,720
Is it an appropriate apology gift?

16
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:32,800
Sure.

17
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,480
A girl will stop being angry

18
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,600
when she sees such a big diamond.

19
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,520
Now the share price
of Sheng Group is low.

20
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,680
It is indeed the best time
to acquire it.

21
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,480
The previous acquisitions
were just small attempts.

22
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,040
If I want to be recognized,

23
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,160
the best way is to snap up Sheng Group.

24
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,040
You're right,

25
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,400
but I don't want to do this.

26
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,080
Nanfang has put tremendous effort
into Sheng Group.

27
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,320
I don't want to take advantage of that.

28
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,920
I can prove myself
without acquiring the group.

29
00:02:08,224 --> 00:02:10,080
(Mr. Li)
(Crescent will go home.)

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,680
Zhao Xian.

31
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,080
Check out the Hechuan project,

32
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,440
and try to find out
if anyone is behind our back.

33
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,920
Go check especially

34
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,680
if Tianqi Group is involved.

35
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:25,800
As soon as possible.

36
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,480
Little bug,

37
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,760
- can you not come here?
- Crescent,

38
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,240
you have to keep an eye on that bug,

39
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,480
and don't let it get out.

40
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,320
If it gets out, I'll catch it back.

41
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,120
Fine.

42
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,840
I won't stop you,

43
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,120
but you'll have to say
something nice about me

44
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,040
in front of your dad tonight.

45
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,040
No way.

46
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,360
Take your time.

47
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,320
Don't I often cook for you?

48
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,720
You seldom cook.

49
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,440
Of course I want to eat more.

50
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,560
Mom, what are you doing?

51
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:14,720
Dad.

52
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:16,960
Me?

53
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,080
Yeah.

54
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,840
Is the lantern done?

55
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,240
What lantern?

56
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,000
It's for my craft class.

57
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,960
Really?

58
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,160
You don't forget it, do you?

59
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,320
It's due tomorrow.

60
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,560
I-I-I'll do it right away.

61
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,480
I love you, Dad.

62
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,960
You are such a good father.

63
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,400
Don't get me wrong.

64
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,160
It is just because
I'm honest and trustworthy.

65
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,600
Okay.

66
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,560
Go for it.

67
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,240
I'll get you
some picture books for reference.

68
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,000
- I didn't mean to.
- I didn't mean to.

69
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,080
I-I-I'm going to check on Crescent.

70
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,040
How did that happen?

71
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,520
Wait. Why am I nervous?

72
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,720
Didn't we kiss a lot?
