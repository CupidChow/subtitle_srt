3
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,160
If it hadn't been for your inability,

4
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,280
Sheng Nanfang would have died.

5
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,200
It's getting tricky now.

6
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,960
They have made up with each other

7
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,320
and they are ganging up on me.

8
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:55,600
Don't let

9
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,480
that mistake happen again.

10
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:11,760
What's wrong, Mom?

11
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:12,720
Nothing.

12
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,120
I'll get someone to clean it up.

13
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,040
No need.

14
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,760
You will be at the helm of
the Tianqi Group.

15
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,000
Take the long view

16
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,000
and don't care about such small things.

17
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,000
There is an important task for you now.

18
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,920
(Do you want to know)

19
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,800
(who's behind the Hechuan project?)

20
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:42,800
Who are you?

21
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,040
(I'll be waiting for you
in the underground parking lot.)

22
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,680
Mr. Sheng, I've heard a lot about you.

23
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,120
I'm Su Tinghao.

24
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,160
Vice President of the Tianqi Group.

25
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,400
I've heard of you.

26
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,560
Make your point quickly.

27
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,440
I'm really curious

28
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,240
about what it's like living with a woman

29
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,320
who's scheming to wreck your company

30
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,960
every day.

31
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,720
You only have five minutes.

32
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:29,600
Okay.

33
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,000
There's another intention
behind her cooperation with your group.

34
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,640
She has already agreed to the proposal
of acquiring the Sheng's Group,

35
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,640
and she's just waiting
for the stock price

36
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,720
to hit a new low.

37
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,800
All the executives at the Tianqi Group
know about this plan.

38
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:43,840
Only you

39
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,240
don't know it.

40
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,560
I don't believe it.

41
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,680
She promised me a sum of money,

42
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,680
and it'll come
into our account in a few days.

43
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,160
I can assure you

44
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,320
that she can't afford the money,

45
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,560
and the project
you're working on together

46
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,680
will be affected.

47
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:00,920
Mr. Sheng.

48
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,120
We're on the same side.

49
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,640
This is to show my sincerity.

50
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,440
It contains the evidence
of Su Shaoyan's covert interference

51
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,400
with the Hechuan project.

52
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,720
And there is an acquisition contract
with her signature.

53
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,920
I've already sent it to you.

54
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:20,640
Mr. Sheng, take a good look at it.

55
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,760
(Do you really think she loves you?)

56
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,680
(She's already hooked up
with her childhood sweetheart.)

57
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,200
(Once you cease to be useful,)

58
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,360
(she will dump you.)

59
00:04:07,104 --> 00:04:07,584
(Acquisition Contract)

60
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:26,760
Mr. Sheng.

61
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,280
Here's the cell phone that was broken
on the day of your accident.

62
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,480
It has been fixed,

63
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,600
and the data in it has been restored.

64
00:04:38,304 --> 00:04:40,128
(Acquisition Contract)

65
00:04:42,336 --> 00:04:47,104
(Su Shaoyan)

66
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,600
It's true that someone in the company
suggested acquiring the Sheng's Group,

67
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,000
but I refused.

68
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,880
You've put tremendous effort
into the Sheng's Group.

69
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,720
How can I do anything to hurt you?

70
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,040
(She has been lying to me,)

71
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,440
(both before)

72
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,720
(and after I lost my memory.)

73
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,760
(I can't believe
I was stupid enough to believe her.)
