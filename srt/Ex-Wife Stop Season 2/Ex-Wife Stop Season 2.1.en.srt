3
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,280
Thinking that tomorrow
is our wedding day,

4
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,720
I'm a little nervous.

5
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,120
What are you nervous about?

6
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,400
We've got our marriage certificates.

7
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:53,760
Are you worried that I would run away?

8
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:54,680
Don't you dare!

9
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:55,600
No, don't.

10
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:56,760
I'm all yours.

11
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:58,800
Miss.

12
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,960
Let's welcome the happiest groom today,

13
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,840
Mr. Sheng Nanfang.

14
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,680
Miss Su Shaoyan.

15
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,520
Do you take
Mr. Sheng Nanfang to be your husband?

16
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,480
Do you promise to love him

17
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,360
and be loyal to him,

18
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,160
for richer and for poorer,

19
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,360
in sickness and in health?

20
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:26,880
Yes, I do.

21
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,080
Mr. Sheng Nanfang.

22
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,960
Do you take
Miss Su Shaoyan to be your wife?

23
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,040
Do you promise to love her

24
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:36,480
(It's not too late to regret it.)
(Acquisition Contract)

25
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,000
and be loyal to her,

26
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,920
for richer and for poorer,

27
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,120
in sickness and in health?

28
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,240
No, I don't.

29
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,040
Nanfang.

30
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,720
What happened? Why did he leave?

31
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:00,760
Nanfang.

32
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,480
What's wrong?

33
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,000
Su Shaoyan.

34
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,240
How long are you going to hide it?

35
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,200
What are you talking about?

36
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,520
You said you love me,

37
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,960
(Acquisition Contract)
but you agreed to acquire Sheng Group.

38
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:09,880
Huh?

39
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,840
Do you want to take
entire Sheng Group as your bride price?

40
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,320
Listen to me, Nanfang.

41
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,600
The contract is real,

42
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,000
but the signature is forged.

43
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,480
Let's not get into it

44
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,640
until the wedding is over, okay?

45
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,600
There will be no wedding.

46
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,400
Nanfang!

47
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,816
(1 month later)

48
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,440
(Where am I?)

49
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,800
(Why am I here?)

50
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:52,640
Nanfang.

51
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,080
You're finally awake.

52
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,520
What are you doing?

53
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,520
What's wrong?

54
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,200
Did we sleep together last night?

55
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,360
Yeah.

56
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:03,800
How much do you want?

57
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:04,840
Just tell me.

58
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,000
What do you mean?

59
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:07,720
Stop playing dumb.

60
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,840
I've seen a lot of women

61
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,760
like you.

62
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,040
You just want money, right?

63
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,160
No matter whether
we did that thing last night

64
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,280
or not,

65
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,360
name your price.

66
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,120
After I give you money,

67
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,680
don't pester me anymore.

68
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,840
Did the accident hurt your brain?

69
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:20,680
Don't touch me.

70
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,680
I have mysophobia.

71
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,560
Well.

72
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,160
Don't you remember me?

73
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:25,840
I'm Yan.

74
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,120
We are a couple.

75
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:27,600
Miss.

76
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,160
Your story sounds very untrue.

77
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,320
He lost his memory?

78
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,880
Isn't this a plot
that only appears in Korean dramas?

79
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,320
Nanfang.

80
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,040
What's wrong?

81
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,600
Dr. Xia.

82
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,760
What exactly is going on?

83
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:49,920
Don't be worried.

84
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:50,960
How can I not be?

85
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,360
He has completely forgotten about me.

86
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,680
He didn't forget his identity,

87
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,360
but he just forgot you.

88
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,960
This is probably the choice
of his subconsciousness.

89
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,280
Did anything

90
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,240
irritate him before the accident?

91
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,680
I thought your love for me was real.

92
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,000
I'm too naive.

93
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,960
(Don't explain
the misunderstanding for now.)

94
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,640
(Tell him more about your story)

95
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,600
(so that he can recover
his memory as soon as possible.)

96
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,480
Take the medicine now.

97
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,720
Where's Dr. Xia?

98
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,160
He's outside.

99
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,800
Rest assured.

100
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,080
It is not poisonous.

101
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Seven years ago,

102
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,520
your grandfather forced you to marry me

103
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,520
in order to repay my grandfather

104
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,920
for saving his life.

105
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,120
At that time,

106
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,880
we were really unhappy

107
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,240
and finally got divorced.

108
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,400
But I didn't expect

109
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,640
I was pregnant with our child, Crescent.

110
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,800
Later, I came back from abroad with her.

111
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,040
And you started to pursue me again,

112
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,360
so we...

113
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:54,960
Enough.

114
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,080
I really have no impression of you.

115
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,360
Say it.

116
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,880
What exactly do you want?

117
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,320
I just want us
to be together as a family.

118
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,960
Are you crazy? You gold digger.

119
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,080
Where are you going?

120
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,280
What does it have to do with you?

121
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,640
I'm your wife.

122
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,360
Get out of the way.

123
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,640
You haven't recovered yet.

124
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,760
I won't let you go.

125
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,600
Get out of the way.

126
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,280
Oh, my God.

127
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,360
Kid.

128
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,400
Are you alright?

129
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,520
Are you injured?

130
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,640
I'm fine, Mom.

131
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,880
Why do you care about her, Mom?

132
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,080
I'm warning you.

133
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,360
Stop pestering me.

134
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,120
You bad boy.

135
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,040
How can you treat her like this?

136
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,040
You want our family to be ruined?

137
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:35,840
Mom.

138
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,520
Nanfang lost his memory.

139
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:39,800
What?

140
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,920
(If Yan hadn't taken over
her father's company,)

141
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,440
(you two would have been married
long ago.)

142
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,280
(Now Sheng Group
relies entirely on Tianqi Group,)

143
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,680
(and only your marriage
can revive Sheng.)

144
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:52,640
Zhao Xian.

145
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,920
Call all the shareholders
to the company for a meeting now.

146
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,040
I'll be there right away.

147
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,680
Let's go. I will send you there.

148
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,240
You know where I'm going?

149
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,520
Of course the company.

150
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,680
I know everything in your heart.

151
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:05,640
But...

152
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,480
Do you intend to go back
to the company like this?

153
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,720
Ms. Su, and Mr. Sheng.

154
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,280
Shirts, suits, ties, shoes.

155
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,520
These are the styles you like.

156
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,640
Pick a set.

157
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,440
I'm going to a meeting,

158
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,560
not a catwalk.

159
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,120
This will be your first appearance
in the company after the car accident.

160
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,120
How can you not dress up?

161
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,120
I don't have time for this.
