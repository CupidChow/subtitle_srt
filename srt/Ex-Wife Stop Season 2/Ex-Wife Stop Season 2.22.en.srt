3
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,880
Here's the soup.

4
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,120
Wait. Let me do it.

5
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,320
Here you are.

6
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,920
You're going to feed me?

7
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:03,840
Of course.

8
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,160
How can you eat it with an injured hand?

9
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,880
Just a scratch. My hand is not broken.

10
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:08,880
You can't.

11
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,360
Dad.

12
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,560
I started eating by myself
when I was three.

13
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,960
Children should stay
out of adults' business.

14
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,320
You're even more childish
than a three-year-old kid.

15
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:19,880
I'm worried about you.

16
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,560
The food is getting cold. Let's eat it.

17
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,440
Eat more.

18
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:38,400
What are you going to do?

19
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,920
It's dangerous for you to bathe alone.

20
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,160
What if you faint?

21
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:44,840
Do you mean

22
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,520
you're going to do it with me?

23
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,480
No.

24
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:48,880
I'll just watch you bathe

25
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,400
to keep you safe.

26
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,760
In your dream.

27
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,080
Yan, where are you going?

28
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,160
I'm going to work.

29
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,680
You were just discharged
from the hospital.

30
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,120
You should stay home.

31
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,240
Nanfang.

32
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,280
Don't treat me
like a three-year-old kid.

33
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,560
I'm not that weak.

34
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,600
Besides,

35
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,840
Song Jiao left,

36
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,440
but I need to go on

37
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,760
with the Kiss of Eros project.

38
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,640
I can't just leave it.

39
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,080
But...

40
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:23,960
No "but".

41
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:25,560
All right.

42
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:26,760
Wait a minute.

43
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,720
This is a vitamin supplement.

44
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,680
It can enhance immunity.

45
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,400
This is cod liver oil.

46
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,640
It's a nutritional supplement.

47
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,480
And these.

48
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,480
You'll take them all.

49
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,600
So many.

50
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,640
These are just for you
to take during the day at work.

51
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,560
There are others
for you to take at night,

52
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,200
which I've put in your room.

53
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,520
I'll remind you when you're back.

54
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,440
According to the surveillance video,

55
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,040
it was not an accident.

56
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,120
Have you caught the person?

57
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,360
Yes.

58
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,160
The driver is the same person

59
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,680
who hit you last time.

60
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:04,720
What was his motive?

61
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,280
He said he was paid for that.

62
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,960
I suspect someone is behind it.

63
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:15,840
Yan.

64
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,800
The driver was caught.

65
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:21,800
How is it?

66
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,440
Did he say who was behind him?

67
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,440
It was Song Jiao.

68
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,760
The accident I had at the wedding

69
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,120
and the one you had this time

70
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,400
were both designed by her.

71
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,480
Are you still going

72
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,320
to send them abroad?

73
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:44,280
Didn't you promise me
not to prosecute Su Tinghao?

74
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,440
Besides,

75
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,120
we're fine now.

76
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:47,880
How about this?

77
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,360
I'll get someone to watch them

78
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,080
when they're in Europe.

79
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,520
Yan.

80
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,480
You're too kind.

81
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,920
Although Su Tinghao and I
were on opposite sides,

82
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,960
I know he didn't really want to hurt me.

83
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,120
And I don't want him

84
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,480
to end up like me with no family.

85
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,520
I'm by your side.

86
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,120
Yeah.

87
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,320
You're by my side,
as well as Little Moon.

88
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,800
I'm satisfied.

89
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,400
So forget the prosecution.

90
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:28,640
Up to you.

91
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,320
Mom, let's go.

92
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,560
I don't want to just leave like this.

93
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,360
What's the difference
between this and exile?

94
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,600
I am going abroad for further training,

95
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,400
and Sheng Nanfang promised

96
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,880
he would pay for our living expenses.

97
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,440
Take it as a vacation.

98
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,160
Just a little money.

99
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,320
He treats us like beggars.

100
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,520
Mom,

101
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,600
I'm not a member of the Su family.

102
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,280
Either the company

103
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,560
or the shares

104
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,360
don't belong to us.

105
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,040
Why should we fight over them.

106
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,280
How did you have the nerve to say that?

107
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,160
Your father is a poor man.

108
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,840
If I hadn't tricked Su Tianqi

109
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,200
into marrying me,

110
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,560
how could you
have been nurtured in luxury?

111
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,040
You don't get what you want for free.

112
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:19,200
You have to work for what you want.

113
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,640
But I don't even want it.

114
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,360
I only want to be a racing driver

115
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,960
and win trophies all over the world

116
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,720
instead of getting involved
in business intrigues.

117
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,960
My son can't be unambitious.

118
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:29,920
Go yourself if you want.

119
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,320
I'm not getting kicked
out of the country

120
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,720
by such a woman.

121
00:07:47,648 --> 00:07:53,056
