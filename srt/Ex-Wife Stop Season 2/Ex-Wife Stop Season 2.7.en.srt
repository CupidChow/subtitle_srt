3
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:46,840
See?

4
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,120
I told you I'm not drunk.

5
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,360
Sheng Nanfang.

6
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,680
I'm wide awake now.

7
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,280
I swear

8
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,000
I will protect you, take care of you

9
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,960
and make you the happiest man

10
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,120
in the world.

11
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,760
Su Shaoyan, do you really love me

12
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,000
or do you have other intentions?

13
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:37,880
(Su Shaoyan.)

14
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,840
(You're totally a loser as a woman.)

15
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,160
(Ms. Su, something really bad happened.)

16
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,640
What is it?

17
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,560
(Mr. Hu suddenly changed his mind.
He won't renew his contract with us.)

18
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,440
Got it.

19
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,520
I'll deal with it right away.

20
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,000
Breakfast's ready.

21
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,760
Tell your mother to come for breakfast.

22
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,120
She left.

23
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,200
She left? Where did she go?

24
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,760
On a business trip.
She won't be back for a few days.

25
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,200
Mr. Hu.

26
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,240
I am really sorry for this matter.

27
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,760
I have already criticized Zhang Tian.

28
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,880
Could you please give us another chance?

29
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,600
This time, I'll see you in person.

30
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:27,680
Alright.

31
00:02:35,456 --> 00:02:39,616
(Have you arrived, Yan?)

32
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,800
Dad.

33
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,800
Are you waiting to hear from Mom?

34
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,200
No.

35
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,160
I'm waiting

36
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,200
for an important message about work.

37
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,160
You're lying.

38
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,720
You just miss Mom.

39
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,200
But

40
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,240
I miss her too.

41
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,440
Why don't we give her a call?

42
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:10,880
Okay.

43
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,960
Then you tell her

44
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,400
it's you who want to make the call.

45
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,800
Got it.

46
00:03:16,576 --> 00:03:17,440
(Su Shaoyan)

47
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,480
Hello, Mom.

48
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,160
(What are you doing, Crescent?)

49
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,840
I'm building blocks with Dad.

50
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,520
(Good girl.)

51
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:27,800
When will you come back?

52
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,400
Mom.

53
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,000
Dad wants you back home
as soon as you finish work.

54
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,680
He misses you.

55
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,480
(Really?)

56
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,000
(I miss you too.)

57
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,360
(I'll fly home)

58
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,680
(as soon as I'm done here.)

59
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,360
Alright.

60
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,000
You are here, Yan.

61
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,320
Come and sit here.

62
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,880
(Jiang Jiayu? Shouldn't he be abroad?)

63
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,480
Mr. Hu.

64
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,000
Ms. Su.

65
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,720
I've already told
Zhang Tian my decision.

66
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,840
He doesn't know any better.

67
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:03,960
Please excuse his manners.

68
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,920
Now I'm here myself to make amends.

69
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,600
Mr. Hu, let me propose a toast to you.

70
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:20,920
Wait.

71
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,560
We drink liquor

72
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:24,800
when we do business in Liucheng.

73
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,480
Sure.

74
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,480
Wait.

75
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:38,920
Mr. Hu, here is the thing.

76
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,040
Ms. Su

77
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,160
is an old acquaintance of mine.

78
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,640
Do me a favor, please.

79
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,320
I'll drink it for her.

80
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,400
You...

81
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:00,840
How about this?

82
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,600
I'll drink

83
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,200
this glass of liquor too.

84
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,120
After all, it's our fault.

85
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,000
What is it?

86
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,320
If you are still not satisfied,

87
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,520
I'll drink one more.

88
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,200
Alright.

89
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,480
Take a seat.
