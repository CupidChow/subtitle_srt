00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,480
(Rally)
I'm furious.

4
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,800
I'm furious.

5
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,400
I've been a member of Tianqi for years.

6
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,880
No one would dare speak to me like that.

7
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,600
I've never been treated that way.

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,600
Mom.

9
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,600
Can you stop walking around?

10
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,360
It made me dizzy.

11
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,080
No.

12
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,720
She joined the company just a year ago.

13
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,240
How could she be the CEO?

14
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,440
The whole company would have been ours

15
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,200
if that old man hadn't played favorites.

16
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,960
You know Dad always looks down on me.

17
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:09,880
Besides,

18
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,720
I don't want to be a CEO.

19
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,920
What are you talking about?

20
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,320
Now, all important projects

21
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,920
are under Su Shaoyan's control.

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,840
You have no real power.

23
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,600
I went to all that trouble

24
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,600
to bring down Sheng Group,

25
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,720
and it was all for you.

26
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,720
As long as we acquire Sheng Group,

27
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,720
you'll have a chance

28
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,120
to outshine Su Shaoyan.

29
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,160
Why are you here?

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,120
This is our room. Of course I'm here.

31
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:48,960
Where are you going?

32
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,640
I'll go to the guest room.

33
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,360
We are husband and wife.

34
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,120
No way.

35
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,920
I've never touched a woman

36
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:56,960
in the past 22 years.

37
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,280
Don't seduce me.

38
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,600
Why are you laughing?

39
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,880
First of all,

40
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,600
you're 29 years old now.

41
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:07,920
Second,

42
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,920
let me help you recall

43
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,600
if you've ever touched a woman.

44
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,400
Alright.

45
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,960
I'll show you something.

46
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:24,920
Do you remember this?

47
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,920
This is the day you proposed to me.

48
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,080
Look.

49
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,040
The diamond ring in the picture

50
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,800
has my initials
engraved on the inner side.

51
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,320
And this one.

52
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,200
You said

53
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,840
we couldn't have the wedding for now,

54
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,800
but...

55
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,080
What's wrong?

56
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,400
Let me take you to rest.

57
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,600
Su Shaoyan.

58
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,600
Don't waste your time on me.

59
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,640
I'll figure out a way
to solve my company's problem.

60
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,720
As for us,

61
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,120
we'd better get divorced
as soon as possible.

62
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,400
Nanfang.

63
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,520
I won't give up on you,

64
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,160
let alone leave you.

65
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:35,680
Sleep.

66
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,200
Don't go.

67
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,320
I'm afraid.

68
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,040
She's troublesome.

69
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,120
Just thunder.

70
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,000
Okay, I'll be here with you.

71
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,040
So he still has feelings for me, right?

72
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:17,520
A meter.

73
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,040
But you hugged me last night.

74
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,200
I was just taking care of a patient,

75
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,480
and that's all.

76
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,240
What do you think?

77
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,200
I can tell

78
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,560
he doesn't hate me at all,

79
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,960
but this morning,
he reacted like that again.

80
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,520
Xiwen.

81
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,880
Can you help me figure out

82
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,440
what he really thinks?

83
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,800
You're a stranger to him now.

84
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,200
If his memory doesn't come back,

85
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,920
we're gonna have to live like this.

86
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,120
It's too painful.

87
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,640
We can help him get his memory back.

88
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,920
I've heard a special treatment

89
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,200
for patients with memory loss,

90
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,800
which is called

91
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,760
situational therapy.

92
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,520
Situational therapy?

93
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,520
I know it's not easy for you,

94
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,800
but Yan's life is hard too.

95
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,040
After her father passed away,

96
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,800
her stepmother
had the final say in their family.

97
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,440
She was once locked up
in a warehouse by her stepmother.

98
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,720
Locked up?

99
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,400
It was a stormy night.

100
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,480
Then

101
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,600
she became terrified of thunderstorms.

102
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,600
She was really scared.

103
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,800
(For thunderstorms)

104
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,560
(If you're really scared, come to me.)

105
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,240
(I will help you restore
your memory, Nanfang.)

106
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,200
(Situational therapy?)

107
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,040
(That is to bring the patient
to a familiar environment,)

108
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,160
(Happy Birthday)
(and then restore the previous scene.)

109
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,480
(The more similar it is,)

110
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,120
(the better.)

111
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,200
(All is ready. Just do it.)

112
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,960
Judging by this quarter's
financial results,

113
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,080
things are actually going well,

114
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:27,920
at least compared to...

115
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:30,960
Are you

116
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,720
having a meeting?

117
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,600
We're just talking about solutions.

118
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,200
If I had known
it was Mr. Sheng's birthday today,

119
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,640
I would have talked
about it another time.

120
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,360
I'm wondering
if you would allow me the honor

121
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,080
to have a taste of your cake.

122
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,040
Of course.

123
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,000
The more people, the merrier.

124
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,880
Don't you see I'm in a meeting?

125
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,520
Try the cake first.
You can have the discussion later.

126
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,320
It's not the time to go rogue. Get out.

127
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,280
I just want to spend
your birthday with you.

128
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,680
I don't celebrate birthdays. Get out.
