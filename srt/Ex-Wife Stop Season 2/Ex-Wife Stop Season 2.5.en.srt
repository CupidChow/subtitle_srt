=Ex-Wife Stop Ⅱ=

2
00:00:43,232 --> 00:00:45,632
=Episode 5=

3
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,440
(You kissed? So soon?)

4
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,800
I didn't expect it to go so well.

5
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,600
(Why don't you take this opportunity)

6
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,400
(to seduce him?)

7
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:55,480
How do I do it?

8
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,440
(It's much easier
for a woman to approach a man.)

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,880
(Do as I say,)

10
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,960
(and I'm sure
he won't be able to resist it.)

11
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,520
This tie goes better with your suit.

12
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,360
(Move one,)

13
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,160
(try to create an intimate atmosphere)

14
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,880
(so that he can't resist it.)

15
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:36,840
I'll do it myself.

16
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:40,720
(Move two,)

17
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,320
(the way to a man's heart)

18
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,560
(is through his stomach.)

19
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,280
Mr. Sheng. Good morning.

20
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,120
Come and sit.

21
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,040
Mr. Sheng.

22
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,760
What kind of breakfast
would you like this morning,

23
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,440
Chinese, Western, Korean or Japanese?

24
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,400
All for me?

25
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,600
Sure.

26
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,080
I woke up early this morning

27
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,640
to do all this for you by myself.

28
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,000
You've got to finish it.

29
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:10,720
(Move three,)

30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,120
(seize every opportunity
to appear in front of him)

31
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,160
(to let him get used to you.)

32
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,240
What now?

33
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,560
I'm here on business.

34
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,000
I don't remember we have a project

35
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,840
with Tianqi Group right now.

36
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,480
There'll be one soon.

37
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:28,640
I want

38
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,880
to establish a long-term relationship
with your company.

39
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,520
We can provide you

40
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,200
with resources and money.

41
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,360
That's exactly what you need right now.

42
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,800
(If I want to be recognized,)

43
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,600
(Basic information about the company)
(the best way is to snap up Sheng.)

44
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,600
(Does she really want to work with us)

45
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,920
(or does she just want
to take control of Sheng?)

46
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,960
It's a big matter.

47
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,440
I have to ask
the shareholders for opinions.

48
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,520
They must be off work now.

49
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,400
Why don't we go to dinner now

50
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,640
and talk about it tomorrow?

51
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,240
I have other things to attend to.

52
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,720
This is how you

53
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,200
treat your partner?

54
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,800
It's a nice place.

55
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,160
Perfect for a date.

56
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,440
Just so-so.

57
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,240
(Move four, show him your love publicly)

58
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,480
(so that he has nowhere to go.)

59
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,960
Nanfang, will you marry me?

60
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,040
Nanfang.

61
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,960
You two just saw it.

62
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,400
Su Shaoyan fools around

63
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,480
and does humiliating things every day.

64
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,960
I can't trust someone like her

65
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,400
to lead Tianqi.

66
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,400
That's very true.

67
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,040
After all, she grew up

68
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,920
with her grandparents
in the countryside.

69
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,560
What can an uneducated girl know?

70
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,680
Tinghao is different.

71
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:23,320
He grew up receiving the best education.

72
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,240
Now, you must know

73
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,080
who should be at the helm of Tianqi.

74
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,440
That's exactly what I thought.

75
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,400
Come on.

76
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,600
Let's propose a toast to Ms. Song.

77
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,000
Here's to you.

78
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,760
I've done so much

79
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,800
for you these days.

80
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,560
What are you not satisfied with?

81
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,920
Did you ask me
what I really wanted before you did it?

82
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,520
You're the one who decides what I eat,

83
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,040
what I wear

84
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,080
and what I do.

85
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,200
Do I have any freedom?

86
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:51,640
I'm a person,

87
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,280
not your pet dog.
