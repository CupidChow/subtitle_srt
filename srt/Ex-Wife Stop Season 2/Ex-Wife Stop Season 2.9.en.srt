3
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:47,560
Yan.

4
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,960
Actually,

5
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,800
you are always special to me.

6
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:53,600
Jiayu.

7
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,160
Actually, you are

8
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,360
a very important friend to me too,

9
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,160
and that's all.

10
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:03,560
If this is

11
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,280
what you wanted to tell me,

12
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,480
there's nothing more to talk about.

13
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,120
Even if it's not me,

14
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,400
it can't be him.

15
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,920
Do you know
Sheng Group is going bankrupt?

16
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,040
Once that happens,

17
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,000
he would be a pauper deeply in debt.

18
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,360
Why does an excellent woman like you

19
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,080
want to waste time on someone like him?

20
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,240
No matter what kind of trouble he's in,

21
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,760
I'm not going to leave him.

22
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,280
Don't turn me down now.

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,880
Think about it.

24
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:29,840
I'll be waiting for you.

25
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:44,920
Nanfang.

26
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,680
What happened?

27
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,360
(Why did he ignore me?)

28
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,840
(Is he abusing me emotionally?)

29
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,120
(How dare he?)

30
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,336
(Sheng Nanfang)

31
00:01:59,264 --> 00:02:04,448
(The subscriber you called is not answered.)

32
00:02:09,216 --> 00:02:11,904
(What are you doing?
Why didn't you reply to my messages?)

33
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,520
I'd like the same drink as this lady.

34
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,400
Alright.

35
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,960
What are you doing here?

36
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,000
Dealing with the work of the branch.

37
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:39,840
But you...

38
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,240
As a girl, aren't you afraid of

39
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,400
the danger of drinking alone?

40
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,000
No one would like to drink with me.

41
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,800
I can only drink alone.

42
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:48,720
Where's Sheng Nanfang?

43
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,800
He is avoiding me.

44
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,480
He's being weird.

45
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,400
He's abusing me emotionally.

46
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,080
All right.

47
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,040
Return it to me.

48
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,920
All right.

49
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,440
Sheng Nanfang, you're a bad man.

50
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,000
You...

51
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,120
Don't pretend to be considerate.

52
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,240
You abused her emotionally.

53
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,800
None of your business.

54
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:43,680
She's my wife.

55
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,080
You!

56
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,080
Enough.

57
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,560
Treat her well,

58
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,640
or I'll take her away right away.

59
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,520
What happened?

60
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:15,640
Does it hurt?

61
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,200
You cuddled with another man

62
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,480
last night,

63
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,000
and now you think of me.

64
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,440
Another man?

65
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,960
I got drunk last night?

66
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,880
Yeah. You were almost
in Jiang Jiayu's arms.

67
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,960
No. We're just friends,

68
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,880
and we only have professional contact.

69
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,160
Then why were you in his car,

70
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,000
totally drunk?

71
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,520
He drove me home?

72
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,360
All I remember is that I fell asleep

73
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,480
at the bar last night.

74
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,720
Going out
with another man till midnight,

75
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,520
and then coming back
and saying you blacked out.

76
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,560
Su Shaoyan.

77
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,440
That's such a lame excuse.

78
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,080
Don't go too far, Sheng Nanfang.

79
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,880
I have never lied to you.

80
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,880
It was you who inexplicably
started to abuse me emotionally.

81
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,160
Inexplicably?

82
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,120
Su Shaoyan, don't you know

83
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,320
what you've done?

84
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,400
I've never cheated

85
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,680
on you.

86
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,440
If you want to force me

87
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,080
to divorce you in this way,

88
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,280
I will fulfill your wish.
