1
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:06,040
National Radio. and Telvison. Administration.

2
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:33,840
Shu Hua.

3
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,240
Look! Look!

4
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:53,720
Look! Look!

5
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,720
Shu Hua.

6
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,040
Shu Hua.

7
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,000
It's my fault.

8
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,080
I shouldn't have left you there alone.

9
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,480
I shouldn't have left you alone.

10
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,280
It's my fault.

11
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,360
I did everything I could

12
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,920
But your mother is seriously ill.

13
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,040
It's like she's struggling between ice and fire.

14
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,079
and slowly exhausted herself.

15
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,520
You know

16
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,280
You know it? Yes.

17
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,280
So...

18
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,000
you didn't cheat or betray her.

19
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,000
My mom committed suicide because she was sick.

20
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,600
It has nothing to do with you, right?

21
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,040
No.

22
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,680
Of course it has something to do with me.

23
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,640
If I knew she was sick earlier,

24
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,880
if I could take a leave with her that day,

25
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,400
the ending

26
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,640
will be totally different.

27
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,280
Today,

28
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,520
go to the hospital

29
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,960
for three months.

30
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,600
Why?

31
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,440
Why?

32
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,240
You can't go to work now.

33
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,360
You should get some rest.

34
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:33,440
I'll go to work after I get treated.

35
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,280
I'll go to work later.

36
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,640
and take a leave.

37
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,079
I'll always be with you.

38
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:41,800
Beihai

39
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,640
I know what you're worried about.

40
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,000
But I want to tell you

41
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,440
when I go to work,

42
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,720
when I go to work.

43
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,000
It's okay.

44
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,720
Don't worry.

45
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,880
Do you know what will happen

46
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:57,360
if anything goes wrong,

47
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,079
if anything goes wrong?

48
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,440
Let me put it this way.

49
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,440
As long as I'm working,

50
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,800
I'm very excited.

51
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:06,720
You know what?

52
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,240
In the past, three surgeries a day

53
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,720
I used to feel tired.

54
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,160
But it's different now.

55
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,520
Five surgeries a day.

56
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,000
I'm in good condition.

57
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,160
And think about it.

58
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,360
the patients are lining up.

59
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,240
What if I ask for leave?

60
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:21,279
Let me tell you.

61
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,240
That's why

62
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,760
you have to get treatment.

63
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:24,760
I know.

64
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,360
you love your work

65
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,960
and take care of patients.

66
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,840
But have you ever thought

67
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,200
you're on the operating table?

68
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,720
If the scalpel in your hand

69
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:34,400
in your hand,

70
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,960
You not only ruined yourself,

71
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,520
but also the patient.

72
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:01,960
Okay.

73
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,160
I'll listen to you.

74
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,840
I'll ask for leave from the director today.

75
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,360
Don't worry. I'll be with you.

76
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,120
I'll pick you up

77
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,280
I'll pick you up in the afternoon, okay?

78
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,120
Director, Beihai

79
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,120
I need to take a leave. Something urgent came up at home.

80
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:58,880
Is it urgent?

81
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,440
Yes.

82
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,560
I have something more urgent.

83
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,160
A major accident happened at the automobile factory.

84
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,160
We're short-handed.

85
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,120
I have to go there now.

86
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,800
You can come with me. Let's go.

87
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,240
No, no, Director.

88
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,840
We'll talk about that later.

89
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,720
Wait, Director.

90
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,880
Qin, you came at the right time.

91
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,160
I was going to see you.

92
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,080
Director Liu, what can I do for you?

93
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,360
Early in the morning?

94
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,080
a patient transferred from the Military Medical University.

95
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,680
Left ventricular mucosa.

96
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,120
I've already done it twice.

97
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,440
It's the third time

98
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,880
This is the third time.

99
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,440
I saw his X-ray.

100
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,880
The entire heart membrane is full of tumors.

101
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,880
It's a rare case.

102
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,280
The surgery is very demanding.

103
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,680
I want to talk to you.

104
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,280
This patient is in critical condition.

105
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,560
Besides looking for you,

106
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,400
I also asked Dr. Jiang and Dr. Chen.

107
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,400
Let's discuss a suitable plan.

108
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,240
Dean Liu, leave it to me.

109
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,520
Have you made up your mind?

110
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,080
The surgery is very difficult.

111
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,680
I've made up my mind. No problem.

112
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,840
Okay, let's hurry up and study.

113
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,640
and try to start the operation this afternoon.

114
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:04,720
Okay.

115
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,280
I'm fine.

116
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,560
Two centimeters lower.

117
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,160
Then use line three to suture.

118
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,720
Watch out for the artery.

119
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:31,880
Yes.

120
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:35,960
Dr. Qin.

121
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,960
How about pause for a while?

122
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,000
No.

123
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,400
Now is the most critical time.

124
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,120
Go on.

125
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:51,680
Okay.

126
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,360
The aorta is cut.

127
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,800
The aorta is cut.

128
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,840
Gauze. Gauze.

129
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,680
Give me the gauze

130
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,159
What should we do now, Dr. Qin?

131
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,280
Give me gauze. Gauze.

132
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,520
What should we do, Dr. Qin?

133
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,559
Give me the veil.

134
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,120
Dr. Qin!

135
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:41,120
What should we do now?

136
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,280
Dr. Qin, what should we do now?

137
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,120
Dr. Qin!

138
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,960
Dr. Qin! Dr. Qin!

139
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,440
What happened after that?

140
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:54,840
And then?

141
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,640
Do you still have gauze?

142
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,840
What should we do now, Dr. Qin?

143
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,120
Dr. Qin.

144
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,640
Do you have any gauze?

145
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,680
Dr. Qin.

146
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,320
The punished person, Qin Shuhua,

147
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,520
December 3, 1995,

148
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,840
In the North Hospital of Jiangdong City,

149
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,160
in Jiangdong City North Hospital,

150
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,960
due to negligence,

151
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,160
the patient Yang Shuping's aortic rupture

152
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,280
She lost too much blood.

153
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,480
The patient died

154
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,960
December 3, 1995.

155
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,280
According to the medical accident,

156
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,840
Article 6 of Chapter 2,

157
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,520
This case is a first-level medical accident.

158
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,600
The hospital is mainly responsible.

159
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,720
According to the medical accident,

160
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,960
Article 20 of Chapter 5,

161
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,640
administrative punishment.

162
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,760
and will be expelled.

163
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:19,840
Do you want to die?

164
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,120
Come, Dong Zi.

165
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,480
Who called the police?

166
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,800
The owner of the steamed bun shop called the police.

167
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,240
This way.

168
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,600
He should be gone.

169
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,240
Shu Hua! Shu Hua!

170
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,680
Shu Hua.

171
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,360
You know each other?

172
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,920
North Sea

173
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,280
This is still alive.

174
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,480
Dong Zi.

175
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,120
Dong Zi, come and help.

176
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,040
Gu, sister-in-law...

177
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,680
Beihai

178
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,720
Come and help.

179
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:05,960
But Chi,

180
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,600
from the moment I met your mother,

181
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,560
until she passed away.

182
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:11,880
until now,

183
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,000
I only have her in my heart.

184
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,080
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

185
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:22,680
We...

186
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,920
We're afraid of ruining

187
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,760
your mother's image in your heart.

188
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,560
And

189
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,680
I won't break

190
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,360
I don't want to break my promise.

191
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,560
Have you thought about my feelings?

192
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,000
Do you know

193
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
over the past 20 years?

194
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,680
I've hated you for more than 20 years.

195
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,160
You told me today that I hate the wrong person.

196
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:52,480
Tell me.

197
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,760
my dad is

198
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,360
in the world.

199
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:57,880
He did all this

200
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,800
to protect his wife's dignity.

201
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,760
He loves his wife.

202
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,240
He cares about his son.

203
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,120
His son was cold to him.

204
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,240
He's just tolerant with a smile.

205
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,320
He's so great.

206
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:14,920
Sorry.

207
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,560
I'm sorry, Chi.

208
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,840
I lost my mom first.

209
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,920
Dad was there.

210
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,360
I don't have a father.

211
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,440
It's been over 20 years.

212
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,040
Let me ask you one more thing.

213
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:18,920
I'm in the north of the city.

214
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,800
After the Cardio Surgery accident,

215
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,920
why did you try so hard

216
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,200
to the emergency center?

217
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:30,680
Chi.

218
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,960
I'm really afraid that you'll go the same way as your mom.

219
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,080
I'm really scared

220
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,520
losing you again.

221
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:46,920
I'm sorry.

222
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,320
I was too selfish.

223
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:34,920
Qi.

224
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,560
Aunt Qin has severe bipolar disorder.

225
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,480
His mother has always been his idol.

226
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,480
I really can't bear to destroy

227
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,720
his mother's image in his heart.

228
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:53,480
So

229
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,720
I kept it from him.

230
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,240
I know all the rumors.

231
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,120
So what?

232
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,280
I don't care.

233
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,440
But Zhang Chi

234
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,840
what would he do

235
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,160
what do you think will happen to him?

236
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,960
You weren't there when I went to your house.

237
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,840
You didn't answer my calls.

238
00:18:58,840 --> 00:18:59,960
My dad didn't cheat on me.

239
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,440
My mom committed suicide.

240
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,040
because she was sick.

241
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,840
Are you surprised?

242
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,360
Is it exciting?

243
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,840
Don't be like this, Zhang Chi.

244
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,800
Your dad did it for your own good.

245
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,440
You were too young.

246
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,040
He couldn't tell you the truth.

247
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,960
You can't understand or accept it, right?

248
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:20,720
For my own good.

249
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,040
How did my mom die?

250
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,600
He didn't tell me for my own good.

251
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,080
He made me hate him for so many years for my own good.

252
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,320
He doesn't want this.

253
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,160
He was just afraid that you and your mother

254
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,360
you and your mother will end up on the same path.

255
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,440
He has been loving and caring about you

256
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,080
that you don't know.

257
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,720
How did you know?

258
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,320
You knew, didn't you?

259
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,240
I didn't know that.

260
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,600
My dad was involved in what happened back then.

261
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,040
I want to know more about it.

262
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,440
My dad didn't tell me about me.

263
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,960
Am I a three-year-old?

264
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,680
I'm in my thirties. Am I that immature?

265
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,480
No, calm down.

266
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,240
I want your relationship to calm down.

267
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,800
I don't want you to worry about this.

268
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,320
and keep pressing you like a big rock.

269
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,800
How do you live?

270
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,560
Aren't you pressing me if you tell me now?

271
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,200
I've been pressing it for more than 20 years.

272
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,960
Can't you understand him?

273
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,080
He's an old man.

274
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,080
It's not easy for him for so many years.

275
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,080
He loves you and cares about you.

276
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,200
You should understand him.

277
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,320
We love you.

278
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,600
Don't doubt this, okay?

279
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,960
You love me.

280
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,840
You've been hiding it from me for so many years. Do you love me?

281
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,960
Don't do this, Zhang Chi.

282
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,360
I don't need such love.

283
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,240
Zhang Chi.

284
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,440
You said you're not a three-year-old.

285
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,040
Hello.

286
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,640
Hello, Zhang Chi.

287
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,120
This is Falia Heart Research Center.

288
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,360
We really hope you can come.

289
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,120
Have you made up your mind?

290
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:55,920
No need.

291
00:21:59,240 --> 00:21:59,760
I'll go.

292
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,680
That's great.

293
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,520
We'll hand in the documents for you

294
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,440
and go abroad.

295
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,400
See you at the research center.

296
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,160
Keep in touch.

297
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,160
120 will be here soon.

298
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,400
Qiang.

299
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,360
Qiang, hang in there.

300
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,640
Can you hear me?

301
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,640
120 is here.

302
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:41,800
120 is here.

303
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:46,640
Come on.

304
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,000
Press the tongue. Press the tongue.

305
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:50,640
Who called the police?

306
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,240
I did.

307
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,640
How long has he been like this?

308
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,640
It's been over ten minutes.

309
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,160
Can you hear me?

310
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,520
Continuous epilepsy.

311
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
He's having a seizure.

312
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:00,520
I saw it.

313
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:02,760
Hurry up.

314
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,240
Stay away. Don't stand so close.

315
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,400
Stand back. Stand back.

316
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,280
Doctor, is he okay?

317
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,640
He's fine.

318
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:10,920
Did you bite it?

319
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,360
I did.

320
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,240
Let's open the vein.

321
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,120
It's bite.

322
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,160
Give me the pipe.

323
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,760
Does he have any basic disease?

324
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,160
I don't know. I'm just his colleague.

325
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:22,280
008401.

326
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,120
Are you his colleague?

327
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,560
Come with us later.

328
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,120
Okay.

329
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,040
Press it.

330
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,760
Please step back.

331
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,520
Keep the air circulation.

332
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,400
Zhang Chi, hold it. Zhang Chi.

333
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,040
I...

334
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,400
Hold it, Ming.

335
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,920
Don't move

336
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,640
Right away.

337
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,280
10 mg of stability.

338
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:48,560
0084 is good.

339
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:48,920
008 is good.

340
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,640
It's okay

341
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,760
Hold it, Ming

342
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,560
Is there any response

343
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:05,760
It's relieved.

344
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,280
Are you done?

345
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,360
Yes.

346
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,000
It's okay

347
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,880
Your legs aren't moving anymore, right?

348
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,040
No.

349
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,520
Stop cramping.

350
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,160
Are you done?

351
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:16,800
Are you awake?

352
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,400
Not yet.

353
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,120
Can you hear me?

354
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:22,800
I'm relieved

355
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,000
Stretcher, Ming.

356
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:24,920
Come on

357
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:25,920
Qiu, pack your things.

358
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:26,280
Okay.

359
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,040
Ready.

360
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,240
One, two, three.

361
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,120
One, two, three.

362
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:36,280
Qiu-yi.

363
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:37,280
Come and help.

364
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,280
One, two, three.

365
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,160
Get in the car.

366
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,160
Qiu-yi.

367
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,760
Get more epilepsy patients.

368
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,880
Prepare a few more tones.

369
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,400
Okay sister

370
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:15,560
Sister.

371
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,440
I heard Dr Zhang didn't come to work today.

372
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,400
He didn't ask for leave either.

373
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,640
What's wrong with him?

374
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,800
It's okay. Leave him alone.

375
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,520
Coming.

376
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,920
Hello, who are you looking for?

377
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,920
Who are you? I'm looking for Xu Chengyuan.

378
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,080
Xu Chengyuan.

379
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,800
Xu Chengyuan, I know you're home.

380
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,400
Come out!

381
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,400
I just wiped the floor.

382
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,400
Oh no

383
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,560
I just cleaned the floor yesterday.

384
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,920
You should at least change your shoes.

385
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,440
Xu Chengyuan, come out!

386
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,280
Who is it?

387
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,400
Xu Chengyuan.

388
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:19,400
Beauty,

389
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,280
Calm down.

390
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,200
My brother is inside.

391
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,640
Who are you?

392
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,400
Your brother.

393
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,280
Brother, I'm his brother.

394
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,280
Tell me.

395
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,640
Brother.

396
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:34,280
Xu Chengyuan, when did you have a brother?

397
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,760
Come out and explain to me.

398
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,440
Stop knocking.

399
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,400
This is my house. It's none of your business.

400
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:41,920
Open the door.

401
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,400
Coming. I'm going to the toilet.

402
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:44,640
Why are you here?

403
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,280
Who is it?

404
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,400
Give me some face.

405
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,120
My sister.

406
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,920
Your sister?

407
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:53,680
You two go up first.

408
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,560
Sister, you step on the floor.

409
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,800
I'll clean it.

410
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,160
It's okay.

411
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:00,640
Go upstairs.

412
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,440
I'm not his brother.

413
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,440
Come out!

414
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:05,520
Fine.

415
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,560
It's creepy to stare at me.

416
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,520
Why did you come back?

417
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,680
I have nothing else to do.

418
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,440
I ran over 10,000 kilometers

419
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,400
and came back to see you.

420
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,600
Is that your attitude?

421
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,160
Okay, thank you.

422
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,040
Thank you.

423
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,920
How nice it would be

424
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,800
to go abroad.

425
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,040
You insisted on being an emergency doctor.

426
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,560
Is something wrong?

427
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:30,640
Are you hurt?

428
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,080
I'm fine now.

429
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,160
I've recovered.

430
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,040
And my brother took good care of me.

431
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,400
What's wrong with them?

432
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,040
They are my colleagues.

433
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,800
It's boring

434
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,680
Isn't it boring?

435
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,040
So I asked them to move in together.

436
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:44,880
and lively.

437
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,040
Luckily, I came back.

438
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,320
If our parents saw you, they would skin you alive.

439
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,920
It's okay. My sister is capable.

440
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:51,760
You can handle it.

441
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,040
I can't.

442
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,400
You can explain to them later.

443
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,640
It's just a routine.

444
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,560
I came back to say hello.

445
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,680
Okay, I'm just doing my job.

446
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,920
Buy me a meal.

447
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,000
What do you want to eat?

448
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,920
You can do whatever you want after eating.

449
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,080
You want me to leave?

450
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,920
This is my home.

451
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:11,080
Watch your language.

452
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,640
We had a deal.

453
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,680
I'll take this place.

454
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,000
OK, OK, OK. Yours.

455
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,160
Are they single?

456
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,160
They both have a boyfriend.

457
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,400
Why are you living with

458
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,160
with two men with a boyfriend?

459
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,800
You really have no idea

460
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,400
I'm not listening. I'm reciting sutras.

461
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,920
I don't want to talk to you.

462
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,680
All right. Aren't you buying me dinner?

463
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:35,880
Let's go. Ask your two brothers.

464
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:36,560
Okay.

465
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,160
I'm happy, Zheng Bo.

466
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,000
Hurry up. My sister is going to treat you to dinner.

467
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:42,320
You...

468
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,520
Slow down.

469
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,520
Be careful.

470
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,160
Where is this?

471
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:02,840
Oh my god.

472
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,000
Come here.

473
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,120
Slow down.

474
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:13,520
Be careful.

475
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:20,520
Are you okay?

476
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,120
What should I do?

477
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,160
Oh my god. You drank so much.

478
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:31,680
Uncle.

479
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,280
Jiaqi.

480
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,200
Why did you bring him home?

481
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,520
What's wrong with him?

482
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,320
He drank too much.

483
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,000
He doesn't want to go back tonight.

484
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,040
and throw him to the hotel.

485
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,000
I was worried.

486
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,640
So I brought it back.

487
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,240
Why are you so drunk?

488
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,560
It's just a few of us having fun.

489
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,600
I didn't expect others to be fine.

490
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,920
He's drunk.

491
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,400
I'll get him some water.

492
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:01,040
Uncle, I'm really sorry.

493
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,680
It's okay.

494
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,920
Sorry, uncle.

495
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,520
It's okay. Don't be shy.

496
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,320
Have some water.

497
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,200
Drink some water.

498
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:12,920
Hurry.

499
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,520
Thank you. Thank you.

500
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,440
Drink slowly.

501
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:24,800
Jia Qi.

502
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:26,680
It's new.

503
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,640
Thank you, uncle.

504
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,400
Lie down.

505
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,920
Don't move. I'll do it myself.

506
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:34,880
I'll do it myself.

507
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:37,640
It stinks.

508
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,640
Take it off yourself

509
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,680
This way.

510
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,160
Come here There's a pillow here

511
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,200
Oh my god

512
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,400
I feel dizzy.

513
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:05,400
They didn't drink, but I drank.

514
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,000
That's right. Who told you to drink?

515
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,120
Good night.

516
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,280
Hi, Kiki.

517
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:17,520
Why are you here?

518
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,280
Why am I here?

519
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,320
Why are you here?

520
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,280
My head hurts.

521
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,960
I'm drunk. I don't remember anything.

522
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:30,640
Where's Uncle Sun?

523
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,480
What time is it?

524
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,840
My uncle went out for a walk.

525
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:34,480
What time is it?

526
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,800
I need to go back to the emergency center today.

527
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,400
Stop. Sit down.

528
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,480
Finish the porridge.

529
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,160
I made it for you.

530
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,080
This is my home.

531
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,640
15 minutes from our center.

532
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,960
I have to go to work later.

533
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,200
So I'll go with you.

534
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,320
Walking.

535
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,120
Walk.

536
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,280
and sober you up.

537
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:51,960
Yes.

538
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,240
Thank you.

539
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,000
It's sweet.

540
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,520
Why am I so dizzy?

541
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:20,880
Have you decided?

542
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:22,520
Yes.

543
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,520
Because when I chose to be an emergency doctor,

544
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,000
to help more people.

545
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,000
Now,

546
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,720
I might have found a better way.

547
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,400
So I want to try it.

548
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,280
Because I think if all the patients

549
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,920
all the patients,

550
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,120
we might be too busy.

551
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,720
I want to help more people

552
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,920
through this app.

553
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:40,560
Yes.

554
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,280
That's true.

555
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:45,560
But...

556
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,160
For me, this is a very important matter.

557
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:52,640
001006.

558
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,520
Okay, that's it.

559
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:03,960
I approve your resignation.

560
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,440
But remember,

561
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:06,680
Do your best.

562
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:07,920
Just do it.

563
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:09,719
Thank you, Secretary Liu.

564
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:21,760
I'll treat you

565
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,960
Order whatever you want. It's on me.

566
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,920
Good for you, Zheng.

567
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:30,040
You have to pay the bill first.

568
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,440
Aren't you afraid that I'll go bankrupt?

569
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,480
How much can you eat?

570
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:34,920
Today.

571
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,760
I have something to tell you.

572
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:38,560
At the end of this month,

573
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,480
at the end of this month.

574
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,880
I submitted my resignation today.

575
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:44,719
You quit?

576
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,239
to focus on the app? Application?

577
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:48,000
Yes.

578
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:49,920
I'm too busy.

579
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,400
I'm too tired to break time.

580
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:53,560
And I already rented an office.

581
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:54,920
When did that happen?

582
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,040
Why didn't you tell me?

583
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,200
Are you moving out of our house?

584
00:34:58,920 --> 00:34:59,680
No.

585
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:00,800
Just a few days ago.

586
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:01,480
Just now.

587
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:02,520
Okay.

588
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:03,800
Congratulations.

589
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,320
You are a member of the entrepreneur army.

590
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,240
You have a chance to pursue your dream.

591
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,000
I'm happy for you.

592
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,320
Emergency doctors

593
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,520
is on the frontline of life.

594
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,320
Your position in the future

595
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,920
is the frontline of public psychology.

596
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:16,240
Yes.

597
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,880
We have different origins, right?

598
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,680
Yuan is so sweet.

599
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,800
Let's drink.

600
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,400
Chi, eat.

601
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:31,200
Why isn't Chi talking today?

602
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,240
You look gloomy.

603
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,240
It's okay.

604
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:40,240
Chi, I have a question.

605
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,720
When I handed in my resignation letter

606
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,880
to Secretary Liu,

607
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,200
I saw your resignation letter on the table.

608
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,120
Are you quitting too?

609
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,960
The research center abroad.

610
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,720
How many times have you contacted me?

611
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,320
No.

612
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,680
When did it happen?

613
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,240
Why didn't you tell us?

614
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,280
Does Qi Tuo know?

615
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,200
I haven't sorted it out myself.

616
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,040
I'll tell you when I'm done.

617
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,960
Are you going to keep delaying?

618
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,720
Chi, let's eat if you don't want to talk.

619
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,320
I think everyone's decision

620
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,040
after careful consideration.

621
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,400
And it will get better.

622
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,200
Anyway,

623
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,480
if Chi wants to study abroad,

624
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,800
I wish Chi

625
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:29,720
in study.

626
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,400
Yuan can find someone he loves

627
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,920
in the emergency center.

628
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:33,920
Come on.

629
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,880
All right, both of you have left.

630
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:36,920
I'm the only one left.

631
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,560
The 120 small canteen will be ruined.

632
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,200
When you come back from abroad,

633
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,960
I remember the three of us still need to gather together.

634
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,120
We are always together.

635
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:44,880
Of course.

636
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:47,120
Let's drink water instead of wine.

637
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,120
Okay.

638
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:48,680
Zheng Bo.

639
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,560
Well, good luck.

640
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:52,200
Thank you, Chi.

641
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:52,520
Come on.

642
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,720
Everything will get better

643
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,120
We will. Let's eat.

644
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:01,480
Come on

645
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,480
Eat. I ordered a lot.

646
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:17,720
Master.

647
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:24,920
Master.

648
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,000
Why are you walking around?

649
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:28,680
I have something to tell you.

650
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,960
But I don't know if I should.

651
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:31,760
Then don't.

652
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,000
But I want to say

653
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,120
Let's say

654
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,400
It's a long story.

655
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,320
Then make it short.

656
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,240
Why are you so slow?

657
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,480
Zhang Chi is going abroad.

658
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,400
When did it happen?

659
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,520
Last night.

660
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:49,800
We had hotpot together. He said that.

661
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,400
Okay, I got it.

662
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,440
Okay, I'm leaving.

663
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,200
Take care of it.

664
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,280
I need to go to the toilet.

665
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:38,320
Qi Qi.

666
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,160
Well,

667
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:41,920
I asked you out to tell you something 0100.

668
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,400
I want to tell you something.

669
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,400
I'm going abroad.

670
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:47,640
How did you know?

671
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,320
When did it happen?

672
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,160
When we had a fight that day.

673
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:54,760
How long?

674
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,640
It'll take two or three years.

675
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,640
They said they liked my assignment.

676
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,280
They said they'd recruit a team for me.

677
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,280
Am I the last one to know?

678
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,920
You won't discuss this with me, right?

679
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,800
Didn't we fight that day?

680
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,720
I agreed on impulse.

681
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:18,400
You're in your thirties.

682
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,120
You made this decision on impulse?

683
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,960
If you hate the emergency center,

684
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:22,720
or us,

685
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,040
You think Cardio Surgery is the light of your life.

686
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,400
You can just say it.

687
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,880
If you tell me, I'll respect you.

688
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:29,800
I don't think so.

689
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:30,640
Stop talking to me.

690
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,160
You're so boring.

691
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,760
I asked you out just to discuss with you.

692
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,800
Are you discussing?

693
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,040
I...

694
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,840
I don't know what he's thinking.

695
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,880
I knew I was the last one to know.

696
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,360
I thought he was boring.

697
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:14,680
Scum.

698
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,280
That's not true.

699
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:21,680
I just feel wronged.

700
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,520
It's not good to be passive.

701
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,680
A country in three to two years

702
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,480
A city can change a lot.

703
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,640
let alone people.

704
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,960
Why don't you go with him?

705
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:34,760
Have you ever thought

706
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:36,760
Why should I go with him?

707
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,320
If I were in my twenties,

708
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:40,920
I might run away

709
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:41,800
when I slapped my forehead.

710
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,160
I'm over 30.

711
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,120
I'm so lucky.

712
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,480
I have a stable job and a harmonious family.

713
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,320
I've never experienced any hardships.

714
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,120
But at my age,

715
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,840
at my age.

716
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,320
I finally got a stable job.

717
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,200
I gave up and went to him.

718
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:02,280
What about me?

719
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:06,000
What are you two now?

720
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:07,680
Are you breaking up?

721
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,600
You told me before

722
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:14,120
Uncle Zhang is very devoted to Zhang Chi's mother.

723
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,600
Zhang Chi must have inherited this too.

724
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,200
Maybe

725
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:21,880
he can spend the rest of your life alone.

726
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,200
I find you post-90s

727
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,560
When you were young,

728
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:26,840
in a drama like that.

729
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:28,560
That's a lie.

730
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:29,680
It's not realistic.

731
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,560
Of course, if in real life,

732
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,520
in real life

733
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:36,440
for another person,

734
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,160
you should respect him, right?

735
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,240
There's such a person.

736
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,160
My uncle.

737
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,840
Stop talking nonsense.

738
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:48,240
But I still like Zheng Bo.

739
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,240
Silly and cute.

740
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:51,760
Who asked Zheng Bo?

741
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,800
We were talking about love.

742
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,120
I'm just saying.

743
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,160
Humans don't share the same sorrow and sorrow.

744
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:00,880
Take this.

745
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,160
I can't swallow.

746
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:16,760
Get changed.

747
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,120
I'll get changed and put on makeup for you.

748
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:18,840
It's almost time.

749
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:20,920
I don't want to go, Snow.

750
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,760
How can you not go?

751
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:23,920
We had a deal.

752
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,000
I'll be angry if you don't go.

753
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,480
I'm not going. Go by yourself.

754
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,840
How can you not go?

755
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:33,760
This is the joint exchange activity

756
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,840
with the traffic police team.

757
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,280
If you don't go,

758
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,120
it will affect our relationship with the traffic police team.

759
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:41,000
Seriously?

760
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,200
