National Radio. and Telvison. Administration.

2
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,320
Hello?

3
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,400
I'm here. I'm here.

4
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,440
Mom, your call.

5
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,000
Hello.

6
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,320
Here, here, here, here. Here, here, here.

7
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,720
Hello?

8
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,520
Dr. Qin, a car accident patient just arrived.

9
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,200
The left ventricular rupture needs surgery immediately.

10
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,200
Okay, I'll be right there.

11
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,000
Okay.

12
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,720
Chi.

13
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,280
Mom has an emergency at the hospital.

14
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,400
I have to go now.

15
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:00,880
I haven't cooked your fried rice.

16
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:02,880
It's okay.

17
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,440
Mom, go ahead.

18
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,640
I'm not hungry anyway.

19
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,880
Dad will be back soon.

20
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,640
Chi is so sensible.

21
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,400
I'll be back soon.

22
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,200
I promise you.

23
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,280
Next time,

24
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,640
I'll make you eat my fried rice.

25
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,520
Okay?

26
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,880
Stay home and wait for me.

27
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,840
Don't run around.

28
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,760
I'll be right back.

29
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,640
I'm leaving.

30
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,040
How long has it been?

31
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,120
Dr. Qin, it's been an hour and a half.

32
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:53,760
Okay.

33
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,800
Dr. Qin.

34
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,240
How about calling Dr. Liu over?

35
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,520
No need.

36
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,400
Continue.

37
00:05:57,159 --> 00:05:59,320
Suture him and send him to the ICU.

38
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,760
Check blood pressure and heart rate 24 hours a day.

39
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,160
Let me know if you need anything.

40
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:03,800
Yes.

41
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,520
Thank you for your hard work.

42
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:47,040
Do you know

43
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,280
if I were ten minutes late,

44
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,640
Chi will die.

45
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,560
Why did you leave him alone at home?

46
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,800
I don't want to leave him alone at home.

47
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,400
I said I had an emergency surgery.

48
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,240
What about you?

49
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,880
You should get off work at seven.

50
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,159
Why are you home so late?

51
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,040
The construction site in the west of the city collapsed.

52
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,920
Dozens of workers are under the cement.

53
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,400
Can I not go?

54
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,920
Yes, I'm busy too.

55
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,280
Who would have thought

56
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,400
at home?

57
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,040
Shouldn't we calm down?

58
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,120
Shu Hua.

59
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,280
I think we should discuss

60
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,120
spend more time and energy on Chi.

61
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,320
We can't go on like this.

62
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,760
We need to discuss.

63
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,760
But I can't do it now.

64
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:28,920
I can't do it.

65
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,400
I can take care of both my career and family.

66
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,280
There are so many patients in the hospital.

67
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,120
What about Chi?

68
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,360
If someone has to stay at home,

69
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,800
and contribute more to our family,

70
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,280
I think that person is you.

71
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:44,640
Why?

72
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,880
Do you think my work

73
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,280
is not as valuable as yours?

74
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,920
That's not what I meant.

75
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,040
Don't get me wrong.

76
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,240
I mean at this stage,

77
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,400
you have more time

78
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:53,920
Beihai

79
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,120
Zhang Beihai I told you not to touch me

80
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,320
No, if you have any difficulties

81
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,960
Let go of me! Don't touch me!

82
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:28,840
You bad guy

83
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,320
Don't touch me Zhang Beihai

84
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,320
What are you doing?

85
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,240
Watch out for the knife.

86
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,720
Don't touch me.

87
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,400
Put the knife down Be careful

88
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,240
Zhang Beihai I told you not to touch me

89
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,600
Dad, don't hit my mom

90
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,679
Go, Chi.

91
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,080
You...

92
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:43,960
Give me the knife.

93
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,320
Mom!

94
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:30,800
Mom.

95
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,280
Mom, I'm hungry.

96
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,280
Why are you so loud?

97
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,640
Watch your mouth!

98
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,040
Chi,

99
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,760
What do you want to tell me?

100
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,280
Can you talk to me nicely?

101
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,400
Don't speak so loudly.

102
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,920
Can you talk to me nicely?

103
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,160
What's wrong?

104
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,240
Zhang Chi, what's wrong?

105
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,640
Dr. Qin,

106
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,560
You're almost off work.

107
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,400
You should go.

108
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,920
I'll read this first.

109
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:07,920
No.

110
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,160
You've been working overtime for almost half a month.

111
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,560
Your body won't be able to take it.

112
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,680
And Zhang Chi is so small.

113
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,520
I told you I'll go back after reading this.

114
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,760
Don't you understand?

115
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:16,920
Stop bothering me.

116
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,880
It's okay.

117
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,320
Mom.

118
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,400
You're hurt.

119
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,240
Chi, look who's here.

120
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,600
Why are you still standing there?

121
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,360
Aren't you in the hospital?

122
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,560
Why did you come out?

123
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,080
I'm in the hospital.

124
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,680
But I have to be discharged.

125
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,560
I listened to you and my master.

126
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,600
for 50 days.

127
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,520
50 days.

128
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,440
Yes, 50 days.

129
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,160
I'll treat you to dinner tonight.

130
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,840
I'm not going. You guys go.

131
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,520
No, don't refuse.

132
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,040
First, to celebrate my discharge.

133
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,000
Second, thank you for

134
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:35,840
for bringing me a car.

135
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,840
You raised my team members

136
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,080
all chubby, right?

137
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,160
I should thank you.

138
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,040
I don't want to eat. Go ahead.

139
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,920
Let's go.

140
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,040
I don't want to eat.

141
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:47,680
Let's celebrate.

142
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,160
I don't want to go, you guys.

143
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,560
the days we spent together.

144
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,280
Let's drink some young wine.

145
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,080
Why are you drinking?

146
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:55,640
This tofu

147
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,280
Don't eat this. It's too greasy.

148
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,080
Zheng Bo, what do you think?

149
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,360
He just left the hospital.

150
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,520
Why did you choose this place?

151
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,360
I thought this is our base.

152
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,880
Have some water.

153
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,760
Listen, you just got discharged.

154
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,600
First, you need to rest well.

155
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,880
You have to sleep early and get up late.

156
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,400
Second, pay attention to light diet.

157
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,080
Yes.

158
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,880
You can't eat such greasy food.

159
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:16,320
Yes.

160
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,800
Also, keep yourself warm.

161
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,520
Yes, keep warm.

162
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,320
Because the blood supply is not enough.

163
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,520
My hands and feet are cold.

164
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,360
The doctor has told me many times.

165
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,600
You've said it more than once.

166
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,080
I know.

167
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,600
You're getting impatient.

168
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,680
Okay, I'm hanging up.

169
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:28,760
No.

170
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,600
I'm going to the bathroom.

171
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,840
Are you angry?

172
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,360
You should listen to Chi.

173
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,320
Don't worry. I'll listen to him.

174
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,680
Don't eat.

175
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,320
Think about how to understand Zhang Chi.

176
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,520
I don’t know.

177
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,440
I've been working on apps lately. It's so tiring.

178
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,840
But Uncle Zhang supports us.

179
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,120
Right, in front of Zhang Chi,

180
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,600
Don't mention Uncle Zhang.

181
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,000
I...

182
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,160
I'm not stupid.

183
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,920
Anyway,

184
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,160
with Uncle Zhang,

185
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,440
I think he's quite nice.

186
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,080
He always talks about Zhang Chi.

187
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,080
Really?

188
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,000
Yes.

189
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,480
He cares about Chi,

190
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,200
but he doesn't want Chi to know.

191
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,840
I think it's quite strange.

192
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,640
Enough, stop drinking.

193
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,840
You can't drink too much.

194
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,920
We're celebrating your discharge.

195
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,880
I can't stay in the hospital anymore.

196
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,040
I'll wait here and talk to you.

197
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,560
I know you're having a hard time.

198
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,000
If there's anything I can do,

199
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,440
you can tell me.

200
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,120
If you don't want me to do anything,

201
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,400
I won't do anything.

202
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:22,560
Chi.

203
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,320
I heard

204
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,160
you've been doing a good job lately.

205
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:29,840
What?

206
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,080
Do you have any difficulties?

207
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:34,680
Liu,

208
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,120
I'm not here to talk about work.

209
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,000
but about my mom.

210
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,080
I always thought

211
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,680
it was an accident.

212
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,320
I heard recently that

213
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,600
the traffic police said my mom committed suicide.

214
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,760
She hit the car on purpose.

215
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,320
You know about this, right?

216
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,800
I've heard of it.

217
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,040
but I'm not sure.

218
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,360
what happened to her

219
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,079
What happened to her?

220
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:05,560
that made her go to a dead end?

221
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,040
I told you.

222
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,359
I'm not sure.

223
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:12,920
I can't tell you irresponsibly

224
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,680
based on my own imagination.

225
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,560
Liu, I was young.

226
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,240
You didn't tell me to protect me.

227
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,040
It's understandable.

228
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,280
I'm an adult now.

229
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,240
Am I qualified to know the truth?

230
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:33,800
Fine.

231
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,440
If you don't want to say it, I won't force you.

232
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,440
Let me ask you again.

233
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,880
Is my mom’s suicide related to my dad?

234
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,080
Why do you think so?

235
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,280
I've been thinking about

236
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,440
a lot of my childhood.

237
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,800
I remember

238
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,520
before my mom passed away,

239
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,040
before she passed away.

240
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,600
and fought with my dad.

241
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,440
Is there something wrong with their relationship?

242
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,120
There was some gossip.

243
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,840
But I trust your father's character.

244
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,240
And your parents

245
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,360
are very close.

246
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,400
Don't think too much.

247
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,360
What gossip?

248
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,680
Some rumors say

249
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,360
that your father had an affair.

250
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,280
with a patient's family.

251
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,120
But those are groundless.

252
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,320
without any evidence.

253
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:22,520
How can you believe it?

254
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:22,880
How can I believe it?

255
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,000
Anyway, I think your dad is an honest man.

256
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,160
He's not that kind of person.

257
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,080
And your mom

258
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,680
trusted your father very much.

259
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,640
As for other things,

260
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,640
about other things.

261
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,880
His mother, his father,

262
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,440
His family.

263
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,400
His father had an affair.

264
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,000
That's right.

265
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,040
Have you heard?

266
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:43,560
Yang Lin fought with me.

267
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:50,480
So he was banished to Tongzhou.

268
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,680
Dr Zhang.

269
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,760
You're in a good mood.

270
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,160
I'm old now.

271
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,480
Of course I have to be calm.

272
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,160
Your community lecture

273
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,600
When will the class start?

274
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,760
I'll ask my granddaughter to join us.

275
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,480
Sure.

276
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,240
5 p.m. on Saturday.

277
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:09,640
Okay.

278
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,800
See you on Saturday.

279
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,240
See you on Saturday.

280
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,440
Take care.

281
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:25,840
Zhigang.

282
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,120
I was thinking of calling you later.

283
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,680
Saturday?

284
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,320
Don't forget.

285
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,280
Zhang.

286
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,640
Chi.

287
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:37,920
He came to see me just now.

288
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,040
He kept asking me

289
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,360
the cause of Mr. Qin's death.

290
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:44,600
Then...

291
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,000
What did you say?

292
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,440
I just followed our plan.

293
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,240
I said I don't know.

294
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,720
Okay, I got it.

295
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,400
I think

296
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,840
you should tell Chi the truth.

297
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,960
Because if he wants to investigate it seriously,

298
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,720
there will always be traces.

299
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,040
Instead of letting others tell him the truth,

300
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,840
than tell him the truth.

301
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:09,720
Let me think about it.

302
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:06,680
Success.

303
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,160
Hello

304
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,680
Next, Zhang Beihai

305
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,520
Hello, boss

306
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,640
Not bad, young man.

307
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,960
You're quite confident.

308
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:33,680
Sit

309
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:36,800
Comrade Zhang Beihai

310
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,160
Please tell us

311
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,680
What are you good at

312
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,080
what's your specialty?

313
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,840
Madam, I went to the countryside after I graduated from middle school.

314
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,000
I didn't study.

315
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,520
But the medical books I read

316
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,880
I can handle

317
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,760
I can handle any injuries.

318
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,280
And then?

319
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,880
the countryside recruited me to the bathroom.

320
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,160
and sent me to a security school.

321
00:22:59,080 --> 00:22:59,600
Also,

322
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,880
I grew up in Inner Mongolia.

323
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:02,960
Eat beef and lamb.

324
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,200
So men who are ten kilograms stronger than me

325
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,280
are not as strong as me.

326
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,600
All right.

327
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,960
We know your physical condition.

328
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,920
Your hairstyle is quite stiff.

329
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:15,920
I'm here for an interview.

330
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,920
Madam, I made the hair specially.

331
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,440
I want to face the leader

332
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,760
with a good mindset.

333
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,440
If I pass the interview today,

334
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,360
in the future,

335
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,640
I'll do this hairstyle.

336
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:27,800
receive patients.

337
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:29,840
Spirit.

338
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,520
This big car

339
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,520
Great!

340
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:03,680
So big.

341
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,160
Sure.

342
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:16,040
We'll drive this car out from now on.

343
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:16,880
to save the patients.

344
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:18,600
This is great.

345
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:19,520
Not bad

346
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:22,880
Zhang Beihai

347
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:24,680
Zhang Beihai

348
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,960
I don't know what kind of taste

349
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,440
to make you an exception.

350
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,880
You're mistaken.

351
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,080
You broke the rules.

352
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,880
This is the only car in the station.

353
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:36,720
Whose car is it?

354
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,440
Mine.

355
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,600
I hope you can match this car.

356
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,320
Sun Yitouch.

357
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,240
Do you know

358
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,960
in Chinese medicine?

359
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,320
The doctor touched it

360
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,880
when he touched it.

361
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,880
Change your name into "Touch".

362
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,800
This name is bluffing.

363
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,600
The ink of ink.

364
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,400
You're uneducated.

365
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,040
Old Gu, here.

366
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,320
Look at this car.

367
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:10,520
It's nice.

368
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,400
Not bad.

369
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,880
We have a meeting today

370
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,360
to discuss

371
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,160
how to respond to the Party's call.

372
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,160
This is a new policy.

373
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,640
to build a basic organization

374
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,920
that the people need.

375
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,320
Please say something.

376
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,240
Director,

377
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,920
When the ambulance got out,

378
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,000
is like a broken kite.

379
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,440
You are so anxious here.

380
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,440
We lost contact with you.

381
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,960
We can only assign another mission after we come back.

382
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,000
It doesn't show the urgency of emergency

383
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,960
What do you think about Beihai

384
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,480
I think there must be a call in the car

385
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,640
After this mission,

386
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,640
I'll go straight to the next mission.

387
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,240
It's so fast, isn't it?

388
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,320
Call on the way

389
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,000
I want to watch TV on the way.

390
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,960
Isn't this just fantasy?

391
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:12,120
We're heroes of an uneducated level.

392
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,800
We must learn to fight under any conditions.

393
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,800
Dong Zi, we're having a meeting here. Be quiet.

394
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,120
I'll see you on my earphones.

395
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,200
Dong Zi, turn up the volume

396
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,840
Zhang Beihai, are you making trouble on purpose?

397
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,400
Beihai what's wrong

398
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:35,840
I have an idea

399
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,080
Director, please write me a letter of introduction tomorrow.

400
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,000
I'll go to the post office.

401
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,760
Be careful.

402
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,320
Watch your feet, Gu.

403
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:41,920
Here

404
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,280
Director, Zhang Beihai likes to play tricks

405
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,080
Can he do this?

406
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,640
Watch your hands. Be careful. Okay.

407
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,200
Hai, you're really something.

408
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,760
You got everyone here.

409
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,320
He's a bit cunning.

410
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,560
Maybe he can try

411
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,000
Beihai, how is it?

412
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:24,360
Hai

413
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,120
This is the radio station.

414
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,640
Ultra Short Radio.

415
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,000
With this,

416
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,400
we can really answer the phone in the car.

417
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:31,640
Today,

418
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,400
let me show you.

419
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,200
Ms. Zhou.

420
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:44,200
Can you hear me? Can you hear me?

421
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,000
Beihai Beihai

422
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,400
I can hear you, really

423
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,360
Can you hear my voice?

424
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:57,920
I can hear you.

425
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:00,120
Ms. Zhou, I can hear you too.

426
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,840
It's like talking face to face.

427
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,840
Ms. Zhou, just tell me if you need anything.

428
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,320
Old Gu, I'll go down and take a look.

429
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:36,760
Okay.

430
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,200
Did you fall badly?

431
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,760
Where does it hurt?

432
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,680
What's wrong?

433
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,240
Doctor.

434
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,680
This girl fell down by bike.

435
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,680
She fell badly.

436
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,880
Take a look.

437
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,320
Comrade, where did you fall?

438
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,680
My left arm can't move.

439
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:58,960
Hang in there.

440
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:00,840
Does it hurt here?

441
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,040
Does it hurt here?

442
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:04,520
Yes.

443
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,480
I think he broke his left arm.

444
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,480
Is there a clipper in the car?

445
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,400
That's all we have for daily life.

446
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,480
Where is the clipper?

447
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,120
Old neighbors, can you help me

448
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,320
to see if there are any hard papers

449
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,400
or magazines.

450
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,960
Got it.

451
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,040
Thank you.

452
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:24,680
Thank you.

453
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,480
Didn't I give you the paper board yesterday?

454
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,320
Yes, I'll get it.

455
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:36,400
Sir,

456
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:37,880
Sell me two magazines.

457
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:38,960
You can have them.

458
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:39,840
There are so many good people. Thank you.

459
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,240
It's okay.

460
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:40,840
I need to find something to fix it for you.

461
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:41,960
Thank you.

462
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,960
Raise her head.

463
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:44,880
Pull her out.

464
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:46,600
Hang in there.

465
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:48,600
Get the bandage.

466
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,040
Okay.

467
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:54,520
Hang in there.

468
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,480
A triangle.

469
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,120
Raise your hand.

470
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,320
Okay.

471
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,320
We'll take you to the bathroom.

472
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,880
I'm not going to the bathroom.

473
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,480
I want to take the exam in San Zhong High School.

474
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,400
Get up first.

475
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,480
Are you going to take the exam?

476
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:40,520
Your arm...

477
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,920
I just fixed it for you.

478
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,240
I have to take you to the restroom.

479
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:44,920
Plaster.

480
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:47,400
I'm from Bukdaeego Forest Farm.

481
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,080
The college entrance exam just started this year.

482
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,920
If I don't make it in time for today's exam,

483
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,320
I'll have to wait one more year.

484
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,520
I have to take the exam no matter what.

485
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:55,800
Okay.

486
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,040
Okay, I'll send you there.

487
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,680
Really?

488
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,200
Thank you.

489
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,360
Thank you.

490
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,200
Gu.

491
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,920
I'll send him to San Zhong High School.

492
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:19,640
Okay.

493
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,600
Hurry up.

494
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,640
Let's go.

495
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,520
Thank you.

496
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,320
Let's go

497
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,360
Thank you.

498
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,680
Don't worry.

499
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,520
We'll be there in two blocks.

500
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,200
Thank you.

501
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,400
Thanks for today.

502
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,040
What's your name?

503
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,600
Me Zhang Beihai

504
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,320
The north of the sea

505
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,360
Zhang Beihai

506
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,760
What a nice name

507
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:09,680
What about you?

508
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,480
Qin Shuhua.

509
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,360
Qin Shuhua.

510
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,680
Your name is also nice.

511
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:15,960
It feels like

512
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,360
You'll live a comfortable life.

513
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,520
Thank you

514
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,920
Zhang Beihai, do you still want to work?

515
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,200
You made trouble on the first day

516
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,120
This is a prairie.

517
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:09,880
If I let you out,

518
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,120
and you'll be gone.

519
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,640
Do you have any discipline?

520
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,360
Director,

521
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,520
I know I was wrong.

522
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,520
It's my fault.

523
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,200
I was busy helping others with the exam.

524
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,680
and violated the rules of the station.

525
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,640
I've written the self-criticism letter.

526
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,640
Look at your handwriting.

527
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,680
Go back and practice.

528
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,040
Okay.

529
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,080
You're smart.

530
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,960
You even know to write a self-criticism letter.

531
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,360
Director, I have a problem.

532
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:52,800
Go ahead.

533
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:56,640
Since ancient times,

534
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,200
we don't worry about widows but not equality.

535
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:59,960
I think in any place,

536
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,200
we should follow the rules of rewards and punishments

537
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:06,480
Zhang Beihai broke the rules in our station

538
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,480
He should be disqualified

539
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:11,880
Director Kang.

540
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:14,120
My education background is better than him.

541
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,360
I'm more suitable for driving.

542
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,920
I asked the leader to give me the car.

543
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,679
I'll do my best.

544
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:21,960
Sun Yitouch.

545
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,040
What do you mean?

546
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:27,120
We are brothers in the trench.

547
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:29,040
Are you taking advantage of me?

548
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:31,360
The ink of ink.

549
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:34,800
I think

550
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,360
Sun is right.

551
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,360
We should be fair.

552
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:40,679
That's it.

553
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:42,360
From tomorrow onwards,

554
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:43,199
Sun.

555
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:44,520
You drive the car

556
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:45,920
Zhang Beihai

557
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:48,000
You stay in the station

558
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,080
Thank you, Director.

559
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,560
I won't disgrace the station.

560
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Director, I

561
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,320
Zhang Beihai

562
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:01,880
Tell me

563
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:02,960
What are you doing?

564
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:03,440
Tell me.

565
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,080
Director! Director!

566
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,000
Come here.

567
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,440
I'll go in first.

568
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,080
The tiles are neat

569
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,720
Zhang Beihai

570
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,760
You're a professional

571
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,760
Is the sun rising from the west?

572
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,320
Or my ears are broken?

573
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,400
Can you praise me?

574
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,760
I mean you are more suitable

575
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,080
than a doctor.

576
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,400
This is you.

577
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,320
Let me tell you.

578
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,080
The leader said

579
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,560
you can make a living on your own.

580
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,960
A small asset like you

581
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,200
should be modified by labor.

582
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:18,960
Hurry up.

583
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,760
Bring me that board.

584
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:26,200
Sloth.

585
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:33,720
Brother Zhang.

586
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:37,640
Brother Zhang.

587
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:50,960
Qin.

588
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,280
Brother Zhang, it's me.

589
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,520
You're getting cuter and cuter.

590
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,960
I almost didn't recognize you.

591
00:36:59,000 --> 00:36:59,440
Here.

592
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,640
You got in.

593
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,120
the second medical school in Jiangdong.

594
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:08,880
Zhang,

595
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,160
thank you for sending me to the exam room in time.

596
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,840
Otherwise, I wouldn't have passed the exam.

597
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,320
You're too polite.

598
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,200
It's my duty.

599
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,520
That's because you can do it yourself.

600
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,440
You're promising.

601
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,200
Here.

602
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:21,400
Thank you.

603
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,400
Congratulations.

604
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:25,760
Yimo.

605
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:29,880
Have some water.

606
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:30,840
Okay.

607
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:34,960
Here.

608
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Have some dates.

609
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,160
Thank you, Zhang.

610
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:38,960
Add some water.

611
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:39,840
Thank you.

612
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,520
I poured some for her.

613
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:41,840
I'll pour you some.

614
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:42,640
That's enough.

615
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:43,640
Well...

616
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,280
I realized

617
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,960
he was the one who sent you to the exam room.

618
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:48,960
That's me.

619
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:49,880
Qin, you know what?

620
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,280
Because I sent you to the exam room

621
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:54,200
and gave him the car.

622
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,320
Don't listen to him.

623
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:56,520
It's not like that.

624
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:58,720
Shu Hua.

625
00:37:58,880 --> 00:37:59,720
Have some dates.

626
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:00,760
Thank you

627
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,520
This is big.

628
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:02,640
This is bigger.

629
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,080
Yimo.

630
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,640
I heard from auntie that you work at the emergency station.

631
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,560
I didn't expect

632
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,400
you and Zhang are colleagues.

633
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:12,760
What a coincidence.

634
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,400
Qin, do you know his mother?

635
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,960
Shu Hua and I have been neighbors for more than ten years.

636
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,280
You watched Qin grow up.

637
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,080
She should call you uncle

638
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,880
Zhang Beihai, are you messing around?

639
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,880
I'm only five years older than Shu Hua

640
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:29,720
We were

641
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:32,080
childhood sweethearts.

642
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:35,440
Ms. Zhou.

643
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,320
Who do you think is more suitable for Miss Qin?

644
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,640
Of course.

645
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,400
It must be Yimo.

646
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,000
Both of them are talented students.

647
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,520
They speak the same language.

648
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,080
I don't think so.

649
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,160
I learned from Beihai.

650
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,960
Being with these two talented students

651
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,520
with these two talented students.

652
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,640
Just wait and see.

653
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,880
Yimo, thank you for

654
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,440
for your guidance on my studies.

655
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,280
You sent me a lot of review materials.

656
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,640
Otherwise, I wouldn't have passed the exam so easily.

657
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,880
A good teacher is important,

658
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,880
but good students are the key to victory.

659
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,960
You have talent.

660
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:10,880
and you can suffer.

661
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:14,520
The point is we both have the same dream and goal.

662
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:17,200
That is to study medicine.

663
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:18,560
and become a real doctor.

664
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:20,960
Yes.

665
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:24,200
Please give me more guidance in the future.

666
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,640
Let's learn from each other.

667
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,520
Yimo, Yimo.

668
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,440
Where is your precious information?

669
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,400
Lend it to me.

670
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:36,960
What did you say?

671
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,280
Baby information

672
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:55,760
Beihai

673
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,160
Why are you still here?

674
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:58,960
Just a little more.

675
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,400
Here, take the key.

676
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,280
Don't forget to lock the door when you leave.

677
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,280
Okay, don't worry.

678
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:49,080
Hello.

679
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:50,880
[This is Jiang Dong Emergency Station.] Hello.

680
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:51,880
Hello.

681
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:52,520
Where are you?

682
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,600
A patient from the orthopedic department of the sixth hospital has been transferred to Zheng Shibang.

683
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,520
Okay, I'll drive here right away.

684
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,080
Fellow.

685
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,520
What are you looking for at this hour?

686
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,640
This female doctor...

687
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:33,760
It's all my fault.

688
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,160
The car fell over.

689
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,400
She rolled down the slope.

690
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:38,640
I want to save her.

691
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,520
But the bottom is too deep.

692
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,320
It's been a while.

693
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,160
Be careful.

694
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,840
This is very deep.

695
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:12,760
Comrade.

696
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,320
Why are you here?

697
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:28,360
Zhang...

698
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:31,800
Brother Zhang.

699
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,720
Don't move.

700
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:35,480
Brother Zhang.

701
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,720
Do you feel any pain?

702
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,360
My body hurts.

703
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:41,040
Your hand.

704
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:46,800
Like this.

705
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,280
I'll help you up slowly.

706
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:49,040
Take it easy.

707
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:51,160
Come on.

708
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:52,600
One, two, three.

709
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:55,720
Slow down.

710
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:57,280
