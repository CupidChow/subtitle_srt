There's one more.

A major car accident.

Can you hear me?

47
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,240
What's wrong?

48
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,159
Here.

49
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,680
Does it hurt too?

50
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,320
Does it hurt?

51
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,000
Wait a minute.

52
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,800
It looks bad.

53
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,400
Take care of her.

54
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,360
Prepare for trauma.

55
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,040
How is it?

56
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,200
His pupils are scattered. He's barely breathing.

57
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,240
He's dying or dead.

58
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,960
It's okay. I'm here.

59
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,920
The glass might have pierced the aorta.

60
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:40,440
You'll bleed a lot if you pull it out.

61
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,560
I'll bandage it for you.

62
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,400
Take him to the hospital.

63
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,480
Hang in there.

64
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,800
Are you a man?

65
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:49,760
Doctor.

66
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,640
There's a granny here.

67
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,320
under the car.

68
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:51,880
You two carry it.

69
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:52,640
Come here.

70
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:01,800
Doctor!

71
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,240
A pregnant woman is about to give birth.

72
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,160
Come and take a look.

73
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:04,960
We don't dare to move her.

74
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:05,840
The front, right?

75
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:06,840
Yes, the front.

76
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,640
Excuse me.

77
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,320
Okay.

78
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,280
Qi Tuo

79
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,280
It’s OK.

80
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,360
Captain, I’ve tried.

81
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,640
Ball-shaped air mat can’t be used.

82
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,720
The car will lose balance.

83
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,360
Yuan Yuan

84
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,920
Open the vein.

85
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,600
Madam Bao, don't be afraid. I'm coming.

86
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,760
Auntie, hang in there.

87
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,240
The firefighters are trying to find a way.

88
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,520
Let me

89
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,000
your head first.

90
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,720
Sir.

91
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,480
Comrades of fire

92
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,320
Coming.

93
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,840
We have to move this lady

94
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,160
from the bottom of the car.

95
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,560
Yes, we've prepared

96
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,640
Ball air cushion.

97
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,720
Use it now.

98
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,200
But now there's a problem.

99
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,080
If we use a balloon air cushion,

100
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,000
this car may not be balanced.

101
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,520
Isn't there a crane here?

102
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,920
If you hang the head with the crane,

103
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,440
Then the car won't fall down.

104
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,160
Yes, we can hang the head of the car.

105
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,200
The car is balanced.

106
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,280
But the people inside

107
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,560
will fall into the water

108
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,240
people inside will fall into the water.

109
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,160
Zhang Chi.

110
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,080
Zhang Chi.

111
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,640
Zhang Chi, don't hesitate.

112
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,760
I can hold it.

113
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:37,760
Hold tight.

114
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,360
Okay.

115
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,200
Zhiqiang, activate the air cushion.

116
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:40,960
Coming.

117
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,760
Don't be afraid.

118
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,560
I'm here.

119
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,400
Fire comrade.

120
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,840
Madam Bao's water is broken.

121
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,560
I can't go out.

122
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,080
I have to deliver the baby in the car.

123
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,280
Qiu-yi.

124
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,960
Ask Huang to bring the bag.

125
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:00,680
Hurry up.

126
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:05,600
Come on.

127
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,480
It's okay.

128
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,880
The water is broken

129
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,240
Come and listen to me.

130
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,320
Now use all your strength

131
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,320
Move to the left.

132
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,520
Move to your left.

133
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,120
Okay?

134
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,320
Slow down.

135
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,200
Okay, it's okay.

136
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,560
Left. Okay.

137
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,520
Relax.

138
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,680
It's okay.

139
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:21,880
Come on.

140
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,640
Hurry up.

141
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,440
Get out of here.

142
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,800
Be careful.

143
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,040
Aunt, don't worry.

144
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,320
You'll be out soon.

145
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,440
Here's a stretcher.

146
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,480
Coming

147
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,400
Master

148
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:39,440
Shake your arm.

149
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,480
Shake your arm to the left.

150
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,080
Madam Bao, listen to me.

151
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,760
You're already broken.

152
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:46,640
But it's okay.

153
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,360
We have to

154
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,760
to pick up the baby, okay?

155
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,640
Okay, here.

156
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,400
Raise.

157
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,240
Don't move.

158
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,400
Watch out!

159
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:57,760
Qi Tuo

160
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:58,840
The car is moving.

161
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,080
Be careful.

162
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,720
It's okay. Just do it.

163
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,360
It's okay.

164
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,560
Cheer up.

165
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:11,880
Master

166
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,000
Higher.

167
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,160
It's okay.

168
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,240
Zhang Chi, it's okay.

169
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,360
We're fine.

170
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,160
Come on.

171
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,040
Now

172
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,200
Is the palace shrinking

173
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,040
Get ready.

174
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,360
One, two, slow down.

175
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:42,960
OK. Harder.

176
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,320
Three, two, one, push.

177
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,680
Harder.

178
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,360
Okay, keep it. Relax.

179
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,320
Relax.

180
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,640
It's okay

181
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,280
My heart is beating.

182
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,200
The chest is stopping.

183
00:09:59,200 --> 00:09:59,880
Hurry up.

184
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,080
CPR. CPR.

185
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,440
Okay, breathe in.

186
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,760
Inhale.

187
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,720
OK. Come on.

188
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,440
Three, two, one. Harder.

189
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,720
Harder.

190
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,480
26 27 28 29 30

191
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:54,880
Got it.

192
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,360
Girl

193
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,000
So pretty.

194
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,320
Here.

195
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,640
Slowly slowly

196
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:30,960
Hold your waist.

197
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,480
Hold your waist. Okay.

198
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,520
Be careful.

199
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,760
Hold your waist.

200
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,280
Okay.

201
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,520
Good job.

202
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,040
Morning, everyone.

203
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,400
Zheng Bo.

204
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,320
Breakfast.

205
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,200
Thanks.

206
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:00,800
Here.

207
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,160
Where's mine?

208
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,680
Chen.

209
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,000
This is so unfair.

210
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,440
You feed your car team every day.

211
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,080
Forget it.

212
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,640
but you're still here for food.

213
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,480
Don't call me Chen.

214
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,520
You call me old.

215
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,440
What's wrong with you guys?

216
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,360
Don't you have a girlfriend?

217
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,320
your girlfriend's breakfast?

218
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,320
Didn't we fight these two days?

219
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,280
Besides, I got up late this morning.

220
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,840
We’re all eating.

221
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,080
Is there anything delicious, Seung-won?

222
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,240
What's wrong?

223
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,200
Did you quarrel with your wife?

224
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,080
My wife and I

225
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,240
between me and my wife?

226
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:30,880
Last night,

227
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,200
I saw the little ancestor doing homework.

228
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,480
I can't even eat.

229
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,640
945.

230
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,520
945.

231
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,640
What did you learn?

232
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,240
I almost had a cerebral haemorrhage.

233
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:43,640
Whose family

234
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,120
to do homework with them?

235
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,920
It's always hard.

236
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,520
Don't be afraid if you're really sick.

237
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,400
We'll send 120 cars to pick you up.

238
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,240
That's right.

239
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,480
Thank you.

240
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,520
Read me out.

241
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,040
What kind of work schedule is this?

242
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,960
Zheng Bo is on day shift, so am I.

243
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,240
Why did you separate us?

244
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,960
Chen, it's too obvious.

245
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,520
This is a trap for Zheng Bo.

246
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,560
to jump in.

247
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,880
Xu Chengyuan, you can't speak.

248
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:10,640
Don't talk.

249
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,360
Dr Zhang.

250
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,480
Why are you here?

251
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,440
I know him.

252
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,760
Who is he? He's a guru.

253
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,360
Last year,

254
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,240
I met him

255
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,480
in the North Emergency Department.

256
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,000
Cardio Surgery focuses on training.

257
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,760
The youngest knife.

258
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:29,880
Very powerful.

259
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,160
You have a bright future.

260
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,040
Why is he here?

261
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,920
He must have done something wrong at the Cardio Surgery.

262
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,680
Don't talk nonsense.

263
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,240
Director.

264
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,640
What are you waiting for? Come in.

265
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,440
Have you all seen it?

266
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:46,920
Zhang.

267
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,480
Please introduce yourself.

268
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,080
Hello, I'm Zhang Chi.

269
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,360
the new emergency doctor.

270
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,320
Welcome.

271
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,320
Welcome.

272
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:58,640
Director,

273
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,480
Didn't we

274
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,840
two newbies before?

275
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,440
One from Nanfang Medical University.

276
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,680
and the seventh hospital.

277
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,480
Those two were refunded.

278
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,200
They are as thin as

279
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,640
He can't do our heavy work.

280
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,320
But this one

281
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,160
doesn't look like a big horse

282
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,400
Be serious.

283
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,760
Dr. Zhang

284
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,720
is a doctor from Beijing Cardio Surgery Department.

285
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,920
He's a PhD in cooperation, you know?

286
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:20,920
Awesome.

287
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,040
A top student.

288
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:22,800
A big shot.

289
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,400
Then why did you come to our emergency center?

290
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,080
That's right.

291
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,480
The talent that Secretary Liu hired

292
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,240
Director.

293
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,680
It's me.

294
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,120
I volunteered to come.

295
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,760
Who's in his team?

296
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,960
If he really

297
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,960
he has a bright future,

298
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,120
This is just a transition.

299
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,600
Who wants to make wedding clothes for others?

300
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,480
Who knows?

301
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,800
Why aren't you talking?

302
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,240
Let me tell you.

303
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,840
If anyone takes him,

304
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,880
it'll be a big bargain.

305
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,760
Got it?

306
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,119
Gao.

307
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,400
Don't bother.

308
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,560
I brought a newcomer last month.

309
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,599
You know that.

310
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:10,760
The bonus for the second half of the year

311
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,040
in the second half of the year.

312
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,480
Where's Chen Xue?

313
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,240
Director, don't count on me.

314
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,079
It's...

315
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,359
There are many patients and doctors.

316
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,520
I work overtime every day.

317
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,839
I'm busy every day.

318
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:22,560
I'm single.

319
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,920
I don't have time to date.

320
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,119
You two...

321
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:26,920
I... Director, I...

322
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,119
Forget it.

323
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:29,520
You're not qualified yet.

324
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,520
Who else?

325
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,640
Let him join me.

326
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,520
Thank you.

327
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:35,880
You're welcome.

328
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,320
Do your work first.

329
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,160
Or I'll kick you out

330
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,360
or I'll kick you out.

331
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,360
Sister Qi will take him. It'll be lively.

332
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,640
Great.

333
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,920
Sit there.

334
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,440
Come to my office if you need anything.

335
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,640
Okay, thank you, Director.

336
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,440
Hurry up, get out.

337
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,400
Get out! Hurry!

338
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,600
Copy that. Hurry up.

339
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:08,880
What are you waiting for?

340
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,800
Let's go. Let's go.

341
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,200
Hurry up.

342
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,320
Hello, Jiangdong City 120.

343
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,000
Do you need a car?

344
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,080
Where was the accident?

345
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,880
How is the patient?

346
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:27,760
Okay.

347
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,160
We'll send a car right away.

348
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,800
Please keep the phone open.

349
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,040
Emergency is not like cardiac surgery.

350
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,600
Have you been trained?

351
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,200
0108 Car Team.

352
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,200
On the road of Ping Village,

353
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,040
a man fainted after getting drunk.

354
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:47,960
Hurry up.

355
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:48,680
Zheng Bo's team received.

356
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,520
Hurry up. Coming.

357
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,120
0127 Choi Woo-myung's car team.

358
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,680
There's a boy who has a heart attack at Kugu Elementary School.

359
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,720
Please go now.

360
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,600
Hurry up.

361
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:57,640
Got it.

362
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,640
Where should I sit?

363
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,720
Sit on the top of the car.

364
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:00,800
Where are you going? Get in.

365
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,000
Where can I sit?

366
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,560
0106 Train Team.

367
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,960
Unit 101, Building 2, Fuchun Community.

368
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,560
The old man said he had a high fever and chest tightness.

369
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,600
Let's go. Okay.

370
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,200
Copy that.

371
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:24,200
Jiang Dong is in a hurry.

372
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,040
Fasten your seat belt and fly out.

373
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,000
I always sat there when I was an intern.

374
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,040
I'm not used to it.

375
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,880
Why don't you sit here? It's spacious.

376
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:45,640
Jiangdong emergency.

377
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:46,480
Jiangdong EMSS.

378
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,280
Let me talk about the next patient.

379
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,080
Male, 69 years old.

380
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,640
chest tightness and shortness of breath.

381
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,080
I feel uncomfortable in my heart.

382
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,160
I feel nauseous.

383
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,320
Dr Qi.

384
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,320
I think the patient's symptoms

385
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,240
It seems to be a cardiovascular vessel.

386
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,120
When you go to the scene,

387
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:01,960
Listen.

388
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,560
You'll be diagnosed.

389
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,240
Don't you get it?

390
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,160
Let me repeat.

391
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,240
Cha Myung, as the driver of this car,

392
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,600
no matter what happens,

393
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,040
no matter what happens.

394
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,080
so that we can send the patient

395
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,880
after the rescue.

396
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:17,680
Huang Hao.

397
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,320
As the driver in charge of operating the patient,

398
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,920
to assist me with CPR.

399
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,440
As a nurse,

400
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:23,720
08401

401
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,720
We need supplements.

402
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,640
Check the medicine.

403
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,600
and help me save the patient.

404
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:27,280
[And you, 401,]

405
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,160
As your first day at work,

406
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,480
you just need to do one thing.

407
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,880
Just listen to me.

408
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,600
Do as I say, understand?

409
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:34,760
Yes.

410
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,080
I know you're in Cardio Surgery.

411
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,160
It can cure your heart.

412
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,360
But this is a hospital, not a cardiac surgery.

413
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,520
Face reality and understand the situation.

414
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,720
Only when we cooperate,

415
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,480
we can save people more efficiently.

416
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:04,800
Which one?

417
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,680
Is it this one?

418
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:06,880
The door is open.

419
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,240
Is this the place?

420
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,240
Is there a patient?

421
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,960
Is this Mr. Lin's house?

422
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:12,640
Here.

423
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,160
Sir.

424
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,960
Sir, we're from 120.

425
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,160
What's wrong?

426
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,000
Zhang Chi, listen to the heart.

427
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,320
ECG, Qiu.

428
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,560
Look at this equipment. It's for cardiac surgery.

429
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:27,720
It's classy.

430
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,760
It's classy.

431
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,560
What's wrong?

432
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,800
Can you hear me?

433
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,720
Can you hear me?

434
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,800
I'll give you a check-up right away.

435
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:39,920
Bring it up.

436
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,520
His heart and lungs are fine.

437
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:47,760
The lungs are fine.

438
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,240
I'm fine.

439
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,160
Take your temperature.

440
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,040
Blood sugar and blood pressure.

441
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,360
36.4.

442
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,800
Did you catch a cold recently?

443
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,840
I can't talk.

444
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,080
It's okay.

445
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,920
Check your blood sugar, sir.

446
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,040
It hurts a little.

447
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,480
Give me your hand.

448
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,360
His blood sugar is a little low.

449
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:10,720
How much?

450
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,520
4.5.

451
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,240
I wouldn't have fainted like this.

452
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,080
Sir.

453
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:16,720
Sir.

454
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,760
Your indicators are normal.

455
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,080
It's nothing serious.

456
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,640
Huang, give me the ECG.

457
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,240
The electrocardiogram is fine.

458
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,120
His blood pressure is normal.

459
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,040
11380.

460
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,440
That can't be.

461
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,440
050350.

462
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,360
It's so hot.

463
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,160
I won't turn on the air conditioner or open the window.

464
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,720
Are you having a sauna?

465
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:44,440
No.

466
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,640
You three are here for a meeting.

467
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,160
Take me to the hospital.

468
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:49,960
Sir.

469
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,400
Your room is too stuffy.

470
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,680
Let me open the window for you.

471
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,280
Don't move.

472
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,040
I won't open the window.

473
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,840
I won't turn on the air conditioner either.

474
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,080
I need to go to the hospital.

475
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,200
I'm not feeling well.

476
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,040
I feel cold all over.

477
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Sir, the takeout...

478
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,480
You didn't eat even if I called.

479
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,600
Is it because you didn't eat

480
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,200
because you didn't eat?

481
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,400
I want to eat freshly cooked.

482
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,480
Braised liver.

483
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,840
My son

484
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,440
always makes me food delivery.

485
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,000
I don't want to eat.

486
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,760
Enough.

487
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,040
Don't waste my time.

488
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,200
Hurry up and send me to the hospital.

489
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:29,640
Sir, 00840.

490
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,040
Sir.

491
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,720
You need a family to go to the hospital.

492
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,720
Are you alone?

493
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,720
Do you have a family?

494
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:34,760
I have a son.

495
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,680
Can you call your son?

496
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:37,880
I'll make a call.

497
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,920
Okay, you look healthy.

498
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,560
I'll use your phone.

499
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,360
Sure.

500
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,320
You remember the number, right?

501
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:54,000
Come on, press it.

502
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,080
Okay.

503
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,240
Hello.

504
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,840
Are you Lin Guangwen's son?

505
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,520
I am.

506
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,800
Your father just fainted.

507
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,880
We're from 120.

508
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,440
He wants to be sent to the hospital.

509
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,640
We need to inform his family.

510
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,560
Can you come over now?

511
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,560
Why is it 120 again?

512
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,240
Leave him alone.

513
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,240
He's not...

514
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,080
He's old.

515
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,880
You should come if you can.

516
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:23,960
Sister.

517
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,600
I'm working.

518
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,200
I can't go after work.

519
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,760
This house is in the suburbs.

520
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,680
You have to take the subway three times.

521
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,280
This only takes two hours.

522
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,600
If this old man is really sick,

523
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,440
I'll accept it.

524
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,920
I called 120 a few times

525
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,400
and went over half of the city.

526
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,080
And then?

527
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,640
The doctor said he's not sick at all.

528
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,120
Isn't this torturing?

529
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,200
He can go wherever he wants.

530
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,360
I don't care. That's it.

531
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,240
Sir.

532
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,720
Your son is busy.

533
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,640
He might not be able to come.

534
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,480
So what are you going to do?

535
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,040
Are you resting at home or going to the hospital with us?

536
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:54,520
Okay.

537
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:55,920
Okay.

538
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,680
He ignores me.

539
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,320
I don't care.

540
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,600
There are many people in the hospital.

541
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,880
There are many people to chat with me.

542
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,160
Then...

543
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,080
Don't be like a wood.

544
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,080
0 is poking there.

545
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,400
Didn't you say I have low blood sugar?

546
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,000
Give me an injection.

547
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,000
Here, open the vein.

548
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,480
Wait, Zhang Chi Kai.

549
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,760
Hurry up.

550
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,880
Sorry, sir.

551
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,080
This is not acupuncture.

552
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,840
You're putting shoes under your shoes.

553
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,560
Sorry.

554
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,680
Get up.

555
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,600
One more shot.

556
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:02,960
Hold your fist.

557
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,280
Young man.

558
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,280
See?

559
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,800
This is a real master.

560
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,280
You should practice.

561
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,440
I'm laughing at you.

562
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,400
Young man,

563
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,960
Let me ask you a question.

564
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,280
Which hospital

565
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,720
to our home?

566
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,360
You don't even know that?

567
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,520
Sir.

568
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:39,680
The closest to your house is Anyang Hospital.

569
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,240
The closest to your house is Anyang Hospital.

570
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,320
There's no emergency at Anyang Hospital.

571
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,960
Can I take you to the Northern Hospital?

572
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:44,920
Bring me a stretcher.

573
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,200
Young man,

574
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,160
You're not young anymore.

575
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,000
Why are you still an intern?

576
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,960
You didn't pass the exam, did you?

577
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,320
Don't ask. That must be it.

578
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:55,600
Hurry up, Huang.

579
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,000
Hurry up.

580
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:57,720
Coming.

581
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,640
Go pack your things.

582
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,600
Be careful.

583
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,680
My old man

584
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,440
can't stand you guys doing this.

585
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,000
Young man, are you a stretcher?

586
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,720
Yes, I am.

587
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,560
Young man.

588
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,360
You look professional.

589
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,400
Look at him.

590
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,680
Don't stand here. Get in the car.

591
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,280
Zhang Chi, what are you doing?

592
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,680
Bride, get off.

593
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,240
Wait a minute.

594
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,360
What's going on?

595
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,240
Dr Zhang.

596
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,160
Why are you here?

597
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,280
Hello, Dr. Xiao.

598
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:10,880
I'm in 120 now.

599
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,880
What kind of doctor is he?

600
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,360
He's just an intern.

601
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,200
Mr. Lin, it’s you again.

602
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,480
Didn't 120

603
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,160
last night?

604
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,120
You came yesterday too.

605
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,640
Yes, you said you were not sick.

606
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,880
Why do you keep coming to the hospital?

607
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,280
Sir, seriously.

608
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,320
I'm just...

609
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,880
I feel a little cold now.

610
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,640
I feel uncomfortable everywhere

611
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,600
Push it

612
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,480
It's a little cold.

613
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,360
Let's go.

614
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,040
It's okay, sir.

615
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,360
Let's go and learn how to turn over the class.

616
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,440
Let me check it for you.

617
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,240
Be careful.

618
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,440
Sir.

619
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,120
Lower your voice. I'm not deaf.

620
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,760
Your hair

621
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,640
is so thick.

622
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,120
What do you usually use to wash your hair?

623
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,440
I have a secret recipe.

624
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,280
Perfume root.

625
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,640
Did you

626
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,760
cut your beard yourself?

627
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,800
Of course.

628
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,640
It's cool like a brush.

629
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,840
Look, it's pointy.

630
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,000
Mr. Lin,

631
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,080
Your results are out.

632
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,440
Take a look.

633
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,240
It's exactly the same as yesterday's.

634
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,080
But his blood sugar is a little low.

635
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,280
That's why you got glucose.

636
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,320
No problem.

637
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,320
I'm fine.

638
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,360
Mr. Lin, I really can't trust you.

639
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,360
After you finish this bottle of glucose,

640
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,120
after you finish this bottle of glucose, okay?

641
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,080
We'll go home when everything's fine.

642
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:32,680
Okay?

643
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:35,600
I don't care.

644
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,800
I want to be hospitalized.

645
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:37,960
You can't just

646
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:38,960
on the street.

647
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,560
Why are you in the hospital if you're so healthy?

648
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,760
Mr. Lin.

649
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,800
Look at this man.

650
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:44,960
Besides,

651
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,640
in your case,

652
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:49,040
in the ER.

653
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,760
My son hates me at home.

654
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,360
When I got to the hospital, the doctor disliked me.

655
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:56,600
Do you

656
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,720
dislike me?

657
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,560
No.

658
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,080
Okay.

659
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,400
I'll go back.

660
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,920
I'll go back, okay?

661
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,480
When I die alone at home,

662
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,760
when I die at home.

663
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,480
Why are you still standing there?

664
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,160
Take me home.

665
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:08,680
No.

666
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:09,960
Mr. Lin.

667
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,800
Didn't Dr. Xiao say

668
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,880
you have hypoglycemia.

669
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:14,560
After the drip,

670
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,200
You can take the car.

671
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,560
The ambulance at 120

672
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,600
is a very nervous medical resource 045.

673
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,080
We need to save them.

674
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,320
Don't waste your time.

675
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:24,720
No.

676
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,840
How can you say that?

677
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,680
What do you mean by wasting time?

678
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,360
Dr. Qi

679
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,920
I'm puzzled.

680
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,040
No matter how short you are,

681
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,080
you can't hire

682
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,800
He is a fool.

683
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,240
Mr. Lin.

684
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,760
Although Zhang Chi doesn't speak nicely,

685
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,560
he was right, right?

686
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,280
You said

687
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,800
120 ambulance.

688
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,400
What about those who are seriously injured outside?

689
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,600
What about the serious patients?

690
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,080
It’s a matter of life and death.

691
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,400
OK, Mr. Lin?

692
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,920
You're a newbie.

693
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,600
What are you doing?

694
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,080
You can't even lift the stretcher.

695
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,000
You don't even speak nicely.

696
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,920
The proper doctor hasn't said anything yet.

697
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,560
Who are you to interrupt?

698
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,640
I didn't mean to. You mentioned me.

699
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,400
Stop talking.

700
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,640
He won’t interrupt.

701
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,360
Mr. Lin, I understand you.

702
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,360
I understand

703
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,400
I understand.

704
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,560
But you can't come to the hospital.

705
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,360
Yesterday you said

706
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,720
you took up

707
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,720
the time of doctors and nurses.

708
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,840
We need to treat patients.

709
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,560
Right?

710
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,400
Let's be more understanding, okay?

711
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:17,960
Okay, sir.

712
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:20,960
Let him send me home.

713
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,480
Send him home.

714
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,400
Take him home.

715
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,520
Lie down.

716
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,360
Send her home.

717
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,720
What are you waiting for?

718
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:30,160
Take him home.

719
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,840
Come on, see him off.

720
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,280
Come on.

721
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,560
Get back to work, Dr. Xiao.

722
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:35,720
Thank you.

723
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,720
Turn around.

724
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:44,040
The 120 bus is so comfortable.

725
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,120
Help!

726
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,480
Stop the car!

727
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,280
Stop!

728
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,480
There was a car accident on Qingquan Road.

729
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,360
Who got out?

730
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,480
What's going on?

731
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,440
We're almost there.

732
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,240
The ambulance

733
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,680
in the middle.

734
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,320
This way.

735
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,240
Look

736
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,800
It's so fast. It's here.

737
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,040
Come here, doctor.

738
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,240
Hello, can you hear me?

739
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,200
Can you hear me?

740
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,800
CPR!

741
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,720
His heartbeat and breathing are gone.

742
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,160
Open the vein, Chow-yi.

743
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,640
28, 29, 30.

744
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,080
Here.

745
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:35,880
0100%.

746
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:40,400
30.

747
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:44,480
008

748
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,720
2930.

749
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,160
Huang, defibrillator. Hurry up.

750
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,040
Coming.

751
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,480
26 27 28

752
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,240
2930.

753
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,360
Get ready for defibrillation.

754
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:02,760
200.

755
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,240
Defibrillation is ready.

756
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,440
Can you hear me?

757
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,120
Can you hear me?

758
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,040
Can you hear me nod

759
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,000
and nod when you hear me.

760
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:23,760
Okay.

761
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:26,080
Jiangdong, emergency.

762
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,560
Three drumsticks.

763
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,360
I'll have another braised pork.

764
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:49,880
Okay.

765
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,840
Okay, two steamed buns.

766
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,200
No vegetables, thanks.

767
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,240
Two taels of rice

768
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:07,720
And fried eggs with tomatoes.

769
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:08,679
Broccoli.

770
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:10,520
One more portion of dried bamboo shoots.

771
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,639
Young man,

772
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:15,280
Why don't you eat some meat?

773
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,000
How do I pay for this?

774
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,639
It's free. Weekends are all welfare.

775
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,520
Thank you.

776
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,159
Dr. Zhang.

777
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,280
You broke the rules on your first day.

778
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,280
How do you feel?

779
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,440
It's against the rules.

780
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,199
You mean

781
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:55,560
I shouldn't save him?

782
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,760
The center says

783
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,680
a car can only carry one patient.

784
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,040
Other patients

785
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,360
I'll send another car.

786
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:04,080
You called the car while you were working.

787
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,520
Do you think you did the right thing?

788
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,640
Are you a taxi?

789
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,080
What kind of patient is Mr. Lin?

790
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,080
Didn't we send him to the hospital?

791
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,320
He has hypoglycemia.

792
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,240
Who gave you the right to distinguish patients?

793
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,560
How many patients have mild diseases before calling a car?

794
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,400
When they get in the car, their lives will be in danger.

795
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,480
You can abandon them

796
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,040
and save

797
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,680
a more urgent patient?

798
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,320
Why do we have to distinguish patients?

799
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,400
I think the system and emergency patients

800
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,200
are equally important.

801
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,640
You can put down the system appropriately in front of your life.

802
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,760
You're talking about the system?

803
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,680
Do I need you to teach me the system?

804
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,920
Do you know how many patients the ER receive a day?

805
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,520
Can you save everyone?

806
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,280
You ruined the order of the center.

807
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,200
Do you know the consequences?

808
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,080
You'll be scared if something happens.

809
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,760
Zhang Chi, let me tell you.

810
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,840
Don't do anything you think is right.

811
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:46,920
Do what you can.

812
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,280
If you can't do it, leave my team.

813
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,000
Do you understand?

814
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:04,960
Hello, Dr. Zhang.

815
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:05,840
Can I sit here?

816
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:07,840
Thank you.

817
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,480
Why are you so angry, master?

818
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,760
You can't treat him like you treat me.

819
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,520
The young master

820
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,200
Maybe he's just here for a transition.

821
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,240
What young master?

822
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,040
Dr. Zhang's father

823
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,280
is Zhang Beihai

824
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,760
The first batch of emergency doctors

825
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,120
of the founder.

826
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,080
for over 40 years.

827
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,880
Secretary Liu personally invited him here.

828
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,320
Dr. Zhang, my name is Zheng Bo.

829
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,360
When we were in the emergency department in the city,

830
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,640
I went to the clinic with you.

831
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,200
You may not remember me.

832
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,040
Hello.

833
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,000
Here's the thing.

834
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,440
I understand how you feel right now.

835
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,240
When I first arrived at the emergency center,

836
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,480
Cui brought me here.

837
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,880
He may seem gentle,

838
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:47,800
he always scolds me.

839
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,600
Sometimes he scolds me three times a day.

840
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,200
And Xu Chengyuan.

841
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,560
The one with glasses.

842
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,080
Sister Qi taught him personally.

843
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,720
Sister Qi scolded him every day.

844
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,440
I heard that she cried several times.

845
00:36:58,920 --> 00:36:59,640
So?

846
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:02,280
Sister Qi is a senior member of our emergency center.

847
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,320
I can learn a lot from her.

848
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,080
So in that situation,

849
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,440
I think

850
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,360
we should pay the tuition fee.

851
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:12,880
I don't need to learn from her.

852
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,120
0502200.

853
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,240
Dr. Zhang.

854
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,280
We're quite busy on the way.

855
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,720
Add more protein.

856
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:25,920
I've never used it here.

857
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,720
I eat light food.

858
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:28,800
Thank you.

859
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,440
What's up?

860
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:45,360
Chi.

861
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,440
It's dad.

862
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,280
I just want to remind you.

863
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,600
You'll be a new comer when you get to the ER.

864
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:55,640
This isn't as good as

865
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:58,000
You need to pass the test first.

866
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,040
So you need to work out.

867
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:03,120
You work at the emergency center.

868
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,600
I'm really happy.

869
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,360
Is this why you called?

870
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,440
I didn't come to the emergency center because of you.

871
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,800
And I won't stay here for long.

872
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,880
Chi, if you're in trouble,

873
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:13,880
Don't worry.

874
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,400
It's you next month.

875
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:09,840
Let's go.

876
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,600
Let's go.

877
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:12,640
Hurry up.

878
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,840
Huang, get a bowl.

879
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,040
Dr Zhang, don't go. There's no food.

880
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,000
You didn't leave a note, did you?

881
00:39:58,680 --> 00:39:59,760
What note?

882
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,600
We often eat half of it.

883
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,560
when we eat.

884
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,680
We would leave a note on the table.

885
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:05,880
Then she saw it.

886
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,160
She knew she wouldn't take our food.

887
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,360
You can eat when you come back.

888
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:10,880
Okay, I'll keep it next time.

889
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,080
Qiu-yi.

890
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,160
It's still here.

891
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:18,480
Here, Dr Zhang.

892
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,320
Eat up.

893
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,120
What if we have to go on?

894
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:03,440
Chi, the leaders and department

895
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:04,760
Everyone wants to protect you.

896
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,240
and did a lot of work.

897
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,440
But the patient's family

898
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,760
They refused to understand.

899
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:15,240
They said if the hospital doesn't punish you,

900
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,680
if the hospital doesn't punish you.

901
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,240
If you stay silent,

902
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,880
it's not good for your future.

903
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,120
So,

904
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,800
I want you to stay away from trouble.

905
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,440
The hospital has done a suspension

906
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,120
for six months.

907
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:38,480
My dream is to become a cardiac surgeon.

908
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,360
Because my mom

909
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:44,880
is an excellent cardiac surgeon.

910
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
She said

911
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:49,520
a heart is the most fragile place

912
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:52,120
and the strongest place.

913
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,120
We must protect her.

914
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,360
She's like the sun.

915
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,960
warm and helping patients.

916
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:02,760
I want to be like her

917
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:04,640
like her.

918
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,240
and overcome the disease.

919
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,640
and become someone like her.

920
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,640
is my biggest dream.

921
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:22,400
Are you busy?

922
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,160
I...

923
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:30,480
I want to apply for a heart research center abroad.

924
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Compared to the emergency center,

925
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,320
than the emergency center.

926
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:36,000
What do you think?

927
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,200
Okay.

928
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:38,920
If you need,

929
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,400
I can write you a recommendation letter.

930
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,200
I wish you

931
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:43,760
get good news soon.

932
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:44,880
