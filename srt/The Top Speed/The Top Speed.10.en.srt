1
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:06,040
It's here. It's here. It's here. It's here. It's here. It's here. It's here. It's here. It's here. It's here. It's here. It's here. It's here. It's here.

2
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,800
We've searched the area, but there's no one.

3
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,640
No. Of course not on the way.

4
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,160
It's a long brake mark

5
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,160
I didn't see it just now.

6
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,080
It's all brake marks.

7
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:43,720
Yes.

8
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,800
Look at the car. It's over 1 meter away.

9
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,440
and a hundred catties of cars.

10
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:49,360
One hundred catties

11
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,560
Then his hands should be 1.2 kilograms.

12
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,080
It means it can hit 60 meters and 80 meters.

13
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,160
It's possible.

14
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,759
We haven't searched that place yet.

15
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,280
Yes, we were too close.

16
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,640
You go this way and I'll go that way.

17
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,040
Okay, let's go.

18
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,120
Zhang Chi, I found it.

19
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,440
So far away.

20
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,280
Zhang Chi.

21
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,840
Zhang Chi.

22
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,800
Dog man. Pure dog man.

23
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,399
Sir, please stop.

24
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:17,640
Master

25
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,680
Sir

26
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,720
Excuse me.

27
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,000
Stop, stop, stop.

28
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,440
Where did you go?

29
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,159
I went to buy ice cream.

30
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,159
It's not the time to buy ice cream.

31
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,280
We didn't bring ice.

32
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,120
We have to keep the palm at low temperature.

33
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,400
I almost didn't see it.

34
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,680
It's in the innermost and innermost position.

35
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,080
Clear this bag.

36
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,120
Here.

37
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,120
Give it to me.

38
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,360
Put it in.

39
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:03,440
Well...

40
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,400
It's too late to go to the North Hospital now.

41
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,720
You'd better plant the palm in six hours.

42
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,120
If you can't go to the north of the city, go straight to the center.

43
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:09,840
We can save half of the road.

44
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,720
I'll talk to the patient.

45
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,680
Come on.

46
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,159
Are you going to find the broken palm?

47
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:36,720
Yes.

48
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,280
The version I heard is different.

49
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,720
I heard that

50
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,200
Dr Zhang drove an ambulance

51
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,320
with an ambulance.

52
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,400
We thought you eloped.

53
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,760
Why are you guys so idle?

54
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,960
I'm writing a novel here.

55
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,400
Don't worry. I didn't write.

56
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,480
Because I know

57
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,040
even if you have the guts, Dr Zhang doesn't,

58
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,520
Let me tell you.

59
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,520
Zhang Chi is really decisive today.

60
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,840
When we arrived,

61
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,280
we didn't find a huge brake mark before.

62
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,600
He said

63
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,960
He said it was a long brake mark.

64
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,200
his hand would have gone far.

65
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,640
How could it be on the way?

66
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,400
Let's find it inside.

67
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,960
We found him in a bunch of grass.

68
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,960
If it weren't for him, I wouldn't have found it today.

69
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,480
Zhang Chi, let me tell you.

70
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,200
Although he is a little stubborn,

71
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,840
he can work.

72
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:22,960
What?

73
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,640
You're weird.

74
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,640
You actually praised him.

75
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,600
I didn't praise him.

76
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,280
I'll judge me objectively.

77
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,080
Please give me more comments.

78
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,640
I'll comment more.

79
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,200
to write a long novel.

80
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,159
What time is it? Why aren't you home?

81
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:36,640
Go back now.

82
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,159
Don't you worry about me when I go home?

83
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,720
Are you sleeping here again?

84
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,960
Did you bring your washer?

85
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,400
No, you have it.

86
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,840
You've wiped out my ice cream.

87
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,880
Go brush your teeth. Stop eating.

88
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,400
Okay.

89
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:48,840
Hurry.

90
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,320
Take this away.

91
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,520
I can't.

92
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:57,520
What about last week's work?

93
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,600
last week.

94
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,840
If you made a mistake, you should be criticized.

95
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,440
Those who should be deducted will be deducted.

96
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,000
Especially Zhang Chi.

97
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,680
Driving an ambulance without permission

98
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,280
You can't even have a driver's license.

99
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,480
This is a serious violation of the central rules.

100
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,720
But we should praise them.

101
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,680
Especially last week

102
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,480
there was a car team who performed very well.

103
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,120
While rescuing a car accident patient,

104
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,880
he can return to the place of the accident in time

105
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,040
and find the broken palm.

106
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,920
The surgery was a success.

107
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,360
This team is Qi Tuo.

108
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:29,920
Zhang Chi.

109
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,280
Huang, Qiu.

110
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,600
Let's applaud.

111
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,240
Great, master.

112
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,680
You have bonus this month.

113
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,360
Thank you, Director.

114
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,360
Thank you, Director.

115
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,360
Everyone should learn from them.

116
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,040
You will get bonus, you know?

117
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,560
OK.

118
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,680
Qi Qi, Zhang Chi.

119
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,120
Your team will treat us tonight.

120
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,040
It's on you.

121
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,120
Also,

122
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,120
Dr. Zhang Chi

123
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,480
The bonus for three months

124
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,040
just like yesterday.

125
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,240
Look, I'm praised today.

126
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,120
I have to

127
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,600
my master and I.

128
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,040
Right?

129
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,080
Disgusting. Slide back.

130
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:06,920
Don't flatter me.

131
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,600
I'm telling the truth.

132
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,600
Anyway,

133
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,440
my master is so generous.

134
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,600
The country road is so dangerous.

135
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,480
In the sun

136
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,480
for over two hours.

137
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,000
Look at that family.

138
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,440
Who can help her?

139
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,480
I really want to give you a needle.

140
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,120
That's enough.

141
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:22,720
Just slide back.

142
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,600
Go back to your seat.

143
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,040
Didn't the leader say

144
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,560
the relationship between patients should be improved?

145
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,680
How?

146
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,800
Someone has to take a step.

147
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,880
Let's take the first step.

148
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,480
Maybe the patient

149
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,799
looks serious and responsible.

150
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,600
The patient is willing to trust us.

151
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:35,880
They are willing to take a step.

152
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,679
If I take one step, you take one step.

153
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,880
Then let's say we're going first.

154
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,360
Speaking of which, I remember something.

155
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,360
Let me tell you.

156
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,800
I was an intern before.

157
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,040
I went to the ER.

158
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,360
One day, I was on duty.

159
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,920
I had a father.

160
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,880
holding that child

161
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,000
Just one or two years old.

162
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,240
It looks like a heart attack.

163
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,360
It's an emergency.

164
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,360
Parents don't have time

165
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,720
I didn't say anything

166
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,480
I didn't say anything.

167
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,360
and rescued him immediately.

168
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,120
But it was sent too late.

169
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,360
Later,

170
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,240
he was really panicked.

171
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,240
He was trying to save that child.

172
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,480
He didn't think it through.

173
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,160
Think about it.

174
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,560
as long as the parents don't give up,

175
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,680
this is an accident.

176
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,360
It's an accident. It's scary.

177
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,840
What happened next?

178
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,160
Later,

179
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,120
Then that person held the child

180
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,360
and bowed deeply to us.

181
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,000
He left without saying a word.

182
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,720
That's a relief

183
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,360
Yes.

184
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,040
This is

185
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,920
is the best medical relationship I've ever seen.

186
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,920
We tried our best to save him.

187
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,680
Regardless of the result,

188
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,680
The family also trusts us.

189
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,120
and responsible for their choices.

190
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,480
But there were too many bad things after that.

191
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,360
I almost forgot

192
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,600
those good things.

193
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,800
Don't be afraid.

194
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,040
The patients Xu Chengyuan mentioned are mostly

195
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,040
OK or majority?

196
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,280
I'm not scared.

197
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,680
I believe

198
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,120
the bad relationship between patients is the best.

199
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:04,680
Exactly.

200
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,920
What's wrong? You don't want to talk anymore?

201
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,360
Xu Chengyuan

202
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,240
At first, I thought he was smooth-tongued.

203
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,600
But when we get to know him,

204
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,800
I still have a lot to learn.

205
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,720
I learned a lot from him.

206
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,920
Don't learn from him.

207
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,440
Let's eat dumplings.

208
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,360
Who ordered it?

209
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,000
Hua.

210
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,360
Mr. Cheng.

211
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,240
Mr. Cheng, you are good, right?

212
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,160
Good.

213
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,160
Are you uncomfortable?

214
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,120
Recently,

215
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,920
I feel much better.

216
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,000
This dumpling

217
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,040
Pork celery filling

218
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,240
It's ready

219
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,040
It's still hot

220
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,360
Come and get it

221
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,800
I'm done.

222
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,560
Early this morning,

223
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,200
Mr. Cheng made dumplings.

224
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,680
and help the neighbors.

225
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,680
It's just cooked.

226
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,040
and asked me to bring it here.

227
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,240
Let’s eat together.

228
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,560
Mr. Cheng, have a seat.

229
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,600
No need.

230
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,680
I have an order.

231
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,000
Go to the hotel to get the order.

232
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,160
What about Mr. Cheng?

233
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,280
He rode a bike with me.

234
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,000
The doctor said

235
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,680
staying at home will get worse.

236
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,800
So I applied to the company

237
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,760
to bring him to work every week.

238
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,600
Take me to meet people.

239
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,720
Exercise more.

240
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,240
I can take less orders today.

241
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,800
Take it as a walk.

242
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,360
What a good Hua Zi!

243
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,000
Hua Zi, let's go.

244
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,920
Sir, we're leaving now.

245
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,120
We're leaving.

246
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,240
Eat the dumplings while it's hot.

247
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,240
Okay thank you

248
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,680
Take care.

249
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,360
Take care, Mr. Cheng.

250
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:36,880
Bye.

251
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:37,560
Take care.

252
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,080
Mr. Cheng, be careful.

253
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:39,800
Take care, Mr. Cheng.

254
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,040
Slow down, Mr. Cheng.

255
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,600
Leave some for me.

256
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,680
Sister Qi

257
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:47,880
It's better than dumplings.

258
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,800
Come on, one more bite.

259
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,560
Come on, try it. It's delicious.

260
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,920
Isn't this Dr Zhang?

261
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,040
What is this?

262
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,240
This is not a rock.

263
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,560
This is a microphone.

264
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,280
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

265
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,040
What microphone?

266
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,920
Jiangdong TV station.

267
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,800
The famous host, Zhang Chi.

268
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,880
The interview today is

269
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,240
from Jiangdong Emergency Center.

270
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:53,120
of Jiangdong Emergency Center.

271
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,040
Dr Qi.

272
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,680
I really want to interview you.

273
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,800
When you found the patient you saved

274
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,360
was the patient's family who hit you before.

275
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,360
How did you feel?

276
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:05,360
I was...

277
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,480
What kind of show is this?

278
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,040
My show is called I can't sleep tonight.

279
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,680
OK. Dear audience who can't sleep tonight,

280
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,040
At that time,

281
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,800
I didn't recognize her.

282
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,480
Why? Because she's covered in blood.

283
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,920
My colleague Zhang Chi recognized me.

284
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,240
He kept pushing me and reminding me.

285
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,040
Your colleague's name is Zhang Chi too?

286
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:24,600
Yes, my colleague.

287
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,360
Your colleague called Zhang Chi

288
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,360
is so unprofessional.

289
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:28,920
Seriously.

290
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,040
When he was saving people,

291
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,680
he was thinking about something else.

292
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,280
He didn't pay attention to saving people.

293
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,240
Right?

294
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,560
different from me?

295
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,480
And I am

296
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,480
a noble person.

297
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,240
A

298
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,240
a pure person.

299
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:40,720
A person

300
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,120
who got rid of the low-class fun.

301
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,160
Applause

302
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,480
Where's the microphone?

303
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,600
I found that your personality has changed

304
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,920
your personality has changed.

305
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,240
You talk too much.

306
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,680
You should reward me.

307
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,240
I mean it.

308
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,480
You should at least give me some gifts. You don't know anything.

309
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,520
Who gave that to you?

310
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:06,640
This.

311
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:07,520
Yes.

312
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,040
Is it a token?

313
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,120
The one

314
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,000
who came to the emergency center to see you.

315
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,160
You're quite nosy.

316
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,760
What gossip?

317
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,040
Isn't that what you said

318
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:18,800
at the convenience store that day?

319
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,000
If you want to integrate into the group,

320
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,760
to integrate into a group?

321
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,640
This is my childhood friend.

322
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,280
I've never seen your childhood friend.

323
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,920
It's her sister.

324
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,680
During the summer vacation when I graduated from primary school,

325
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,000
we went to the river in the countryside.

326
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,840
She drowned in an accident.

327
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:39,960
Jiayi.

328
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,080
Wake up, Jiayi.

329
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,720
Jiayi, wake up. Don't scare me.

330
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,720
I'm so scared, Jiayi.

331
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,560
Jiayi!

332
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,920
Help!

333
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,080
Help! Help her!

334
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,960
Jiayi, wake up.

335
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,960
Doctor, help her!

336
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,560
Jiayi.

337
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,920
When she took it away from me,

338
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,280
I kept this

339
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:24,920
I kept it.

340
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,560
If I knew a little emergency knowledge,

341
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,320
I've been wearing it since then.

342
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,720
I've changed the rope many times.

343
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,360
But these candy has been here.

344
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:38,960
Isn't it pretty?

345
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:40,800
That day,

346
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,720
when you saved that kid by the beach,

347
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,080
you were a little distracted.

348
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,000
That's the reason.

349
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,440
I was a little traumatized.

350
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,960
No, but your whole operation that day

351
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:53,720
was very regular.

352
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:54,360
Right?

353
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,840
You called me back that day.

354
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:58,320
Really?

355
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,920
Yes, you...

356
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,720
How's your research abroad going?

357
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,320
Going abroad?

358
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,680
I don't think he'll leave for a while.

359
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,160
But Mr. Dai

360
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,280
is helping me apply for funds.

361
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,800
He said that

362
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,560
find some people

363
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,560
to do the research first.

364
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:27,680
Good.

365
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:28,800
Good.

366
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,480
Tell me some good news.

367
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,560
Look over there.

368
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:40,960
It's sprouting.

369
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:47,760
Jiayi.

370
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,480
Jiaqi is fine.

371
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:51,840
Don't worry.

372
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,440
I'm not doing well.

373
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:03,640
Jiayi.

374
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,040
I miss you.

375
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,920
I always dreamed of you.

376
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,280
Wait for me by bike.

377
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,680
A pair of sneakers for driving.

378
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,080
Everyone gets one pair. Everyone gets one.

379
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,080
Everyone gets one. Me too.

380
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,680
Don't always wear those leather shoes.

381
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,560
It won't bubble.

382
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,080
Dr Zhang, you're not wearing leather shoes today.

383
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,680
There are two amazing things in our center.

384
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,840
Gao's tea cup.

385
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,800
Chi's shoes.

386
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,600
Put your head back and fasten your seat belt.

387
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,200
When the window is closed, your head will be broken.

388
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,080
You got scolded again?

389
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,080
Yes, I should scold you.

390
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,200
In my opinion,

391
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,720
we still need to wear sneakers.

392
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,320
Right?

393
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:35,040
Change your style sometimes.

394
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,040
Yes.

395
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:03,960
You're home.

396
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,920
I'm off tomorrow.

397
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,920
So I got off work as soon as it's time.

398
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,560
What about you? Why are you back so late?

399
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,440
I just had a gathering with my classmates.

400
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,200
to talk about something.

401
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:23,560
Yuan.

402
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,680
I just talked to my classmates.

403
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,800
Help me analyze it.

404
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,560
So serious? Then tell me.

405
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,720
Many patients

406
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,280
are not equal.

407
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,280
Many patients don't trust doctors.

408
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,080
Besides,

409
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,520
they lack basic medical knowledge.

410
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,320
I'm thinking how to solve this.

411
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,280
It's not easy.

412
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,320
Think about it.

413
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,920
Our country has a large population base.

414
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,320
It takes a long time

415
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,600
to cultivate a doctor.

416
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:51,600
The medical resources are very tight.

417
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:52,600
Look.

418
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,280
Every hospital has

419
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,080
online reservations.

420
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,080
Can I make a platform

421
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,560
to gather all the hospitals

422
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,200
on this platform.

423
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,600
including appointments,

424
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,080
and check the hospital.

425
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:07,800
Wait.

426
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,920
Of course, we can give you some medical knowledge.

427
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,840
That's a good idea.

428
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:13,440
Right?

429
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,200
But you need a specific plan.

430
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,800
I'm just being quick-witted.

431
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,200
Other things are not mature yet.

432
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,320
How about this?

433
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,080
I'll introduce an expert

434
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:27,680
to introduce you.

435
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,080
and listen to his advice.

436
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,440
You know him?

437
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,680
Love your brother.

438
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,440
Where are you going?

439
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,280
I'll cook something delicious for you.

440
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,400
Okay, if you need anything,

441
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,200
just tell me.

442
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,320
No problem.

443
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,520
What do you want to eat?

444
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,800
I'll eat whatever you cook.

445
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:45,600
Okay.

446
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,320
Zheng Bo.

447
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,720
I brought you breakfast.

448
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,720
Hot steamed buns.

449
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,920
Thanks, Ms. Chen.

450
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,600
Go away.

451
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,560
It's not for you.

452
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,040
Cheap.

453
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,920
Ms. Chen, I've had breakfast.

454
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,320
Thank you.

455
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,440
You have to eat more.

456
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,280
We are so busy with work.

457
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,280
I'm afraid you can't handle it.

458
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,160
Zheng Bo, think about it.

459
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,160
What has upset Ms. Chen recently?

460
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,080
Apologize.

461
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,080
Let me tell you.

462
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:22,080
I seriously suspect there is something wrong with the stuffing.

463
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:22,800
Xu Chengyuan.

464
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,280
Hurry up, Zheng Bo. It's meeting time.

465
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,000
I have more.

466
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:25,800
Coming.

467
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,080
Why are you in such a hurry?

468
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:30,800
It's a meeting.

469
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,440
Go ahead.

470
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,000
Zheng Bo, wait for me.

471
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:35,840
I’m leaving.

472
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,960
Have you watched the weather forecast?

473
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,040
Yes.

474
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:50,160
The weather station has issued a yellow warning.

475
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,320
Recently,

476
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,200
there will be continuous storm and weather.

477
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,440
According to our experience,

478
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,080
the bad weather

479
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,440
will increase our workload.

480
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,680
Everyone should be prepared.

481
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,520
There are a few things

482
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,840
Please pay attention to them.

483
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:08,440
First, strengthen security for the ambulance.

484
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,800
to ensure the car's function and condition.

485
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,520
Second, prepare emergency supplies.

486
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:17,040
and check the medicine, materials, oxygen in advance.

487
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:17,920
emergency supplies

488
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,960
We need to check.

489
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,800
Third, we need to take a level three duty system.

490
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,720
The transfer room is on duty 24 hours a day.

491
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,080
Director, Team Leader Cha,

492
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,080
and the head nurse.

493
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,440
have to work overtime every day.

494
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:32,600
Make sure to respond to the emergency efficiently, 4577.

495
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,720
Do you hear me?

496
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,200
Yes.

497
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,440
Cheer up, everyone.

498
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,440
Don't slack off.

499
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,560
Okay.

500
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,960
0106 railway team.

501
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,200
On the Huanghai Road,

502
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,400
on the Huanghai Road.

503
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:52,800
Please go immediately.

504
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,320
Copy that. We're on our way.

505
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,600
Dad, are you okay?

506
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,400
Are you okay, Dad?

507
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,200
The ambulance is here.

508
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,440
Doctor! Hurry!

509
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,440
Sir, can you hear us?

510
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,520
Can you hear us?

511
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,520
Do you feel nauseous?

512
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,960
Do you feel disgusting?

513
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,680
You don't feel like vomiting, right?

514
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,280
Okay.

515
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,840
Does it hurt?

516
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,200
No, right?

517
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,800
Does it hurt if I squeeze like this?

518
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,440
It doesn't hurt. Okay.

519
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,560
Right hand, right hand. Let me see.

520
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,800
Okay, left hand.

521
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,320
OK. Let me see your foot.

522
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,400
Raise your right foot.

523
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,520
Okay, straighten your left foot.

524
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,680
Raise your left foot.

525
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,080
Okay, no problem.

526
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,280
Come on, help him up.

527
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,280
Slowly, sir.

528
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:35,800
Slow down.

529
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:36,680
Come on.

530
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,080
How did you fall?

531
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,840
It's raining heavily today.

532
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,440
I don't want my dad to work.

533
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,960
but he insisted.

534
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,800
He was afraid the water would affect the traffic.

535
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,320
But he fell down

536
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,320
I fell down here.

537
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,960
Is it cerebral hemorrhage?

538
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,320
So far,

539
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,720
it's just a brain trauma.

540
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,200
There might be concussion.

541
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,040
Is it cerebral haemorrhage?

542
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,360
We need to take a CT scan

543
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,320
CT. to know.

544
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,160
Mr. Bai is fine. Let's go to the hospital first.

545
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:01,920
Ming's stretcher.

546
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,440
Coming

547
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,600
I'm sorry.

548
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,200
for letting you save me in such a heavy rain.

549
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,320
I'm sorry.

550
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,560
Don't say that.

551
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,280
Sir, don't say that.

552
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,920
You're doing this

553
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,560
for everyone to go out.

554
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,960
We should thank you.

555
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,320
Slow down.

556
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:16,920
Take this.

557
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,080
Come on. Slow down. Come on.

558
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:19,720
Slowly.

559
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:20,600
Slow down.

560
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,960
Slowly Lie down a little bit

561
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,320
Ready

562
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:29,320
One two three

563
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,200
Are you okay?

564
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,080
I'm fine.

565
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:55,360
EmSS emergency.

566
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,040
I think he caught a cold.

567
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,560
Why is the rain getting heavier?

568
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:03,840
Yeah.

569
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,320
Oh my god.

570
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,200
Why are you still here? What are you waiting for?

571
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,160
I'm waiting to see you off. Don't you have a limited number today?

572
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,520
Why do you always record my limited number so clearly?

573
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,160
I'm smart.

574
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,160
Besides,

575
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,320
if Uncle Qi asks

576
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,320
if Uncle Qi asks about my daughter getting wet?

577
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,200
What should I say?

578
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,560
Enough. My dad is really...

579
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:57,600
What?

580
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,200
It's raining heavily.

581
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,320
It's not that bad.

582
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,440
Hurry up.

583
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:56,960
AN

584
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,320
It's not that serious.

585
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,720
Why not?

586
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,160
This medicine

587
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,320
for half an hour after eating.

588
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,440
There are too many kinds

589
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,800
It can relieve coughs.

590
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,600
It can relieve the cold.

591
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:10,720
Okay.

592
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,680
Take your medicine after you go back.

593
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,080
Okay, thank you.

594
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,160
What are you doing?

595
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,680
I...

596
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:33,160
I'll put that seat down a little.

597
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,200
so that you can sleep comfortably.

598
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,200
Why didn't you wake me up?

599
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:37,520
I just arrived.

600
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:39,680
Thank you.

601
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,320
Hold on. Take the medicine.

602
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,280
Why don't you ask for leave from Mr. Lu

603
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,320
Don't go to work tomorrow.

604
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,680
I'm not going. I'm not going.

605
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,440
How serious?

606
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,040
You just had a runny nose.

607
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,520
Are you having a fever? How sick are you?

608
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,400
Why are you suddenly so concerned about me?

609
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,600
What do you want from me?

610
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,440
You're flattering me.

611
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:57,960
I...

612
00:30:58,960 --> 00:30:59,320
Wait.

613
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,160
Let me give you a ride.

614
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,080
No need.

615
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:25,280
I asked you to take leave but you insisted on coming.

616
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,600
It's just a minor injury.

617
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,320
You're not the only one.

618
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,280
The rain will last for three to four days.

619
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,560
The driving volume is up.

620
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,880
Based on previous experience,

621
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,560
if one day less,

622
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,200
at least ten patients.

623
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,840
You are a patient yourself.

624
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,080
Don't talk to me.

625
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:42,920
Don't infect you.

626
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,080
I'm counting on you to work.

627
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,440
Why is it raining so heavily?

628
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,880
The weather forecast said it'll rain for two more days.

629
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,080
It's so stuffy. Thank you.

630
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,360
Chocolate.

631
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,680
Zhang Chi, do you have mine?

632
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:02,680
Let me see what happened.

633
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:05,600
Isn't this medicine?

634
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,719
Why did you put it in the chocolate box?

635
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,280
Are you afraid that someone will see it?

636
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,440
Are you afraid we'll see you?

637
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,800
and expose you?

638
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,280
He doesn't even look at us.

639
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,320
It's time for you to take your medicine.

640
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,760
What are you talking about?

641
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:24,960
Let Sister Qi give you an injection.

642
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:55,960
Let's go.

643
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:57,560
See if Mr. Wang is here.

644
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,120
Hello.

645
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,360
Excuse me,

646
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,720
how is Mr. Wang

647
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:03,600
How is he?

648
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,920
I saw him two days ago.

649
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,520
He's almost recovered.

650
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,880
I heard you're going to work in two days.

651
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,040
That's great.

652
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,880
I drew this.

653
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:12,840
It's up there.

654
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,960
There are some things to pay attention to in rainy days.

655
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,560
There are electrocuted and fall

656
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,600
and prevent high-altitude falling.

657
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,200
Take it back and share it

658
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:21,840
to your colleagues.

659
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:22,120
OK.

660
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,280
If you need more,

661
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,640
if you need more.

662
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,520
I'm Zhang Chi from the emergency center.

663
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:27,520
I'll draw more for you.

664
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,160
Okay?

665
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,040
Okay.

666
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:29,800
Thank you.

667
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:34,920
You drew this?

668
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,400
You have this hidden skill?

669
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:38,720
This is so cute.

670
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,600
When did you draw it?

671
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,720
Last night.

672
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,560
Give it back to him.

673
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,440
Thank you.

674
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,320
Thank you.

675
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:45,880
Thank you. We're leaving.

676
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:46,840
Thank you.

677
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,040
You're welcome.

678
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:48,560
Bye. Bye.

679
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:50,640
Well done, Zhang Chi.

680
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,120
Have you heard of the story of the three Brothers?

681
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,160
I've heard of it.

682
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,600
He said he used medicine before he fell ill.

683
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,640
He used medicine when he was sick.

684
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,320
Only Magpie

685
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,360
is to take medicine when the patient is seriously ill.

686
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:04,280
Brother, you're the boss of the generation.

687
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,880
You should have prevented it.

688
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,680
As doctors,

689
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,440
should be a preventative.

690
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:14,400
Got it.

691
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,200
0106 Stock Team.

692
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,080
There's a patient in Fengyuan Road

693
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,160
He needs to be transferred to the hospital.

694
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,040
Hurry up.

695
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,640
They are all here.

696
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:25,840
Qi Tuo.

697
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,360
It’s me, Qu Yufan.

698
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:28,680
No, my call

699
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,720
to contact the transfer center and the patient.

700
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,200
Don't keep calling me.

701
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:33,400
Don't hang up.

702
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,640
Uncle Qi fainted in the tea room.

703
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,160
and was picked up by an ambulance.

704
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,960
What? What happened to my dad?

705
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,120
What do you mean?

706
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:42,800
The waiter in the tea room said

707
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,880
he suddenly fainted while drinking tea.

708
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,640
If you can make it,

709
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,320
go to the city North Hospital.

710
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,160
I'm transporting my critical patient.

711
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,120
I haven't reached the hospital yet.

712
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,080
Well...

713
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,120
Okay, I'll send the patient over.

714
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,120
Help me out first.

715
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,320
Don't worry, I'm here.

716
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,280
I'll be right there. Thank you.

717
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,320
Give it to me. I'll take over.

718
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,920
Go to the north of the city to find your dad.

719
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,360
You're under guidance now.

720
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,160
You can't hand it in yourself.

721
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:45,680
Give it to me.

722
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,680
I'll call Mr. Lu.

723
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:47,000
If you're like this, I'll call Director Lu. 0104577.

724
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,960
If she doesn't agree, send someone else to me.

725
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:50,920
I'm telling you.

726
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,640
It's not a big deal that she fainted suddenly.

727
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,600
It could be hypoglycemia.

728
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,680
but it could be a cardiovascular vessel.

729
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:57,880
Go.

730
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,320
Do you understand?

731
00:38:59,360 --> 00:38:59,880
Thank you.

732
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,960
Nurse, I...

733
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,040
Are you Qi Xuejun's family?

734
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:10,640
It's okay.

735
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,840
Here's the bill. Pay the bill.

736
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:19,360
Qi

737
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:20,440
I'll pay the bill.

738
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,600
and buy you some food and drinks.

739
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:22,280
Get some rest.

740
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,120
Go. Thanks, dad.

741
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,280
Qu.

742
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:25,640
Coming.

743
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:26,280
Qiqi.

744
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,880
Why did you hit your head?

745
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:28,960
Why are you here?

746
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,280
Shouldn't you be at work now?

747
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,080
Do you feel nauseous?

748
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,120
Am I? Do I look heavy?

749
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:34,880
Look.

750
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,320
You even made me sick.

751
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:38,200
I'm fine.

752
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,640
Don't worry. I'm really fine.

753
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:40,720
You're really...

754
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,600
Nothing, Qiqi.

755
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,360
The doctor said

756
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,160
hypoglycemia.

757
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,880
I've filmed the film. My head is fine.

Get back to work.

00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,360

762

767
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,120
I'll ask the doctor.

768
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,120
It's okay.

769
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:00,080
It's okay.

770
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:07,560
Qiqi.

771
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,520
What's wrong, Qiqi?

772
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,920
Qiqi, what’s wrong with you?

773
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,960
Doctor! Help!

774
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:18,400
Coming.

Are you okay? Hang in there.

776
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,560
What's wrong? What's wrong with her?

777
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,200
Ma'am.

778
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,320
Can you hear me?

779
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,160
Xu.

780
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,000
Uncle Qi.

781
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,600
Why are you here?

782
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,000
What happened to your head?

783
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,680
I'm fine. I fell down.

784
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,760
Are you going to do some formalities?

785
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:55,840
Let me do it. Have a rest.

786
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,200
No, this is not my order.

787
00:40:58,520 --> 00:40:59,760
It belongs to your master.

788
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,000
My master?

789
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,520
Look at your master.

790
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:04,840
came to see me.

791
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:05,560
What happened?

792
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,480
she fainted.

793
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,320
Okay, I'll go check on her.

794
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,240
Which room is she in?

795
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,040
Bed 38. Go take a look.

796
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,480
Okay, I'll leave you to it.

797
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:16,480
Nurse.

798
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:17,000
What's wrong?

799
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,000
Don't move.

800
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,360
Let go of that water bottle. Let me do it.

801
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:27,840
Are you serious?

802
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,080
It's just a cold.

803
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,560
It's not virus.

804
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,360
I'm just tired. I caught a cold.

805
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:33,840
It's not contagious.

806
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,000
As long as it's not contagious.

807
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,000
I'm afraid you might infect me.

808
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,040
I can't take good care of you.

809
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:38,400
What are you doing here?

810
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:39,880
I went to see a patient.

811
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:40,920
When I came out,

812
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,040
I saw Uncle Qi at the nurse station.

813
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:44,200
He told me you were sick.

814
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,160
and fainted.

815
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,160
Let me tell you.

816
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,840
I heard that it took less than three seconds

817
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,280
it took less than three seconds.

818
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,400
How are you going to thank me?

819
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,160
Why are you so talkative?

820
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:53,560
Why are you here?

821
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,000
You smell something so fast.

822
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:57,760
Are you okay?

823
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,880
I'm fine. It's just a cold.

824
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,280
I'm just tired. I fell down.

825
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,280
You know what? It's a serious cold.

826
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,760
It's pneumonia when the cold gets worse.

827
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,640
Even if you cure pneumonia,

828
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:09,200
there will be calcification point on your lungs.

829
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:10,040
and traumatized.

830
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,880
If you can't cure it, it'll turn into lung cancer.

831
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,320
Shut up.

832
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,560
Can you say something nice?

833
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,040
Do you think you're the chief doctor

834
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:17,480
You think you're the chief doctor?

835
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:18,200
Seriously.

836
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:19,680
You're scaring me.

837
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:20,720
You even have lung cancer.

838
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,560
That's right. Look how scared my master is.

839
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:24,240
Leave the melon here. Leave.

840
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,280
Come on, have some watermelon.

841
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,280
And a melon.

842
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,280
I bought a new spoon

843
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,680
and hot water.

844
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:33,720
You're quite considerate.

845
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,160
Let me tell you.

846
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,720
You have a fever and a cold.

847
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:38,440
You need to drink more water and eat more fruits.

848
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,480
Don't burn water.

849
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:40,560
I can't eat it.

850
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:41,200
Eat up.

851
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:42,720
Eat from here.

852
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:43,720
Of course I know

853
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:44,840
Who doesn't know how to eat watermelon?

854
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:46,720
You should eat whatever you want.

855
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:48,000
and drink whatever you should.

856
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:50,200
You are like ginseng, bird's nest and deer antler.

857
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,800
Pick whatever you want. I'll reimburse it.

858
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,560
You won the lottery.

859
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:54,840
It sounds like a big one.

860
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:56,280
I didn't tell you before.

861
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:58,640
