1
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:06,040
I'm a student. I'm a student. I'm a student. I'm a student. I'm a student. I'm a student. I'm a student. I'm a student. I'm a student. I'm a student. I'm a student. I'm a student.

2
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,080
I met a farmer

3
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,520
I met a farmer.

4
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:41,200
He has congenital heart malfunction.

5
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,440
He can't see this disease in the countryside.

6
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,840
So he borrowed a lot of money.

7
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,880
and hung up

8
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,640
in the city.

9
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:49,960
That person

10
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,960
is my tutor.

11
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,320
After seeing the results of this patient,

12
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,000
the first thing he said was

13
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:57,880
you're late.

14
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,320
Second,

15
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,440
It's hopeless.

16
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,080
The third thing.

17
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,320
Go home.

18
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:09,320
The patient was about to collapse after hearing that.

19
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,200
He grabbed my tutor's hand and said,

20
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,280
I beg you.

21
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,680
I have to support my family.

22
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,000
Please help me.

23
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,520
What did you do

24
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,520
What did you do earlier?

25
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,120
After hearing this,

26
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:30,400
after hearing this.

27
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,000
After the internship,

28
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,400
I lived in 4577 after my internship.

29
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:37,079
I was assigned to the Beijing Hospital.

30
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,520
It's similar to

31
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,840
of the city North Hospital.

32
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,079
First day at work,

33
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:44,440
I met a patient with angina.

34
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,000
Mr. Dai took this patient

35
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,760
and his family

36
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,880
to the office.

37
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,840
and took out a heart model.

38
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,000
I made the structure of this heart

39
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,000
How is angina formed?

40
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,640
What's the special drug now?

41
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,440
What's the risk?

42
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,840
I introduced him to the patient for over an hour.

43
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,760
Then he took out the notification.

44
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,320
The family signed it quickly.

45
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,440
After the patient left,

46
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,320
I’ll ask Mr. Dai.

47
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,080
Is it necessary to be so detailed?

48
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,960
Mr. Dai said

49
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,320
It seems unnecessary before the incident.

50
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,000
0104577.

51
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,880
may become very important

52
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,200
at one point.

53
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:23,920
I finally realized

54
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,600
I realized the meaning of this sentence.

55
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,200
In the past, I thought saving people was the priority.

56
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,880
Nothing else matters.

57
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,160
Now I realize

58
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,079
it's not enough to have professional knowledge.

59
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:38,440
After working these days,

60
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:42,400
I realized that only by looking at patients

61
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,560
from the patient's perspective.

62
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,440
Maybe we can get the ideal result.

63
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,720
This is my personal reflection.

64
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,880
Let's work together.

65
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:54,960
Thank you.

66
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,120
Thank you for your sharing.

67
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,880
I think it's very good.

68
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,560
Let me say something too.

69
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,440
Right, doctors nowadays

70
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,640
We are under a lot of pressure at work.

71
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,560
Because

72
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,680
there are too many patients.

73
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,560
And we doctors are too few.

74
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,800
We have high workload.

75
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,680
For example, our own center.

76
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,000
There are over 100 doctors here.

77
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:31,800
right?

78
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,120
But what we have to face

79
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,640
is a huge city

80
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,800
a huge city.

81
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,560
Sometimes there are traffic jams.

82
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,920
the patient and his family are anxious.

83
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,440
I have no choice.

84
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,200
The emergency resources are too tight.

85
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,920
There are too few beds in the hospital.

86
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,240
All these together

87
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,240
which makes every doctor

88
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,200
become a contradictory face.

89
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,000
I want every doctor

90
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,200
to stay in the best state of work

91
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,440
Be patient and stay calm.

92
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,560
It's too hard.

93
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,800
I hope all of you

94
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,000
can learn to change your positions.

95
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,120
Think about it.

96
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,000
Every emergency patient

97
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,000
they must be emotional.

98
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,080
the most nervous and fragile state.

99
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,080
What if

100
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,880
a patient doctor

101
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,320
a patient doctor.

102
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,000
it will easily cause

103
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,880
emotional breakdown and opposition.

104
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,880
If you continue,

105
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,560
it'll be a vicious cycle.

106
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,000
The patient and patient will be hurt in the end.

107
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,360
After all these years,

108
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,800
I made some summary.

109
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,640
I divided doctors into five types.

110
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:40,880
First,

111
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,560
This kind of doctor

112
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,920
can treat patients as their family.

113
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,800
What will the patient think?

114
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,560
It'll be nice and comfortable, right?

115
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,000
Second,

116
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,360
is to treat patients as mature people.

117
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
He's passionate at work.

118
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,440
Tell them everything.

119
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,120
Make the patient satisfied and rest assured.

120
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,800
The third is to treat patients as patients.

121
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,680
As long as we have

122
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,320
in work,

123
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,560
The patients will feel relieved

124
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,760
through our friendship.

125
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,440
The fourth one is not good.

126
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,120
They treat patients as passers-by.

127
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,920
He's cold-tongued.

128
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,320
The patient must be disappointed and disappointed.

129
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,560
The most important one is the fifth one.

130
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,880
Some doctors

131
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,880
treat patients as humans.

132
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,080
He's so arrogant.

133
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,760
This patient is here to see a doctor.

134
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,320
It's not cured, but it's heart-broken.

135
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,360
They must feel despair.

136
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,560
and upset.

137
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,000
So I

138
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,680
I really hope you can

139
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,360
change your positions.

140
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,920
We should care more about the patients

141
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,680
Be patient and help them.

142
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,920
As long as we doctors make a heart,

143
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,640
I believe

144
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,000
the patients can feel it.

145
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,000
Actually, the key to

146
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,480
the key

147
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,440
is still in our hands.

148
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:08,920
Alright.

149
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,200
Done.

150
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,000
Okay.

151
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,600
Hello, Dr Zhang.

152
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,800
Yangyang's mom is going to have a kidney transplant.

153
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,840
This afternoon

154
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,600
Did the surgery go well?

155
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:39,320
The surgery is over.

156
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,480
It went very well.

157
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,400
He's in ICU now. Yes.

158
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,880
The doctor said we should observe him for a few more days.

159
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,400
If there is no rejection,

160
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,760
we can go back to the general ward.

161
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,520
That's great.

162
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,400
Why didn't you tell us

163
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,880
such a big operation?

164
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,280
We're in this industry after all.

165
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,280
What if we can help?

166
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,000
Yes.

167
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,080
I'm sorry for the trouble.

168
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,680
Actually, it happened so suddenly.

169
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,200
I couldn't take care of anything.

170
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,880
Then why did

171
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,240
suddenly got such a serious illness?

172
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,240
Actually

173
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,920
has chronic kidney inflammation.

174
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,440
He's not in good health.

175
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,200
Plus, about the child,

176
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,560
and her ex-husband.

177
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,760
and her ex-husband.

178
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,120
His condition got worse.

179
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,560
After the examination,

180
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,200
The doctor said no when he saw the list.

181
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,200
You need a kidney transplant right away.

182
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,800
That's a quick surgery.

183
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,880
Think about how many years Dan has been waiting for.

184
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,920
Some have waited for eight or ten years.

185
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:30,760
Have you forgotten?

186
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,320
She's a direct relative of the deceased.

187
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,440
That's why she has the priority. Look at you.

188
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:36,440
Forget it.

189
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,440
Yes.

190
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,679
I'm telling you, luckily there's such a rule.

191
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,240
And we happened to meet a suitable donor.

192
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,679
Then the hospital said, "Hurry up."

193
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:44,880
Let's get the surgery.

194
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,480
The result was good.

195
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,880
So I think

196
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,440
I believe good people will be rewarded.

197
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,000
Definitely.

198
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,800
This is a toy for Dan Dan.

199
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,440
Yang's mom said

200
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,320
before the surgery

201
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,560
before the surgery.

202
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,920
She likes stuffed toys.

203
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,080
You don't know yet, do you?

204
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,080
Dr Zhang gave this to her.

205
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,320
Yangyang's mom.

206
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:26,920
Dr Zhang

207
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,800
I'm sorry, Yang's mom.

208
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,200
I

209
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,120
I was too impulsive.

210
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,560
I didn't consider how you feel as parents.

211
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,800
I didn't expect

212
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,440
you and your husband would...

213
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,080
Our divorce has nothing to do with this.

214
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,480
Don't blame yourself.

215
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,680
I know Dr Zhang did it to save people.

216
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,800
I understand.

217
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,360
I was too reckless.

218
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,320
Anyway, if there's anything I can do to help,

219
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,640
just let me know.

220
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,240
Actually, saving Dan Dan

221
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,680
to save Dan Dan.

222
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,880
This is for Dan Dan.

223
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,440
This is for you.

224
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:19,920
Give it to me.

225
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,680
Before Yangyang left,

226
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,080
I begged my ex-colleague

227
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,680
to record Yangyang's heartbeat.

228
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,280
Thank you.

229
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,240
Thank you

230
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,120
Yangyang

231
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,920
Yangyang, my God, I'll take it wherever I go

232
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,080
I won't leave you

233
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:14,920
Listen.

234
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,880
Five gold pieces are good.

235
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,440
Senior, is this pretty?

236
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,640
I think it's cool.

237
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,040
This one

238
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,200
Next, a pair of pants with this color.

239
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,120
It's very green.

240
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,680
I didn't even mention you just now.

241
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,120
Are you suffering from dislocation?

242
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,560
Why are your shoulders so wide?

243
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,440
Don't touch it. I'll smash it.

244
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,480
It's fake.

245
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,320
You don't know anything Shoulders make your face smaller

246
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,440
Really

247
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,120
Yes.

248
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,120
You're especially mean today.

249
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:19,680
Tell me.

250
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,360
What's wrong? Are you in a bad mood?

251
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,920
Uncle Qi asked you to go on a blind date again?

252
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,680
No.

253
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,560
No one in my family wants me to go on a blind date anymore.

254
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,920
Our family's top priority now

255
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
is a safety check for my work.

256
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,880
So what?

257
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,560
Did your disciple upset you?

258
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,400
Well, to be honest, you did a good job.

259
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,440
You're getting better.

260
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,920
Why don't I believe it?

261
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,560
Since he got into your car,

262
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,400
since he got into your car.

263
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,040
Did I?

264
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:43,920
Really.

265
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,920
Others may think

266
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,280
you are strict.

267
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,680
Actually, I know you well.

268
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,400
You really care about him.

269
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,880
Did he piss you off?

270
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,280
I'll teach him a lesson for you.

271
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,400
Well done, really.

272
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,280
Sometimes I think

273
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,040
that he would leave the center sooner or later.

274
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,920
It's a pity.

275
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,360
Leaving?

276
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,400
Where is he going?

277
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,640
He applied for a foreign heart research center.

278
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,640
He's quite interested in his assignment.

279
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,760
It's not hard to guess.

280
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,920
He's a cardiothoracic surgeon.

281
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,640
He came to our center for a transition, right?

282
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,160
He's always so focused.

283
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,120
He looks like that.

284
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,280
Just stay in the center.

285
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,400
You treat him as your disciple now.

286
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,880
and teach her by hand.

287
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,400
When they leave,

288
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,040
you will be very sad.

289
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,000
No hope, no disappointment.

290
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,520
Got it. Stretch your shoulders.

291
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,040
Buy one for me.

292
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,440
broad shoulders.

293
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,760
Okay, I'll buy it for you now.

294
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,120
Go to the store and pick some.

295
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:45,680
Okay.

296
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,680
This is the class room.

297
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:57,680
These

298
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,920
are our emergency doctors.

299
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:00,680
Hello.

300
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,640
Put down your work.

301
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,040
Let me introduce them to you.

302
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:05,680
These are

303
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,880
are the filming team of the TV station.

304
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,040
Aren't we shooting a promotional video?

305
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,040
They're here for the interview in advance.

306
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,120
Step on it.

307
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,520
Let's welcome him.

308
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,000
Hello.

309
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,440
Welcome.

310
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,520
This is our filming team.

311
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,440
Please get ready.

312
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,000
Take care.

313
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,440
Why are you standing there?

314
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,640
Why are you laughing like this?

315
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,120
Excited.

316
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,360
We all saw her on TV, right?

317
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,640
Yes.

318
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,640
Celebrity.

319
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:32,680
She

320
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:35,520
the host of Yangxin Hall.

321
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,280
Miss Cheng.

322
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,880
The promotional video

323
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,680
is in charge of

324
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,160
to the show.

325
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,040
Nice to meet you.

326
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,440
It's so beautiful

327
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,360
You've seen a living person.

328
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,160
Lower your voice.

329
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,920
Miss Cheng.

330
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,520
Hello.

331
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,360
Hello, Miss Cheng.

332
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,560
We are all your fans.

333
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,920
We love watching your show.

334
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:56,640
Thank you.

335
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,880
I finally meet you in person today.

336
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,240
I'm a little excited.

337
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,360
Director.

338
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:05,880
Director.

339
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,280
I'm taking the morning shift.

340
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:10,040
How about I take Ms. Cheng for a walk?

341
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,920
Sure, come if you want.

342
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,040
Please.

343
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,440
When did Mr. Cui

344
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,920
What's that called?

345
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,760
Beauty tip.

346
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,240
He drew it. How can he draw it like this?

347
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,160
Painted?

348
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,040
It suddenly occurred to me that...

349
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:28,760
No wonder.

350
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,520
Why did he ask me for an eyebrow brush yesterday?

351
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,920
The eyebrow brush.

352
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,640
Isn't this Wolverine?

353
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,160
I think it's more like the Iron Arm Agonwood.

354
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,400
It does look like him.

355
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,280
Great.

356
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,880
What did he say? What did he say?

357
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:52,880
Did you get it, Mr. Cui?

358
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,400
What did he say?

359
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,160
I failed.

360
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,360
Why are we...

361
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,280
What's wrong with us? Right.

362
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:57,920
Is it too little?

363
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,280
It’s not that I can’t.

364
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,280
Ms. Cheng said

365
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,400
the audience of this promotional video is young.

366
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,000
So a photographer

367
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:08,920
he has to be a young man.

368
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,680
To put it bluntly,

369
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,000
I'm not handsome enough.

370
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,040
Why does the TV station judge people by their looks?

371
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,520
Yes, they have no taste.

372
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,640
What TV station?

373
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,680
It doesn't matter. Forget it.

374
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,760
We should focus on participating, right?

375
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,240
He's so manly now.

376
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,160
That's right

377
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,000
Right?

378
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,280
So handsome.

379
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:35,640
Son.

380
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,400
Dad, you made it, right?

381
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,920
I'm sure you did.

382
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,640
Right, dad?

383
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,040
About choosing an actor

384
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,760
I didn't get it.

385
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,560
I prepared a cake for you, Dad.

386
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,160
It's okay. Next time.

387
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,880
But I told my classmates.

388
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,640
Please be quiet.

389
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,520
I have something to announce.

390
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,359
This is a promotional video.

391
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,560
We'll start shooting soon.

392
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,160
Don't mind it.

393
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,760
Just do what you should do.

394
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,920
Don't be nervous.

395
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:27,520
Yes. Then our shooting

396
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,280
without

397
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,680
without affecting your work.

398
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,640
Thank you for your cooperation.

399
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,640
And Miss Cheng

400
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,000
chose three doctors.

401
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,560
These three doctors have Qi Tuo.

402
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,440
They're calling you. Hurry.

403
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,280
Zhang Chi.

404
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,880
And Zheng Bo.

405
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,240
You three go get ready.

406
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,640
What are your criteria?

407
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,280
Why didn't you choose me?

408
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,520
Alright, sit there.

409
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,360
You talk too much.

410
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,240
I don't talk much.

411
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,520
Zheng Bo, you...

412
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,040
Go.

413
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,520
Pick me next time.

414
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,360
Don't be disappointed if you fail.

415
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,120
We'll have another chance next time.

416
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,760
Do your best, okay?

417
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:58,760
Alright.

418
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,920
Don't just sit here.

419
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,400
Go back to work.

420
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,160
Go to work.

421
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,160
What are you looking at? Let's go.

422
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,480
Hurry.

423
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,280
Let's go.

424
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,000
Dr Xu.

425
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,520
You don't know me?

426
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,360
Of course I do.

427
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,240
The famous female lead of security.

428
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,160
I followed you on Weibo three years ago.

429
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,520
You didn't even choose me.

430
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,560
No, no, not on TV.

431
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,400
You went to my house to save my dad.

432
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,640
There are too many patients.

433
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,280
so I can't remember.

434
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,120
We still have a history.

435
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,160
Then you should choose me.

436
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,520
Have you really forgotten?

437
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,640
When you came to my house two years ago,

438
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,240
my dad passed away.

439
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:42,880
But

440
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,240
you still made him a full emergency procedure.

441
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,400
CPR, artificial respiration.

442
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,360
It's been half an hour.

443
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,760
He's gone.

444
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,400
This is my father's body.

445
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,560
After he was sent to the hospital,

446
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,760
the doctor told me.

447
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,040
Final care.

448
00:18:59,040 --> 00:18:59,640
Go away.

449
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,880
He hit the gun.

450
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:03,520
Well...

451
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,280
Miss Cheng, I’m really sorry.

452
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,560
I’m really sorry.

453
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,760
Actually, I didn't mean

454
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,920
I don't mean anything else.

455
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,520
When I just found out,

456
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,920
I was a little angry.

457
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,440
I even thought about filing a complaint.

458
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,120
But

459
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,640
I thought about 0102002 after I calmed down.

460
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,160
Actually, I'm very grateful to Dr Xu.

461
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:19,400
Jiangdong emergency.

462
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,800
Dr Xu gave me

463
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,120
a psychological relief period.

464
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,680
If he told me

465
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,000
my father passed away,

466
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,240
How can I stand it?

467
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:26,720
010120.

468
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:27,920
Thank you.

469
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,400
Thank you for understanding.

470
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,360
We've put in a lot of effort.

471
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,520
Fortunately, we met you.

472
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,520
I'm at a high level.

473
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,040
because

474
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,400
this experience.

475
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,280
I'm very interested in

476
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,640
of our promotional video.

477
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:42,920
I hope

478
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,280
to get close to our emergency doctor.

479
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,400
Okay.

480
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,800
In that case,

481
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,520
you should add another spot.

482
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,160
This is a different matter.

483
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,040
That's right.

484
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,400
Go back to work.

485
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:57,560
Okay.

486
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,640
How about this?

487
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,280
I sign up for labor.

488
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,520
This one is good.

489
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,640
Let's go.

490
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,520
Let's go.

491
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,640
A thin telephone line.

492
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,120
When the number is given to 120,

493
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,240
it built

494
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,400
a platform to continue and protect life.

495
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,120
He's always on the way to the hospital.

496
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,400
Take a short break before the emergency.

497
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,520
It's simple and unexpected.

498
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,040
and surprisingly unexpected.

499
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,920
This is an extraordinary world.

500
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,160
The crew of Yangxin Clinic.

501
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,760
Please follow our camera

502
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,560
and walk into the life of an emergency doctor.

503
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,880
Go through here.

504
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,280
From here

505
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,000
This is our exit hall

506
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,160
All the cars on duty are parked here.

507
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,280
Sometimes our colleagues

508
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,920
can meet each other here every day.

509
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,640
This is our car.

510
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,000
Zhang Chi and I are in this car.

511
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,160
Can we go upstairs?

512
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,280
Come on.

513
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:57,920
Please come in

514
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,400
I usually sit here

515
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,000
I sit here.

516
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:02,280
Yes.

517
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,040
This is the patient's family.

518
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:05,880
the patient's family.

519
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,280
Please have a seat.

520
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:06,880
This is our...

521
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,920
I'll sit here and feel it.

522
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,680
Dong Xiaoqiu's position.

523
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,560
Yes.

524
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,000
I saw many

525
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,000
in our car.

526
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,280
introduce these medical equipment to you?

527
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,880
Let's start from here.

528
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,160
This oxygen bottle

529
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:16,920
It's in the car.

530
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,640
If the patient needs oxygen,

531
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,440
use this.

532
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,880
If you're in the patient's house,

533
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,280
we have to use this oxygen pillow.

534
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,880
But it takes a short time.

535
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,920
It only takes more than ten minutes.

536
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,400
Yes.

537
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:26,760
Emergency.

538
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,440
Yes.

539
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,280
This is the ECG monitor.

540
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,040
Usually, we

541
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,440
to monitor the patient's vitals.

542
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,440
Vitals? Yes.

543
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,920
This one here.

544
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,760
Defibrillation. Yes.

545
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:39,160
Defibrillator.

546
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,400
Normally, patients have ventricular fibrillation.

547
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,120
We'll use this.

548
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,280
other medical equipment.

549
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,040
Medicine supplies.

550
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:45,560
We'll put them here.

551
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,160
All here.

552
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,520
Yes.

553
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,040
there's also gadgets.

554
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,760
I want to ask you two.

555
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,000
Since your career,

556
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,920
how do you feel

557
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,880
how do you feel about yourself?

558
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,040
We...

559
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,880
This is a big problem.

560
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,920
Mr. Cui, wait.

561
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,400
What's wrong?

562
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,120
Well, host,

563
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,160
How about

564
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,000
to answer this question?

565
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,880
Let's stop the machine.

566
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,120
Dr Zhang, here's the thing.

567
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,360
We have to follow the outline.

568
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,520
And our part

569
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,280
to interview you two.

570
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,880
Host, here's the thing.

571
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,560
I just came to the emergency center.

572
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,400
Dr Qi.

573
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,760
I don't know what she thinks about this.

574
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,760
But I think

575
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,280
this is more suitable for Dr. Choi.

576
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,280
He's been working in this industry for 20 years.

577
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,520
He must have driven more than 20,000 times.

578
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,640
So he's more qualified to answer this question.

579
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,640
Ask Mr. Choi

580
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,280
Mr. Cui knows more than us.

581
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:38,880
Well...

582
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,280
Well, if you think

583
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,640
you are not satisfied with his answer,

584
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,880
We can add it.

585
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,400
Yes.

586
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,120
OK?

587
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:45,560
Sure.

588
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,640
Shall we interview Dr. Choi now?

589
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,520
Let's get the machines ready.

590
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,040
No.

591
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,040
Dr. Choi, I'm here to interview you.

592
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:51,800
I'm a little nervous.

593
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,280
Don't be nervous.

594
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:52,680
Don't be nervous.

595
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:53,560
Don't be nervous.

596
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,640
Mr. Cui, don't be nervous.

597
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,880
I'm fine

598
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,000
Get the machine ready.

599
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,600
Three, two, one.

600
00:22:58,760 --> 00:22:59,280
Action.

601
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,560
Hello, Dr. Choi.

602
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,520
I want to know

603
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,640
what motivation and spirit

604
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,240
can make you

605
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,640
for 20 years.

606
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,040
Here.

607
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,360
As an emergency doctor,

608
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,320
is walking on the edge of life and death.

609
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,400
is walking on the edge of life and death, 2020.

610
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,160
We race against life every day.

611
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,920
To save those critical patients,

612
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,880
no matter how hard it is,

613
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,080
We're the ER, after all.

614
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:26,800
We are the first-aid doctors.

615
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,160
When I first started,

616
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,400
a senior told me something.

617
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,920
that I will never forget.

618
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:39,640
He said the patient entrusted his life to the doctor.

619
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,120
and lives together.

620
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,040
We received a patient

621
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,400
in such a short time in the ambulance.

622
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,240
the patient's condition

623
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,520
are very obvious.

624
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,680
Sometimes you feel that a patient

625
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,640
is dying.

626
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,160
But in such a short time,

627
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,040
in such a short time.

628
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,880
The joy and pride of that moment 006202

629
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,960
I think everything in the world 062020

630
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,560
I think everything in the world

631
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,280
in the world.

632
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,520
the patient's improvement

633
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,160
can give me the greatest sense of accomplishment.

634
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,040
I think this is

635
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,520
the important reason

636
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,360
for so long.

637
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,640
Cut.

638
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,800
Well said.

639
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,040
Our interview is very good.

640
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,280
Then this part is over.

641
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,400
We'll interview Dr. Zheng.

642
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,760
In the end,

643
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,800
need your cooperation.

644
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,520
No problem.

645
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,280
See you later.

646
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,400
Okay, thank you.

647
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,800
Let's interview Dr. Zheng.

648
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,920
Okay, go ahead. I won't go, 62020.

649
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,240
Okay, you guys go. I won't go.

650
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,000
No, you have to come.

651
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:35,800
You have to come together.

652
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,640
You need to serve others.

653
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,760
Hurry up. Let's hurry up.

654
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:39,800
Hurry up.

655
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,400
Do more work.

656
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,680
I want to stay with you.

657
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:42,920
Play after you finish your work.

658
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,400
Okay, let's go.

659
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:45,920
I'm leaving.

660
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,760
Keep up the good work.

661
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:49,640
Qi Tuo

662
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:50,920
Zhang Chi.

663
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,640
Thank you so much for today.

664
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:53,760
As you know,

665
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:54,760
Where is Tony?

666
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,640
He always wants to see me on TV.

667
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,160
I called him

668
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,520
I asked him

669
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,640
a special gift for you.

670
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,280
I thought it would be over.

671
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,240
I have a gift.

672
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,920
Your son will definitely see you on TV.

673
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,640
His father is a real hero.

674
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,280
Yeah.

675
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,280
Tony will be very happy.

676
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:12,880
Okay, I'll get back to work.

677
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,280
Okay, go ahead.

678
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,800
Good for you.

679
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,120
You're more humane.

680
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,760
What do you mean?

681
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,560
When people talk, they say me first.

682
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,040
From me

683
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,880
That means this person is self-centered.

684
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,280
You were always like this when you first came to the ER.

685
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,760
You always do what I do.

686
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:33,640
What should I do?

687
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,280
I can’t. I’m wronged.

688
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:35,800
0104577.

689
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,240
You're talking more and more about him.

690
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,680
What about him?

691
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,120
I think if he wants it or not,

692
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,400
It means you've made progress.

693
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,760
Am I like what you said?

694
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,280
You did that a lot.

695
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,320
0104577

696
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,800
You mean I...

697
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,640
0104577.

698
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,920
I didn't do well.

699
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,880
Now I have

700
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,000
little by little.

701
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,640
A little bit

702
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,560
But there is still a lot of room for improvement.

703
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:01,640
0104577.

704
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,160
Is that what you mean?

705
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,360
You have a lot of room for improvement.

706
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,920
But you deserve praise.

707
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:05,640
Here's a bottle of water.

708
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,360
Isn't this from Xu Chengyuan?

709
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,400
I didn't drink it.

710
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,280
This is our men's changing room.

711
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:41,880
This is...

712
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,040
This is the women's dressing room

713
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,400
This is the men's changing room.

714
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,920
And this is

715
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,520
is our meeting room.

716
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,040
Let me show you around.

717
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,360
This meeting room

718
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:58,000
we will hold a regular meeting here every Monday

719
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,120
Let's summarize the work situation last week.

720
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,240
Of course, this place is also used for reception and training.

721
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,280
This is our lounge.

722
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,640
This lounge

723
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,920
is usually prepared for

724
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,560
for our comrades.

725
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,400
They rest here

726
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,160
they rest here.

727
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,040
But usually it won't take more than 15 minutes.

728
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,520
I get texts from the bus.

729
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:16,760
It's tough.

730
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:17,360
Yes.

731
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,000
Let me show you over there.

732
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:21,400
Okay.

733
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,040
Okay.

734
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,160
This is the restaurant of our emergency center.

735
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,000
Please come in.

736
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,520
Because the emergency center

737
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:35,160
has 24-hour shifts.

738
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:38,120
So we have breakfast and dinner.

739
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,360
But if you miss the meal time,

740
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,040
you have to solve it by yourself.

741
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,000
Look at our dishes.

742
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,880
Chicken leg and beef brisket

743
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:46,920
All meat and vegetables

744
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,680
Something like main food.

745
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,160
We'll basically make two meat and two vegetables. Yes.

746
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,360
It's quite a feast

747
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:51,800
Yes.

748
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,120
Okay, let's stop the camera for a while.

749
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,000
Where is my senior? She didn't come to eat.

750
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:56,920
I don't know.

751
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,000
Okay, I'll go find her.

752
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,280
Excuse me.

753
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,440
Are you also a doctor at the ER?

754
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,680
No, I'm a commissioner.

755
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,040
You're from the emergency center, right?

756
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:13,160
Later,

757
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,040
we're going to do a live emergency demonstration.

758
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,880
Can you cooperate with us?

759
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:18,760
Kiki.

760
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,160
Don't you have a lot to say to the audience?

761
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:24,400
Yes.

762
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:25,880
That's great.

763
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,400
Hello.

764
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:31,000
I'm a transfer officer

765
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,040
of 120 Emergency Command Center.

766
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,120
I sincerely urge you

767
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,040
[Please don't call]

768
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,640
120 emergency call.

769
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:40,280
Don't occupy the people's lives.

770
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,160
The correct way to call 120.

771
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,160
What is the following number?

772
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,040
First,

773
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,520
Please tell us your address.

774
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:49,120
Or a signature building around.

775
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:49,800
Second,

776
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,120
the patient's basic condition.

777
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,240
Names, gender,

778
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,640
Height, weight and so on.

779
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,520
Third,

780
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,280
Please keep your phone open

781
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,680
so that the doctor can contact you.

782
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:01,760
Yes.

783
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,680
and cold and fever.

784
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,880
patients who are not over 38 degrees Celsius

785
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,400
and minor injuries.

786
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,760
Please go to the hospital.

787
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,800
We hope to leave the ambulance

788
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,040
to more critical patients.

789
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,280
Thank you for earlier.

790
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,640
You're welcome.

791
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,160
Besides,

792
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,280
helping you

793
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,400
is to help ourselves.

794
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,560
We are in the same department.

795
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,480
By the way,

796
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,040
I remember I didn't say

797
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,800
to promote the transfer center.

798
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:39,920
How did you know?

799
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,360
Sometimes when I watch dramas,

800
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,760
I really hope

801
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,880
on TV.

802
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:51,880
Please don't occupy 120 life hotline.

803
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,000
Just a few words.

804
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,480
Let everyone see

805
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,280
you are so loyal to me today.

806
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,560
I'll give you a reward.

807
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,800
I'll treat you to dinner tonight.

808
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,040
No, Jia Qi.

809
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,720
There will be a CPR process later.

810
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,560
Time is running out.

811
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:08,680
Jiangdong, emergency.

812
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,200
Let's go together.

813
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:11,760
Ladies and gentlemen,

814
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,000
we're going to see an emergency show.

815
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,960
CPR and artificial respiration.

816
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,480
Let's welcome Dr Zhang and Dr Zheng.

817
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,880
Dr. Qi and Sun to cooperate.

818
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,400
Dr Zhang and Dr Zheng

819
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,520
You play the rescuers.

820
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,280
Girls, get ready.

821
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:25,720
Okay.

822
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,200
OK. Let’s stop for a while.

823
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,640
Ms. Cheng.

824
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,920
Is this artificial respiration?

825
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:34,880
Yes.

826
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,280
Why don't we switch to another project?

827
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,160
Why?

828
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,200
Yes, we have a lot of skills.

829
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,400
Can you show us something else?

830
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,360
We can't save this part.

831
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,680
The audience must learn this first aid skill.

832
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,560
It's very practical.

833
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,040
It can be used normally.

834
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,000
What's wrong?

835
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,360
Nothing.

836
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,160
You are all professional.

837
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,440
We've done it many times.

838
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,480
I believe you. Come on.

839
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:00,480
Xiaoyan.

840
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,160
Look at me.

841
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,200
I've been busy for half a day.

842
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,000
I ordered food delivery and water delivery.

843
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,440
This is the end.

844
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,520
Can you give me a camera?

845
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,680
What do you want?

846
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,760
The last shot.

847
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,160
Change Dr Zhang.

848
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,240
I'll work with Dr. Qi.

849
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,760
This won't do.

850
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,920
Because Dr Zhang and Dr Qi

851
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,960
are the main partners in the promotional video.

852
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:20,640
No.

853
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,400
If you want to change, switch with Dr. Jung.

854
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,120
I don't think it's a good idea.

855
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,760
Read the script then.

856
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,680
It's finally on screen.

857
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,400
Zhang Xiaomin, are you ready?

858
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,280
Yes.

859
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,720
Let’s start shooting.

860
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:40,560
East Wind first aid.

861
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:40,960
Jiangdong EMSS emergency.

862
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:41,800
Seriously?

863
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,520
What's the real deal?

864
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,960
I'm sure you'll do a full show. Help me.

865
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,560
It's a dummy.

866
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,200
It's always a dummy. What's wrong?

867
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,200
Yes, a dummy.

868
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,680
I think someone thinks too much.

869
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,200
What are you dreaming about?

870
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,400
I thought too much. I almost misunderstood.

871
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,960
Thank you, Dr. Qi, for giving me a yoga mat.

872
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,360
Thank you.

873
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,880
Okay, thank you, Dr Zhang.

874
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,880
to show you.

875
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:12,440
Okay.

876
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:17,720
Ladies and gentlemen,

877
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:18,920
let's welcome Dr Xu

878
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,400
to be our commentator.

879
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,360
Dr Xu.

880
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,320
When the heart stopped

881
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,000
when his heart stopped,

882
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,320
CPR

883
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,960
is one of the emergency measures.

884
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:33,920
The goal is 00102002.

885
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:36,360
Restore the patient's independent breathing and independent circulation

886
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,760
to prevent death of brain cells.

887
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,480
A complete CPR includes

888
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,280
30 CPRs

889
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,680
and two artificial respirations.

890
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,360
When it comes to artificial respiration,

891
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,040
should be maintained.

892
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,520
the sit-ups

893
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,040
and clean the respiratory tract.

894
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,000
and mouth to mouth mouth.

895
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,440
should be maintained to avoid cross infection.

896
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,960
You need to check every five loop.

897
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,440
Pulse and breathing.

898
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,400
Not more than ten seconds per time.

899
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,800
Without carotid artery,

900
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,680
and breathing,

901
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,960
Let's not give up.

902
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,880
We must continue the rescue.

903
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:27,720
Zhang Chi.

904
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:29,520
Liu.

905
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,200
You've been busy the whole day. You must be tired.

906
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,400
You have to study at night.

907
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,960
I'm shooting that show

908
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,400
with the TV station today.

909
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,480
I'm here to recharge.

910
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,880
I've been working here for so long.

911
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:41,720
Do you have any new experience

912
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,880
about emergency work?

913
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:46,120
Is it the same as when you first came?

914
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,720
Of course not.

915
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,000
Okay, tell me.

916
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:52,960
The emergency

917
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,720
happened outside the yard.

918
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,120
Every second comes first.

919
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:00,920
So the emergency treatment environment

920
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,640
is either in the patient's house

921
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,520
or the farmland side dish market.

922
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:07,280
But what impressed me the most

923
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:10,159
is that sometimes

924
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,560
complain and resent.

925
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,880
But as long as I receive the message to get out,

926
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:14,960
it’s like

927
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,639
like a warrior who wants to fight in battle.

928
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:20,159
Okay, it seems that you've got the point.

929
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:22,960
Are you interested in

930
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,480
in our emergency work?

931
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,480
Liu.

932
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,719
My ambition

933
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:32,679
is to study abroad.

934
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,480
I've already submitted my research.

935
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:36,760
I'm waiting for their reply.

936
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:37,960
But don't worry.

937
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:39,639
As long as I stay here,

938
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:40,880
I'll do my best.

939
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,159
Okay.

940
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:46,480
No matter you go to the Heart Research Center,

941
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:48,080
No matter you go to the Heart Research Center,

942
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:48,480
Whether you go to the Heart Research Center

943
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,000
or stay in our emergency center,

944
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,920
I will support

945
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,280
I'll support you.

946
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,040
Thank you, Liu.

947
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:57,040
But

948
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:00,520
To be a good doctor,

949
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,960
you have to be benevolent

950
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,160
but also a kind heart.

951
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,680
Have you ever heard of a doctor?

952
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:08,800
Jiangdong emergency.

953
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:09,880
Jiangdong EMSS emergency.

954
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,640
The size is big, the doctor's medicine.

955
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:16,720
This is a big topic.

956
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,240
Never heard of it.

957
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,200
Once.

958
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,160
someone once said

959
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,280
Sun Simo.

960
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,960
If there's a disease coming to seek help,

961
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,120
don't ask about the nobleness and poverty.

962
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,160
The elder Yan Chi.

963
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,440
[Relationships and friendships]

964
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:34,680
Hwayi is foolish.

965
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:35,640
and ordinary.

966
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,160
is just like the thought of my family.

967
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,320
You can't be too careful.

968
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,320
and worry about bad luck.

969
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,320
and protect your life.

970
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,000
In this way,

971
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,600
to become a great doctor.

972
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:48,840
Did my mother

973
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,160
told you this, right?

974
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,560
That's what she wants, right?

975
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:55,560
Jiangdong Emergency

976
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:56,920
Emergency.

977
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,640
I heard this

978
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,560
from your dad.

979
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:05,640
Chi.

980
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,880
Yes, if you want to be a doctor,

981
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:13,200
it must be a difficult journey.

982
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:19,080
I hope a doctor with this ambition

983
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,120
More.

984
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,360
More.

985
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:22,920
Chi.

986
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,080
Jiangdong, emergency.

987
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,080
In my heart,

988
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:27,160
your mother is such a doctor.

989
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,640
So is your father.

990
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,880
So I believe that one day,

991
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,080
you can do it too.

992
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:42,640
All right.

993
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,000
Take care of yourself.

994
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,120
I'm leaving.

995
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:48,720
Chi, have you received the package?

996
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,680
Honey, I'm leaving.

997
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,240
Drive slowly.

998
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,200
Don't worry.

999
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,000
Mr. Sun, I'm taking a walk.

1000
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,400
Are you busy?

1001
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:10,760
Mr. Cheng.

1002
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,160
Mr. Cheng.

1003
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:13,760
Are you up?

1004
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,200
Mr. Cheng.

1005
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:15,920
Get up.

1006
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:16,400
Jiki.

1007
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,920
I'm relieved to hear your voice.

1008
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,360
I'll hang soy milk and fried dough sticks at your door.

1009
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,440
Remember to eat it.

1010
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:23,680
Remember.

1011
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,680
Who put it here?

1012
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,480
I want to buy a cake.

1013
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,680
I want a cake.

1014
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,560
It's my son's birthday today.

1015
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,560
I want to buy a cake.

1016
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:33,480
Stay healthy.

1017
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,080
Boss, you've paid.

1018
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,360
OK. Take care.

1019
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,200
Sir, what are you doing?

1020
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,000
Don't you think it's dirty

1021
00:39:59,000 --> 00:39:59,960
Don't you think it's dirty?

1022
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,840
Sir, what are you doing?

1023
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:03,960
Go back to your son.

1024
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:04,560
Hurry!

1025
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:06,560
Son.

1026
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:13,240
Boss.

1027
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:14,600
Boss.

1028
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,160
I want to buy a cake.

1029
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,320
It's my son's birthday.

1030
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:19,880
Sir, are you senile?

1031
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:20,960
This is a hotel.

1032
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,080
Where did you get the cake?

1033
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,600
Let's go.

1034
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,240
Boss.

1035
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,240
It's my son's birthday today.

1036
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,320
I have to buy him a cake.

1037
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,160
Sir, this is a hotel.

1038
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,880
The cake shop is across the street.

1039
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:32,320
You can buy it there.

1040
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,520
Boss, I just want to buy a cake.

1041
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:35,440
Go over there.

1042
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,520
This is my birthday cake.

1043
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,160
You must sell it to me.

1044
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:39,960
Are you playing dirty?

1045
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:40,880
I want to buy a cake.

1046
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,600
I want a cake! I want a cake!

1047
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:45,680
Mr. Cheng.

1048
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:45,960
Mr. Cheng.

1049
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,040
Are you okay?

1050
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:49,960
How could you do this to an old man?

1051
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:50,960
I didn't mean it. I'm sorry.

1052
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,160
If something happens to you,

1053
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,320
can you afford it?

1054
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,240
I'm sorry.

1055
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,320
I didn't mean it.

1056
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:56,240
I'm sorry.

1057
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,160
Birthday cake!

1058
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,080
Sir, are you okay?

1059
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:58,960
I'm sorry.

1060
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,240
Who doesn't have an old man?

1061
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,600
If your parents were treated like this,

1062
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:03,800
if your parents are treated like this?

1063
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,080
Yes, you're right.

1064
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:05,600
I got it.

1065
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,080
Mr. Cheng.

1066
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:06,720
Sorry, sir.

1067
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:07,600
You want to buy a cake?

1068
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,800
Let's go. I'll take you there.

1069
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,320
Cake.

1070
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,800
Take your time. Let's buy a cake.

1071
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:12,880
Take your time.

1072
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:13,320
It's my son's birthday.

1073
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,040
Take your time.

1074
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,240
Be careful.

1075
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:15,720
I want to buy a cake.

1076
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,600
No hurry.

1077
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:18,960
I want to buy a cake.

1078
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,440
Cake?

1079
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,600
It's my son's birthday.

1080
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,240
Yes, the cake shop is right ahead.

1081
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:24,440
Cake

1082
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,720
And cream filling

1083
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,240
Cream filling

1084
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:36,520
It's too sunny.

1085
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,080
You look like a fairy.

1086
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:43,880
Mr. Dai.

1087
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:47,880
What is it?

1088
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,160
I've contacted

1089
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:53,320
a Chinese specialist

1090
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,440
Chinese specialist.

1091
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,800
He came to China

1092
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,240
for academic exchange and lecture.

1093
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:01,160
I asked someone

1094
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:04,880
to meet him.

1095
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:08,440
We had dinner together after the lecture.

1096
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,160
Really? That's great.

1097
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,520
Of course.

1098
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:13,720
I've introduced

1099
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:15,160
your situation.

1100
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,560
He's also very interested in you.

1101
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,800
He wants to talk to you face to face.

1102
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,280
If you can get his recommendation,

1103
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,400
go to his research center.

1104
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:27,400
That's a good idea.

1105
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:30,000
It's at Junyue Hotel.

1106
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:32,440
Come early at 5:30 today.

1107
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:33,520
to pick candies for Dong Xiao Qiu.

1108

1109
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:35,320
Don’t be late.

1110
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,000
Mr. Dai.

1111
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,560
I’m leaving now.

1112
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,160
I'll arrange the time, okay?

1113
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:41,120
You're not the only doctor

1114
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,880
You're not the only doctor.

1115
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,120
Isn't there someone else?

1116
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:47,000
Can you take a leave?

1117
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:48,960
Because this expert

1118
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:49,600
Let's go.

1119
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,120
The schedule is full.

1120
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:53,120
He’s going back tomorrow.

1121
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:54,960

1122
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,520
