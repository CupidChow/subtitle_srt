National Radio And Telvison Administration

2
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,000
Excuse me.

3
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,120
Put the baby down.

4
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,520
You can't control the water. You can't control the water.

5
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:37,759
It will flow backwards.

6
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,320
Save my son.

7
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,520
Please save my son.

8
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,320
The rest of you, step back.

9
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,200
Chao Chao.

10
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,080
Chao Chao, come.

11
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,120
Come on, wake up.

12
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,200
Wake up.

13
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,000
Chao Chao, I'm here.

14
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,520
I didn't take care of you.

15
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,520
Wake up. It's all my fault.

16
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,320
He's not breathing or heartbeat.

17
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,400
His heart is beating. CPR.

18
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,320
Jiayi.

19
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,360
Wake up, Jiayi.

20
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,280
Qi Tuo

21
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,480
Qi Tuo

22
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,120
Why are you here again?

23
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,320
If you're watching,

24
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,360
don't affect our work, okay?

25
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,560
Doctor, there's another drowning man over there.

26
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,120
Go and have a look.

27
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:47,880
Over there.

28
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,760
Another drowned one.

29
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,200
Doctor, please save my son.

30
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,079
Please save my son.

31
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,640
Chi, there's indeed a drowning person.

32
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,560
Save my son.

33
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,480
Qi Tuo

34
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,320
You guys go. It's done here.

35
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,320
I'll bring something to you.

36
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,680
Where are you going? Don't go.

37
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,240
Let that female doctor go.

38
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,880
Stay and save my son.

39
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,840
Sister Qi is fine. I'm here.

40
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,520
Okay.

41
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,840
Excuse me. Excuse me.

42
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,160
Excuse me. Excuse me.

43
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,200
Don't surround me

44
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,400
Young lady.

45
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,400
Can you hear me?

46
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,079
Get out of the way!

47
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,200
Move aside.

48
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,400
Chao Chao!

49
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,600
What's going on?

50
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,960
Why hasn't my son woken up?

51
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,160
Is it useful to keep pressing?

52
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,520
I want that male doctor.

53
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,840
Chao Chao, look at Mum. Chao Chao.

54
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:51,880
Where are her parents?

55
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,320
I don't know.

56
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,520
He was playing with his phone just now.

57
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,079
Where?

58
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:54,840
That way.

59
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,760
Stop standing here.

60
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,760
Can you look for him?

61
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,600
Find her father.

62
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:58,960
Okay.

63
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,200
Take everyone to find her father.

64
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,280
Okay. Hurry up.

65
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,200
Call him back. I don't want a female doctor.

66
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,200
I don't want a female doctor.

67
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:06,840
We can see it too.

68
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,840
We can all see it.

69
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,680
Yes, we are all doctors.

70
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,600
Don't bother.

71
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,760
That's right.

72
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,440
Chao Chao.

73
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,160
You're awake.

74
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:21,200
Hurry up.

75
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,520
Spit out the water.

76
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,200
It's okay.

77
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,520
Little girl, it's okay.

78
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:32,760
You're awake.

79
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,760
No. Go.

80
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,720
That girl is awake.

81
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,840
Do you know how to treat her?

82
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,760
Do you know how to treat it?

83
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,520
Call that male doctor back.

84
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,080
We're doing it.

85
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:41,560
We're all doctors.

86
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,520
Don't make trouble.

87
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,520
Look how tired he is.

88
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,880
That's right. How could you do this?

89
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,080
How are they the same?

90
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,400
A man and a woman.

91
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,159
How can they be the same?

92
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:51,520
The medical level is the same?

93
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,200
Aren't you all looking for male doctors?

94
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,760
Every patient is different.

95
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,080
Your son is in such a serious condition.

96
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,640
What's the difference?

97
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,400
It's serious.

98
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,760
What do you mean by serious?

99
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,520
Are you trying to shirk your responsibility?

100
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,400
Call that male doctor here.

101
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:06,960
Okay?

102
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,720
One more. One more.

103
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,920
No, Qiu. No.

104
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,120
Are you okay? Get out of the way!

105
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,760
Get out of the way!

106
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,800
Come here.

107
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,040
We're saving...

108
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,800
One, two, three, four.

109
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,880
We're saving your child.

110
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,440
Why are you doing this?

111
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,440
I won't listen.

112
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,240
How dare you hit me?

113
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,200
Stop it!

114
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,360
Stop!

115
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,000
What are you doing? Why did you hit me?

116
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:34,920
So what?

117
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,480
I hit her because my son's treatment was delayed.

118
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,480
Is 120 irresponsible?

119
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,440
You sent a female doctor to save my son.

120
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,560
What if he dies?

121
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,000
I understand how you feel.

122
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,040
But first aid experience

123
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,200
has nothing to do with gender.

124
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,440
We have a law enforcement recorder.

125
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,200
I don't want to hear it.

126
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,680
You can complain if you don't like it.

127
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,680
but you can't hurt our medical staff.

128
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,240
Got it?

129
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,440
Save my son! Save my son!

130
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,040
Sister Qi, he's breathing.

131
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,120
Chao Chao.

132
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,000
Quick, stretcher.

133
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,200
Ming, take him to the hospital.

134
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,360
The doctor saved your child.

135
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,440
and you hit him.

136
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,560
Shouldn't you apologize?

137
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,040
Yes.

138
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,040
For what?

139
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,120
If he was a male doctor,

140
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,040
my son would have recovered.

141
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,640
Are you following the car?

142
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,440
Follow or not?

143
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,440
Okay.

144
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,920
Okay.

145
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,640
What is this?

146
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,200
What bed pressure fee?

147
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,920
The hospital says

148
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,480
you have to pay deposit with a stretcher bed.

149
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,440
Don't use the hospital rules to pressure others.

150
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,120
I suspect you charge randomly.

151
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:46,920
Take it away.

152
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:47,800
What?

153
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,880
Are you talking to her about the bed pressure fee?

154
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:50,360
Yes.

155
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:51,880
Here's the thing.

156
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,480
There are many emergency patients.

157
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,240
There's no bed.

158
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,120
So your child

159
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,360
used our stretcher bed,

160
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,920
we have to charge 300 yuan deposit.

161
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,760
Did my son use it?

162
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,320
Didn't you just take the stretcher out?

163
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,000
We need to save them.

164
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:03,720
We got you another one

165
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,920
another one for you.

166
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:05,800
It's not in the hospital.

167
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,920
Ask the hospital to get the money.

168
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,040
Besides,

169
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,160
I haven't settled with you

170
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,160
I haven't got even with you.

171
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:11,760
You even asked me to sleep on the bed.

172
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,040
Why did you ask me to do that?

173
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:12,520
And you asked me to do that.

174
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,560
What kind of attitude is that?

175
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,920
It's our hospital's rule to pay for the bed pressure.

176
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,760
Your kid is using a stretcher bed.

177
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,800
not us.

178
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:20,760
What's my attitude?

179
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,120
What kind of attitude is that?

180
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,000
You're ganging up to bully me, aren't you?

181
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,480
You want money, right?

182
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,080
Okay.

183
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,080
Here, 300 yuan, right? Take it away.

184
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,760
What kind of attitude is that?

185
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,760
Is this money for me?

186
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,880
Don't talk.

187
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,040
The stretcher bed is for your kid

188
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,440
Director Qi, Director Zhang

189
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,560
You two are so busy.

190
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,240
Why are you leaving in person?

191
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:41,880
What?

192
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,240
What's wrong with the patient?

193
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,640
The kid is drowning.

194
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,400
You know what?

195
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,040
This is our boss.

196
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,400
He usually doesn't get out easily.

197
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,760
It's only for these critical patients and critical patients.

198
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,440
Let's go.

199
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,760
You two go back to work.

200
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,440
No, she...

201
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,520
Leave it to me. Don't worry.

202
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,160
Go back to your work.

203
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:00,640
Bye.

204
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,120
You're so lucky today.

205
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,920
to meet our two directors.

206
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,000
She's so young. She's already the director.

207
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,280
Of course.

208
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,400
You're young and promising.

209
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,240
Let me tell you.

210
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,280
This child

211
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,920
drowning is very dangerous.

212
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,640
The best golden time

213
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,800
is four to six minutes.

214
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,760
If we meet our director,

215
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,760
it would be too dangerous.

216
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,000
It's my fault.

217
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,040
My baby's skin.

218
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,640
I was scared.

219
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,680
You can't say that

220
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,159
Look at that smart kid.

221
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,640
Everyone is naughty, right?

222
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,159
Okay, well...

223
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,159
Nurse Zhang, take the money.

224
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,360
I, I apologize on behalf of my parents.

225
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,559
I didn't make myself clear.

226
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,160
Well...

227
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,680
Okay, take good care of the kid.

228
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,920
I have something to do. I have to go.

229
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,400
Okay.

230
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,880
I wish I had a good doctor like you.

231
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,280
I wouldn't have had so much trouble.

232
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,160
Take good care of the baby.

233
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,000
Thank you.

234
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:53,400
Okay.

235
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,280
I'll go to you now.

236
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,560
Xiao Qiu.

237
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,200
It's not your fault.

238
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,600
Even if it gets to the director,

239
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,440
we have a point.

240
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,040
But I feel sorry for Sister Qi.

241
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:21,920
How would we know?

242
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,960
There were two drowned children at the scene.

243
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,720
She even hit people.

244
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,600
What did she say?

245
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,080
It's all our fault for not studying well.

246
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,800
Sister Qi's face was scratched

247
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,440
He's just bullying Qi Tuo for his good temper.

248
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,480
If I were him,

249
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,800
who would get hurt?

250
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,160
Xiao Qiu, is Sister Qi hurt badly?

251
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,560
She went to deal with it.

252
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,800
Mr. Lu is with us.

253
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,160
She asked us to come back first.

254
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,200
How is my senior?

255
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,560
Qi Qi is not back yet.

256
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,400
I'll get an explanation.

257
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,560
I'll go with you.

258
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,560
Qiu, are you okay?

259
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,400
I heard the family members speak badly.

260
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,440
I'm fine.

261
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,280
Sister Qi protected me and got hurt.

262
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,160
I want to protect her too.

263
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,400
I'll go with you.

264
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,440
Count me in. Me too.

265
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,200
Okay.

266
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,080
It won't heal in three to four days.

267
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,200
Luckily, it won't leave a scar.

268
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,080
I'll give you three days off.

269
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,840
Have a good rest.

270
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,960
It's okay. Just a scratch.

271
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,320
It's not that delicate.

272
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,800
Tell me.

273
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,160
Why can't you

274
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,280
for yourself?

275
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,640
I'm also responsible for this.

276
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:22,960
Sit.

277
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,000
Don't do this again.

278
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,840
Doctors are human too.

279
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,400
You have to protect yourself

280
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,960
to save people.

281
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:33,800
Got it?

282
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:34,440
Yes.

283
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,560
Xiao Qiu is too young.

284
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,840
She has never experienced this.

285
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,600
Besides, luckily I scratched her.

286
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,600
She's the one who should be scratched.

287
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,480
You're still single at such a young age.

288
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,480
Zhang Chi is a bit aggressive.

289
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,400
But there was a reason.

290
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,200
If someone complains about him,

291
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,880
I'll give him a lighter punishment.

292
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,320
You only worry about others.

293
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,800
Can't you be more concerned about yourself?

294
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,320
I do.

295
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,440
You think only you

296
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,200
to worry about your men?

297
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,960
This protector is a master of the emergency center.

298
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,440
But don't worry.

299
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,480
I won't let you be punished.

300
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,080
I will seek justice for you.

301
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,560
Thank you, Director.

302
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,560
Have a good rest.

303
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,320
Goodbye, Director.

304
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,960
Director, I need to talk to you.

305
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,800
You want to see me?

306
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,480
I have something to tell you.

307
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,920
What's wrong with you?

308
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,840
Did you fight with the patient's family?

309
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,680
There are so many people in the ER.

310
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,560
We have patients and families.

311
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,080
That's ridiculous.

312
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,800
What do I look like?

313
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,440
Director Kang.

314
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,920
In order to save people at the beach,

315
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,400
she beat Dr. Qi.

316
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,960
We were in a hurry to send her to the hospital.

317
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,840
We didn't say anything.

318
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,920
When we get to the hospital,

319
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,080
Press the bed.

320
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,680
300 yuan on the floor.

321
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,680
Did you give me the money?

322
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,720
Yes, I was wrong.

323
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,440
Then throw it on the ground.

324
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,600
But you can't act like this.

325
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,920
Isn't this insulting?

326
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,800
So many people are watching.

327
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,800
What did we do?

328
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,200
We're treating patients.

329
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,400
We can't just let it go.

330
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,680
I have to help my senior.

331
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,400
Mr. Lu, don't let us down.

332
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,080
Don't be afraid

333
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,440
because of this.

334
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,040
Yeah.

335
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,320
Yes.

336
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,320
Fine.

337
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,600
You're making me headache

338
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,800
It makes my head ache.

339
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,600
Can you hear me out?

340
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,280
About Xiao Qi and Xiao Qiu,

341
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,560
I will seek justice

342
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,080
to my family.

343
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,560
No matter what the result is,

344
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,440
our center

345
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,000
will maintain

346
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,440
legal rights.

347
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,080
Are you satisfied now?

348
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,040
Director, it's not about whether we're satisfied or not.

349
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,040
we have to work in the future.

350
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,280
We won't feel burdened, right?

351
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,960
My goodness, I was wrong.

352
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,200
Mr. Lu, I'm off work.

353
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,480
I'll go with you. I'll go now.

354
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,320
I want to go too.

355
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,840
Stop it.

356
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,440
Hurry up. Get back to work.

357
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,200
Come with me.

358
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:03,800
Me too.

359
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,080
Dr. Qi is at the beach.

360
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:10,840
to save your son.

361
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,440
Why did you hit him?

362
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,960
You hit me so badly.

363
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,560
Look at his face.

364
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,600
How did I know it was so heavy?

365
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,160
I was in a hurry.

366
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,760
And the 300 yuan for bed pressure,

367
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,800
just throw it on the floor.

368
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,280
How disrespectful!

369
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,560
Let me give you an example.

370
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,800
If someone pays for your company and throws it in front of you,

371
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,840
how do you feel?

372
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:28,920
Besides,

373
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,680
Who are you to discriminate against a female doctor?

374
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:31,960
Do you know

375
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,320
in the medical field?

376
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,560
I don't care how many female experts there are in the country.

377
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,400
What's wrong with me looking for male doctors?

378
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:39,840
Besides,

379
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,160
Did I scratch her?

380
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,200
I'll teach you a lesson.

381
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,840
That was a minor injury.

382
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,600
You can be detained for 15 days.

383
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:50,800
In three months,

384
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,160
if Dr. Qi checks her wound,

385
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,480
her wound

386
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,680
is more than 20 square meters.

387
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,160
you can be sentenced to a year.

388
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,320
Don't scare me.

389
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,680
If this is your attitude,

390
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,320
we'll leave it to the police.

391
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:02,840
Call the police.

392
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:03,600
Call the police.

393
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,600
No, no, no.

394
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,560
Three.

395
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,440
Three

396
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,800
I'm really sorry.

397
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,440
I'm sorry.

398
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:09,800
My wife

399
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,480
my wife was too impulsive.

400
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,680
When we were treating her,

401
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,840
I kept telling her

402
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,840
I said we should find a time

403
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,960
to apologize to the doctor.

404
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,720
My son just got hospitalized.

405
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,280
We can't leave either.

406
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:22,920
0501200.

407
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,200
How about

408
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,200
I'll take my wife

409
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,800
to your emergency center tomorrow.

410
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,960
and sincerely apologize to the doctor. 10045.

411
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:30,920
What do you think?

412
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,400
OK?

413
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:35,960
Say something.

414
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,440
I spoiled her. She's too stubborn.

415
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,280
I'm sorry.

416
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:57,560
Xiao Qiu.

417
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,040
How is my master?

418
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,480
I feel sorry for him.

419
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,320
It's time to

420
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,920
these people who hurt doctors.

421
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,440
We should figure something out.

422
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,200
Yes.

423
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:12,960
Yuan.

424
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,400
You were also hurt.

425
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,560
Of course.

426
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,320
When we first joined the industry,

427
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,160
the family called

428
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,080
on the phone.

429
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:24,560
We thought

430
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,600
something big happened.

431
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,200
The driver is driving.

432
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,560
I was about to fly out.

433
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,080
When I arrived at the scene,

434
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,320
Guess what?

435
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,080
What do you think?

436
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,080
Because that old man

437
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,720
wanted to get medicine from the hospital.

438
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:42,040
I don't want to take a taxi from upstairs. It's troublesome.

439
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:43,800
And?

440
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,400
And then?

441
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,440
The old man has lung disease.

442
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,560
but he doesn't have any emergency.

443
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,600
I was just saying.

444
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,600
You don't need to

445
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,680
call us 120.

446
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,960
Unless you have lung cancer.

447
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,200
In the end, because of that,

448
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:05,200
the family said I cursed his father.

449
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,440
He gave me a punch.

450
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,480
My glasses fell off.

451
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,320
I almost hurt my eyes.

452
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,160
Not bad.

453
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,920
We're quite skilled too.

454
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,600
I'll hit him perfectly.

455
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,400
How dare you hit him back?

456
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,600
Aren't you afraid of being complained?

457
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,080
Complaint?

458
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,320
I'll definitely be sued.

459
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,680
They're in court.

460
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,160
However,

461
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,920
for this matter,

462
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,320
but it still

463
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,160
in my childhood.

464
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,440
This is why

465
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,840
I always emphasize

466
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,800
the importance of the speech, you know?

467
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,200
But I think

468
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,320
it has nothing to do with the speech.

469
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,400
I think this is a proper sexual discrimination.

470
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,480
Let me tell you.

471
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,560
Sister Qi and I have been out for so many years.

472
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,800
We've met this many times.

473
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,800
Some patients and families

474
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,400
They don't trust female doctors.

475
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,560
That old man

476
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,960
He wouldn't let Sister Qi do acupuncture.

477
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,400
or needles.

478
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,440
Why did you ask Huang to do it?

479
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,319
I wouldn't.

480
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,440
Huang wouldn't do that.

481
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,560
Then we can only do nothing.

482
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:12,839
In the end,

483
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,960
missed the time for treatment.

484
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:17,560
I was scolded by my family.

485
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:18,920
I have no choice.

486
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:19,800
You're right.

487
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,880
In our doctors' eyes,

488
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,160
patients don't care about age or gender.

489
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,319
However,

490
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,119
doctors have no gender.

491
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,400
But from the patient's perspective,

492
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,920
middle-aged doctors have more clinical experience.

493
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,160
They will feel more at ease.

494
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,160
The trust of young doctors

495
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,200
is not that strong.

496
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,120
But it's not easy

497
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,320
to be a doctor.

498
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,200
Our nurses are the same.

499
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,960
Everyone can accept the survival of the fittest.

500
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,880
But I don't want to be treated differently.

501
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,480
That's right.

502
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,200
Everyone here

503
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,480
stay with value.

504
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,320
with their ability.

505
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:53,920
Yes.

506
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,280
The takeout is here. Take it away.

507
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,400
Bye.

508
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:58,920
Delivery.

509
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,600
Zhang Chi ordered it.

510
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,160
Dr Zhang, where is she?

511
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,600
Qiu, come here.

512
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,800
Is my master still hungry?

513
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,400
She hasn't eaten yet.

514
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,280
Give this to her.

515
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,400
This is Dr Zhang's takeout.

516
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,880
It's inappropriate.

517
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,280
Why not?

518
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,760
Zhang Chi is my junior.

519
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,360
I can invite him back later.

520
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,640
Take it.

521
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,040
Remember.

522
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,520
Tell my master I bought it myself.

523
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:35,760
Go.

524
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,400
Go.

525
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,240
BBQ pork delivery and soda.

526
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,400
When did Dr Zhang

527
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,760
have the same taste as Sister Qi?

528
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,480
Charge!

529
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:07,880
I just charged.

530
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:08,800
0106 is good, Zhang Chi.

531
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,880
Good job, Zhang Chi.

532
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,960
You're working hard now.

533
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,080
Keep it up.

534
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,240
Thank you for your encouragement. Don't get infected.

535
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,240
Dad.

536
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,600
I won't go home if I work overtime that night.

537
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:32,760
What?

538
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,120
Working overtime again?

539
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,240
Qi Qi,

540
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,840
The advertisement said

541
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,600
girls

542
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,360
stay up one more night.

543
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,720
There will be more wrinkles on your head.

544
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:47,360
Really.

545
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,240
Xiao Qu is here.

546
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,320
She's making western food for us.

547
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,240
It's been almost two hours.

548
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,960
Qi Qi, how about this?

549
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,320
I'll call your leader

550
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,120
and ask him to change your shift.

551
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,120
No, don't call him.

552
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,480
Why did you call the leader?

553
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,880
We're having a hot battle.

554
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:10,640
One radish and one pit.

555
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,520
Dr. Qi, let's go.

556
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,240
Hurry, a critical patient is waiting for you.

557
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,000
Coming. Coming.

558
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,520
Dad, look, he's looking for me.

559
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,600
Don't make trouble for me.

560
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,480
You guys eat.

561
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,120
I can't do anything about you.

562
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,720
No matter how busy you are, don't forget to eat.

563
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,240
Don't worry.

564
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,720
I'll stay in the lounge.

565
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,200
OK. OK. Bye.

566
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Okay, bye

567
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,240
Is it Qi Tuo?

568
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:36,840
Is she downstairs?

569
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,480
I'll pick her up.

570
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:38,880
No.

571
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,600
Qu.

572
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,520
Sorry.

573
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,120
Qiqi is working overtime.

574
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,120
He won't come back tonight.

575
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,600
It's okay, uncle and aunt.

576
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,320
Let's eat.

577
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:47,720
Okay.

578
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,240
The dishes are cold. Hurry.

579
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,840
Okay, let's eat.

580
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:52,640
Try my cooking.

581
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,240
Have a seat.

582
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,240
Beautiful.

583
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,400
Not bad, Dr. Zhang.

584
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,360
You're smart.

585
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,120
I don't want your dad to worry.

586
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,120
Go home now.

587
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,000
I'm going to the lounge.

588
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,720
I'm staying in the lounge too.

589
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:09,880
Why?

590
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,360
You stay in the lounge.

591
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,320
Don't you have an assistant if you want to go out?

592
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,360
Go home and rest.

593
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,600
I can live anywhere by myself.

594
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,200
I don't care about that, Zhang Chi.

595
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,480
What do you think?

596
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,760
Good, Qu.

597
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,200
Great.

598
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,480
You did better than this restaurant.

599
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,360
That's good.

600
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,080
Not only it's delicious, there are also flowers.

601
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,240
The atmosphere is here.

602
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,760
I'm really sorry.

603
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,720
This is all here.

604
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,360
There's no point at work.

605
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,120
Don't say that, uncle.

606
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,120
Originally,

607
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,080
for taking care of me.

608
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,640
Work is more important. It's okay.

609
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,600
As a girl,

610
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,320
value work so much?

611
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,960
It's better to get married early

612
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,240
Qi, what are you talking about?

613
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,760
What's wrong with a girl?

614
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,360
Can't a girl do business?

615
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,760
My partner is also a girl.

616
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,080
She’s very capable.

617
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,600
Don’t put too much pressure on Qi.

618
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:24,600
Right.

619
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,600
Sure.

620
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,600
You young people have their logic.

621
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,080
I can't convince you.

622
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,120
Have you contacted Qi recently?

623
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:39,880
No.

624
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,360
I

625
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,080
I don't plan to date recently.

626
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,320
Let's start with business.

627
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,120
Okay.

628
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:48,200
Good

629
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,520
Qi Qi

630
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,840
has always had an idea.

631
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,120
Now that she's grown up,

632
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,640
we can't control her.

633
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,320
However,

634
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,600
we are different.

635
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,840
When you're free,

636
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,120
when you're free.

637
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,880
As long as you don't mind,

638
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,000
I'll come often.

639
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,360
Don't say that.

640
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,360
Eat more.

641
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,400
Qi Tuo usually doesn't come back from work.

642
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,120
Where does she live?

643
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:21,760
They...

644
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,480
There's a lounge in the emergency center.

645
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:26,720
What's the condition?

646
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,600
A lounge.

647
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,520
Two bunks.

648
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:33,880
Who is tired?

649
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,480
Just take a nap.

650
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,880
Does she live there often?

651
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:38,720
No.

652
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:40,720
This one.

653
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:43,000
Qi Qi said this is not enough.

654
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,760
She lives with a colleague from afar.

655
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,080
She usually goes home

656
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,600
She usually goes home.

657
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,720
I live with this female colleague sometimes.

658
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:56,600
Like this.

659
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,440
When I go back later,

660
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,400
when I go back.

661
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,400
That's great.

662
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:01,920
Thank you.

663
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,080
Don't mention it

664
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,680
Come on Qi

665
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,120
Auntie

666
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,360
Here.

667
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,320
Have some more.

668
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,000
Not bad.

669
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,240
What a pity.

670
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:32,040
Qu is really a good girl.

671
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,480
Alright.

672
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,680
I'm sure he has someone he likes.

673
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,560
You're so good. You'll be robbed.

674
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,560
No way.

675
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,440
I've known him for almost three years.

676
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,720
Why didn't he mention it to me?

677
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,760
Sometimes,

678
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,560
I have to believe in women's sixth sense.

679
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,200
Anyway, I think

680
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,480
he is not suitable for Qiqi.

681
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,040
I think they are a good match.

682
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,600
Don't make trouble.

683
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,280
Qiqi is under a lot of pressure.

684
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,040
Don’t bother her.

685
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,240
Plaster.

686
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:35,920
It's not expired, right?

687
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,080
It's in March next year.

688
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,960
Let me help you.

689
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,680
Your method

690
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:47,880
all patients are delayed by you.

691
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,880
It's not an emergency.

692
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,360
This way.

693
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,120
Sister Qi

694
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,240
Plaster.

695
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,080
What's wrong?

696
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,840
A handsome guy is looking for you.

697
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:05,560
Who is it?

698
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,560
I've never seen him.

699
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,320
He looks like a foreigner.

700
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,680
He brought us a lot of delicious food.

701
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,600
We all have some.

702
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:11,120
Okay.

703
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,320
Do you want some?

704
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,040
No, I'm tired.

705
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,600
I’m tired.

706
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,680
Good job.

707
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,360
The new love is progressing so fast.

708
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,440
You're announcing the sovereignty so soon.

709
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,920
One needle for each of you.

710
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,520
Master, why are you here?

711
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,440
Don't talk nonsense.

712
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,280
He's not my boyfriend.

713
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:37,200
You're back.

714
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:37,840
Hello.

715
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,200
This is the soup Uncle Qi made for you.

716
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:39,920
Drink it while it's hot.

717
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,320
You came all the way here. Look at you.

718
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:42,840
What happened to your face?

719
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,480
It's okay. I scratched it.

720
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,360
Don't tell my dad.

721
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:46,920
No.

722
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:47,920
We were beaten.

723
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,160
Xiao Qiu, you...

724
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,440
I just want to

725
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,560
to help you.

726
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,800
What brother-in-law?

727
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,600
You have to call him uncle.

728
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,520
Isn't he my dad's friend?

729
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,240
You're messing with the seniors.

730
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:07,200
That Qi Tuo is right

731
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,200
I've known Uncle Qi for a long time.

732
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,200
I came here today

733
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,680
because Uncle Qi was worried

734
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,680
I didn't eat well at work.

735
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,000
I bought something to visit you.

736
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:14,920
Don't get me wrong.

737
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:15,680
Come out and talk.

738
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,440
Thank you.

739
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,280
Thank you.

740
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:18,840
For what?

741
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,960
I think you still have a chance.

742
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,600
But the hope is slim.

743
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,440
How could you say that?

744
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,680
What do you mean by that?

745
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,200
Let me tell you.

746
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,000
You can't defeat your childhood friend.

747
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,240
But you are not.

748
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:35,920
Who says I'm not?

749
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:36,920
I am.

750
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:37,600
You're not.

751
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:38,920
I am.

752
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:41,560
You're not.

753
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,000
Are you really okay?

754
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,680
I'm fine. I'll be fine in three days.

755
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:50,720
Don't tell my dad.

756
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,080
He won't stop if he knows.

757
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,680
Fine, Uncle Qi is worried about you.

758
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,120
But I didn't say hello to you today.

759
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:58,600
I'm sorry.

760
00:27:58,840 --> 00:27:59,240
It's okay.

761
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,440
Next time he asks you to take things,

762
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,080
Ignore him.

763
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,920
They're busy. It's a waste of time.

764
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:03,920
Okay.

765
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:04,720
By the way,

766
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,680
I have something else to do today.

767
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:07,960
I told you

768
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,840
about the video plan of the Emergency Hospital.

769
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,640
We discussed it at the regular meeting yesterday.

770
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:14,120
Everyone thinks the prospect is great.

771
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,680
So we need you to help us.

772
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,680
No problem.

773
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,680
Just contact me.

774
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,720
Okay, I'm leaving.

775
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:19,440
Okay, this way.

776
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:20,640
Sorry. Bye.

777
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,200
Bye bye

778
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,400
What are you doing?

779
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,440
I'm taking a towel.

780
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,080
Get out.

781
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:01,720
I'm not.

782
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,040
I'll give you whatever you want.

783
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,160
I want a towel.

784
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,160
I need to apply ice on your face.

785
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,240
I'm afraid you'll get cold.

786
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,480
Get some ice.

787
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,800
You have a conscience.

788
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,120
Why are you flattering me?

789
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,440
What can I do for you?

790
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:30,840
I...

791
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,560
wanted to thank you a long time ago.

792
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,000
I heard later that

793
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,440
you also helped me with Yangyang's mom's work.

794
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:41,040
You got a bonus for this

795
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,160
Thank you.

796
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,480
Don't take it seriously.

797
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,360
I'm your teacher.

798
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,600
I'll be responsible if anything happens to you.

799
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,640
Isn't that normal?

800
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,240
By the way,

801
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,160
Mr. Lu and Xiao Qiu

802
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,160
went to find

803
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,920
the woman who hit her in the afternoon.

804
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,200
Her husband agreed.

805
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,880
to bring his wife

806
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:00,960
to apologize to you tomorrow.

807
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,160
I know. Mr. Lu told me.

808
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,200
How did you know? You went too?

809
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,960
I'm afraid of two girls.

810
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,960
Good for you now.

811
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,400
You look like a disciple.

812
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,000
You have a conscience.

813
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,360
Look how sharp your mouth is now.

814
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,120
When they hit you,

815
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,640
when they hit you.

816
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,640
Let me teach you.

817
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:21,640
Let me ask you.

818
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,720
They had a conflict at the scene.

819
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,680
What should we do if the family is emotional?

820
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,640
Hit him back or scold him back?

821
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,960
You can't do anything.

822
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,160
You have to be patient.

823
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,440
You have only one way to endure.

824
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,440
You have to save him.

825
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,640
You must save him first.

826
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,840
Tell them I'm saving someone with action.

827
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:36,640
Can you remember?

828
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,160
Go back.

829
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,400
Why are you squatting here? Sleep with me.

830
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,920
What are you talking about?

831
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,960
Your socks are wrong.

832
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,720
Don't pay attention to my socks.

833
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,240
My uncle went out for a meeting.

834
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,200
Just stay here.

835
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,120
It's so clean.

836
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:30,920
You stay in the bedroom and I stay in the study.

837
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,360
No, I can stay in the study.

838
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,440
No way.

839
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,200
I told my uncle

840
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,560
I told my uncle.

841
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,640
My uncle said

842
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,200
when you stay here,

843
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:39,960
he'll pay for it.

844
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,120
You should beat him up.

845
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,480
Why did you tell the elders?

846
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,400
I'm not embarrassed enough.

847
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:45,800
It's the same.

848
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,960
You didn't fight back

849
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,360
That's good.

850
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:49,720
Right?

851
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,200
Your face...

852
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,400
I have a very good ointment.

853
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,440
Let me apply it for you.

854
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,440
You can be better than my medicine.

855
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,200
My medicine is good.

856
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,440
I love beauty so much.

857
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,880
Love beauty is the scar.

858
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,440
Really?

859
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,600
You won't get a scar, right?

860
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,240
No.

861
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,240
Does it look deep?

862
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,440
A deep one.

863
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,400
One is a bit deep and the other is not bad.

864
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,400
I can't see it myself.

865
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,960
Apply my ointment for three days.

866
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,480
Are you bragging?

867
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,880
I'm doing an advertisement.

868
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,240
You'll be fine after applying my medicine.

869
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:22,920
It's quite cool.

870
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:23,480
Not bad.

871
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,760
Take some for me later.

872
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,960
I'll give you the tube. I'm generous.

873
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:27,600
Really?

874
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,120
Okay.

875
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:35,240
By the way,

876
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,400
I heard a gossip yesterday.

877
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,440
I heard that a very handsome man

878
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,640
sent it to you at night.

879
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,960
What?

880
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,400
Love or supper?

881
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,080
Why didn't you tell me?

882
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:45,480
Don't mention it.

883
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,840
No, we've met in my dad's tea room.

884
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,200
in my dad's teahouse.

885
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,160
Like a foreigner.

886
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,640
Qu Yufan, my dad's friend.

887
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,440
They are talking nonsense.

888
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:54,920
Chen Xue told me

889
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,240
that he's very handsome.

890
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,640
He looks like a deity.

891
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,160
What kind of look is that?

892
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,880
I've been trying to explain.

893
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,120
No one believed me and spread it every day.

894
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,240
From last night till now.

895
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:03,800
It's endless.

896
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,280
It's okay. I'll clarify it for you.

897
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,400
If you want to catch up with my senior,

898
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,800
you must pass me first.

899
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,480
What level is this?

900
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:12,960
Beauty Pass.

901
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,520
Jiaqi is silly.

902
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,480
We haven't seen each other for a long time.

903
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:19,840
Let's take a photo here.

904
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:20,600
You tricked me.

905
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,120
How can you take a photo with me with my face like this?

906
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,440
I have an idea.

907
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,520
You know there's a beauty camera, right?

908
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,720
It can grind the skin

909
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:26,560
Yuan Yuan

910
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,760
Fix up what you need

911
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:29,600
Put them away.

912
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:30,800
Okay.

913
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:46,880
Zheng Bo.

914
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:48,520
Look.

915
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,960
Jiaqi posted it on her Moments. Did you see it?

916
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,600
Isn't she pretty?

917
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,000
This is them.

918
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,600
I can't tell it's too hard.

919
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,080
Go and like it.

920
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,240
I just got out of the car. I don't have time.

921
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:03,680
Chi,

922
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,880
Aren't you off today?

923
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,440
I applied to the center

924
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,520
to go with Xu Chengyuan today.

925
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,520
What? With...

926
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:12,520
Call.

927
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:16,159
Follow me.

928
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:17,239
Yes, with you.

929
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:18,600
This...

930
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,520
What happened?

931
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,719
that made Dr. Zhang love me so much?

932
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,800
I want to learn how to speak with you.

933
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,960
I remember someone once said

934
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,800
that you don't like my outfit.

935
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,600
They said I lied and didn't have medical ethics.

936
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:37,440
It happened last month.

937
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,520
Why did you suddenly turn 180 degrees

938
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,719
to be my master?

939
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:41,800
I'm not used to it.

940
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,159
I thought about it.

941
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,360
Some of your moves are right.

942
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,440
So I want to learn from you.

943
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:50,960
But I won't learn how to lie.

944
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,239
How could you say that?

945
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:54,719
When did I lie?

946
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,320
I've never lied to you.

947
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,600
Hippocrates once said

948
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,320
the doctor has three magic tools.

949
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:01,720
language.

950
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:03,160
Medicine.

951
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,240
And scalpel.

952
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,160
Look. Judging from the order,

953
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,440
language comes first.

954
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,880
That means it's very important.

955
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,520
But many doctors

956
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,600
have forgotten about it.

957
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:14,960
Of course.

958
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,600
Some of them have a unique personality.

959
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,360
For example, my master.

960
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,800
He's carefree.

961
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:22,680
Straightforward

962
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:23,520
He's too straightforward.

963
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:24,360
Go ahead if anything happens. Make up.

964
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,000
Just go ahead.

965
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,360
I don't think I can learn her for the rest of my life.

966
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,800
But you are a potential person.

967
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,360
So you have to study hard.

968
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,960
You have to study hard.

969
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,080
When you learn to protect my master,

970
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,240
It won't be in vain, right?

971
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,280
It's so hot today.

972
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:46,800
So hot.

973
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,720
Doctor, there's no empty bed.

974
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:52,520
I need to press the bed for a while.

975
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,800
It'll be available in ten minutes.

976
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,280
Okay, let's wait for ten minutes.

977
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,600
Here comes the mission.

978
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,880
An old lady fell on the road.

979
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:05,800
A fracture.

980
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:07,280
What should we do?

981
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,400
The stretcher bed is still inside.

982
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,000
I'll explain to the center.

983
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:14,120
The bed pressure is getting worse.

984
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,880
Especially in Sanjia Hospital.

985
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:19,280
many patients are minor injuries.

986
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,120
They don't go to the community hospital

987
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,080
in front of my house.

988
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,440
Why do you have to come to Sanjia Hospital?

989
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,560
Yes, there were more outpatients.

990
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,240
Actually, there are many minor problems.

991
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,120
in a second-year hospital.

992
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,800
or the community hospital.

993
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:31,680
Yes.

994
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,400
Look at you two.

995
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,520
You know too much.

996
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,000
This is a long-term project.

997
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:39,120
We can only drive to pick up the patients

998
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,960
to encourage the patients to get treated separately.

999
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,240
It's just a minor illness.

1000
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,520
near the hospital.

1001
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,720
Try not to occupy Sanjia Hospital.

1002
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:46,840
of Sanjia Hospital.

1003
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,280
Dr Xu is so thoughtful.

1004
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,400
So stop complaining.

1005
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:50,440
The bed is available.

1006
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,280
You can take the stretcher.

1007
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,160
I'll get the bed.

1008
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,400
Yuan Er, hurry up.

1009
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:53,800
Okay.

1010
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,840
Today's teaching mission is about to begin.

1011
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,120
Dr. Zhang, learn from him.

1012
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:00,560
Let's go.

1013
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:12,840
What's going on?

1014
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:13,840
Did you call him?

1015
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,240
I've called you several times.

1016
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,400
Mom, don't touch it.

1017
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,440
Don't press it.

1018
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,600
Hurry up.

1019
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,240
Call again.

1020
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:20,880
Okay.

1021
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:21,680
Why isn't he here yet?

1022
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,400
You guys are too slow.

1023
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,080
My mom has been sitting here for half a day.

1024
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,720
What's wrong with you in such a hot day?

1025
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:27,560
Are you trying to kill my mom?

1026
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:28,280
Granny Fushun.

1027
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,400
You are so lucky.

1028
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,960
It's so hot

1029
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,800
They know you fell down

1030
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,120
They're all here with you

1031
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,120
So filial.

1032
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,840
Let me check it for you.

1033
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,000
Is your right leg okay?

1034
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:40,880
Yes.

1035
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:41,840
Left leg.

1036
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:43,600
It hurts here.

1037
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,280
I dare not move.

1038
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,560
Okay, I'll be gentle.

1039
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,680
I'll be gentle.

1040
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,120
Are you fractured?

1041
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,120
It's nothing. Don't worry.

1042
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,800
Yuan Yuan, bring me the clapper

1043
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,400
Now it's just dehydration

1044
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,800
Yuan Yuan, the glucose you prepared

1045
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,360
I'm really sorry

1046
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:10,880
It's okay. Don't worry.

1047
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:11,240
Okay.

1048
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,400
Well, the last patient has been bedridden.

1049
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,840
That's why we're late.

1050
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,800
But when we heard that the elderly fell down,

1051
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,880
we were very anxious.

1052
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,600
Look at the sweat.

1053
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,960
We really came here

1054
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,640
on the way here.

1055
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,120
So there is a special situation.

1056
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,160
No wonder I'm late.

1057
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,280
I'm sorry.

1058
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,280
You guys worked hard too.

1059
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,880
We are a little emotional.

1060
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,120
It's okay. We should work hard.

1061
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,720
Well, thank you.

1062
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:36,400
It's so sunny.

1063
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,840
and wait for us here.

1064
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,000
Okay, it's done.

1065
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,160
Put the stretcher on.

1066
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:42,920
Come on.

1067
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,400
Okay. Slowly.

1068
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:45,680
Slowly.

1069
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Let's see who's keeping the bed.

1070
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,120
How about you?

1071
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,840
You're her granddaughter, right?

1072
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,680
I'm not her granddaughter. I'm her daughter.

1073
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:55,520
I'm almost 40.

1074
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,120
You don't look like

1075
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,360
You look like

1076
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:58,840
Come on.

1077
00:38:59,080 --> 00:38:59,600
Slow down.

1078
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:02,000
Okay, if you two want to go,

1079
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,280
get a taxi, okay?

1080
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,000
Okay.

1081
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,280
Grandma, don't worry.

1082
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,440
I'll pick you

1083
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,960
the best and thinnest needle.

1084
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,120
It won't hurt to get an IV.

1085
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:17,440
Okay.

1086
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,840
Doctor, I'm sorry about earlier.

1087
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,360
I didn't expect you to be so attentive.

1088
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,120
Have some water.

1089
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:23,360
It's okay.

1090
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,600
Take a taxi and follow us.

1091
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,280
OK. OK. OK. Let’s go.

1092
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,840
There's no fine needle.

1093
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:31,880
You're lying again.

1094
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,240
Watch and learn. Get in.

1095
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:42,080
Ambullace.

1096
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,040
I said,

1097
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,280
why don't we call Qi Qi?

1098
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,160
It's not good to go in directly.

1099
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,360
Why not?

1100
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,800
I'm bringing breakfast to my daughter.

1101
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,840
I don't need an appointment.

1102
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,280
You all work so hard.

1103
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,040
I think they just stayed up all night.

1104
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,680
After all, it's work.

1105
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,240
I'm sure I'll meet my leader.

1106
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,600
Don't cause bad influence on Qiqi.

1107
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:14,920
It's better to meet them.

1108
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,720
I'm looking for their leader.

1109
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:19,720
I want to ask

1110
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,240
which one

1111
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,360
detained my daughter for three days.

1112
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,400
and made her work overtime day and night.

1113
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:27,680
Okay, let's go.

1114
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:28,720
The food is getting cold.

1115
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:29,800
Let's go.

1116
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:31,920
Hey,

1117
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,480
You always bring food.

1118
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,720
You're too used to it.

1119
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,240
Morning.

1120
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,040
Morning.

1121
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:43,160
Are you feeling better?

1122
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:43,520
What?

1123
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:44,840
It's still a little swollen.

1124
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,280
It's a bruise.

1125
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:47,840
My parents.

1126
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:48,840
Help me block it.

1127
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,480
Qiqi is over there.

1128
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:51,920
Qi Qi

1129
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:52,680
Qi Qi.

1130
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:54,800
Qiqi.

1131
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,120
Why are you here?

1132
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,400
I brought you breakfast.

1133
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,120
You haven't been home for three days.

1134
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,400
