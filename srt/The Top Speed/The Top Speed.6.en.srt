1
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,040
National Radio. and Telvison. Administration.

2
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,360
Why are you so surprised?

3
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,240
Please.

4
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,479
We're at work. Stop it.

5
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:36,920
Let's go home.

6
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,000
No, just say it.

7
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,120
The family scratched it accidentally.

8
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:42,680
What?

9
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,800
He really got beaten up by his family.

10
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,479
What happened?

11
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,120
They hit you when you saved them.

12
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,120
Don't make a fuss. We're colleagues.

13
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,120
Go back.

14
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:51,800
Hurry up.

15
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,120
What happened?

16
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,240
I'm fine now.

17
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,039
No wonder you haven't been home for three days.

18
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,000
So you're avoiding us.

19
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:58,920
Yes.

20
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,240
It's so popular now.

21
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,000
I wonder what happened three days ago.

22
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,240
Who is this person?

23
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:04,920
Who is he?

24
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,800
I'll go find them now

25
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,240
Stop it Qi

26
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,320
I'm working.

27
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,360
Is there anyone like you?

28
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,360
You still won't tell me, right?

29
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,240
You think I can't do anything if you don't tell me, right?

30
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,800
How did you deal with it?

31
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,240
What do you mean

32
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,920
It's all done. What's there to deal with?

33
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,560
Who are you?

34
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:20,680
He...

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,320
I'm a colleague of Dr Qi's car.

36
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,800
Colleague of the same car?

37
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,160
What were you doing

38
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:26,920
What are you doing?

39
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,240
I'm saving another patient.

40
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,120
Stop making excuses.

41
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,560
You can't even protect a female colleague.

42
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,680
What kind of man are you?

43
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,360
You're right.

44
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,120
I failed to protect Dr. Qi.

45
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,160
Protect what?

46
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,240
I'm with him.

47
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,880
I have to protect him.

48
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,360
You know nothing.

49
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,360
It's me. I failed to protect you.

50
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,360
Stop talking.

51
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,320
Please go back.

52
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,120
No way.

53
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,240
My daughter was beaten up like this.

54
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,040
I'm not in the mood to reply.

55
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,560
Yes, there must be an explanation.

56
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,560
Is Mr. Lu

57
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,560
in that office?

58
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,160
Don't be like this

59
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,320
I'll find her now Qi

60
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,920
I have to make things clear today.

61
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,000
Come with me.

62
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:55,800
Let's go

63
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,480
Qi

64
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,240
We should make it clear.

65
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,000
Seriously?

66
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,240
Yes.

67
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,160
Stop looking. Don't look. Aren't you embarrassed?

68
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,120
This is ridiculous.

69
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,480
How could he hit someone?

70
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,160
Oh my god.

71
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:11,880
Mr. Lu.

72
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,720
Since young,

73
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,520
my daughter

74
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,400
like my eyes.

75
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,280
I can't even

76
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,600
even a strand of hair.

77
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,079
Today,

78
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,079
I was beaten when I saved someone.

79
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,760
How can I stand it?

80
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,200
If it weren't for her personality,

81
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,000
this wouldn't have happened.

82
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,880
I was careless that day.

83
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,600
She suddenly...

84
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,480
Besides, she's a woman.

85
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,240
I don't hit women.

86
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,560
You know it all the time.

87
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,920
Yes, Qi's father.

88
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,560
This won't happen again.

89
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,480
Our car

90
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,240
in our car.

91
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,560
With male colleagues,

92
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,800
they won't dare to be rude.

93
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,680
Don't mention male comrades.

94
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,120
One vegetable melon.

95
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,120
It's useless.

96
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,240
Isn't he there too?

97
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,760
I'll still be beaten.

98
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,920
I told you I'll take care of her.

99
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,160
I need to take care of his safety.

100
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,240
My dad

101
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,320
Uncle, auntie.

102
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,920
I'll take care of

103
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,680
in the future.

104
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,920
If anything goes wrong,

105
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,880
you can punish me.

106
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,440
Let's go. Let's go.

107
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,040
Let's go back. Stop messing around.

108
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:15,760
We're leaving.

109
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,360
Qi Qi.

110
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,399
You know her temper.

111
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:21,240
No, I'm not done yet.

112
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,240
Let's talk later.

113
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,120
Sorry, Mr. Lu.

114
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,120
It's okay.

115
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,000
Goodbye

116
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,160
Qi

117
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,440
0106 Train Team.

118
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,920
[A pregnant woman passed out]

119
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,040
A pregnant woman fainted.

120
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:36,920
Please go immediately.

121
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:38,360
Copy that.

122
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,120
Let's go now.

123
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,440
There seems to be a car following us.

124
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,320
Where is it?

125
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,000
The one at the back.

126
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:02,920
This one.

127
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,240
Follow us.

128
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,560
Really?

129
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,160
Drive slowly.

130
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,480
What if we lose him?

131
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,560
Hold tight. Hold tight.

132
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,440
Got it.

133
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:24,840
Jiang A, 35798.

134
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,360
Can you do it?

135
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,800
You're not even good at driving.

136
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,560
You want to be a bodyguard for your daughter?

137
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,320
The leaders and colleagues have promised me many times.

138
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,480
Why can't you listen?

139
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,560
My own daughter.

140
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,360
I'm the only one who feels sorry for her.

141
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,800
I don't believe it.

142
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,640
Over there.

143
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,240
Yunyun, wake up.

144
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,400
Excuse me.

145
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,400
Excuse me

146
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,640
Excuse me.

147
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,160
Doctor, please save my daughter.

148
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,000
How long has it been?

149
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,120
She's five months pregnant.

150
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,880
Be quiet. Tell me clearly.

151
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,040
She's five months pregnant.

152
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:17,880
Five months pregnant.

153
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,400
How long has she been unconscious? Tell me.

154
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,760
Ten minutes.

155
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,400
More than ten minutes, right?

156
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,880
Can you hear me?

157
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,400
Can you hear me?

158
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,560
Your body temperature is a bit high.

159
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,400
Qiu, take your temperature.

160
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,240
Get the ice pack ready.

161
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,560
37.7 degrees. It's a bit high.

162
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,280
Let's cool down.

163
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,480
Let's open a vein for her.

164
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,159
Do you have a basic disease?

165
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:45,680
No.

166
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,040
Don't you have high blood pressure or heart disease?

167
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:47,680
No.

168
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,680
Do you have a cold recently?

169
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,159
No.

170
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,760
No. Okay.

171
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,760
Huang, evacuate him.

172
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,280
Come on.

173
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,000
Blood pressure is normal. Low pressure is a bit high.

174
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:56,880
How much?

175
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,520
93

176
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,760
Chow-yi, get some salt water and not glucose.

177
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,280
Okay

178
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,760
Maybe it's heatstroke

179
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,560
Move back

180
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,160
He's awake, 01.

181
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:08,640
She's awake.

182
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,240
Yunyun, you scared me.

183
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,640
Can you hear me?

184
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,120
Yes.

185
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,040
I can hear you.

186
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:14,880
We are doctors.

187
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,560
You fainted just now. You had a heatstroke.

188
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,160
Don't be afraid.

189
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:17,800
Thank you, doctor.

190
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,040
It's okay.

191
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,040
How is my child?

192
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,560
The baby is fine,

193
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,120
But he needs to go to the hospital for a check-up.

194
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:23,560
Okay?

195
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:23,880
Okay.

196
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,040
Take a small breath.

197
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,160
Shut up and breathe with your nose.

198
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,400
Okay.

199
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,160
I'll help you up slowly.

200
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,880
Come on, slow down.

201
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,520
One two three

202
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,280
Be careful.

203
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,640
Come on. Carry the car.

204
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:38,760
Put my daughter down!

205
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,400
Put my daughter down!

206
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,760
Mom, what are you doing?

207
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,280
They gave me a ride.

208
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,480
They're unlucky.

209
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,280
I won't take your car.

210
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:44,760
No, aunt.

211
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,520
She needs to go to the hospital for a check-up.

212
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,920
There are four on their badges.

213
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,880
Didn't you see it?

214
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:51,880
It's unlucky.

215
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:53,520
You can leave by yourselves. It's ominous.

216
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,640
I won't get in your car. I won't let you see me off.

217
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,080
You're so superstitious.

218
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,320
You can't go anywhere if you're so superstitious.

219
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,240
I can't.

220
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,160
Don't be superstitious.

221
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,520
Don't say that.

222
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,520
Mom, what era is it now?

223
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,120
Don't talk about that. Let him give me a ride.

224
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,160
The doctor is fine. Please give me a ride.

225
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,280
You can't do that. You're so annoying.

226
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,280
Daughter, hang in there.

227
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:11,560
Jiangdong EMSS.

228
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,680
Let's take a taxi.

229
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,800
If something happens,

230
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,560
it'll be too late to regret.

231
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:17,480
Hey,

232
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,240
Are you crazy?

233
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,240
If you're sick, hurry up.

234
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,920
Don't bother the doctor here.

235
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,280
Who are you?

236
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,480
It's none of your business.

237
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,360
Who am I?

238
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,280
I'm the father of a female doctor. What's wrong?

239
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,159
How old are you?

240
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:32,919
You take your parents to work

241
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:33,000
They even bring their parents to work

242
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:33,919
You even bring your parents to work

243
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,000
Doctor, are you a kindergarten manager?

244
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,520
How could you say that?

245
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,280
You only care about your daughter.

246
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,400
Do you know that?

247
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,280
That doctor

248
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,040
is someone else's father's precious daughter.

249
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,920
Why do you have to suffer?

250
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,280
It brings bad luck.

251
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,000
When you go shopping,

252
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,120
there are many doors with four doors on the street.

253
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,640
Aren't you having fun too?

254
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,240
My daughter is pregnant.

255
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,640
You should be careful.

256
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,800
Is there anything wrong?

257
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,360
Because

258
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,680
there are unreasonable people like you.

259
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,520
Calm down.

260
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,240
Take him to the hospital.

261
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,000
Say it. Go on.

262
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:07,520
Qi Qi.

263
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,480
Is there anyone like you?

264
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,560
I'm leaving home today, Qi Xuejun.

265
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,040
Qi Qi Qi.

266
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,880
I can't see you suffer.

267
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:14,920
What's wrong with you?

268
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,040
Qiqi, don't go.

269
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,240
You can go to the hospital by yourself, right?

270
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,280
Sign here.

271
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:18,920
Stop!

272
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,040
Is she not here?

273
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,640
Sister Qi

274
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,880
She's not back yet.

275
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,480
Jia Qi, come and take a look.

276
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,240
The center of the dance girl group looks like you.

277
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,920
Does it look like you? Look.

278
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,880
How? How?

279
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,160
Tell me how.

280
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,920
Isn't Jiaqi much prettier than her?

281
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,240
Of course.

282
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,400
What's wrong, Kiki?

283
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,400
Why are you so unhappy?

284
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,160
Did you receive a prank call again?

285
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,240
More than 40,000 calls a year.

286
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,960
It's almost one tenth.

287
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,240
It's a prank call.

288
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,720
I didn't get away with it today.

289
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,840
Besides,

290
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,000
even if we get rid of these harassment calls,

291
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,600
nothing else is better.

292
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,800
90% of them are invalid calls.

293
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,560
There's nothing we can do with them.

294
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,560
There are people who can't tell

295
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,960
Some can't tell us their address.

296
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,200
What else?

297
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,480
When you called,

298
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,840
and she just hung you up.

299
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,200
If you call again, you'll get a line.

300
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,120
I couldn't find it. I was so worried.

301
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,000
It's normal.

302
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,600
We're used to it.

303
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,840
Is there anything new?

304
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:34,840
Yes.

305
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,840
There's a guy who asked me to find a boyfriend recently.

306
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,080
A boyfriend?

307
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,240
What do you mean?

308
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,000
A few days ago,

309
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,880
a few days ago.

310
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,800
She said this male doctor

311
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,840
his figure, appearance and temperament

312
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,680
It perfectly fits her standard for choosing a partner.

313
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,440
It's like a dream.

314
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,960
And then he fell in love.

315
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,440
Call our center.

316
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,600
and asked us to find him.

317
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,480
I forced my anger

318
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,480
I was serious, but I was gentle.

319
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,600
I said sorry.

320
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,880
I really can't help you.

321
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,480
Our 120 is not a blind date hotline.

322
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,560
We're 120.

323
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,320
It's an emergency patient's call.

324
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:11,960
Is it okay for me to say that?

325
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,480
No problem.

326
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,440
No problem.

327
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,200
Guess why she...

328
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,880
She cried.

329
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,360
She said I ruined her love.

330
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,360
I'm not upset yet.

331
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,440
I'm already upset.

332
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,680
Sometimes when I watch dramas,

333
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,080
I really hope

334
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,320
on TV.

335
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:26,520
0501200.

336
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,960
Please don't occupy

337
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,960
120 life hotline.

338
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,240
Just a few words.

339
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,680
Let everyone see it.

340
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,560
Kiki, you should have a dream.

341
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,960
I heard that the TV station

342
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:38,960
will come to our center

343
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,480
for 40 minutes.

344
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,240
I'm filming you.

345
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,600
Not our adjustment center.

346
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,200
Don't worry. If I'm selected,

347
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,560
I'll go to the PR Centre.

348
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,200
No problem.

349
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:49,800
Really.

350
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,240
Thank you.

351
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,360
Fei is looking for me. I have to go.

352
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,480
Tell me when you come back.

353
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,480
Okay, go ahead.

354
00:11:59,480 --> 00:11:59,840
Thank you.

355
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,240
Come on.

356
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,480
Oh my god.

357
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,960
I drove four cars in a row this afternoon.

358
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,440
I worked until I got off work.

359
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,080
Qi Tuo

360
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,440
The shoelace is loose.

361
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,480
I saw it.

362
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,440
Sister, let's organize tonight.

363
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,080
There's a new Chongqing restaurant downstairs.

364
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,600
It'll be good for you.

365
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,200
Go ahead.

366
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,600
It's on me. I'll reimburse it for you.

367
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,720
I have something to do tonight.

368
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,680
What? Are you going on a date?

369
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:34,960
Stop gossiping.

370
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,080
Senior.

371
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,200
What happened today?

372
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,880
You treat me to such a nice steak.

373
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,120
It's not my treat. It's my treat.

374
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:41,880
Who?

375
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:42,720
Qu Yufan.

376
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,720
What is he looking for you for?

377
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,200
The thing you told Snow this afternoon

378
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,480
about your transfer center

379
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,360
to Mr. Lu.

380
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,000
She thinks your story is good.

381
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,200
Qu Yufan said

382
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,600
to make some short videos for our center?

383
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,080
Mr. Lu asked me to talk to him.

384
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,440
Let's go.

385
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,320
No way.

386
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,200
I'll text you.

387
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,240
I'll wait for you at the same place.

388
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,400
Qi Tuo, have you arrived?

389
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,400
Sorry.

390
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,520
I'm leaving now.

391
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,600
I just finished the emergency treatment.

392
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,640
How about we make another appointment?

393
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,360
I'm really sorry.

394
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,600
It's okay. Work is more important.

395
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,760
I can wait for you.

396
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,680
The western restaurant closed early.

397
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,280
How about we eat somewhere else?

398
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,040
How about this?

399
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:44,920
Send me the address.

400
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,240
I'll be right there after I'm done here.

401
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,760
See you later.

402
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,280
Okay.

403
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,040
I'm sorry.

404
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,600
Are you waiting for Sister Qi?

405
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,360
Senior.

406
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
You must be tired.

407
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,640
You made him wait for so long.

408
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,520
Can he wait for us?

409
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,480
We've changed the place. We've changed the barbecue restaurant.

410
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:12,800
Hurry up.

411
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,760
Change clothes with me and we'll leave.

412
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,160
OK.

413
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,120
Xu Chengyuan.

414
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,760
My God, my legs are sore.

415
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,400
I just got off.

416
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,360
Your chicken wings, chicken feet, mutton skewers.

417
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:31,880
Okay, thank you.

418
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,000
Eat it while it's hot. It won't taste good when it's cold.

419
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,360
Here.

420
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,360
It's really good.

421
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,400
Thank you.

422
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,880
It has high calories.

423
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,280
You girls don't need to keep fit.

424
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,760
We're in the ER, we're afraid of calories.

425
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,920
We consume so much every day.

426
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:47,880
This is nothing.

427
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,880
It smells good.

428
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,400
What's wrong?

429
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,040
I haven't

430
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,480
I haven’t seen a girl eat like this for a long time.

431
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,760
Qu, I really can’t find the lyrics.

432
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,000
We can stop praising him.

433
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,760
Don't praise me like that. It's inappropriate.

434
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,640
I'm telling the truth, right?

435
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,160
Just like me.

436
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,600
How is it? We'll be there in five minutes.

437
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,920
Senior, luckily you're not with him.

438
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,640
Take the back door and go upstairs.

439
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,280
I can't handle it.

440
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,120
This part is too high.

441
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,120
I can't stand it.

442
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,000
Why did they take the back door?

443
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,240
Look, they are sitting there.

444
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,880
You bumped into each other through the front door.

445
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,120
What’s going on?

446
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,760
This Qu

447
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,520
is the boss of a media company.

448
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:00,000
They are talking about the promotional video

449
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,120
to make a promotional video.

450
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,760
You've heard about that?

451
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:03,800
I heard it.

452
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,760
He looks kind.

453
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,120
He looks kind?

454
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,360
You can never judge a book by its cover.

455
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,120
When he came to our emergency center,

456
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,920
I thought he was different from others.

457
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,120
Okay, the alarm is off.

458
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,120
Let's eat. I'm starving.

459
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,720
Okay, hurry up and eat.

460
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:19,280
Okay.

461
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,240
I'm full.

462
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,160
What do you think they are doing?

463
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,720
They haven't finished yet.

464
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,240
Jia Qi, are you full?

465
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:33,800
Yes.

466
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,880
It's so clean

467
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,480
It's a waste of anchovies.

468
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,000
I'll pay the bill.

469
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,480
Stop hiding.

470
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,040
I found you long ago.

471
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,400
Jiaqi, what a coincidence.

472
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,640
You're eating here too?

473
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,240
So disgusting.

474
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,640
Xu Chengyuan, what are you doing?

475
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,720
Come down.

476
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,640
Let's go.

477
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,640
I found that Zhang Chi didn't learn well.

478
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,280
Really.

479
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,760
What are you two? Twins.

480
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,720
We were playing basketball.

481
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,720
If we hadn't known you,

482
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,560
we would have called the police

483
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,960
to take you to the police station.

484
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:19,920
Yes.

485
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,160
Why are you with them?

486
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,280
The clothes are pretty.

487
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:24,880
I just bought it.

488
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:25,400
Me?

489
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,400
Yuan chose it for me.

490
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:28,520
Isn't he handsome?

491
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,600
What a coincidence.

492
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,120
These are our colleagues.

493
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:31,880
This is Qu Yufan.

494
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,000
Let’s go.

495
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,480
Qi Qi, I'll call a designated driver to send you home.

496
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,120
Give me a ride?

497
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,600
I'll go with him.

498
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,160
Do you know him? I'll give him to you.

499
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,120
Let's take a ride. Let's go.

500
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,280
I'll send him home then.

501
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,280
Bye, master. Bye.

502
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:45,800
Bye.

503
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:46,880
I'm leaving.

504
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:47,520
Senior.

505
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,120
I'm worried about you going back alone.

506
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,000
Dr Zhang, please send her back.

507
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,360
What's there to worry about?

508
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,040
Okay, I'll see you off.

509
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:54,760
Let's go.

510
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,000
Bye.

511
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,880
It's just the two of us.

512
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,280
Take my car.

513
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,120
When did you buy a car?

514
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,120
I just mentioned it yesterday. Let's go.

515
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,640
This is the car you bought?

516
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,520
Of course.

517
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,520
Are you kidding me?

518
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,880
No.

519
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,240
I just bought this car.

520
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,520
It can run more than 100 kilometers.

521
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,000
You're the first passenger.

522
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,000
How about this?

523
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,520
Where do you want to go tonight?

524
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,120
wherever you want to go tonight.

525
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,880
You can go anywhere you want.

526
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:32,520
Of course.

527
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:35,880
I'll go to the beach.

528
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:42,880
No problem.

529
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:44,800
Here.

530
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,000
This...

531
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,120
What does this mean?

532
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,240
You mean the words on it?

533
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:51,640
This one.

534
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,760
I want to

535
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,920
to my life.

536
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,880
You're quite prepared at such a young age.

537
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,800
Don't discriminate about age.

538
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,040
Let me help you.

539
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,240
Is it tight?

540
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,120
No.

541
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:12,720
Okay.

542
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,240
You have to take my bag.

543
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:14,760
Okay.

544
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,160
Thank you.

545
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,360
Come on, get in.

546
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,760
Can you do it?

547
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,640
Sit tight.

548
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,520
Sit tight.

549
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,280
Can you do it?

550
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,640
Of course I can.

551
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,760
Really?

552
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,400
Really

553
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,640
The weather is nice.

554
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,680
Yes, it's not that sticky today.

555
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,360
And the air is nice.

556
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,800
Why did you

557
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,400
come to such a faraway city to be an emergency doctor?

558
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,640
Isn't it good to be in your hometown?

559
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,000
There are many opportunities in big cities.

560
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,400
and learn a lot.

561
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,920
And my dad told me

562
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,240
when I was young,

563
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,760
when you're young.

564
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,240
and settle down when I'm older.

565
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,520
Your dad is so nice to let you come out.

566
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,640
Our family is different.

567
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,520
My parents are worried about me.

568
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,760
They didn't let me go far.

569
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,280
Then I discussed with them

570
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,760
if I could come to my uncle.

571
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,280
I have freedom

572
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,640
and give them an explanation.

573
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,240
It's good. I really think it's good.

574
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,640
How is your scar?

575
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,280
Well...

576
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,880
is almost healed.

577
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:57,800
Don't worry.

578
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:58,920
It won't affect my beauty.

579
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,000
Yes.

580
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,160
But it was my fault that day.

581
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,920
If I had found you were gone earlier,

582
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,360
you wouldn't have this scar.

583
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,520
Why are you saying this?

584
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,120
It's gross.

585
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,520
What's so cheesy about that?

586
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,800
It's my duty to protect you.

587
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,640
Don't talk nonsense.

588
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,520
I'll take it seriously.

589
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,320
It's true.

590
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,320
And my dad said

591
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,480
your dad said he wouldn't be fined by the traffic police.

592
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,600
Think about how to go back.

593
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,800
Should I call a taxi for you?

594
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,720
I don't need you to call a taxi.

595
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:38,800
Qi Qi is back.

596
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,040
Qiqi.

597
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,520
Why are you here?

598
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,640
Waiting for you.

599
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,760
Qi Qi, my dear daughter.

600
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,120
You're finally back.

601
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:49,880
Thank you. I'm leaving.

602
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,560
Thanks. Bye.

603
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,160
Whose car is this?

604
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:52,920
Zhang Chi.

605
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,280
My disciple, Zhang Chi.

606
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,920
Let him down.

607
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,760
No, he's busy. What are you doing?

608
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,880
Let me verify it.

609
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,640
Let him down.

610
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,280
Come in and have some water.

611
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:03,920
Uncle Qi, auntie.

612
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:05,920
Little Xiaogua.

613
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,240
Come up here.

614
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,360
I have something to tell you.

615
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,280
You have something to tell me?

616
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,280
What did you say?

617
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,000
Just go.

618
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:13,640
Are you coming up?

619
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,480
I'm going to put out the fire.

620
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,040
What?

621
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:25,800
Come up quickly.

622
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,680
Watch your mouth.

623
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,040
Your dad is worried about you.

624
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,640
What's wrong with my dad?

625
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,400
Have a seat.

626
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,040
Coming.

627
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:38,760
Auntie.

628
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:39,560
Have a seat.

629
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:42,560
Sit.

630
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:46,560
Sit.

631
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:47,240
Sit down.

632
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,360
Qiqi.

633
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,560
I'll say it again

634
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,280
in front of your disciple.

635
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,560
resign tomorrow.

636
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,640
No matter Mr. Lu agrees or not,

637
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,040
it's confirmed.

638
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,160
You said the same thing.

639
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,920
Let's talk here.

640
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,280
What do you want?

641
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,040
Qi Qi, aren't you talking about the wheel?

642
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,120
It's not solved yet.

643
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,640
Of course I have to tell you.

644
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,120
Listen to me.

645
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,360
resign tomorrow.

646
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,560
After you quit,

647
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,000
what do you want to do?

648
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,520
I'll do my best to support you.

649
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,520
If you want to start a business,

650
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,400
I'll invest in you.

651
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:29,920
I want to study more.

652
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,760
I'll send you abroad to study.

653
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,240
It's okay if you don't want to do anything.

654
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,520
I'll take care of you forever.

655
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,480
But let me tell you,

656
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,640
if you have to go against me,

657
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,160
then...

658
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,880
I'll see you in heaven.

659
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,280
Didn't I tell you to watch less romantic scenes?

660
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,760
You're still pushing me to death.

661
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,680
Have some fruit. Thank you.

662
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,360
I'm serious.

663
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:54,920
Qi Xuejun.

664
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,920
Do you have to force me out of this house?

665
00:23:59,000 --> 00:23:59,920
Are you satisfied?

666
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:00,560
No.

667
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,040
Isn't this just a job?

668
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,160
You'd rather abandon your parents

669
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,760
than resign.

670
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,280
What's wrong with you?

671
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,560
Dad, what did I do?

672
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,000
Can you...

673
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,360
When I feel a little wronged,

674
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,880
you can comfort me and hug me.

675
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:19,920
Isn't that enough?

676
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,160
You're doing this now.

677
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,240
Do you think you can make it?

678
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,520
Uncle Qi, can I say something?

679
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:29,760
Go ahead.

680
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,600
Dr. Qi

681
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,840
is very skilled.

682
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,760
and very responsible.

683
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,080
She is an excellent emergency doctor.

684
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,680
When she's working,

685
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:45,480
Well...

686
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,920
The patient will cooperate with her

687
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,520
and support her.

688
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,240
The one you saw in the park

689
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,040
And the one who hit someone last time.

690
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,400
That's a rare case.

691
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:55,560
No.

692
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,480
What are you trying to say?

693
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,080
I just want to say

694
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:02,560
I've only been to the emergency center for a short time.

695
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,640
I've been learning a lot of things without experience.

696
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,320
I'm learning how to deal with

697
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,280
with the patient.

698
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,800
I promise you.

699
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,880
if you meet

700
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,880
in the future.

701
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,920
I'll let them beat me.

702
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,400
I promise I'll protect Dr. Qi, okay?

703
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,600
I don't believe

704
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,120
I don't believe it.

705
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:23,520
Let me tell you.

706
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,920
In this world,

707
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,320
there are only two men

708
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,920
can protect her.

709
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,240
One is her dad,

710
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,080
and the other

711
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,160
is her future husband.

712
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,160
My goodness.

713
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,520
Look at you.

714
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:42,880
Right?

715
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,320
You have an idea.

716
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,520
You want to court my daughter?

717
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,240
No, Uncle Qi, no, no

718
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,000
You think too much

719
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:48,800
I...

720
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,640
I don't even treat Dr Qi as a woman.

721
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,160
I just...

722
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:51,760
What did you say?

723
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,360
I just...

724
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,840
Qi Qi is not a woman?

725
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:54,280
No, no.

726
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,080
I respect and respect her.

727
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:56,560
Why am I...

728
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,800
That's not what I meant.

729
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,600
Do you know that doctors

730
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,520
We can't treat patients

731
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,760
That's the feeling, you know?

732
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,280
Enough. Stop.

733
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,600
The more you explain, the more confused it is.

734
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,840
You just said it, right?

735
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:14,080
You acknowledge and respect them from the bottom of your heart, right?

736
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,760
Then tell me

737
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,760
what's her strength?

738
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,000
Why are you talking about this?

739
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,560
To test you.

740
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:26,120
You have to respect her from the bottom of your heart

741
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,240
can you do your best to protect her.

742
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,680
Tell me five reasons now.

743
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:31,480
Say it.

744
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,120
This...

745
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,920
Dr. Qi

746
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,240
has excellent medical skills.

747
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:43,880
and responsible.

748
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:47,320
He's an excellent ER doctor.

749
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:47,880
Stop.

750
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,160
You said it just now. It doesn't count.

751
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:50,280
Go on.

752
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,000
Say it.

753
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,080
Uncle Qi

754
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,000
Aunt, I...

755
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,560
We don't have much private communication

756
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,080
other than work.

757
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,160
You can't say it, right?

758
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,560
We have many advantages.

759
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,600
Just say it.

760
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:05,840
It's quite a lot.

761
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,240
Dr. Qi is

762
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,560
a very good leader.

763
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,320
She's very loyal.

764
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:17,880
She protects the car team

765
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,120
like a man.

766
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:20,920
This is one.

767
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:21,840
Go on.

768
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,080
Good physical strength.

769
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,760
Our emergency center

770
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,320
This one.

771
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,480
is better than physical fitness.

772
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,800
than men.

773
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:37,760
Okay.

774
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:40,640
I'm barely one.

775
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,120
The second one.

776
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,560
What about the third one? Go on.

777
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:52,840
She eats a lot.

778
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,160
She can eat a lot.

779
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,120
She's a big eater. It means she...

780
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,760
She works hard.

781
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,240
She's tired.

782
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:02,760
Stop it.

783
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,360
She should eat more if she's tired.

784
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,520
Stop it, dad.

785
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,520
Can you give me some face?

786
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,640
Can you stop talking?

787
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,560
Can we go inside?

788
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,400
Please, Dad.

789
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,400
Dad, I'm an adult.

790
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:13,800
Please.

791
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,320
That's right. That's enough.

792
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:15,840
Okay.

793
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,400
Go back.

794
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,080
Okay, you guys talk.

795
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:37,840
Oh my god.

796
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:39,400
Dr Zhang.

797
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,480
Thank you for saying so much.

798
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,480
I'm telling the truth from the bottom of my heart.

799
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:49,880
Let me ask you.

800
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,600
I'm not a man.

801
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,040
What is it?

802
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,080
Why did I say that?

803
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,040
Because of you.

804
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,480
You're a big eater.

805
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,600
You really can.

806
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,040
You eat six drumsticks a meal.

807
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,800
Compared to men,

808
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,480
Our emergency center

809
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,560
Zheng Bo, Xu Chengyuan,

810
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,560
Can they eat you?

811
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,520
Who eats six drumsticks?

812
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,920
And you're strong.

813
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,000
Swing rope.

814
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,280
Do you remember

815
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,680
Zheng Bo and Xu Chengyuan

816
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,760
than you.

817
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,320
I usually exercise.

818
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:35,240
I'm 20 seconds less than you.

819
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,160
Aren't you leaving?

820
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,320
I'm leaving.

821
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:45,600
I'll go.

822
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,800
Why are my legs numb?

823
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,680
Why are you...

824
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:49,600
Wait a minute.

825
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,320
I forgot to ask you.

826
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,320
Did you expose

827
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,600
to Xu Chengyuan?

828
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:02,840
Yes.

829
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,240
Why?

830
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,840
What gossip do you want from me?

831
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,760
Anyway, Xu Chengyuan meant

832
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,400
He said he likes you.

833
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,240
He...

834
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,560
What are you doing?

835
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,680
Just tell him.

836
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,640
and you believed it.

837
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,400
Why not?

838
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,360
Are you out of your mind?

839
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,480
I wish I could pull your head off.

840
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,880
Throw it out for medical knowledge.

841
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Put some EQ in.

842
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,880
Everyone in our center says that.

843
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,080
They make fun of us every day.

844
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,560
Marry me and I'll marry you.

845
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,320
I'll give birth to a monkey and a peach tomorrow.

846
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:35,920
What are you doing?

847
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:38,320
Ms. Chen.

848
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,800
I don't think it's urgent for you to find a boyfriend.

849
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,080
Even if you can't find a boyfriend at 50,

850
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,680
we can make do with each other.

851
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,480
Don't curse me.

852
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,920
You have a girlfriend.

853
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:49,920
Don't interrupt me.

854
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:55,680
Zheng.

855
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,120
Don't be single.

856
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,280
What do you think of me?

857
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,040
It's local.

858
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,080
Sister Chen.

859
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,520
Please let Zheng go.

860
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,840
Look at me, okay?

861
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:12,560
Sure.

862
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,280
Xu Chengyuan.

863
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,640
Do you think I don't know

864
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:15,680
You think I don't know?

865
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,680
You even helped me.

866
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,600
I really want to give you a needle.

867
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,360
Are colleagues crazy?

868
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,800
How can two doctors live together?

869
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,520
How can peers find peers?

870
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,520
Are you not leaving?

871
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,120
No, I want to go to the toilet.

872
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,360
Go in.

873
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,480
Talk to my dad more.

874
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,280
Don't go in.

875
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,640
Is there a toilet outside your house?

876
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,880
Of course it's in my house.

877
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,520
It's not my toilet outside.

878
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:45,880
Go ahead.

879
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,080
This...

880
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,360
There's a toilet in my room.

881
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,600
But I have to pass by my dad's room.

882
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,480
He must have seen it and talked to me again.

883
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,760
Close your eyes and go in.

884
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:56,840
Close your eyes.

885
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,480
Is he invisible

886
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,600
or I can't see him?

887
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:30,800
Hello?

888
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,560
Honey.

889
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:40,680
Honey.

890
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,080
You finally called me.

891
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:45,080
Honey, please forgive me for the last time.

892
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,240
Trust me for the last time.

893
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,600
I won't use a knife anymore.

894
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,920
I won't hurt myself or kill myself.

895
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,360
Trust me this once.

896
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,240
I'm tired of what you said.

897
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,240
I'll say it one last time.

898
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,280
I swear to God.

899
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,960
I have something to tell you.

900
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,960
I've been looking for a job this week.

901
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,400
I went to 20 companies.

902
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,280
Many HR department replied to me.

903
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,080
Really?

904
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,520
You really went to find a job?

905
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,720
You can log in my email.

906
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,480
You have my password.

907
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,160
Look how many resumes I sent

908
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,080
How many replies have you received?

909
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,600
Read it now.

910
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:21,880
What's wrong?

911
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,840
Honey, let me tell you.

912
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,720
There's a weird restaurant upstairs.

913
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,960
She doesn't wear slippers at home every day.

914
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:31,880
Wearing high heels.

915
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:34,520
Walking around

916
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,760
Practice cat walk.

917
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,840
And that kid is definitely a weirdo.

918
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,520
He runs around every day.

919
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,840
ADHD.

920
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,680
Shut up! I can't stand it!

921
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,720
Don't be so angry.

922
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,600
It's normal to make a sound in broad daylight.

923
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,800
Wait for me, honey.

924
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,480
Who is it? What are you doing?

925
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,800
Are you crazy?

926
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,440
Why are you walking around in broad daylight?

927
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,520
What are you doing?

928
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:04,520
What are you doing?

929
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,560
Why are you here in broad daylight?

930
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,480
I'm talking about you.

931
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,320
You don't wear slippers. Wear high heels.

932
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,280
Sports day?

933
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,400
or a fashion press conference?

934
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,120
What's wrong with wearing high heels at home?

935
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:13,760
Am I bothering you?

936
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,560
Of course. Can you stop bothering me?

937
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,920
Can you not disturb me?

938
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,840
Don't shout. You're disturbing the kid.

939
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,480
Your kid is disturbing me too.

940
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,280
You know?

941
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,280
You're disturbing me, you know?

942
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:24,920
Can you keep your voice down?

943
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,760
I'm calling the police.

944
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,280
Go ahead.

945
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,000
What's the number?

946
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:42,840
Room 301.

947
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:44,199
I've been here before.

948
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,199
This man had a fight with his wife

949
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:47,360
and stabbed his leg.

950
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,000
A little grumpy. Be careful.

951
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,639
Huang, hurry up.

952
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,360
Coming.

953
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:06,560
This is it.

954
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,200
Did you call 120?

955
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,000
That's great.

956
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:10,840
Are you feeling unwell?

957
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:11,840
Doctor, it's great.

958
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:12,720
You're finally here.

959
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,640
Take me to the hospital.

960
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:16,120
I can't sleep. I'm going to collapse.

961
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,280
Insomnia?

962
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,200
You can go to the clinic during the day.

963
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,840
to see a neurosurgeon.

964
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,200
No, I can't go.

965
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,000
If this continues,

966
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,840
I'm going to die.

967
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,840
Calm down.

968
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,560
You need to rest now.

969
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,360
Go to the outpatient clinic when you're done, okay?

970
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,480
What kind of attitude is that?

971
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,000
What kind of attitude is that?

972
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:32,400
Brother.

973
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,120
You're so picky about a patient like me, aren't you?

974
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,360
I'm not picky.

975
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:35,720
Right?

976
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,520
Calm down.

977
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,000
Get out of the way.

978
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,560
Stand behind me.

979
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Step back. Stand behind me.

980
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,000
See?

981
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,280
It's empty.

982
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,480
There's no sleeping pills.

983
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,280
Let me go to a hospital.

984
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,400
Can you make sleeping pills with me?

985
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,720
It's not like I don't pay.

986
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:01,560
Go, go, bring it.

987
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:02,000
Huang.

988
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,120
Let's go.

989
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,000
Prepare the medicine.

990
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:11,840
Put it down.

991
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,040
Let's go.

992
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,720
Slow down.

993
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,160
Raise your head first.

994
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,880
One, two, go.

995
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,600
Okay, let's go.

996
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,320
Senior, how many times have we been there today?

997
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,040
Eleven times.

998
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,760
It's over 40 degrees. I'll get on if I leave again.

999
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,440
Come on.

1000
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,040
Xu, go.

1001
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:59,160
Doctor, can there be a bed in the fourth hospital now?

1002
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,600
I'm not sure yet.

1003
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,720
My dad is in such a dangerous condition.

1004
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,440
Do you think he needs surgery?

1005
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,000
Doctor, I'm asking you.

1006
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,560
Can you let us work? Sit down.

1007
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,000
Do we need surgery?

1008
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,440
It's not up to us now.

1009
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,880
Doctor, can't you drive faster?

1010
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,880
Why don't you give my dad another shot?

1011
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,720
Is it up to you or me?

1012
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,040
Are you a doctor or am I a doctor?

1013
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,000
No, I'm afraid my dad can't take it.

1014
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,040
What did you do earlier?

1015
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,560
What's your attitude?

1016
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,440
You're giving me a hard time as soon as you get in the car.

1017
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,040
You don't know anything.

1018
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,320
Why did I ask you to sit here?

1019
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,040
Sit down first.

1020
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,400
I'm so worried.

1021
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:32,040
Can't you say something nice?

1022
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,760
This attitude is so bad.

1023
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,600
Dad, hang in there.

1024
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:50,600
You're back.

1025
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:51,320
What are you eating?

1026
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,440
Have some instant noodles.

1027
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:53,880
You know what?

1028
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,440
We met that grumpy man again today.

1029
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:57,760
Crumpy man?

1030
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,280
When Dr. Zhang was with our team,

1031
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:00,880
with our team.

1032
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,880
Yes, I think Dr. Jung

1033
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,120
met him once.

1034
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,840
You don't know.

1035
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,200
It's even worse today.

1036
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,760
Throwing medicine bottles.

1037
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,160
When Huang and I arrived today,

1038
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,880
it was a critical moment.

1039
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:14,400
Let me tell you.

1040
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,400
Come on, let's learn.

1041
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,760
I'm Zhang Chi. This is Qi Tuo.

1042
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,560
She stopped me and stopped me.

1043
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,760
At the same time, their eyes meet

1044
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:23,600
Then

1045
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:26,320
Chi shouted, "Come here."

1046
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,280
That's amazing.

1047
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:29,160
You...

1048
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,440
The director asked us to have a meeting.

1049
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,560
When did you come?

1050
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,840
That's what happened last week

1051
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:44,840
Now,

1052
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,400
tell us about the problem.

1053
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,720
Chen Xue, what's wrong with you?

1054
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,840
The family called the headquarters.

1055
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
They said you had a bad attitude at work.

1056
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,560
You said you didn't know anything.

1057
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,160
and asked me to punish you.

1058
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,520
What's wrong with you?

1059
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,040
Did you take gunshot that day?

1060
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,000
Ms. Lu.

1061
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,440
The temperature was over 40 degrees that morning.

1062
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,320
I took a dozen cars in the morning.

1063
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,600
I couldn't even eat.

1064
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:08,880
I'm exhausted.

1065
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,560
The family kept asking.

1066
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,840
and kept disturbing my work.

1067
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,560
I can't control myself.

1068
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,280
Everyone has a temper.

1069
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,240
Unless you wear a mask on my face,

1070
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,880
Otherwise,

1071
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,480
I wouldn't be able to do a smile service.

1072
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:21,280
Director Kang.

1073
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,160
I think

1074
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,280
the complaint is good.

1075
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:26,880
What am I afraid of now?

1076
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,960
I'm just afraid that I'll run into the kid.

1077
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:29,560
Yes.

1078
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,720
Every family has a precious child now.

1079
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,000
But if you fail,

1080
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,840
the family will fight you to death.

1081
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,680
I was scared.

1082
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,600
We are more patient

1083
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,880
is more patient than our parents.

1084
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,320
But this won't do.

1085
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,520
You endured it a thousand times.

1086
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,160
If you don't hold it back once,

1087
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:47,840
Okay.

1088
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,680
You'll be sued and punished.

1089
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:57,840
Okay.

1090
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,720
Why are you getting more and more excited?

1091
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:03,120
Yes, I know you all worked hard.

1092
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,280
Everyone is walking with a lot of weight.

1093
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,840
It's something to be sure of.

1094
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,120
But in reality,

1095
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,960
we not only cured the patient,

1096
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:10,880
this is not enough 07303.

1097
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,000
We need to know how to

1098
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:13,880
and the patient

1099
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,720
and patients.

1100
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,520
On this point,

1101
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,680
Xu Chengyuan did a good job.

1102
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:23,440
He complained less and had less disputes.

1103
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,080
He often received praises letters.

1104
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:26,520
Xu.

1105
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,480
Show us your experience.

1106
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:29,760
Come on.

1107
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,520
I won't be modest then.

1108
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:32,960
Let me say it.

1109
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,960
Let me ask you a question.

1110
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,080
Usually, if we were late,

1111
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:43,520
How do you explain it

1112
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,520
in front of a violent family?

1113
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,160
Well, just tell the truth.

1114
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,520
There's usually traffic jam.

1115
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,040
Yes.

1116
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,040
Anything else?

1117
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,280
And that one is on the bed.

1118
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,200
We have no choice.

1119
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,800
Wrong. All wrong.

1120
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:56,840
Let me tell you.

1121
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:59,040
I met the same situation the day before yesterday.

1122
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:02,040
He was about to explode when facing the family.

1123
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:02,920
I told him

1124
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,160
the average of 40,000 people is an ambulance.

1125
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,960
If you can get one,

1126
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:11,040
That means you won a house with a shake.

1127
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,960
Buying a double-colored ball is at least third prize.

1128
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,480
How can you say that?

1129
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,400
Disgusting.

1130
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,800
How is this disgusting?

1131
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,840
This is the art of talking.

1132
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:23,280
Think about it.
