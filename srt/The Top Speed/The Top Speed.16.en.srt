1
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:06,040
National Radio. and Telvison. Administration.

2
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,800
Let me introduce someone to you.

3
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,039
Professor Song Yun-sung.

4
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,280
When I was studying in Nanjing, I had a lot of friends. I've been working at a club for a long time. I've been working at the same time.

5
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,039
I met many experts and leaders

6
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,680
in the meeting.

7
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,800
Mr. Song is one of them.

8
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:48,200
I told him about you.

9
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,600
He's very interested.

10
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,840
and wants to work with you.

11
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:53,400
He told me that he can provide pre-inspection distribution

12
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,520
and the technical support of Cloud Clinic.

13
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,280
Great. Thank you.

14
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,280
No need to thank me.

15
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,840
I just told them

16
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,160
what you told me.

17
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,600
They value your talent and vision.

18
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,720
We all believe

19
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,800
you will succeed.

20
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,760
Why are you laughing?

21
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,400
I have something for you.

22
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:17,960
What is this?

23
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:18,840
A bank card.

24
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,920
Your first investment

25
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,280
My first investment.

26
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,160
What money?

27
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,280
I saved it.

28
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,600
Not much. 100,000 yuan.

29
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,160
Take it back. Stop messing around.

30
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,520
I can't take the money.

31
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,520
I'll figure it out.

32
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,600
This is my first venture investment.

33
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,720
Don't make trouble for me.

34
00:02:37,079 --> 00:02:39,280
When you earn a lot,

35
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,360
I want high interest.

36
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,200
I'm asking for a reward.

37
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,480
If my investment fails,

38
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,600
how can I face you?

39
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,920
It doesn't matter if I fail.

40
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:50,960
I admit it.

41
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,520
Zheng Bo.

42
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,920
I really hope

43
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,040
your talent won't be defeated by reality.

44
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,160
That's all.

45
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,040
I've told you everything.

46
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:09,520
See you tomorrow.

47
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,000
Kiki.

48
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,200
I don't want the card.

49
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,960
I don't want to return what you gave me.

50
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,240
No.

51
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,960
It's not about the card.

52
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,760
I want to tell you.

53
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,240
What?

54
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,200
I want to tell you

55
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,200
I...

56
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,880
Tell me. I'm so worried.

57
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,760
Actually, I want to tell you

58
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,120
I...

59
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,320
How much is the interest of this card?

60
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:36,880
Very high.

61
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,440
Surprise? Happy? Surprised?

62
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,440
How did you know my birthday?

63
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,960
I know everything.

64
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,080
Look.

65
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,480
I carefully prepared it.

66
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,720
How is it, Xianbing? Look.

67
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,520
We've prepared for ten hours. Look.

68
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,040
This...

69
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,440
Will there be a mark when you take it off?

70
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,680
What's wrong with you?

71
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,560
It's all hydrogen.

72
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,920
You can suck it on your own.

73
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,120
Who will stick it on you?

74
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,600
Did you cook all these dishes?

75
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,680
No, only a small part of them are delivery.

76
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,360
Most of them are delivery, right?

77
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,040
No, only six are takeout.

78
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,120
There are only six dishes.

79
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,040
Six are takeout.

80
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,440
Which one did you make?

81
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,440
I cut the fruit.

82
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,080
Okay, good cutting skills.

83
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:45,680
Where are you going?

84
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,440
It's okay. I'm going to wash my hands.

85
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,200
No, no.

86
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,080
Don't leave. Sit down.

87
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,720
I've prepared wet tissues for you.

88
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,960
As your birthday girl,

89
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:54,800
Fine.

90
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,640
Here, dear landlord.

91
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,240
I hope you like it.

92
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,880
How did you know I like jigsaw puzzle?

93
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,840
You really like jigsaw puzzle.

94
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,960
And it's hard to buy.

95
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,520
Look how sensible you are.

96
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,760
I know you like it.

97
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,880
Just use it for ten days.

98
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,880
Put them together.

99
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,400
No need. I'll put them together after dinner.

100
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,160
This is here.

101
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,400
It's here

102
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,280
Look.

103
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,240
It's divided into eight pieces.

104
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,560
Then we need to compare.

105
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,040
Let's find the other side first.

106
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,560
They look the same.

107
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,280
Look, these colors are the same.

108
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,360
So this is training us.

109
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,560
Just observe the subtle differences.

110
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,280
You're good at observing.

111
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,120
Okay, I'll put this piece together.

112
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:56,880
It's kind of...

113
00:06:58,159 --> 00:06:58,640
Who?

114
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,040
My dad.

115
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,480
Happy birthday to you

116
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,000
Give me a reply.

117
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,480
No.

118
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,680
Happy birthday!

119
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:28,880
Son

120
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:29,480
Here.

121
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,480
Have a bowl of longevity noodles I made for you

122
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,440
Zhang Beihai

123
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,240
It's his birthday today

124
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,600
You just make a bowl of noodles and leave him like this?

125
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,280
Children are not picky.

126
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,960
I bought this for my son.

127
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:47,840
Nonsense.

128
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,000
Did I buy it for you?

129
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,240
You can still buy a birthday cake at this hour?

130
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,840
I ordered it in advance. I just got it back.

131
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:54,840
Look.

132
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,320
Sun Yimo is so thoughtful.

133
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,080
Qin can't fool the kid without him.

134
00:07:59,440 --> 00:07:59,960
Yes.

135
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,320
We're about to get off work.

136
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,080
Everyone is fine.

137
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,720
Let's celebrate Zhang Chi's birthday.

138
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,080
Thank you, uncle.

139
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,840
Thank you, uncle.

140
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:16,720
Happy birthday to you

141
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,680
Happy birthday to you

142
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:24,200
Happy birthday to you

143
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,600
Happy birthday, baby.

144
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,040
Happy birthday.

145
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,320
Thank you all. Thank you.

146
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,320
Thank you.

147
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,799
Look at the camera.

148
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,080
Smile.

149
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,960
Three, two, one.

150
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,320
Don't do that.

151
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,040
He's your dad.

152
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:56,840
Our problem

153
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,360
can't be solved in a few days.

154
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,320
Then we can solve it in a few more days.

155
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,480
Of course.

156
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,840
Two doctors

157
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,480
You have to treat your mental illness.

158
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,360
Look at you hiding like this.

159
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,480
You don't look like an adult at all.

160
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,320
I know something about the past.

161
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,480
But I don't know the details.

162
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Tell me.

163
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,600
I won't tell anyone.

164
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,480
I have a tight mouth.

165
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:46,000
My mom used to be the youngest

166
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,320
in the city North Hospital.

167
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,600
My dad is in Jiangdong Emergency Station.

168
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,840
was the front of our emergency center.

169
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,280
My parents were busy at that time.

170
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,040
I spent most of my childhood at the emergency station.

171
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,840
Beihai

172
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,000
Where is Zhang Beihai

173
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:03,560
He went to pick up the kid

174
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,080
What are you busy with?

175
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,080
I'm picking up the kid. I'll be right back.

176
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,280
These two

177
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,560
have time to give birth and have no time to raise children.

178
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,680
Our emergency station is almost a daycare center.

179
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,040
Isn't he here?

180
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,840
Let's go, Beihai

181
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,320
Say hello.

182
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,600
Hello, Uncle Dong Zi.

183
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,480
Hello.

184
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,360
Hello, Uncle Gu.

185
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,280
Good boy.

186
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,480
Good boy.

187
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:29,720
Dong Zi.

188
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:30,880
Get the clothes.

189
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,040
Sister Zhou, please take care of the kid.

190
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,040
Okay.

191
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,080
Let's go.

192
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,160
Say goodbye to Dad.

193
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,200
Goodbye, Dad.

194
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:44,440
Bye.

195
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,440
Be good.

196
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,160
Let's go inside.

197
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,720
What mission is it today?

198
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,040
67, Jiangdong.

199
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,160
A man broke his bone in North Street.

200
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,240
Here.

201
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,240
Have some meat.

202
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,360
Slow down.

203
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,800
Have some milk.

204
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,000
Director Qin,

205
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,720
You're like this when you eat.

206
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,520
Aren't you afraid that the rice will get into your nostrils?

207
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,120
There's a big surgery tomorrow.

208
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,240
I need to study his medical record.

209
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,480
If you figure this out,

210
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,600
what will you do?

211
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,120
This kid.

212
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,240
How dare you steal it from him?

213
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,200
Adults should behave like adults. Be an example.

214
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,880
Eat well when eating

215
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,240
Come on.

216
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,880
Okay, let's eat.

217
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,600
Here, eat more eggs.

218
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,360
Dad.

219
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,640
Tomorrow is weekend.

220
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,080
Can we go to the park?

221
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,720
No problem.

222
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,360
But...

223
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,640
Tomorrow?

224
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,440
But my mom has to work. Then the day after tomorrow.

225
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,600
I'll be fine the day after tomorrow.

226
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,400
I promise you.

227
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,360
Let's go to the park together, okay?

228
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:52,640
Eat up.

229
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,400
I remember my mom worked hard.

230
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,440
The lights were on in the study at 2 or 3 a.m.

231
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,360
Because of work,

232
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:16,280
[because of work.]

233
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,680
What can I do?

234
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,600
What can you do? What can I do?

235
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,480
Why do you always have a reason? What about me?

236
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,600
Today is an exception.

237
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,360
What exception?

238
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,640
Who cares if he doesn't pick him up?

239
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,120
What if something happens?

240
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,080
Why do you always have a reason?

241
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,120
Stop talking.

242
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,000
What should I do then?

243
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,320
Why don't you save him when he's dead?

244
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,000
What am I then?

245
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,320
Why is he so unreasonable?

246
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,760
That's strange.

247
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,240
Until that day...

248
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,800
I remember it was cold.

249
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,120
Snow is floating in the sky.

250
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,080
Come on.

251
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,040
Come on.

252
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,920
I'll cook for you and put it on the stove.

253
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,080
If you're hungry,

254
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,800
eat with me, okay?

255
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,440
Are you going out again?

256
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,680
Yes, I'm busy with work.

257
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,400
You've grown up.

258
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,440
Mom is sick.

259
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,160
Take good care of your mom, okay?

260
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:20,920
Be a man.

261
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,800
OK. OK.

262
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:23,200
Okay.

263
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,080
I'm leaving.

264
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,560
Mom, are you hungry?

265
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,680
I'm not hungry.

266
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,040
Mom.

267
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,440
Mom!

268
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,920
Mom, where are you?

269
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,400
Mom!

270
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,480
Mom!

271
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,920
Mom, where are you?

272
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,760
Mom!

273
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,560
Chi.

274
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:44,800
I didn't expect

275
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,960
you could go to college at 15.

276
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,760
I'm really happy for you.

277
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,040
You've brought honor to our family.

278
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:55,840
Tell me.

279
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,680
What gift do you want?

280
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,480
whatever you want.

281
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,480
I want to ask you something.

282
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:07,960
Go ahead.

283
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,160
On the day of the accident,

284
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,120
why didn't you save my mom?

285
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,480
Actually, I should explain this to you.

286
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,000
As an emergency doctor,

287
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,640
I should save those who have a glimmer of hope.

288
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,240
But you gave up on her just by looking at her.

289
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,360
With your ability,

290
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,160
give my mom one more minute,

291
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,000
and try your best to save her,

292
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,960
she has a slim chance of survival.

293
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,200
It's you.

294
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,800
didn't give her hope to live.

295
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,560
My mom is such an excellent person.

296
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,840
lost in marrying you

297
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,040
and marry a murderer who killed her.

298
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,120
Murderer?

299
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,560
I'm going to my grandpa's house.

300
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,120
I don't want to see you anymore.

301
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,840
I never came back to that house.

302
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,840
I've been living with my grandpa.

303
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,680
It's not easy for Xianbing to grow up.

304
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:34,960
Thank you.

305
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,720
You looked like touching a pet. Touching a dog.

306
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,040
Where did you put it?

307
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,200
Did you put two pieces together?

308
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:57,400
No.

309
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,680
Do it with your head.

310
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,320
Stop fighting.

311
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,200
Don't.

312
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,240
I finally put them together.

313
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:16,720
Slow down.

314
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,280
You make me look a little stupid.

315
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,240
You can't be

316
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,200
in everything.

317
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,200
Let's do it again

318
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:25,760
Let's start.

319
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,640
Oh my god. It's been hours.

320
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,320
What a waste.

321
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,680
Mom

322
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,760
What do you mean?

323
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:13,720
Well...

324
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,960
There's something I've been looking for lately.

325
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,840
a girl

326
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,080
a girl lives in my house.

327
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,280
There's nothing between us.

328
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,000
But

329
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,680
there seems to be something in my heart.

330
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,760
I don't know what I'm talking about.

331
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:33,760
Anyway,

332
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,840
It's all over after hearing what I said.

333
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,360
OK. Take care.

334
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:48,920
I'll be fine too.

335
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:51,920
Good luck to your son.

336
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,520
Yes, I'll be off work in half an hour.

337
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,120
Okay, see you at the cafe.

338
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,560
Yes, I'm going to work now.

339
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:57,840
Bye, Bo.

340
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,840
You even yawned.

341
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,720
Why is there no car today?

342
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,320
It's strange.

343
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,520
Isn't it good not to get out?

344
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,080
It's easy.

345
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,480
You even hung yourself on the idiom.

346
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,320
Seriously.

347
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,680
You should have some ideas.

348
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,840
Let's create

349
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,120
a cart of miracles.

350
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:23,920
You're disgusting.

351
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,520
Don't learn from Xu Chengyuan.

352
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,920
Let's go grocery shopping later.

353
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,600
Okay, let's buy some beef today.

354
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,960
I want to eat fried pork.

355
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:33,800
Make it yourself.

356
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,160
Buy whatever you want.

357
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
It's time to shift.

358
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,000
OK, right away.

359
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,280
By the way, Zhang Chi,

360
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,040
Mr. Liu is looking for you.

361
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:44,880
He asked you to move the car.

362
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,560
and occupy the parking space.

363
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:47,600
Go get changed.

364
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,840
No, I'm not sweating.

365
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,040
Just go home and wear it tomorrow.

366
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,320
Let's go together. I'm not going to change either.

367
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,160
Let's go.

368
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,440
Bye bye

369
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,720
Does your doll have so much homework now?

370
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,040
Yes.

371
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,040
Long time no see.

372
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:22,760
Honey.

373
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,840
We're divorced.

374
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,200
Can you stop pestering me?

375
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,120
We're not suitable for each other.

376
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,120
I can't lose you and our child.

377
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,200
I have nothing without you.

378
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,960
You can't let our child lose his father.

379
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,120
Please.

380
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,840
Can you give me another chance?

381
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,120
I know you still have feelings for me, right?

382
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:54,840
I beg you.

383
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,480
Can we get off and talk?

384
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,760
My mom is sick.

385
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,200
I can't run away with my mom here.

386
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,400
Fine.

387
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,840
Give me the car key.

388
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:12,840
Get down first.

389
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,560
Help! Help!

390
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,600
How dare you fool me?

391
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,160
They seem to be fighting.

392
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,440
Let's go.

393
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:52,640
Go away.

394
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,080
Don't come up. Get lost.

395
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,080
Put down the knife

396
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,000
Put down the knife first.

397
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,440
Put down the knife.

398
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,200
What are you doing?

399
00:28:59,400 --> 00:28:59,960
Go away.

400
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,080
Or I'll call the police.

401
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,760
I'll kill anyone who comes closer.

402
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:03,520
Let's go.

403
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,560
Call the police. I'll report to them.

404
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,160
Okay, I'll start the emergency plan right away.

405
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,280
You called the police?

406
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:35,880
Yes.

407
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,280
What's going on inside?

408
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,520
The kidnapper kidnapped a young man

409
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,720
and entered the convenience store.

410
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,120
I don't know what's left.

411
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:41,920
Yes.

412
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:42,920
The gas station

413
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,480
We've started the corresponding emergency plan.

414
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,040
Okay, thank you.

415
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:46,280
397462.

416
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,240
Hurry to the designated location.

417
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:03,840
Go!

418
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,160
Captain.

419
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,480
Based on the current situation,

420
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,920
and vehicle registration information,

421
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,160
the suspect and hostage inside

422
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,360
are ex-husband and wife.

423
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,680
The suspect spilled gasoline on the floor.

424
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:17,680
If it explodes,

425
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,720
we'll be implicated

426
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,040
will be implicated.

427
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,040
More importantly,

428
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:23,240
There's a kindergarten nearby.

429
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:28,560
First,

430
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,920
Don't shoot without an order.

431
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:31,400
Yes, sir.

432
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:32,240
Second,

433
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,720
Send a negotiator to check the situation.

434
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,360
Fire police, take emergency measures.

435
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:36,920
Yes, sir.

436
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:37,600
Third,

437
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:40,040
Assemble people to evacuate the residents.

438
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:40,680
As soon as possible.

439
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:41,400
Fourth,

440
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,240
Call 120 and ask for backup.

441
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,040
Copy that.

442
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,040
Xiao Long, Xiao Lei, we're on a mission.

443
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:51,480
Okay.

444
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,480
Okay, got it.

445
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:00,160
Ms. Lu, 120.

446
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,240
Hello, Ms. Lu.

447
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,480
Hello, Qiqi.

448
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,520
Where are you and Zhang Chi now?

449
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,840
We're near Zhang Chi's house.

450
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:08,640
Great.

451
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,120
There's a kidnapping case

452
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,080
near Zhang Chi's gas station.

453
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:13,440
Dr Ding and Dr. Gao are at the scene.

454
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,600
You go to support them now.

455
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:16,720
04577.

456
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:35,720
Buddy, I'm a negotiator of the police.

457
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:36,760
My name is Liu Yao.

458
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,200
Don't worry.

459
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,320
I didn't bring any weapons.

460
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,640
I didn't bring anything.

461
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,680
I'm here to help you.

462
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,880
Don't be impulsive.

463
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,200
There's still room for salvation.

464
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,320
Don't do anything stupid.

465
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:00,480
What's going on?

466
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,080
Hello.

467
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,160
For now,

468
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,200
are all under our control.

469
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,080
But the details are not clear.

470
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,480
So if there's an emergency later,

471
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,720
I'll let you know as soon as possible.

472
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:08,640
Okay.

473
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:12,840
Stay away.

474
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:13,960
Or I'll kill her.

475
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:14,520
Fine.

476
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,080
I'm right here. I'm not going in.

477
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,760
Brother, I'm here to help you.

478
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,520
You can tell me

479
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,600
you can tell me.

480
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:22,640
Get lost!

481
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,520
Get out of here! Get out!

482
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:33,960
Brother.

483
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:36,040
I think we're about the same age.

484
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,640
I'll call you brother.

485
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:39,320
Brother.

486
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,520
Listen to me.

487
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,320
Tell me

488
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,200
tell me.

489
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,200
I'll solve it with you, okay?

490
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,520
Our daughter is waiting for us at home.

491
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,520
She must miss you.

492
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:56,720
Let's watch her get married and have children together, okay?

493
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,960
Get married and have children.

494
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,480
together.

495
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,960
Together.

496
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,520
Don't lie to me.

497
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,520
My mom is dying.

498
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,240
Brother.

499
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:30,000
Please take her to the hospital.

500
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:31,400
Brother.

501
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:35,400
Who is this old man on the ground?

502
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,200
Did you fall down?

503
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,600
Do you want to go to the hospital?

504
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,720
That's our family matter.

505
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,200
None of your business.

506
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,400
But I think

507
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,640
he's seriously injured.

508
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,080
We have a doctor here.

509
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,160
Do you want to see a doctor?

510
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:56,160
Can you ask the doctor to come in?

511
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,600
Okay.

512
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,920
Call a doctor.

513
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:05,920
Just one.

514
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,640
The conditions are not good.

515
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,280
It's spacious outside.

516
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,400
It's easier to operate.

517
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:15,440
Cut the crap.

518
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,639
Do as I say.

519
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,280
Calm down.

520
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,920
I'll take care of it for you.

521
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,040
Call the doctor.

522
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:31,719
Hello, doctors.

523
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:32,920
We need a doctor over there.

524
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,040
Which one of you will come with me first?

525
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:34,679
I can.

526
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:35,560
Me too.

527
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,800
Those who are experienced, come with me.

528
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,040
Let me do it.

529
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:41,560
Captain.

530
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,440
This is the doctor from the emergency center.

531
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,320
Hello, doctor. What's your name?

532
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,199
My surname is Ding.

533
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,080
Hello, Dr Ding.

534
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,639
We are the Third Criminal Investigation Brigade.

535
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,960
I’m the captain. My surname is Wang.

536
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,560
The situation is critical.

537
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,320
The suspect has taken two hostages.

538
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,280
The old man is suspected to be stabbed by the suspect.

539
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,400
We've made a preliminary negotiation.

540
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,920
The suspect has agreed

541
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,400
to let the doctor in for treatment.

542
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:01,800
Can you do it?

543
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,400
We will be fully prepared

544
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:07,960
to ensure everyone's safety.

545
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,080
OK. OK.

546
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,160
The other party is very unstable.

547
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,680
Don't do unnecessary action.

548
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,640
Check the elderly. After the initial treatment,

549
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:19,560
and withdraw immediately.

550
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,880
Protect yourself.

551
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,840
We'll take care of the rest.

552
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,280
She can only come in.

553
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:47,640
Go over there.

554
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,240
Get her treated.

555
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,200
Hello, there's a kidnapping case.

556
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,160
Please leave as soon as possible.

557
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,160
Our 120...

558
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,000
Okay, this way.

559
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,080
Takato! Takato!

560
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,360
What's going on?

561
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,360
Why are you two here?

562
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,640
We came as soon as we got the call.

563
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:16,520
What's going on?

564
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:17,520
Here’s the thing.

565
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,520
This is our live commander, Captain Wang.

566
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:20,480
Hello, Captain Wang.

567
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,400
Hello.

568
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,600
This is the information

569
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,080
of the suspect and the victim.

570
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:24,880
Take a look.

571
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,200
The old lady lost too much blood.

572
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,680
She needs to be sent to the hospital now.

573
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,560
Ba-reum.

574
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,360
Should I go in and change him?

575
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,480
I need a doctor to save him.

576
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,080
Don't fool me. Get lost.

577
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,840
I beg you.

578
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,600
Can you take my mom to the hospital?

579
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,880
She'll die at this rate.

580
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,240
No one can leave.

581
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,840
Then you should let the doctor in for the suture.

582
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,480
You're a doctor. Help me.

583
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:49,960
I don't have a suture bag,

584
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:50,960
and I can't do it well.

585
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:51,960
Not every hospital doctor

586
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,000
surgical sutures.

587
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:53,720
Useless.

588
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,480
I was a cardiac surgeon. I'll stitch it up.

589
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:56,360
Zhang Chi.

590
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,200
Suture bag, hurry up.

591
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,240
Here it comes.

592
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,040
Give it to me.

593
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:08,560
Let's go together.

594
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:08,840
Let's go to 08401.

595
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:10,120

596
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:10,760
Let's go together.

597
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,280
Let go. Let go.

598
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:19,840
Let go.

599
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:43,680

600

Hurry up.

601
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:50,920
Let me do it.

602
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:52,720
Don't move.

603
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,640
Did you get the haemostatic injection?

604
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:01,920
Hemostatic injection?

605
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,800
There's no hemostatic injection.

606
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:11,560
Hurry up.

607
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,200
Get me the anesthesia.

608
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,320
I forgot the anesthetic.

609
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,560
I'll go get the medicine.

610
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:22,400
Go.

611
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:29,840
I'm sorry.

612
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:31,400
008401

613
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:34,600
Gao.

614
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,400
Give me the electrocardiogram. Give me the supply bag. Hurry.

615
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:37,560
Coming.

616
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,320
What's going on?

617
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,440
I'll go in.

618
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:41,280
It's okay.

619
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,080
Be careful.

620
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:42,680
It's okay.

621
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,040
Why are you here?

622
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,320
Where is he?

623
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:52,960
Dr Qi.

624
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,440
I can handle it without anesthesia.

625
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,440
I'll deliver the medicine.

626
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,560
I won't talk.

627
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,320
I won't affect you.

628
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:06,800
If I don't talk,

629
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,320
I'll send the medicine.

630
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:10,720
Go.

631
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,680
Don't move outside.

632
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:18,960
Don't come over.

633
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,800
Hurry up.

634
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,400
Doctor, how is my mom?

635
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,160
Doctor!

636
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:39,600
Doctor!

637
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:40,720
Don't ask.

638
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,080
Dong Liang, lower your knife.

639
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,360
You're too close to her aorta.

640
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,840
If you go a little further, she might be gone.

641
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:48,480
Treat her now.

642
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,240
Or I'll stab you to death.

643
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,600
Dong Liang, calm down.

644
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,680
If your mother-in-law and your ex-wife are safe,

645
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,240
you still have a chance.

646
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,120
If anything happens to them,

647
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,600
it'll be too late.

648
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:01,320
And Dong Liang.

649
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,680
I heard that you have

650
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:04,880
a three-year-old daughter.

651
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:07,280
You don't want your daughter

652
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,120
to grow up without her parents.

653
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,760
If you really set this place on fire,

654
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,800
will your daughter be able to live a decent life?

655
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,560
My daughter is waiting for me at home.

656
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:23,840
It's not good.

657
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,320
Auntie, can you hear me?

658
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,400
What's going on?

659
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,320
Mom!

660
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:32,920
Save him!

661
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:33,560
CPR.

662
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,080
Mom.

663
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,920
Doctor, tell me what happened to my mom.

664
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:40,520
She's scrambling.

665
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:40,960
Doctor.

666
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,560
It's okay. My heart stopped for five minutes.

667
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:43,600
We saved her.

668
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,840
Is she dead?

669
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,640
Mom.

670
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,400
She's dead.

671
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,480
Okay, today.

672
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:53,400
Let's die together today.

673
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,760
Dong Liang, you bastard!

674
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:31,440
Don't move!

675
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:32,680
Drop your weapon.

676
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,440
Let go of me!

677
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:35,880
Don't move.

678
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:36,440
Let's go.

679
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,000
Let me do it.

680
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:40,560
Calm down.

681
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:43,640
Step back. Hurry.

682
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,640
Take the bag first.

683
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:49,400
No no

684
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,000
Mom.

685
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,400
Mom!

686
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,800
I got it. My heart is beating back.
