1
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:06,040
National Radio. and Telvison. Administration.

2
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,039
Get out.

3
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,120
Come on. Come on.

4
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:44,920
Come on, come on, come on, come on

5
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:45,680
Come on, come on, come on

6
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:46,920
Come on. Come on.

7
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,039
I don't know.

8
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,840
I just asked Mr. Lu to leave.

9
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,680
Didn't you see it?

10
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:51,600
No.

11
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,080
He just left.

12
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,040
Please be quiet.

13
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,520
Today,

14
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,600
I have three things to say.

15
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,039
The first thing is to announce a new appointment.

16
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,160
After the central leadership party

17
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,600
by the leadership party.

18
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,840
to appoint Qi Qi as the Deputy Director of the center.

19
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,280
for a week.

20
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,600
Please cooperate with her.

21
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,040
Director Qi

22
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,040
Director Qi

23
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,480
Director Qi

24
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,280
Alright

25
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,600
The second thing

26
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,840
is about the New Year's holiday.

27
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,480
Where is the latest shift schedule?

28
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,840
in the group chat.

29
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,120
I hope

30
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,960
can take the last shift.

31
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,160
in order.

32
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,280
If you need to apply for leave for any special situation,

33
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,240
report to Director Qi.

34
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:49,040
The last thing is also the most important

35
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:53,120
Wish you all success in the new year.

36
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,040
Personal questions of individual comrades.

37
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,800
Hurry up.

38
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,160
I already have a boyfriend.

39
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,600
Xiao Qiu is still single.

40
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,720
Marry Huang Hao in place.

41
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,480
Be together. Be together.

42
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,520
Give it a try if you can't.

43
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,720
Move aside.

44
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,240
Qi Tuo, wish you two

45
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,480
in the new year.

46
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,360
Okay.

47
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,960
I'm waiting for your wedding candies.

48
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,360
Sure. I'll keep one more for you.

49
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,600
I'll pay you more.

50
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,960
It's not easy to work for you.

51
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:18,920
Okay, no problem.

52
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,920
Bye, Mr. Lu.

53
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:21,680
It's Director Qi's treat.

54
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,120
Director Qi has to treat us

55
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,120
Yes, you should.

56
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,440
Yes, treat us

57
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,840
Director Qi

58
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,880
Hello, Director Qi

59
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,920
Treat us

60
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,880
It's on me.

61
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,840
My treat.

62
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,280
I'll treat you to dinner. Please.

63
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,400
I'll...

64
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:44,520
Tonight.

65
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,000
Tonight.

66
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,280
By the way, Gao,

67
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,760
I saw your cup.

68
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,480
Let me tell you where it is.

69
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,800
Chen, don't bother.

70
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,040
I'd better not go to the hospital.

71
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:01,680
Mrs. Zhang.

72
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:02,920
Doctor Zhang will be here soon.

73
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,000
Just wait patiently.

74
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,280
Thank you.

75
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:07,800
It's okay.

76
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:08,800
Chen.

77
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,280
Doctor Zhang.

78
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,120
Who?

79
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,520
Sister, it's you.

80
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,680
I'm Zhang Beihai

81
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,399
of our community

82
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:21,800
We met before

83
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,280
Do you remember?

84
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,760
What's wrong?

85
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,640
I can't breathe.

86
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,160
My heart is beating.

87
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,680
It's okay. Let me check.

88
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,480
It's not cold.

89
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,120
Liang,

90
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:43,080
Didn't I tell you to get something cold last time?

91
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,760
It's not a cold day yet.

92
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,480
It's good for health

93
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:50,720
It's hot.

94
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,760
I'll buy you some cold drinks.

95
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,760
Okay, buy some.

96
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,760
Thank you, Chi.

97
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:55,640
You're welcome.

98
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,240
Thank you.

99
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,240
A healthy figure.

100
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,240
Dong Xiao Qiu.

101
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,280
We can't pass.

102
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,480
We're in the Wu's business today.

103
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,000
Yes, Dong Xiaosheng.

104
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,640
Dong Xiaosheng's family is rich.

105
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,480
Here are the noodles. Thank you.

106
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:16,880
So fast?

107
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,240
This is Dr Zhang's.

108
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:18,600
Okay.

109
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,880
This is yours.

110
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:20,880
Thank you.

111
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,680
I'll take your noodles.

112
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,120
Okay.

113
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,360
Hurry up, Liang.

114
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,360
Don't call him Mr Liang

115
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,960
Sister Qi, what are you waiting for?

116
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,760
Why aren't you eating?

117
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,360
Where did you buy this?

118
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,760
He hasn't come back for so long.

119
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,640
I'll go find him.

120
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,760
How could you get lost as an adult?

121
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,600
You're so sweet.

122
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,360
Yeah.

123
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,320
Here's a needle.

124
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:45,720
00840.

125
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,280
What do you want to drink?

126
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:05,640
Let's go.

127
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,640
Dr. Zhang, the ambulance is here.

128
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:28,920
Come on.

129
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,400
Who called 120?

130
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,280
I did. Here.

131
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,000
Where's the patient?

132
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,400
Dad, why are you here?

133
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,480
I came to check on the patient.

134
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,720
Old people have high blood pressure.

135
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,920
His blood pressure is high now.

136
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:45,760
Heart rate is a bit fast.

137
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:47,400
Her lower limbs are swollen.

138
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,280
I think it's chronic heart failure.

139
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,760
It's safer to send him to the hospital.

140
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,000
No need to carry the stretcher.

141
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,280
Get the patient in the car.

142
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:55,920
Be careful.

143
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,720
Grandma, can you walk?

144
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,520
What about the patient's family?

145
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,880
Hello, I'm a community worker.

146
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,000
She lives alone all year long.

147
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,520
She has no children or family.

148
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,880
Who will follow the car?

149
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:06,720
I'll follow.

150
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:08,920
I'll go.

151
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,640
Thank you, Dr Zhang.

152
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,600
It's okay.

153
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:12,840
Slow down.

154
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,360
Watch the steps

155
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,000
It's quite cold. You've lost weight.

156
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,520
Not bad.

157
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,360
Your equipment is quite complete.

158
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,120
Of course.

159
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:30,760
Slow down, aunt.

160
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,360
Slow down. Don't panic.

161
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,400
Cheers

162
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,400
Oh my.

163
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,760
This is the situation.

164
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,760
So I want to see if you have any suggestions

165
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,000
or share experience.

166
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,280
Got it.

167
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,880
Okay, I knew it.

168
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,920
So,

169
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,120
you and Sister Qi had a little conflict

170
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,640
because of what happened abroad.

171
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,000
And then?

172
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,520
I'm afraid the future emotional road will be a little shady.

173
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,280
Now you ask us to come here

174
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,720
to warm up

175
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,880
to warm you up, right?

176
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,240
You're right.

177
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,040
Give me some practical advice.

178
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,480
Yes, very smooth.

179
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,480
I suggest Sister Qi.

180
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,720
Her hobby is niche.

181
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,840
and fascinated.

182
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,760
It's hard to say.

183
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,520
If it weren't for this,

184
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,240
give her a silk banner,

185
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:35,920
Think about it.

186
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,400
The banner is the highest honor of a doctor.

187
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,880
Or buy a coin

188
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,240
and carve a few words on it.

189
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,360
This love is firmer than gold.

190
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:47,400
Keep going to 99999

191
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,360
I can't stand it anymore.

192
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,920
Who brought him here? Who brought him here?

193
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,520
Jia Qi, did he give you the banner?

194
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,120
I don't want it. My goodness.

195
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,520
You don't have to give it to me. Thank you.

196
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:56,760
Here are your shoes.

197
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,360
Then tell me what to do.

198
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,400
I'll tell you.

199
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,640
My master

200
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,000
is more creative.

201
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:04,640
How about this?

202
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:05,880
Take her to the amusement park.

203
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,120
You ride the carousel.

204
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,760
Isn't the carousel rotating around?

205
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,600
She faints easily.

206
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,840
When she faints,

207
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,640
give her a hand.

208
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,000
The Ferris wheel

209
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:16,760
Ferris wheel.

210
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,920
Look, it's turning higher and higher.

211
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,720
When it reaches the highest point,

212
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,240
she will scream and be scared.

213
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,760
and hug you.

214
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,600
Look at your relationship.

215
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,000
Xu Chengyuan, have you watched too many idol dramas?

216
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,600
What kind of bad idea is that?

217
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,120
What good idea do you have?

218
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,280
In my opinion,

219
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:42,760
Propose?

220
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,880
The tables and tents are ready.

221
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,360

222
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,880
Wine and water barbecue is ready.

223
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Thank you.

224
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,120
Hello.

225
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,640
Okay, I'll arrange an ambulance for you nearby.

226
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,160
Hello, don't worry.

Got it.

Master, what are you looking for?

240
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,120
Nothing. Nothing.

241
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,760

242
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,200
It's okay. Go on with your work.

243
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,600
What are you looking for, Zhang Chi?

244
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:23,520
Nothing.

Why are you squatting there?

I'm tiing my shoelaces.

Where are they?

249
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,000
I want to ask you.

250
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,200
What did you do to them?

251
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,000
I'm not the director.

252
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,240
I can't order others around.

253
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,360
Did you lose something?

254
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,200
No.

255
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,400
I really lost something. Let me help you.

256
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,120
No.

257
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,480
What is it? My phone.

258
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,520
I have it.

259
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,120

260
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,880

261
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:48,880
What does it look like?

262
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:49,720
Let me help you.

263
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:52,880
Forget it.

264
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,600
It's not important.

265
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,480
What's not important?

266
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,880
Tell me. I'll help you.

I didn't find it.

272
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,760
Forget it then.

273
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,200
I don't want to forget it either. I...

274
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,119
You can't find it, right?

275
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:11,640
Yes.

276
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,640
Come to me if you can't find me.

277

278

Is this it?

279
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,280
Are you funny?

280
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,000
What?

281
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,200
Why did you steal my ring?

282
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,720
Who stole your stuff? I picked it up.

283
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,840
I picked it up in front of the changing room.

284
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,000
How did I get it in your pocket?

285
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,520
Why is it in my hand?

286
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,200
Give it back to me.

287
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,600
I'm useful.

288
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,400
Lend it to me.

289
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:07,960
Give it back to me.

290
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,120
I have something to tell you.

291
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,280
Will you marry me?

293
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,080
Zhang Chi, I've been raising it for a long time.

294
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,520
You...

295
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:47,800
Will you marry me?

296
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:53,240
Will you marry me?

297
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,240
No, no, no.

298
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,560
Shouldn't I say marry him?

299
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,960
Marry him! Marry him!

300
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:04,000
It's the same. It's the same.

301
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,880
I'm so tired.

302
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,320
Are you happy? Surprise?

303
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,120
Are you surprised?

304
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,480
Are you happy?

305
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,040
Yes.

306
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,560
Will you marry me?

307
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:21,800
Sure.

308
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:05,560
This...

309
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,280
Did you propose?

310
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,720
I was quite worried.

311
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:12,000
We used to live together,

312
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,800
But one is the landlord and the other is the tenant.

313
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:15,760
It's illegal.

314
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,240
Who?

315
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,320
How am I illegal?

316
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,680
Yes, the tenant and this.

317
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:22,360
Yes, the relationship between the tenant and the landlord

318
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,160
will become legally married.

319
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,280
we'll really be together.

320
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,720
I regret it.

321
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,280
I'm not going back on my word. I need to get prepared.

322
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,680
Let me think what I can do first.

323
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,040
I need to prepare for the meal.

324
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,360
I'll make a list first.

325
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,280
The barbecue is ready.

326
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,000
Let's go. It's done.

327
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:37,920
Let's go for barbecue.

328
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,080
Chicken leg. I'll make you Kung Pao Chicken Ding.

329
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:40,760
Are you serious?

330
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,320
Really?

331
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,960
It looks good.

332
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:43,800
Of course.

333
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:44,720
Here.

334
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,760
Are you a doctor or a cook?

335
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,800
I don't know.

336
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:49,280
Thank you.

337
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,280
Thank you.

338
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,520
Have one.

339
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,000
I'll hold it for you. I don't think you have enough.

340
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,280
It's almost time.

341
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,000
Let's raise our glasses.

342
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:00,920
Come on.

343
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,040
Happy New Year.

344
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,080
Happy New Year!

345
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:03,840
Happy New Year.

346
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,760
I'm so happy.

347
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,000
I'll say something.

348
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:11,520
Okay.

349
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,520
Say something.

350
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,160
You've become an official now.

351
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,800
It's different to work in a company.

352
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,720
Really

353
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,800
First of all, congratulations to Sister Qi

354
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,200
on your proposal.

355
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,760
Objection! Objection! Objection!

356
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,240
Why?

357
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,000
I planned this.

358
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,920
You two have turned against each other.

359
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,160
Okay? Stop it.

360
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,520
You two knew she found the ring.

361
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,560
Why didn't you tell me?

362
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,480
We're talking about the iron porcelain with Sister Qi.

363
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,680
Right? Yes.

364
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,600
They are all my people.

365
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,680
You're a cardiac surgeon. You're an outsider.

366
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,000
Yes.

367
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,080
I'm an emergency patient too.

368
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,080
I'm yours too.

369
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,000
Disgusting.

370
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,760
You're disgusting.

371
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,320
No, the second thing.

372
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,200
I can't take it anymore.

373
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,160
I can't stand it.

374
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,160
Second,

375
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,720
everyone

376
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,360
I want to say a new year's wish.

377
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:51,720
Okay.

378
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,240
Okay.

379
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,280
I'll go first.

380
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,000
In the new year,

381
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,520
Jia Qi.

382
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,760
I hope we can get married.

383
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,160
So cheesy.

384
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,520
Good wish. Be good to Jiaqi.

385
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,280
Of course.

386
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:04,840
Really?

387
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:05,720
Then you do it.

388
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,800
I hope it's not just a new year.

389
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,600
In the future,

390
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:15,560
after we get married,

391
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,080
and happy.

392
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,280
Sun Jiaqi, why are you so weak?

393
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,080
Right?

394
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,280
I'm shy too. What should I do?

395
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:21,920
She's shy.

396
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,520
She's only seven or eight years old. It's normal to be shy.

397
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,280
It's okay to be shy.

398
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,480
My wish is that

399
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,320
everyone can be happy and healthy.

400
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,320
It's mainly because you...

401
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,160
Yes.

402
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:33,840
The layout is open.

403
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,040
My new year wish is

404
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,320
all of us can eat without getting fat.

405
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:40,920
Okay.

406
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,480
Really.

407
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,920
Come to our house.

408
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,520
It's your turn, Dr. Zhang.

409
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,760
I have a lot of wishes. You go first.

410
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:48,600
I'll go first.

411
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,840
In the new year, I hope

412
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,320
all the elders of our family can be healthy

413
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,200
and happy.

414
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,920
Most importantly, we have to be safe and happy.

415
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,280
so that we can save more people.

416
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,520
Great. Very good.

417
00:22:59,160 --> 00:22:59,760
Come on, Zhang.

418
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,560
My new year wish is

419
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,760
all my wishes will come true.

420
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,240
You are a little oily now.

421
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,600
Do you know what to do?

422
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,480
Zhang Chi, you're disgusting.

423
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:12,680
This is

424
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,000
This is your unique name.

425
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:14,680
What mine?

426
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,480
It's beautiful.

427
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:25,800
Dr Zhang.

428
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:32,720
Come in.

429
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,960
Sir, are you looking for me?

430
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,040
Do you still see me as your teacher?

431
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,960
How long has it been since you visited me?

432
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,280
If I hadn't texted you,

433
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,920
I wouldn't have seen you.

434
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,160
Have a seat.

435
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,360
I've been wanting to visit you.

436
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,720
But I don't have time.

437
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:54,080
You came without changing your clothes.

438
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,520
Okay, Chi. I know you're busy.

439
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,160
Look.

440
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:02,520
This is the information and honor

441
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,640
when you were a cardiologist.

442
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,160
I've kept them for you.

443
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,400
Here, take it yourself.

444
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,720
Return it to me.

445
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,600
Thank you, Director.

446
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:19,520
0104577.

447
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,200
Why did you suddenly give me these?

448
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:22,400
0104577.

449
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,280
Chi.

450
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,520
Since you refused to go to the research center,

451
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,160
the leaders of the Municipal Health Commission

452
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,040
feel sorry for you.

453
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,400
But they value you.

454
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,920
They think people like you can't be wasted.

455
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:37,280
I hope you can go back to Cardio Surgery

456
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,840
and do our own research.

457
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,400
How is it?

458
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,160
Don't worry. I don't need you to do the surgery.

459
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,600
Do your own research.

460
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,280
It's hard to think but not hard.

461
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,280
Sir, this...

462
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,040
It's too sudden.

463
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,160
Don't feel pressured and follow your heart.

464
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,280
I know.

465
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,520
He should be off work soon.

466
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,160
What do you want to eat?

467
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,480
I have to go.

468
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,840
Qiu, Huang, Chen Da has left.

469
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:29,400
Okay.

470
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:32,560
Are you okay?

471
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,000
Sister Qi fell down

472
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:33,720
Sister, are you okay?

473
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,280
Are you okay

474
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:36,960
I hit my knees.

475
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,040
It's okay. Let me try.

476
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:39,920
Slow down. Hold it.

477
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:40,800
Don't touch me.

478
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:41,560
Let me help you.

479
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,160
No, no.

480
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,840
What should we do?

481
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:45,920
What should we do?

482
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,360
Gao,

483
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:48,960
Can you pay the car for me?

484
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:49,720
Okay, give it to me.

485
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,480
Hurry up.

486
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:50,960
Come with me.

487
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,720
Hurry up.

488
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:53,840
Be careful.

489
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:54,720
Listen to Gao

490
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:55,720
Take care of me.

491
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,840
Chen Da, let's go.

492
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:58,960
Let me help you.

493
00:27:59,160 --> 00:27:59,920
It's okay. Don't worry about me.

494
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:00,960
I'll take a break. Go back to work.

495
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:01,960
I'm fine. I'm really fine.

496
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,280
Are you sure? Hurry up.

497
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,720
Hurry up.

498
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,040
If you don't get out,

499
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,160
I'm already eating my wife's cooking.

500
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,960
You must've been starving in your previous life.

501
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,280
Your sister-in-law is about to give birth.

502
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,040
She even asked her to cook.

503
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,840
You don't understand.

504
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,840
What is your sister-in-law?

505
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,360
She loves cooking.

506
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,520
She likes cooking.

507
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,520
She is...

508
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,040
See, whoever is here.

509
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,400
Hello, honey.

510
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,600
Honey, where are you?

511
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,160
I tripped over a chair.

512
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:01,640
What's wrong?

513
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,160
I'm bleeding.

514
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,840
Call the ambulance and go to the hospital.

515
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,280
Aren't you 120?

516
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,720
Okay, I know.

517
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,800
I'll find someone right away.

518
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,040
What's wrong?

519
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,800
Doctor, over here.

520
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:27,960
Who's her family?

521
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:28,840
I'm her brother.

522
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:29,560
What's going on?

523
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,720
My sister is doing homework outside.

524
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,160
Then a group of kids came to play with her.

525
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:32,960
I don't know why.

526
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,920
Kids, let me take a look.

527
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,720
Can you breathe?

528
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,800
Did you eat something?

529
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,080
My parents went out to deliver.

530
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:43,960
I'm alone in the shop.

531
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,600
Let me take a look.

532
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,040
There might be something in your throat.

533
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,560
Come on, stand up, kid.

534
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,440
Cooperate.

535
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,080
Bend a bit.

536
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,160
Right away

537
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:08,680
It's coming out

538
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,960
Let me take a look.

539
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,680
Kid, are you feeling better now?

540
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,320
Is your breathing normal?

541
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,560
Much better, right?

542
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,320
There's some blood here.

543
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,440
Family, let me tell you.

544
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,440
The foreign object is out now,

545
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:22,040
But the trachea may be scratched.

546
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,320
We need to go to the Fourth Courtyard for further examination, OK?

547
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,720
Yes, go, go

548
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,800
Okay, open the door.

549
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,800
Come here, kid.

550
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:30,680
Lock the door.

551
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,800
and cooperate with us.

552
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:32,640
Okay.

553
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,400
Take care.

554
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,680
Come on.

555
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,680
The baby's throat is stuck.

556
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,560
I took care of it.

557
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,560
But there's still a scratch.

558
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,560
We need further treatment.

559
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,040
Qiu, Huang.

560
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,160
Something happened to my family.

561
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:11,800
I have to go now.

562
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:12,560
Thank you, uncle.

563
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,440
Let's go. Save him first.

564
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:27,920
Honey.

565
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,400
I could have come back earlier today.

566
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,200
Emergency.

567
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,800
I came late

568
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,200
so I came late.

569
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:37,800
I saved a child.

570
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,080
So...

571
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:45,840
What took you so long?

572
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,720
It was an emergency, honey.

573
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,800
The baby is gone.

574
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,080
The baby is gone.

575
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:29,920
Honey.

576
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,440
I'm sorry.

577
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:30,320
What do you do?

578
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,320
I'm an ambulance doctor.

579
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:33,920
No wonder.

580
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,560
Doctor, is this serious?

581
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,320
What's going on?

582
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:40,840
There's an old injury

583
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:41,679
has an old injury.

584
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:45,400
It should be caused by

585
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,800
and the wrong posture of exercise.

586
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:53,560
The situation

587
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,199
is quite serious.

588
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,200
In my case,

589
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,160
in this situation?

590
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,680
You need to rest your knees for a while.

591
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:05,600
During this period,

592
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,080
I suggest you not do strenuous exercise.

593
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,800
to hurt your knees.

594
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:13,320
You'll have surgery if you don't pay attention.

595
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:14,560
How about this?

596
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:16,600
I'll prescribe some medicine for you.

597
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,560
I'm back.

598
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,280
You're so lucky.

599
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,560
I just made the noodles.

600
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,560
I'm late.

601
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,040
Why are you so late?

602
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,400
Don't mention it. I fell down.

603
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:49,960
Where did you fall?

604
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,600
I'm fine. I'm fine.

605
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,720
Which leg? Let me see.

606
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,920
No, I just fell here.

607
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,920
It's okay. Look how scared Xianbing is.

608
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:57,920
Hurry up. I'm hungry.

609
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,800
Let's eat. I'm fine.

610
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,720
We have to go to the hospital tomorrow.

611
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,520
Go.

612
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,560
You'll know when you're done. Hurry up.

613
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,840
Why are you so careless?

614
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,440
I took some time to rest there.

615
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:09,720
I'm starving.

616
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:14,920
Be careful.

617
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:16,800
Delicious.

618
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,440
If I didn't become an emergency doctor,

619
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,040
what else can I do?

620
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,800
Why do you ask this suddenly?

621
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,560
I'm just asking.

622
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,040
Just asking

623
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,560
I'll just answer it casually.

624
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:51,920
I think

625
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,080
with your figure,

626
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,680
with your appetite,

627
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,200
I have nothing to say.

628
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,800
The best candidate is the tasting staff.

629
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,440
Other people

630
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,200
can only try one meal a day.

631
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,200
You can try three meals.

632
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,200
And you won't gain weight after eating.

633
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,720
I'll beat you, Zhang Chi.

634
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:15,040
It's not good to just eat without getting fat.

635
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:19,720
Just kidding.

636
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,560
The best job for you is to be an emergency doctor.

637
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,320
If you don't,

638
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,680
it'll be a huge loss to our ER.

639
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:30,840
Right?

640
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,720
Why are you so serious?

641
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:36,520
What's wrong?

642
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,080
Are you hiding something from me?

643
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,960
I'm hiding something from you.

644
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:45,560
What is it?

645
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,080
I want another bowl.

646
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,520
to satisfy you.

647
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,040
Don't go.

648
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,560
I'll satisfy you.

649
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:10,680
Who said that?

650
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,080
What should I say?

651
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,400
She must feel guilty.

652
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,800
I don't understand.

653
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,800
Let's wait until she comes back.

654
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,080
What will you say later?

655
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,800
He's here. Tell me what happened.

656
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:23,720
Well...

657
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:25,680
It's embarrassing.

658
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,800
Tell me. What are you doing?

659
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:31,440
I was happy yesterday. Didn't I drive for you?

660
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,040
When we went home,

661
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,280
his wife

662
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:36,920
Huang Hao.

663
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,320
My sister-in-law accidentally fell

664
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,160
and had an abortion.

665
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,560
Help us apply for leave.

666
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:54,920
Okay.

667
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,080
Don't say it.

668
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,800
I didn't say it.

669
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,080
Qi Qi, Zhang Chi, why are you here?

670
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:09,920
Let's take a look.

671
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:10,920
Yes, let's see her.

672
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:14,280
Sister-in-law.

673
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,080
I'm sorry.

674
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,440
If it weren't for the happiness,

675
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,440
it wouldn't have happened.

676
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,200
I'm sorry.

677
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:22,600
I'm sorry.

678
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,680
It's okay.

679
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,280
I'm happy.

680
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:29,560
I'm tired.

681
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:32,320
Okay.

682
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:32,840
OK.

683
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:33,760
We won't disturb 001.

684
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,920
We won’t disturb you.

685
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:35,400
Have a good rest, 084001.

686
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,080
Have a good rest, 0084001.

687
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:36,320
Rest well.

688
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,160
I'll see you off.

689
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,160
I'm so sorry

690
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,440
It's really okay, Qi Qi.

691
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,440
Don’t blame yourself.

692
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:56,680
It's true that something happened to her attitude.

693
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,040
Any attitude is fine.

694
00:39:59,080 --> 00:39:59,920
It's not a big deal.

695
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,200
What a big accident!

696
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,560
Are you okay?

697
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,040
I'm fine, really.

698
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,040
120.

699
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,280
Yes.

700
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:19,840
I couldn't figure it out for a while yesterday.

701
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,600
I was thinking

702
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,800
I saved someone else's child,

703
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,080
but I lost my own child.

704
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:35,880
Jiangdong EN

705
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:36,680
Jiangdong EMSS.

706
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,680
I'm just thinking

707
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,440
I'm a 120 emergency doctor.

708
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:43,800
I saved a lot of people.

709
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,200
We saved a lot of people.

710
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,800
But when our family needed us the most,

711
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,440
when my family needed us the most,

712
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,440
I can't save her.

713
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,080
I can't.

714
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,960
I even thought

715
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,200
if I should continue this industry.

716
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,400
Don't let your wife see it.

717
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:14,920
What did the doctor say?

718
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,360
Luckily, the doctor said

719
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,280
we are still young.

720
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,520
We have the ability to regenerate.

721
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:26,840
Life is unpredictable.

722
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:30,600
Bad luck has come to you.

723
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,920
Be brave and optimistic.

724
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:35,560
Face it.

725
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:39,560
There's an old injury

726
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:40,440
has an old injury.

727
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:41,800
It should be you who oppressed your knees for a long time.

728
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:44,080
It should be caused by you

729
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:47,560
and the wrong posture of exercise.

730
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:49,080
Can I

731
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:50,920
in this situation?

732
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,920
You need to rest your knees for a while.

733
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:55,920
During this period,

734
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,280
I suggest you not do strenuous exercise.

735
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:01,400
