1
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:06,040
National Radio. And Telvison Administration

2
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,479
Put this on first.

3
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,640
Tighten it.

4
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,120
For example, after you put it on,

5
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:41,759
custom-made.

6
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,240
Yes.

7
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,840
We

8
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,640
we need to put it here

9
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:49,720
should be put here.

10
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,120
It's a bit high.

11
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,000
Usually we stand

12
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:55,360
We stand.

13
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,960
Our operation

14
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,479
do the most?

15
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,720
It's the bridge that has done the most.

16
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,560
How to do this?

17
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,720
Let me tell you the process.

18
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,440
You have to open it first.

19
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,240
Then open it.

20
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,480
Then put the extra fat

21
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,200
and show it.

22
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,360
And then?

23
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,720
At the same time,

24
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,200
my assistant doctor

25
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:20,840
My student.

26
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:25,120
Please cut this patient's left leg

27
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,240
on his left leg.

28
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,960
to the heart.

29
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,560
This is called a match.

30
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,760
Why is that?

31
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,640
Because

32
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:13,720
Well...

33
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,440
It's just stitching, but...

34
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,480
Make them stick together.

35
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,600
There won't be any cracks.

36
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,360
It won't be a problem.

37
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,240
Your patients don't know

38
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,240
how cool you are to save them.

39
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:47,840
right?

40
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,440
This...

41
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,840
The light is a little close to my forehead today.

42
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,560
It's hot.

43
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,120
Well...

44
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,200
When I was young,

45
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,600
I always thought

46
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:17,880
I'm learning a major.

47
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:19,079
I may work for the rest of my life.

48
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,640
for the rest of my life.

49
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,640
Sometimes,

50
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,600
your life is not arranged like this.

51
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,120
It's just a process.

52
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,360
Gold shines everywhere.

53
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,120
Zhang Chi, you're a great doctor.

54
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,320
Very good.

55
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,200
Yes.

56
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,960
I can do it if I can't.

57
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,960
I can do it.

58
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,480
I can study.

59
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,200
Well...

60
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,120
No surgery.

61
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:52,880
That's right.

62
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,080
You're right.

63
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,200
Wipe it

64
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,360
wipe it clean.

65
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,320
Zhang Chi.

66
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,840
It's okay.

67
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,000
It's okay.

68
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:30,720
It's okay.

69
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,480
Oh no!

70
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,960
Dr. Zhang, get up.

71
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,600
You got up to exercise.

72
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,840
Did you forget?

73
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:00,960
No.

74
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,360
Impossible.

75
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,480
I remember everything.

76
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,320
What do you remember?

77
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,480
I just

78
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,240
say goodbye to my old friends.

79
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,240
What else?

80
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,200
There's something else.

81
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:20,960
Great.

82
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,960
Just kidding.

83
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,720
Yesterday, you said you would cool the five of them.

84
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:28,920
Qi Tuo.

85
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,080
I repeat.

86
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,480
They are jellyfish.

87
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,440
not jellyfish.

88
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,920
Can you stop thinking about eating them?

89
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,000
You said you wanted to mix some garlic yesterday.

90
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,240
Who said that yesterday?

91
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,920
That's nonsense.

92
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,960
Why do you always want jellyfish?

93
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,440
That's what you said yesterday.

94
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,360
OK?

95
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,480
You need to stretch after exercising.

96
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,320
Folks, look who's back.

97
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,960
Chi.

98
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,200
You got to work so soon.

99
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,320
Chi, why are you back?

100
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,360
How's your hand?

101
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,440
How is it?

102
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,440
How is your hand

103
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,840
Excuse me.

104
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,320
Don't push Dr. Zhang.

105
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,320
Let him get some air.

106
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,320
Are you okay?

107
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,600
I can do nothing

108
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,680
nothing else can be delayed.

109
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,440
That's good.

110
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,440
My representative.

111
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,720
I'm here to say hello

112
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,040
to say hello.

113
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,200
Your hand...

114
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,440
Stay away from his hand.

115
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,800
Stay away from him.

116
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,240
Hurry up.

117
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,880
Go back to sleep.

118
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:30,960
He's going to the TV station

119
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,039
for an interview.

120
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,360
Do what you should do.

121
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,320
Don't stand there.

122
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,799
Guys, get to work.

123
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,120
Get to work.

124
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,200
Here.

125
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,680
Use your right hand.

126
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,200
I've had breakfast.

127
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,080
Mr. Cui, this is for you.

128
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,560
Give it to Zhang Chi.

129
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,440
Zhang Chi has eaten too.

130
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:10,960
It starts.

131
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,200
It's starting

132
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,080
Come to me.

133
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,680
Come and see me.

134
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,800
Look, it's starting.

135
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,720
Hello, Dr Zhang.

136
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,720
First of all, thank you very much.

137
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,440
Dr. Zhang looks handsome on camera.

138
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,800
Is he a fan?

139
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,360
Maybe.

140
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,720
I have to put on makeup.

141
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,080
Stop arguing or I can't hear you.

142
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,960
How's your hand?

143
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,360
Well...

144
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,960
I used to be a cardiac surgeon.

145
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:42,200
I don't think

146
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:43,720
in the future.

147
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,480
I'm sorry for that.

148
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,520
Recently, people are paying more attention to the emergency treatment in front of the hospital.

149
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,720
You were on the morning news

150
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,760
on the street.

151
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,320
We know that

152
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,840
you're here for emergency treatment.

153
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,920
So I've been wanting to talk to you.

154
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,440
about the transfer.

155
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,520
But we happened to meet

156
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,480
You stopped the patient's family

157
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,840
and hurt your hand.

158
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,160
So I want to interview you.

159
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,560
What do you think

160
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,240
what do you think about this incident?

161
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,000
If God gives me a chance to start over,

162
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,000
I think I will still make the same decision.

163
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,760
As a doctor,

164
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,120
what is our original intention?

165
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,240
To cure patients.

166
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,080
Actually, the 120 doctor

167
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,640
patients' emergency.

168
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,880
We even pulled them back from the death line.

169
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,720
Whether it's cardiac surgeons or emergency doctors,

170
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,160
our goal is to save every patient.

171
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,200
I thought

172
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,000
I had to stop

173
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,520
his self-harm.

174
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,680
gradually,

175
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,920
and let it go.

176
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,560
Now many viewers of our show

177
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,680
care about you.

178
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,000
He's really kind.

179
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,840
He's already

180
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,520
a qualified first aid doctor.

181
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,120
First of all, thank you for your concern.

182
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,480
As a doctor,

183
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,320
I...

184
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,880
I hope everyone will be fine.

185
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,120
to see a doctor.

186
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,480
I hope

187
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,400
can be healthy.

188
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,560
Okay, thank you for your blessings, Dr Zhang.

189
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,000
Zhang.

190
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,920
Dong.

191
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,760
I asked him for the car key.

192
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,280
It's been a long time.

193
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,440
It's so clean

194
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,600
Here too.

195
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,760
Okay, Zhang.

196
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,280
miss our ambulance when he was hospitalized.

197
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,480
Think about it.

198
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,200
Many critical patients

199
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,160
were saved by us.

200
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,760
This car

201
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:00,720
is like

202
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,280
our armor and our war horse.

203
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,840
It's just like

204
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,960
my scalpel

205
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,920
match the needle and thread.

206
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,200
It fits.

207
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,960
Isn't it stitching?

208
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,280
Suture.

209
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,840
Cardio Surgery is called a combination.

210
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,760
It doesn't matter.

211
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,200
Of course it's different.

212
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,000
Look.

213
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,280
This is a kiss.

214
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,160
There's no gap in kissing.

215
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,960
So, cardiothoracic Surgery is called a combination?

216
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,440
Yes.

217
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,520
The combination surgery we did

218
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,840
two blood vessels are like

219
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:35,960
together.

220
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,280
Dr. Zhang is so meticulous.

221
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:40,760
0104577.

222
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,240
Now you're a carpenter.

223
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,480
0104577.

224
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,520
Let me show you something.

225
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,080
to cheer you up.

226
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,080
0104577.

227
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,520
Pull down. There's a message.

228
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,480
Let me read it to you.

229
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,960
The message board.

230
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,120
1,685 people commented 120.

231
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,200
He said

232
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,680
I feel so sad.

233
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,720
On behalf of myself,

234
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,120
on behalf of myself.

235
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:16,720
There's one down there.

236
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,720
This picture is a pretty girl 120

237
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,800
This girl said

238
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,800
I'm a high school student.

239
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,280
I'm preparing for the college entrance exam this year.

240
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,520
After seeing Dr Zhang,

241
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,600
I want to help the dying and go forward bravely.

242
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33,160
and become an angel in white.

243
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,800
And the one below.

244
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,560
My dad said he would still help you under the risk.

245
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,040
I should be grateful.

246
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,160
It's because people have to endure

247
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,320
I have to endure a few times of pressure

248
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,320
to complete it.

249
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,760
There are people we saved here.

250
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,520
Isn't this Dr. Zhang Chi?

251
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,760
My legs were swollen and painful.

252
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,240
My family didn't think it was serious.

253
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,400
Dr Zhang insisted that I go to the hospital

254
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,920
so that my illness was discovered and treated in time.

255
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,840
When Dr. Zhang Chi was still in the Cardiac Surgery,

256
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,440
he was my daughter Dan Dan's doctor.

257
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,720
He left Cardio Surgery,

258
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,240
he still cares about Dan Dan's condition.

259
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,000
I was running around for Dan Dan.

260
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,560
I was misunderstood

261
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,480
and never gave up.

262
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:24,240
He insisted on giving Dan Dan his second life.

263
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,080
He's a very kind

264
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,320
and responsible doctor.

265
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,000
Dr Zhang saved my life too.

266
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,600
I lost consciousness in a car accident.

267
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,840
If Dr Zhang hadn't passed by

268
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,040
and saved me in time,

269
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,640
I might not even make it to the ambulance.

270
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,040
My daughter said

271
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,720
Dr Zhang gave her two candy.

272
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,040
She won't be afraid anymore after eating it.

273
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,200
She hoped Dr Zhang wouldn't be afraid.

274
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,760
These are the people you saved, Dr Zhang.

275
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,840
And this person said

276
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,000
Dr Zhang,

277
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,960
You saved my dad's life.

278
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,960
I hope you'll be safe in this life.

279
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,040
You saved so many people.

280
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,560
I'll call him back.

281
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,320
Call him.

282
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,760
Doctor Zhang.

283
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,760
Doctor Zhang.

284
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,360
Welcome back to 120.

285
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,600
Hua Zi.

286
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,000
What formation is this?

287
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,760
The formation to welcome Dr. Zhang.

288
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,520
Dr. Zhang.

289
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,760
No, it's all for us.

290
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,000
Who bought it? So generous.

291
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,520
It's ordered by netizens.

292
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,280
Many people watched that show.

293
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,440
Too many.

294
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,080
So I asked my brothers

295
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,520
to send them to you.

296
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,000
This is too embarrassing.

297
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,600
I didn't come to see you

298
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,240
so I didn't come to see you.

299
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,520
He really misses you.

300
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:05,560
Hua Zi, 010.

301
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,320
Thank you for telling Mr. Cheng.

302
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,240
Tell Mr. Cheng for me.

303
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,600
My hand is almost healed.

304
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,000
Come in.

305
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,600
Okay, guys, go upstairs.

306
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,760
Thank you.

307
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,200
We'll go upstairs first.

308
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:17,480
Okay.

309
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,200
Give it to me.

310
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:19,600
Give me this too.

311
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:28,640
Is everyone here?

312
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,560
Come on, everyone is here.

313
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:33,840
I'm leaving. Bye.

314
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,040
Bye. Bye.

315
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,600
Come here.

316
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,080
You just took one more.

317
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,320
Brother Zhang.

318
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,960
You are so stubborn.

319
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,040
change your temper?

320
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,160
What's wrong?

321
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,760
He always goes to the hospital.

322
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,080
and asked the doctor about Zhang Chi's health every day.

323
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,800
You said you care about your son.

324
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,520
you should come and see him.

325
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,760
You made me look at my son secretly.

326
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,680
I'm worried

327
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,480
about your father and son.

328
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,720
How do we solve it in the future?

329
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,319
Take your time.

330
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,440
I'm sorry for

331
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,680
Sorry. It’s my fault.

332
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,720
I didn't take good care of him.

333
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,920
Don't say that. It's not your fault.

334
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,079
I think

335
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,839
is stronger and better than I thought.

336
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,160
Zhigang.

337
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,720
I can rest assured

338
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,520
I can rest assured.

339
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,680
That's all.

340
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,760
Dr. Qi bought this coffee.

341
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,720
This is mine.

342
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,000
Why did you take mine too?

343
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,440
What are you doing? I'm drawing.

344
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,240
No, I didn't throw it away.

345
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,440
I packed it and put it in the study.

346
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,320
Why did you touch my painting?

347
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,840
Do you think you have the right

348
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:02,760
in this room?

349
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,680
No, I have no right to speak.

350
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,760
I just think your black

351
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,320
blocked here.

352
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,680
The last time I see it at night,

353
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,400
I'll have nightmares.

354
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,080
And it's broken.

355
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,560
I don't care. Switch back.

356
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,840
No, don't do this.

357
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,640
Don't deny it now.

358
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,320
You need to get used to it.

359
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,760
If I get used to it,

360
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,520
you'll be glad.

361
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:21,720
right?

362
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,520
Of course.

363
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:49,800
Jisoo.

364
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,080
Jisoo.

365
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,240
Jisoo.

366
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:05,760
Get in.

367
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,280
0106 Train Team.

368
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,440
5-star basketball court, JiangChi Road.

369
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,360
[A man suddenly fainted.]

370
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,480
Please go now.

371
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:14,800
Copy that.

372
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:20,360
Wake up.

373
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,520
Wake up.

374
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:26,840
Excuse me.

375
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,040
Excuse me

376
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,320
Excuse me

377
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,400
How did you faint?

378
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,040
We were playing basketball.

379
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,920
and he fainted.

380
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,120
Did the patient have cardiovascular disease before?

381
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,920
No.

382
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:38,960
He's not sick.

383
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,040
How long have you been lying here?

384
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,040
It's been ten minutes.

385
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,200
There's no ups in his chest.

386
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:44,960
CPR.

387
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,560
Let's open the vein.

388
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,200
Move, everyone.

389
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,600
Do you have a fever recently?

390
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,240
No.

391
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,400
I didn't catch a cold either

392
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,400
No, I didn't.

393
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,200
29 30

394
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,040
Air pressure ventilation.

395
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,400
26 27 28 29 30

396
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:17,760
Give it to me.

397
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,200
Inhale.

398
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,840
Make way please

399
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:23,600
Please make way

400
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,040
Keep the rhythm.

401
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:26,120
Excuse me, everyone. 01045.

402
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:26,840
Excuse me.

403
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,200
Keep the air circulation.

404
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,560
23 24 25 26

405
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,200
27, 28, 29, 30.

406
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,560
The carotid artery is still unstable.

407
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:35,960
Ming

408
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,200
Ming Defibrillator

409
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,120
Hurry up Ming

410
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:41,600
Coming

411
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,040
Get ready for defibrillation.

412
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:54,840
How much energy?

413
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,480
Two hundred two hundred

414
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,200
200

415
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,120
Everyone, leave.

416
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:01,600
Charge. Come on.

417
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,040
Got it?

418
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,680
How is he?

419
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,400
26 27 28 29 30

420
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:15,840
Inhale.

421
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,440
Doctor! Doctor!

422
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,240
Is he okay?

423
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,840
I'm fine. Don't worry.

424
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,640
Get out of the way.

425
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:23,400
He didn't take any medicine before he fainted 0401210

426
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,480
He didn't take any medicine before he fainted.

427
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,600
No, no.

428
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:26,640
Okay.

429
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,360
I didn't eat anything.

430
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,920
29 30, ventilate.

431
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,480
Got it?

432
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,640
Doctor, is he okay?

433
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,360
I'm fine. Don't talk.

434
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,520
I got it.

435
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,320
Ming, Ming, let's go.

436
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,280
Stretcher

437
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,480
Are you okay now?

438
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,760
What are you?

439
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,760
I'm his girlfriend.

440
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,640
Come with us.

441
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,040
Okay.

442
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:49,360
Come on.

443
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,400
Slow down, your neck.

444
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,040
Qiu, pack your things.

445
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:52,360
Okay.

446
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:54,920
Okay?

447
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:55,480
Come on.

448
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,200
One, two, three, go.

449
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,480
Qiu, are you done?

450
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:03,840
Yes.

451
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,240
Let's go.

452
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,600
89/58.

453
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,800
Why did the blood oxygen drop?

454
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,080
It's good to be connected.

455
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:28,920
He's 80, Zhang Chi.

456
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:30,400
What's going on?

457
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,760
He has his breathing mask.

458
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,360
Did he have a respiratory disease before?

459
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,840
No, he has no disease.

460
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,080
He's neither sick nor taken medicine.

461
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,760
He used to exercise a lot. He's healthy.

462
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,360
Still 80 or 80?

463
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,520
Did he eat gum before playing?

464
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:50,840
Gum.

465
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,760
He ate gum.

466
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,080
I think his gum got stuck in the tube.

467
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,360
Go to Seongbuk Hospital.

468
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,080
There is a microbronchoscope in the north of the city.

469
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,240
Ming, Ming, go to the north.

470
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:00,680
Ming

471
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,240
Okay.

472
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:14,760
Thank you.

473
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,000
Thank you.

474
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:22,920
Where's your cup?

475
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,240
It's so bright.

476
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,040
That gum is sticky and small.

477
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,040
It's not easy to find it.

478
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:29,920
How did you think of it?

479
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,640
When you were in school,

480
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,960
when you were in school?

481
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,360
No, I usually play with girls.

482
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,120
I don't look at them.

483
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,920
The campus belle is playing basketball too.

484
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,320
Chewing gum.

485
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,400
It's a great weapon to play basketball.

486
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,320
I saw his friends chewing gum.

487
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,520
It just occurred to me.

488
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,360
You used this sharp weapon a lot when you were young.

489
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:53,760
Take care.

490
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,520
I told you, I...

491
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:59,480
I did that when I was a doctor.

492
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,240
I forgot that you were a piece of wood.

493
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,640
You have a good sense of smell.

494
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,640
You have a good sense of smell.

495
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,040
It's like a police dog.

496
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,120
No, I'm like a detective.

497
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,360
You know what?

498
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,240
I think being an emergency doctor

499
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,080
is like a detective.

500
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,080
Look, there are cases

501
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,600
some cases

502
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:21,080
I can tell right away what the case is like.

503
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:21,920
But some

504
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,800
you have to find a detail and another detail.

505
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,320
and peel the cocoon

506
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,760
to find out the truth.

507
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,600
You sound like a detective.

508
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,360
You act like that in movies too.

509
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,600
When Sherlock Holmes arrived,

510
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,760
Is he asking questions?

511
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,800
As an emergency doctor,

512
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,920
should think like Sherlock Holmes.

513
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,400
Are you Sherlock Holmes?

514
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,240
What am I?

515
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,680
Do you think Hua Sheng is a man?

516
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,640
No, Hua Sheng is a man.

517
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,440
The man is good. The man is perfect for me.

518
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:45,840
It's me.

519
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:49,680
Huasheng.

520
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:58,400
Gao.

521
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,800
Why are you more depressed than me?

522
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,400
What time is it today?

523
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,640
The fourth time.

524
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,120
It's the fourth time.

525
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,720
It's the fifth time.

526
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:08,520
Thank you.

527
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,640
Okay, another trip.

528
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,400
Wang City, Yuan Er, hurry!

529
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:19,800
Victory!

530
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:20,760
Victory!

531
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,280
Okay.

532
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,200
Doctor Zheng.

533
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,920
Your noodles are here.

534
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:30,960
Thank you, Liang.

535
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:31,520
Enjoy

536
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,440
If you need anything,

537
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,200
just tell me.

538
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:33,960
Okay.

539
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:34,520
Thank you.

540
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,320
One iceberg, please. Thank you.

541
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,000
Okay, honey.

542
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,200
Why are you here?

543
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,880
Why am I here? I'm here to see you.

544
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:45,760
How did you know I was here?

545
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,120
I know everything.

546
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,560
How is it going?

547
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,080
I'm going to hand it over in a few days.

548
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,960
It's stuck in the distribution. It's hard to do.

549
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,200
Here's the iceberg you want.

550
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,040
Do you want me to open it for you?

551
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,200
No, thanks.

552
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,280
Thank you.

553
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,720
Let me give you some ideas.

554
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:00,920
Sure.

555
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,720
Here's the thing.

556
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,040
I think the segment

557
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,480
is related to

558
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,960
is actually related to the rest.

559
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,200
We're the first people to contact patients.

560
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,880
So according to my previous experience,

561
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,120
we can divide it according to serious levels.

562
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,720
into five levels.

563
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,280
Five levels.

564
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,600
Which five levels?

565
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,160
First,

566
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,360
My name is Urgent.

567
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,360
He's in danger.

568
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:25,480
ICE.

569
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,160
We need an ambulance right away.

570
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:27,400
ICE.

571
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,680
For example, brain infarction, myocardial infarction,

572
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,480
or sudden death.

573
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,040
The second type is an ordinary emergency patient.

574
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,280
For example,

575
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:39,120
chest pain or brain stroke.

576
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,040
or brain stroke.

577
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,160
and needs to be hospitalized

578
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,720
for the next treatment.

579
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,240
Third,

580
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,560
his vitals are stable.

581
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,920
but they need emergency resources.

582
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,800
For example, pregnant women who are about to give birth.

583
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,720
Fourth, we need to deal with

584
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,280
But it's not urgent.

585
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,360
fractures or setbacks.

586
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,040
Fifth,

587
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,600
We don't need 120 at all.

588
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,960
slight symptoms.

589
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,480
Like cold and fever.

590
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,920
It makes sense.

591
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,560
Let me write it down.

592
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:12,040
In this way, we can divide

593
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,720
from top three to top two.

594
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,600
and then transferred from 2A to the community hospital.

595
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,920
It'll be more convenient.

596
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:17,800
Got it.

597
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,800
Let me see how many you've written.

598
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,480
Is it better to divide them into five levels?

599
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,040
Yes, it's not done yet.

600
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,040
I need to finish it.

601
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,160
It's still early.

602
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:57,960
Qiqi, your dad made your favorite dishes.

603
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,840
Come back and get it after work.

604
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,600
Okay, I'll wait for you.

605
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,320
Here, have some tea.

606
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,240
I just came back from a business trip and didn't go home.

607
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,600
I knew you like it.

608
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:15,800
Really?

609
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,320
My friend from Shunde said

610
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,720
their oysters are the best.

611
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,480
Come and eat when I'm done.

612
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,320
Of course.

613
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:26,840
Dad, mom.

614
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,320
Qi is back.

615
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,200
You’re back.

616
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:31,800
Qu is here.

617
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,240
I’m off work.

618
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,200
I won't change my shoes.

619
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:33,840
I'm leaving.

620
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,440
It'll be ready soon.

621
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,320
Why don't you stay today?

622
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,240
I have an early shift tomorrow. Give it to me.

623
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,720
Hurry up, bring the vegetables here.

624
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,960
I'm really fine. Give it to me.

625
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,680
Can you do it alone? It's late.

626
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,320
Sure.

627
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,200
I'll ask Zhang Chi to pick me up downstairs.

628
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,080
Hurry up. Give it to me.

629
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:53,440
How about this?

630
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,600
It’s late. I’m leaving.

631
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,680
Qi Qi, can you give me a ride?

632
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:57,960
Where are you going?

633
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,440
Are you on your way to No. 5 Hospital of Gao Cheng?

634
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:00,560
Yes.

635
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,440
Okay, I'll take you.

636
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:01,960
Give it to me, mom.

637
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:02,440
That's fine.

638
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,800
Call me when you arrive.

639
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,680
Sleep early.

640
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,600
Take care.

641
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,320
Bye, uncle and auntie.

642
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,320
Come again when you're free.

643
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,160
Okay, bye.

644
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,560
Don't bother.

645
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,600
The taxi I called is here.

646
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,920
I'll walk up later.

647
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:19,960
I don't care.

648
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:20,600
Don't worry.

649
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:23,840
Okay.

650
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:24,360
Bye.

651
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:24,880
I'm leaving.

652
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:33,840
Thank you.

653
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:34,680
Bye.

654
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,320
Zhang Chi.

655
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:38,960
Wait for me.

656
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,040
Why didn't you wait for me? I've been calling you.

657
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,320
I went downstairs to take out the trash.

658
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,840
Why is the wine so bad?

659
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,800
You didn't change your shoes.

660
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,120
You broke the rules.

661
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,360
You've been cleaning for a week.

662
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,480
What? It's weird.

663
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,080
Are you jealous, Zhang Chi?

664
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:11,960
What are you thinking?

665
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,800
Help me feed five brothers.

666
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,680
It doesn't matter. You guys.

667
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,320
I'll mix you up.

668
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:58,840
Huang, Xiao Qiu, get out.

669
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,000
Coming. Let's go.

670
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,240
Good.

671
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,080
Zhang Chi is quite professional now.

672
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,480
He's close to leading his team.

673
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:07,760
Right, Zheng Bo?

674
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,440
What are you doing?

675
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,880
App.

676
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,880
This one called 120, right?

677
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,000
Yes.

678
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:33,880
Sir.

679
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,000
How did you get hurt?

680
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:37,880
I fell.

681
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,960
What happened?

682
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:11,720
No problem.

683
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,520
We need to take a CT scan.

684
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,640
It could be broken.

685
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,880
I think it's broken.

686
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,880
How did you get hurt?

687
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,200
He fainted while doing housework.

688
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,560
and fell on the tea table.

689
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,160
and fell on the tea table.

690
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,880
This bruise is an old injury.

691
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:40,760
What happened?

692
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,520
Why do you care so much?

693
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,080
You're 120.

694
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,400
You're here to save people.

695
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,640
Are you the patient's family?

696
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,080
Calm down.

697
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,320
I need to know

698
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,880
how this patient got hurt.

699
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,320
how he got hurt.

700
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,400
Can you save him?

701
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,160
No. Let's go.

702
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,320
According to the law,

703
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,880
you can't affect our treatment.

704
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,000
Are you breaking the law?

705
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,080
I'm awake.

706
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:09,639
I'm awake.

707
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,639
Hello, lady.

708
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:11,760
Can you hear me?

709
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,280
Are you conscious?

710
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:15,760
Here.

711
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,719
Do you feel any other pain?

712
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,639
Move your arms.

713
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,760
Move your arm

714
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,080
No.

715
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:24,000
Are you injured?

716
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:25,960
Brother, I have a neck here

717
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:26,520
Yang Jing

718
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:28,560
Don't come near me

719
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,199
Don't come near me.

720
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,840
I'm here to check on you.

721
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:34,840
Don't come over.

722
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,080
Watch out!

723
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:39,719
Be careful.

724
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,840
Your wife's injury doesn't look like she fell.

725
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:44,400
Are you domestic violence?

726
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,840
Young man, don't talk nonsense.

727
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:46,520
Who abused you?

728
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,880
Brother, we can call the police.

729
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:51,760
Call the police.

730
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:52,760
Don't call the police.

731
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,760
Don't call the police. It's all my fault.

732
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,199
It's my fault.

733
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,320
Whose fault is this? You can't hit him.

734
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,440
You hit him like this.

735
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,280
Madam, even if it's your problem,

736
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,400
he can't treat you like this.

737
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,080
This is illegal, you know?

738
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,200
010.

739
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,320
Do you have any concerns?

740
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,760
Yang Jing, think about it

741
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,320
You can live in this villa

742
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,680
in this villa as a rich lady.

743
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,680
The child can go to an international school.

744
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,800
because of me.

745
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,280
Jiang Dong, if you call the police today,

746
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:31,920
you will destroy me.

747
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,640
and this family.

748
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:35,920
Do you think it's worth it?

749
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,760
No, I won't call the police.

750
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,320
You go. You go.

751
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:42,080
010

752
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,360
Go.

753
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,120
Did you hear that?

754
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,920
My wife wants you to go.

755
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,080
Ma'am.

756
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:57,440
There are only zero times and countless times of domestic violence.

757
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,120
If you forgive him this time,

758
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,840
there will be a next time.

759
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,240
I just heard that

760
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:04,960
you have children.

761
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,720
Parents are the best teachers for children.

762
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,600
and role model.

763
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,040
If his father treats you like this,

764
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,040
he'll make him

765
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:16,160
into a violent personality.

766
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,000
Is that what you want to see?

767
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:00,680
Ma'am.

768
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,320
I know it's hard for you to do this,

769
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:04,800
But you have to understand

770
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,200
this is all for you and your son.

771
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,040
for you and your son.

772
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,120
You need to go to the hospital for a check-up.

773
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:10,680
Let's go.

774
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:20,840
Here.

775
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:23,600
Huang, get in.

776
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:24,040
Okay.

777
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,040
Zheng Bo.

778
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,240
Wait.

779
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,160
What's wrong, Snow?

780
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,080
Wait.

781
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,480
I need to talk to you.

782
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,720
Me too.

783
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,240
No.

784
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,400
Let's go. I'll take you somewhere.

785
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,280
Where?

786
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:46,920
Snow.

787
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,800
Follow the car in front for me.

788
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:17,560
Okay.

789
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,520
Sister Chen, where are you taking me?

790
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,400
Leave me alone.

791
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:28,280
We're here.

792
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,120
Where is this?

793
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:38,760
Jiang AF21433.

794
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:39,520
Jiang AF21433.

795
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,080
Zheng Bo.

796
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:42,320
We're here.

797
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,240
Sister Chen, what is this place?

798
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,240
Let's go upstairs and you'll know.

799
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:47,920
No, this...

800
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:49,560
It's okay.

801
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,960
Zheng Bo, come with me.

802
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:14,480
Take a look.

803
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,200
Since you treat me as your sister,

804
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,440
I'll give you a big gift today.

805
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:19,880
Isn't this place nice?

806
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:22,360
And there are five bus routes

807
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,840
there are five bus routes.

808
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,560
It's very convenient.

809
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,800
I'll buy some

810
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,760
some office supplies.

811
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,760
will soon become

812
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,280
a great start-up company.

813
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:36,360
Ms. Chen, this is a big gift.

814
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:37,960
I can't accept it.

815
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,720
Don't be shy.

816
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,160
I have to support you.

817
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,080
This is

818
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,400
is my uncle's office.

819
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,520
I can provide you for free.

820
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,560
You can register the company first.

821
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:48,360
My uncle will invest in the first round.

822
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,080
You don't need to worry about the follow-up financing.

823
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,200
Do your best.

824
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,160
Prove it to my uncle.

825
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,240
I'm right.

826
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,000
Thank you, Snow.

827
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,680
Thank you for your uncle's kindness.

828
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:58,680
Thank you.

829
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,400
But I really can't accept

830
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:02,960
such a good thing.

831
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,520
such a good thing?

832
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,840
I’ll think of other ways.

833
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:11,080
Zheng Bo, it's hard for you to start a business alone.

834
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,200
Not to mention how busy you are at work.

835
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,440
It's just a little break time.

836
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:16,320
to start a business.

837
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,800
How long are you going to do it?

838
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,640
Besides, when you start a company,

839
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:20,720
you have to hire an employee.

840
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,680
You have to pay.

841
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:22,680
Where did you get the money?

842
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:28,920
Are you afraid of losing face?

843
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,240
Don't worry.

844
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,560
I won't tell anyone.

845
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,520
Don't worry about this place.

846
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:35,200
Take the money.

847
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,360
Zheng Bo.

848
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,960
This reality is not as easy as you think.

849
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:43,840
Ms. Chen,

850
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,800
First, I'm very grateful for your kindness.

851
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,400
Secondly, I can't accept it.

852
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,960
Of course I know how hard it is.

853
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:57,520
If I accept your investment now,

854
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,240
and such a big venue,

855
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,240
I will increase the success rate

856
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,440
and reduce the development cost.

857
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:03,520
But I am

858
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:05,000
Yi Kang app. initiator.

859
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:08,040
The purpose of this project is to save people.

860
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:10,480
It's not to prove anything to anyone.

861
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,520
And if I do that,

862
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,080
I'll look down on myself.

863
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:18,840
I still hope I can

864
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,080
and take every step.

865
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:24,840
You will understand me, right?

866
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:28,640
Zheng Bo.

867
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,680
After listening to you,

868
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,760
I understand what you want.

869
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:37,840
As your sister,

870
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,520
I hope you can succeed.

871
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,840
If you have any difficulties

872
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:42,880
in the future,

873
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:44,320
you can come to me anytime.

874
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,720
Don't feel burdened.

875
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:48,360
I support you. Come on.

876
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:50,920
Thank you.

877
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,000
Ms. Chen, thank you.

878
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:25,480
Why are you here?

879
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:26,600
Why am I here?

880
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:27,600
I can't come.

881
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,720
I came to you as soon as I got off the plane.

882
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,840
I didn't expect you to get on Snow's car.

883
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,520
I want to know more about it.

884
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:39,120
You heard it?

885
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,040
I did.

886
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,280
I was right about you.

887
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:45,600
But Snow really treats you as her family.

888
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,000
That's why she arranged these for you.

889
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,840
Stop being sarcastic.

890
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,840
I'm full of lawsuits now.

891
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:52,360
Here.

892
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:53,600
Leave me alone.

893
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,240
I have something to tell you. Let's go.

894
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:57,840
Why are you pulling me again?

895
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:58,720
