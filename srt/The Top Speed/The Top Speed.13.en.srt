Ming, hold on.

108
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,760

We know the situation.

118
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:35,880
Ask your family

119
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,640
to register and get the procedure done.

120
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,920
We'll treat him first.

121
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,080
No problem. This is for you.

122
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,280
Okay, this is for you.

123
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:42,880
This one, right?

Sister.

125
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,480
What about you?

126
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,320
She just turned around.

127
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,600
Why is he gone?

128
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,440
Did she go to the toilet?

129
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,200
Okay, I'll look for her.

130
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:51,800
Please.

131
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,600
Hurry up and hand it in.

132
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,320
Where are you going?

133
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:54,760
Okay.

134
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,600
Look over there.

135
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,200
Xiaobo.

136
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,560
Buy me a ticket

137
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,320
to my hometown.

138
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:00,920
What's wrong?

139
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,560
Stop asking.

140
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,080
I'm going back to my hometown now.

141
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,000
Okay, I'll show you now.

142
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,640
Qiu.

143
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,040
Zhang Chi.

144
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,080
Did you see the lady with the car?

145
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,720
No. Didn't she go in with you?

146
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,480
I couldn't find him. He was there for a long time.

147
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,920
Did you find him?

148
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,800
No.

149
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:37,720
No.

150
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,159
He's not here.

151
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,040
What's going on? Where did he go?

152
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,040
She didn't go this way?

153
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,920
Is she afraid that the money will run away?

154
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,600
No way.

155
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,560
Didn't she just say she's responsible?

156
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,640
I'll register first.

157
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,600
Don't delay Uncle Sun's treatment.

158
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,000
Call the police station

159
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,080
and ask them to find someone.

160
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:53,920
Okay.

161
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,280

162
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,280

163
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,040
Hello.

166
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,360
Yes, I am.

167
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,600
Tian Limei is your aunt, right?

168
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,640
We received a report

169
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,760
She ran away.

170
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,200
Please come to the North Hospital.

171
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,200
Okay, I'll be right there.

172
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,760
Ren Jie, I need to go out for something

173
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,600
If you have any mission to leave,

174
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,720
call for emergency backup.

175
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,600
Okay, got it.

176
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,280
Mr. Lu, something happened to my family.

177
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,480
Apply for emergency deployment.

178
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,280
Please approve.

179
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,800
Can you run away from such a big thing?

180
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,560
The society is under the law now.

181
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,800
There are so many Heavenly Eye.

182
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,000
Where can you go?

183
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,200
You're right.

184
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,760
You knocked me into the hospital,

185
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,440
and lied.

186
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,040
You talked well on the way.

187
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,000
You're responsible for the fare and medical expenses.

188
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,040
And then?

189
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,200
He ran away when he arrived.

190
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,360
What do you mean?

191
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,800
I'm just a part-timer.

192
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,800
I don't know how much it costs to see a doctor.

193
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,320
Besides, you're old.

194
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:20,560
What if...

195
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,200
If it's all on me,

196
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,640
who can afford it?

197
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,720
You're talking too much.

198
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,280
You mean

199
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,720
you're afraid I'll extort you?

200
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,440
Who do you think I am?

201
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:30,760
It's not me.

202
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,600
Okay, what did I tell you in the car?

203
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,880
I've taught you for nothing.

204
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,880
Look at your attitude.

205
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,920
Yes, it's our negligence in management.

206
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:37,800
Look.

207
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,320
I'm sorry

208
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,280
I'm really sorry.

209
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,160
When I heard about this,

210
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,480
I immediately brought her to apologize to you.

211
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,320
Really?

212
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,360
We'll pay for all the medical expenses.

213
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,000
Green Plateau.

214
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,440
I'm sorry.

215
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,080
Aunt Lian.

216
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,720
[Chain Supermarket]

217
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,000
Xiaobo.

218
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,640
This is your aunt.

219
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,760
Is she really your aunt?

220
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,760
Your aunt?

221
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,640
hit Jiaqi's uncle

222
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,440
at the supermarket.

223
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,760
He was sent to the hospital after the accident.

224
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,240
He ran away when he paid.

225
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,440
Uncle, what's the matter after the checkup?

226
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,680
Nothing serious.

227
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,120
He just ran away.

228
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,880
Uncle,

229
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:14,000
I'll pay for the rest, okay?

230
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,200
Don't worry about it.

231
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,000
I'm sorry.

232
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,520
What are you paying for?

233
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,240
Aunt, stop it.

234
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:22,760
Jiangdong emergency.

235
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,080
I'm sorry, uncle.

236
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,400
I've paid for the rest.

237
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,400
Don't worry.

238
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,080
Qiqi, thank you.

239
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,760
After I finish this bottle,

240
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,960
after I finish this bottle.

241
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,080
I'll go back by myself later.

242
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,640
Go back to work.

243
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,880
No, I'm not going back to the center.

244
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,560
Go ahead. I'll play with you.

245
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,760
Jiaqi can't take leave.

246
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:55,760
Besides,

247
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,880
the doctor said

248
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,440
you should be hospitalized for observation.

249
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,320
I've been a doctor for so many years.

250
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,320
how can I not know my health?

251
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,080
Speaking of this,

252
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,080
you should call me senior.

253
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:08,960
Of course.

254
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,120
You're a founder. Of course.

255
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,960
You have to listen to the doctor, right?

256
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,000
If I don't leave the hospital,

257
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,640
who will cook for Jia Qi?

258
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,440
Thank you

259
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,560
all the way here.

260
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,200
Otherwise, I wouldn't have recovered so fast.

261
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,120
Thank you.

262
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,320
for saving my life.

263
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,200
You're too courteous.

264
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,240
I forgot to ask Dr Zhang for his number.

265
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,080
Do you have his number?

266
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:34,840
Yes, send it to me.

267
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,240
This kid is nice.

268
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:45,440
In order not to let me lie down,

269
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,240
he kept holding on behind me.

270
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,080
for so long.

271
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,640
I've been exhausted in the hospital.

272
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,520
He's so devoted to me.

273
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,680
I have to thank him in person.

274
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,240
I sent it to you.

275
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:57,760
Okay.

276
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,080
If he knows you praised him like this,

277
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,200
he would be so happy

278
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,240
I've forgotten about it.

279
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,840
This kid is really nice.

280
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,200
He's handsome

281
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,000
And he's nice.

282
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,200
He's not married yet, right?

283
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,880
No.

284
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,000
You know that.

285
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,120
Five ice peaks.

286
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,400
Thank you.

287
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,440
It's not cold.

288
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,080
Liang, make something cold.

289
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,080
Liang is not cold.

290
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,560
Dong Xiaoqiu.

291
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,160
08401.

292
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,080
To be honest,

293
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,440
Is this restaurant owned by your family?

294
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,080
Why?

295
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,080
Yeah why

296
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,760
Aren't the photos here

297
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,200
Yes, the hairstyle is the same.

298
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,000
Is it similar

299
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,000
Exactly the same.

300
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,320
Is my face that round?

301
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,960
Yes, exactly the same.

302
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,560
No wonder we eat noodles every day.

303
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,560
I have a sunflower face.

304
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,440
Who are you?

305
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,000
I have a sunflower face.

306
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,080
How much do you earn from us?

307
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,200
It's all my hard-earned money.

308
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,960
No, the boss's surname is Liang.

309
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:00,680
Her surname is Dong.

310
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,200
Yes.

311
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,200
Dong Xiao Qiu, what's your surname?

312
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,240
My surname is Dong.

313
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,400
Dong Xiaoqiu is not Liang.

314
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,200
What's wrong?

315
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,560
Your uncle gave me

316
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,760
to the resort.

317
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,680
Dr Zhang, go play with your friends.

318
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,520
I'll give you a ticket to the resort.

319
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,760
My old friend gave it to me.

320
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,840
I'm still recuperating. I can't go.

321
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,000
I'm here to show my gratitude.

322
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:25,920
to show my sincerity.

323
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,640
Who has been to this place?

324
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,560
Resort?

325
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,200
You have a ticket?

326
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,400
Let me see.

327
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:33,880
This place is fun.

328
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,560
I'll go.

329
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,000
Go ahead.

330
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,320
You only have one ticket?

331
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:38,800
You're not going?

332
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,080
If you don't go to 01,

333
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:39,240
084001.

334
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,000
I'll buy tickets if I want to go.

335
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,560
I'll go. Go ahead.

336
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,200
Give it to me. I'll go.

337
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,240
I'll go.

338
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,760
I'll send you the ticket.

339
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:54,760
Really?

340
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,000
Why don't you go in?

341
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,880
What are you doing?

342
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,560
Oh my god.

343
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,440
Senior.

344
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,520
Jiaqi.

345
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,000
How are we going to spend the holidays?

346
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,640
The beautiful resort is waiting for us.

347
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,200
Here.

348
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:34,760
Zhang Chi sent it to me.

349
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,800
It seems to be here too.

350
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,640
You don't have to look.

351
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,640
My uncle gave it to him.

352
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,120
Uncle Sun is good.

353
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,160
You're right.

354
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,200
But I seriously suspect

355
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,960
Comrade Sun is randomly deciding the matchmaker.

356
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,080
I read it online.

357
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,200
This ticket is quite expensive.

358
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,320
What does he mean by giving me three tickets?

359
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,560
You think too much.

360
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,880
I just want to thank Zhang Chi.

361
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,400
By the way,

362
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,200
to make you and your friends happy.

363
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,000
Like me.

364
00:14:59,200 --> 00:14:59,760
You're back.

365
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,000
That place looks great.

366
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,320
We can soak in hot spring and do spa.

367
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,320
and garden restaurant.

368
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,200
Can you record a camping video with me?

369
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:08,800
Food.

370
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,200
Okay, I'll record it for you.

371
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,440
I have two tickets.

372
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,120
I'll ask Zheng Bo.

373
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:12,480
Okay.

374
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,000
Take me with you.

375
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,560
Why are you everywhere?

376
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,000
Of course I'm here.

377
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,960
I'm good at carrying bags and delivering water and taking out trash.

378
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,120
It's not a loss to be a shareholder.

379
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,640
Do you think I can't see that?

380
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,560
If I let you go,

381
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,320
if I let you go?

382
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:28,880
Zheng Bo is yours.

383
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,960
I’ll take care of the rest.

384
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,760
You're a crazy person.

385
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,560
Playing is playing.

386
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,280
Deal.

387
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,640
Oh, no.

388
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,200
It's hot, right?

389
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,440
Here, blow on the fan.

390
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,000
Why are you giving me flowers? I want wind.

391
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,080
How is it? Look at me.

392
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,080
So beautiful.

393
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,080
Is it pretty? Yes.

394
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,560
Yes. So beautiful.

395
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:06,880
Is it hot?

396
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,240
It's too hot over there.

397
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,240
Let me blow on it.

398
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,120
No makeup

399
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,200
No, I just put on makeup.

400
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,880
What cosmetics are you talking about?

401
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,120
It's too hot.

402
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,520
You have three tickets, right?

403
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,080
Zhang Chi, give me one.

404
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,240
We have four tickets in total.

405
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,320
Then who bought this one?

406
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,120
I didn't buy it.

407
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,200
He gave it to me.

408
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,880
Zheng Bo asked me to come with him.

409
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,760
Aren't you not interested?

410
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,200
Okay, you've improved. You're quite compatible.

411
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,560
Okay, are you ready? Let's go.

412
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:34,640
Almost.

413
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,120
You...

414
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,440
Yes, I'm ready.

415
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,960
You asked us to work for you.

416
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:38,960
Of course.

417
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,200
Zheng Bo is a photographer I trained.

418
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,680
I’ll make good use of him.

419
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,120
As for you,

420
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,320
I'll give you a ticket.

421
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,680
You have to take it no matter what.

422
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:48,640
No.

423
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,320
I'm not here to help you.

424
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,560
You can talk over there.

425
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,120
It's not a whisper when you grit your teeth.

426
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,320
What are you talking about? Nothing.

427
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,440
Let's go.

428
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,200
Go ahead.

429
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:58,880
No.

430
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,560
I don't want to take photos.

431
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,520
I'm afraid of this.

432
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,560
I don't want to. You guys go.

433
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,880
What's there to be afraid of?

434
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,200
Why are you afraid of a camera?

435
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:05,960
I don't like taking photos.

436
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,200
I'm looking at something. Go.

437
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,000
Let's go.

438
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:08,800
Go, master.

439
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,560
Well,

440
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,119
Ask Zheng Bo to take photos for Jia Qi.

441
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:11,960
I'll take a photo for you.

442
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:12,760
I'll take a photo of you.

443
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,000
Hurry up.

444
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:14,560
Are you really not filming?

445
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,319
Hurry up.

446
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,119
Let's go.

447
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,560
Since you're here, you've got the ticket.

448
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,119
Work hard.

449
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:18,760
Let's take a photo.

450
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:19,440
Hurry up.

451
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,079
Are you really not going?

452
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:22,640
I'm not going. Hurry up.

453
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,760
You don't get along.

454
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:30,120
Xu Chengyuan is like a fool.

455
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,080
You're almost here.

456
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,000
Here you are.

457
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,200
Why do I think Xu Chengyuan

458
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,560
is very professional?

459
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,880
Yuan, you're perfect for this reflector.

460
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,080
Let me try the light first.

461
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,880
Right? Try it.

462
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,920
Beautiful. What do you think? Okay.

463
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:46,960
Wait

464
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,400
Chi, Qi,

465
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,120
You're kind of in the picture.

466
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,200
Can you move to the right a little?

467
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,200
Which side?

468
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,240
Right hand.

469
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,440
Isn't this supposed to be moved by you?

470
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,120
You're old.

471
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,680
Okay, thank you.

472
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,560
Stay away.

473
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:03,640
Don't move.

474
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,000
What is it?

475
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,440
Why are you always looking for something on my head?

476
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,280
It's been several times.

477
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,440
There's something on your hair.

478
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,920
What do you mean?

479
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,040
You keep peeling and pulling my hair.

480
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,800
You sound like a gorilla.

481
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,440
Stop talking.

482
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,800
Sister Qi, Chi, it's still on the screen.

483
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,160
Why don't you move a little to the right?

484
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,000
Sorry.

485
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:22,880
We're not here.

486
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,160
We're almost there.

487
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,400
We'll get you some water.

488
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,880
I want ice cream.

489
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,760
I want ice water, master.

490
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,200
Just wait.

491
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,440
Watch out.

492
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,000
OK.

493
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:33,800
This way, Zhang Chi.

494
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:34,520
Come on.

495
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:35,880
Come on

496
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,640
I can't catch up with the light.

497
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,520
Run

498
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,040
Why haven't we arrived yet?

499
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,560
You have to pass this door and turn left.

500
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,280
to get there.

501
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,760
How do you know? Have you been here?

502
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:49,760
No.

503
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,640
I looked at the map when I entered.

504
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,280
Remember.

505
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,520
What's that look?

506
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,760
You don't like it

507
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,760
I found there was nothing fun here.

508
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:03,160
Besides taking photos, we'll go to the hot spring.

509
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,320
Nothing to play.

510
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,520
I have a high-end exciting game here.

511
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,760
I can't play it alone. Only two of us. Do you want to play?

512
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,800
My legs suddenly hurt.

513
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,760
Why don't you buy the water yourself?

514
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,440
I'll save you if you do this.

515
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,160
It's fun. It's simple.

516
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,680
Rock, paper, scissors.

517
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,040
I see Look

518
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,120
This is a rock

519
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,040
This is paper

520
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,040
This is scissors.

521
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,280
If I win, take ten steps.

522
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,040
If you win, take five steps.

523
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,160
If you win, take two steps.

524
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,160
Whoever arrives first will pay.

525
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,680
The loser buys drinks.

526
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:34,680
Get ready.

527
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:35,680
Ready

528
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,760
Rock, paper, scissors.

529
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,640
One, two.

530
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,880
Come on. Rock, paper, scissors.

531
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:43,320
Great.

532
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,920
One, two, three, four, five.

533
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,520
Come on.

534
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,040
You have to put it down.

535
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,160
Rock, paper, scissors.

536
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,400
Rock, paper, scissors.

537
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,040
One, two, three, four, five.

538
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,920
Bye.

539
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,000
Bye.

540
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,640
You can't see my feet, can you?

541
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,200
How about we use our hands?

542
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:08,920
Like this.

543
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,400
This is paper.

544
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,760
This is rock

545
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,000
This is scissors.

546
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:14,800
OK?

547
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,520
Zhang Chi, I don't want to play anymore.

548
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,040
Go ahead. I'm leaving.

549
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,520
No.

550
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,760
I'll let you win two rounds.

551
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:29,760
Qi Tuo

552
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,800
This game is really interesting.

553
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,440
Why haven't we arrived at the store yet?

554
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,120
You remember, right?

555
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:35,880
Over there.

556
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,400
The store saw you.

557
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,800
Where does it hurt?

558
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,920
So what?

559
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,280
Honey.

560
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,680
What happened?

561
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:44,680
Honey.

562
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,280
What's wrong?

563
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,040
What's wrong?

564
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,920
We're the ER at 120.

565
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,560
What's wrong with him?

566
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,880
His chest hurts.

567
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,120
Here, right?

568
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,280
How does it hurt?

569
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,760
Does it hurt outside or inside?

570
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,920
Inside, inside, right?

571
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,280
Did you feel stuffy

572
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,760
Did you feel chest tightness

573
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,400
Yes.

574
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,400
A little bit, right?

575
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,520
Is your pain

576
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,800
right here?

577
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,280
Does it hurt here? Yes.

578
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,040
Does it hurt here?

579
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,320
He has angina.

580
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,120
Did he have cardiovascular vascular disease before?

581
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:08,760
No.

582
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,280
No right

583
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,520
How long have you been swimming

584
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,400
For an hour

585
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,400
He said he was exercising.

586
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,520
The oxygen consumption is too high.

587
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,160
so that his heart can't bear too much.

588
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,040
Do you have the medicine?

589
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,160
Effective heart-saving pills or ginseng drops pills.

590
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,920
No, I didn't bring any medicine.

591
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,400
Get a stretcher.

592
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,440
Don't touch him. I know.

593
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,440
You stay here and watch me find a stretcher.

594
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,120
Go.

595
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,160
Thank you.

596
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,560
We can't touch him.

597
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:27,800
Hold on.

598
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,400
I have angina. It's okay.

599
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,280
Zhang Chi, hurry up.

600
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:32,880
Honey.

601
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I've bandaged it. Don't get wet.

602
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,280
We're here.

603
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,640
This is the patient with angina.

604
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,280
Yes.

605
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,520
Okay, the medicine is ready.

606
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,520
Come on

607
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,040
Put it on the bed

608
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,200
Put it on the bed. Be careful.

609
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:47,640
Here.

610
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,400
Slowly.

611
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,680
Slowly.

612
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,040
Slowly.

613
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,680
It's okay. Come on.

614
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,040
Yes, move it.

615
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,160
Put your head straight.

616
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,880
Take the stretcher away.

617
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,000
Thank you.

618
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,560
Feed him the medicine.

619
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,520
Okay. Here.

620
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,440
We're leaving.

621
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,400
Okay.

622
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,280
Thank you.

623
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,520
Why did you jump the queue?

624
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,680
We've been queuing for a long time.

625
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,400
My stomach is aching.

626
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,120
He hit his head.

627
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,920
Can we have a look first?

628
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,000
This patient is too dangerous.

629
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,640
Hang in there.

630
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:18,880
I'll be right there.

631
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,640
How long do we have to wait?

632
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,320
Yeah, if it weren't for the hospital,

633
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,800
we wouldn't have come here.

634
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,880
Are you alone in the infirmary?

635
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:26,800
Yes.

636
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,120
We're the ambulance.

637
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:30,600
We'll help you.

638
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,360
What ID do you need?

639
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,280
we can provide it to you.

640
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,080
I'll just help you.

641
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,120
Thank you so much.

642
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,040
Thank you.

643
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,600
Let the kid take a look.

644
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,240
Come on.

645
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,160
Did you hurt your head?

646
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,520
Let me see.

647
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,360
Did you hit your head?

648
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,880
Is there any other pain?

649
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,520
How did you fall just now?

650
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,400
Who has a stomachache?

651
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,400
You have a stomachache, right? Which part?

652
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,520
Here?

653
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,480
Have you had breakfast?

654
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,160
No.

655
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,360
Wait a minute.

656
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,640
I'll get you some warm water.

657
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,000
You're so brave.

658
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,760
Nice. Good.

659
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,400
Okay. Okay.

660
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,920
Nice.

661
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,160
I'll give you a close-up.

662
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,000
Come on. Three, two, one. Go.

663
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,480
Okay, don't move. Come on.

664
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,240
Beautiful.

665
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,000
Good.

666
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,280
Okay.

667
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,400
Okay.

668
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,000
Cover the flowers on your face.

669
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:35,600
Okay.

670
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,040
The light is so nice now.

671
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,640
Okay.

672
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,680
You're a good photographer.

673
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:45,520
So beautiful.

674
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,360
Add more flour.

675
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:49,640
Okay.

676
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,400
It's really pretty.

677
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,400
Are you tired? Do you want some water?

678
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,400
Give it to me. Thank you.

679
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:57,520
Let me twist it for you.

680
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,680
Okay, it's okay.

681
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,040
I'll call them.

682
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,520
Why did my master

683
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,520
buy water for so long?

684
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,520
He hasn't come back yet.

685
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,400
He's not picking up his phone.

686
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,880
Probably not.

687
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,640
Where can they go?

688
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,160
We still have a group of videos. Let's finish it.

689
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:15,520
Yes.

690
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,000
I'll call her later.

691
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,880
Why are you so slow-witted?

692
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:20,880
Hurry up.

693
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,280
Okay, remember to treat us tonight.

694
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:22,880
No problem.

695
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,160
Come on.

696
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,240
I'll walk over from that distance.

697
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,600
Then walk over and take some pictures for me.

698
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,040
No problem.

699
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:28,920
Movement video

700
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,880
Should I follow him?

701
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,480
You don't have to follow me.

702
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,240
Wait for me here.

703
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:35,800
Are you done?

704
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:36,680
No problem.

705
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,480
One, two, three.

706
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,360
So beautiful.

707
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,920
Yes, very beautiful.

708
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,400
No, this has nothing to do with the board.

709
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,400
It doesn't matter.

710
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,280
Hold it properly.

711
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:12,280
OK. Hold it. Is this OK?

712
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,680
I hit it.

713
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,800
Hurry up. This is pretty.

714
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,400
Three, two, one. Okay.

715
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:17,920
OK.

716
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,600
Great. So beautiful.

717
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,280
The two doctors

718
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,040
can be treated.

719
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,160
Don't worry.

720
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,760
It's normal to have diarrhea in summer.

721
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,880
Don't eat cold food.

722
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,360
Doctor, my hand is cut.

723
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:33,920
Take a seat.

724
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,480
I want to stay here for a few days.

725
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,880
Can I add you on WeChat?

726
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,880
If you don't feel well,

727
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,520
can I ask you on WeChat?

728
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,880
Zhang Chi, I'll take this.

729
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,120
You can add that doctor.

730
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,400
That doctor is a doctor here.

731
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,160
We're not here.

732
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,040
We're leaving soon.

733
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,000
I didn't ask you.

734
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,640
Yes, we're leaving today.

735
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,760
Add him on WeChat.

736
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,120
It's okay. You would have come sooner.

737
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,760
Don't get wet and go back.

738
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,600
Doctor, are you free tonight?

739
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,760
I want to treat you to a meal.

740
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,400
Dr. Qi, hurry up.

741
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,880
Many people are queuing up.

742
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,040
How fast should I be?

743
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,480
His wound is not serious.

744
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,480
Just disinfect it.

745
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,800
What bag?

746
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,400
Who said it's not serious? You didn't see it.

747
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,520
It's too deep.

748
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,280
Cover it if you wrap it.

749
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:15,880
It's not ventilating.

750
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,400
I'll wrap it for you. Don't worry.

751
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,240
Look at you.

752
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,640
It's not easy to recover.

753
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,520
My stomach really hurts.

754
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,040
Did you have diarrhea?

755
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:24,640
Yes.

756
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,520
How many times?

757
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,880
Three or four times

758
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,120
It hurts

759
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:30,640
It hurts.

760
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:31,880
Okay, don't get wet.

761
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:32,640
Thank you, doctor.

762
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,280
Take care.

763
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,160
Okay.

764
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:35,640
Okay.

765
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:36,600
Next.

766
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,520
Go find him.

767
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,880
Ask the doctor to get some alvein.

768
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:40,360
Here.

769
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,520
Don't eat cold food today.

770
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,880
Take the medicine for three days in a row.

771
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,600
Okay, thank you, doctor.

772
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,000
It's okay. Bye.

773
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,160
I'm done.

774
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,520
Thank you so much today.

775
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,760
If it weren't for you two,

776
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,160
I wouldn't have been able to take care of so many people.

777
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,880
It's okay. We all saw that you're here.

778
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:01,800
Okay, we're leaving.

779
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,160
Bye.

780
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,000
Wait a minute

781
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,520
You haven't eaten anything since you were busy.

782
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,400
I have some local specialties.

783
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,480
Here, take it for your stomach.

784
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:08,880
No need

785
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,600
You're welcome.

786
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,160
It's a small specialty. Take it.

787
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,520
Just a little token of appreciation.

788
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,360
Thank you.

789
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,240
I'm leaving. Bye.

790
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,160
Okay, bye.

791
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,480
You're tired.

792
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,160
Take a break Sit here

793
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,680
Come on sit down

794
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,280
It's like a car of ten cars and eight cars

795
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:37,920
So tired?

796
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,880
I think I saved a lot of people today.

797
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,400
It's just ten cars and eight cars.

798
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,160
Have some of this.

799
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,240
What is this?

800
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,120
You eat first.

801
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:52,920
Try if it's poisonous.

802
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,120
Are you the Empress Dowager?

803
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,520
Then you are a eunuch.

804
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,040
Why am I a eunuch?

805
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:00,160
Why can't I be an imperial guard?

806
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,360
Why are you so anxious?

807
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:03,600
Too...

808
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,200
Chi.

809
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,120
Qi Qi

810
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,640
Senior.

811
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,720
Where is she?

812
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,400
I can't find him.

813
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,240
Both of them aren't picking up.

814
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,040
Did they leave already?

815
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,360
Impossible.

816
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,360
Chi.

817
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,800
Let's go over there.

818
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:25,480
Okay.

819
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,120
Qiqi.

820
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,280
Chi.

821
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,640
Sister Qi

822
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,000
It's delicious.

823
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,480
There are too many people.

824
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,880
There are also many important things.

825
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,040
There are a lot of people asking for phone calls for someone

826
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,400
Isn't that man a bit too much?

827
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,120
I mean that woman.

828
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,000
That man.

829
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:42,880
Think about it.

830
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,760
When we first met in public,

831
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,880
We treat him.

832
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,000
He's just a patient.

833
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,760
He asked you for WeChat.

834
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,240
Isn't that too casual?

835
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,800
Why are you arresting him?

836
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,000
to the police.

837
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,160
You've known each other

838
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,040
like us.

839
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,000
Let me add you on WeChat.

840
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,880
It’s natural.

841
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,920
If I didn't stop you, I would've called.

842
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,280
Why should I?

843
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,000
That woman

844
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,160
Isn't she the same as that man?

845
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,640
It looks like you're giving it to me.

846
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,400
I didn't give it to you.

847
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,480
Senior, what's wrong with you two?

848
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,480
Just...

849
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,600
He called us, right?

850
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,880
He didn't answer the phone.

851
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,000
We're going through a lot.

852
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,360
I thought you were kidnapped. I almost called the police.

853
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,480
Where did you go?

854
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,520
Don't mention it.

855
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,000
Didn't we buy water for you?

856
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,400
There was someone in the swimming pool.

857
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,280
What happened to him? He had a heatstroke.

858
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,000
Heart problem.

859
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,160
Heart problem, angina

860
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,280
So we sent him to the infirmary.

861
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,240
There were people in the infirmary.

862
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,520
The line is so long.

863
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,400
Just a doctor.

864
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,800
Let's stay there for a while. Do me a favor.

865
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,760
Helping others

866
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,520
So I've been helping you all this time.

867
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,520
I can't believe you two.

868
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,680
A good holiday becomes a working day.

869
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:45,760
It's my occupational disease.

870
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,160
It's normal to save a patient.

871
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:48,840
Scary.

872
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,120
Everyone is here.

873
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:50,520
What?

874
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,240
Let me teach you

875
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,520
a very exciting game.

876
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,160
Zhang Chi.

877
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,480
What game?

878
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:56,680
How dare you!

879
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,880
We can only play together, right?

880
00:29:59,040 --> 00:29:59,880
What?

881
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,760
What game can only be played by two people?

882
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,600
You're so annoying.

883
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,240
Master.

884
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,760
Don't go.

885
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,400
What game?

886
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,880
Don't run!

887
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,160
Morning.

888
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,120
You scared me. Why are you squatting here?

889
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,920
I'm tying my shoelaces.

890
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:36,880
Why are you sitting here?

891
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:37,640
Why are you sitting here?

892
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,000
I moved here.

893
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:40,920
I told Mr. Lu.

894
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,400
I applied to move in.

895
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,240
Why?

896
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,640
It's close to the door.

897
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:51,160
Can I take the walkie-talkie and the recorder?

898
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:54,000
Where can you go with just two steps?

899
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,000
At least two seconds.

900
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,880
What if the person we want to save is only two seconds away?

901
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,520
Okay.

902
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,160
Fight for every second.

903
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:05,920
01004.

904
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,480
Let's go.

905
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,840
I think I saw my mom.

906
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:29,800
Where?

907
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:31,800
Take this car away.

908
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,680
Why did she come to the hospital?

909
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:35,440
I don't know.

910
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,480
Did anything happen

911
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,480
Will something happen to her?

912
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,960
You can't act like that in dramas.

913
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,080
Just hide your condition

914
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,280
and come alone.

915
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,520
Don't talk nonsense.

916
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,400
Call and ask.

917
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,560
Hello, Mom.

918
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,480
I saw you at the hospital. It's you, right?

919
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:52,520
It's me.

920
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,760
I'll prescribe some vitamins.

921
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,080
Are you okay?

922
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,160
I'm fine.

923
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,680
Okay, I'm hanging up.

924
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,520
Okay.

925
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:04,640
Are you okay?

926
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,480
I'm fine. I'm here to buy some vitamins.

927
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,920
My mom doesn't eat vitamins.

928
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,720
Get in the car. We'll talk later.

929
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,560
Let's go.

930
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,440
Do you think something really happened to Sister Qi's house?

931
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:30,840
If you keep talking nonsense,

932
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:33,240
I'll sew your mouth with Sister Qi's needle.

933
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:40,520
Qi Tuo.

934
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,280
Why don't you go back first?

935
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,400
I'll take over the shift with Chen Xue.

936
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,560
No, wait for her.

937
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:49,640
Hello?

938
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:50,400
Hello.

939
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,560
Your package has been delivered for over 24 hours.

940
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,240
Hurry up.

941
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:53,800
Just put the package in the delivery cabinet.

942
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:54,560
Thank you.

943
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:55,720
Go back.

944
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,880
Then you should date her.

945
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,240
What took you so long?

946
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,160
I'm in a hurry. I'm leaving.

947
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:02,480
Okay.

948
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,040
Chen Xue, let's switch shifts.

949
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,400
What's wrong with her? Is she okay?

950
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,240
Something happened.

951
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:07,720
I'll take over the shift with you.

952
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,520
There are seven cars in total today.

953
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:12,160
The first car is there.

954
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,200
An old man got heatstroke.

955
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:22,720
Dad.

956
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,640
Mom.

957
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,520
Why are you back at this hour?

958
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,960
Mom, what's wrong with you?

959
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:32,760
Tell me the truth.

960
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,000
I can handle it.

961
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:34,760
I can accept it.

962
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,280
I'm fine.

963
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:36,920
No.

964
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,040
Mom, I know many doctors.

965
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,000
We're not afraid of any disease.

966
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,200
Tell me the truth. Hurry.

967
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,000
Fine.

968
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,720
I'm fine.

969
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,280
You don't eat vitamins.

970
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,240
Why did you buy vitamins?

971
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,080
What medicine did you buy?

972
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:47,920
Fine.

973
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,400
I understand what you said.

974
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,040
Fine, I wanted to take a nap.

975
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,720
Look at you, you're so startled.

976
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,080
You scared me to death.

977
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:55,840
Of course.

978
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,000
I just bought some vitamins.

979
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,240
This...

980
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,200
It's really vitamins.

981
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,840
It's vitamins. I'm not lying.

982
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,520
Besides...

983
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,480
What's wrong with you?

984
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,320
Are you having insomnia or something?

985
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,480
Just a little insomnia.

986
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:15,400
Other things are good.

987
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,320
Just insomnia, right?

988
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,440
Mom, how about I move back?

989
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:25,920
Are you not getting along well with Dr Zhang?

990
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,320
No, I'm fine.

991
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,000
Why did you come back in a hurry?

992
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
I told you I'm fine.

993
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:33,080
I was thinking

994
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:34,239
if you want to buy something,

995
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,800
I can run an errand for you.

996
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,239
Stop nagging.

997
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:38,239
I told you.

998
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,080
Did he forbid you to stay?

999
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:42,480
You sound like I'm staying here.

1000
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,760
What do you mean?

1001
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:46,280
Didn't you tell me you paid rent?

1002
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,400
I did.

1003
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,280
If my dad hadn't asked me

1004
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:49,960
and forced me to resign,

1005
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,239
Do I have to live in his house?

1006
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,679
In that case,

1007
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,640
What a pity.

1008
00:34:59,080 --> 00:34:59,760
What?

1009
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:03,040
It's a pity that I missed such a good boy.

1010
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,440
I'm fine too, okay?

1011
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,080
Fine.

1012
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,160
I won't force you.

1013
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,840
I'm afraid you can't hold her.

1014
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,560
Of course I can.

1015
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:15,520
Why should I?

1016
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,520
I'm your mother.

1017
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,560
I know you best.

1018
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,280
You are carefree.

1019
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,720
few boys can tolerate you.

1020
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,480
You can't live here.

1021
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,320
I can't stand you.

1022
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,000
Why not?

1023
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,680
I'm very popular.

1024
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,920
I have good living habits.

1025
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,320
I also do a lot of housework.

1026
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:32,760
Okay.

1027
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,920
Your room is quite clean now.

1028
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,200
Okay, come back.

1029
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,040
But

1030
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,240
you have to think about what to say to your dad.

1031
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,240
Anyway,

1032
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,640
your dad thinks highly of Dr Zhang.

1033
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,280
I hope you can develop.

1034
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,240
Now that you're back,

1035
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,920
you won't have a chance, right?

1036
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,040
Of course.

1037
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,320
Your dad will definitely arrange a blind date for you.

1038
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,200
Mom, how about this?

1039
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,400
I won't move back.

1040
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,800
You're fine, right?

1041
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:58,680
I can't stand it.

1042
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,480
He nags me about the blind date.

1043
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,760
It's up to you.

1044
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,040
Don't tell him I'm back.

1045
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,720
Eat on time.

1046
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:05,480
You're leaving already?

1047
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,160
Let's go.

1048
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,080
Just because of this?

1049
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,040
I'm just afraid

1050
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,080
that something might happen to you.

1051
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,200
I'll get back to work.

1052
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,000
Look at you.

1053
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,760
Didn't you get it wrong?

1054
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,200
Who do you look like?

1055
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,000
Let's go.

1056
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,200
Okay, take care.

1057
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,240
You're back.

1058
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,280
How is your mom?

1059
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,720
I'm fine. I'm really going to the hospital to buy vitamins.

1060
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,720
You scared me.

1061
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,760
That's good.

1062
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,240
He interrogated us again.

1063
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,720
It's better to stay here.

1064
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,400
Of course.

1065
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,720
No one nags you every day.

1066
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,960
It must be less than staying at my house.

1067
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,000
This uncle and aunt

1068
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,520
express their love to you.

1069
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,200
It's too intense.

1070
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,480
They should push each other harder.

1071
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,560
They always push to me.

1072
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:51,720
You made me...

1073
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,680
Look at Granny Ju and her husband.

1074
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,480
They're both working hard.

1075
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,760
Look how relaxed they are.

1076
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,640
The relationship between Aunt Ju and his wife

1077
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,160
is really enviable.

1078
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:09,080
Dr. Zhang has human emotions.

1079
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,800
Well...

1080
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,000
I...

1081
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,320
I put the rice in the microwave to keep you warm.

1082
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,040
Forget it. I'll take a break.

1083
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:24,800
Oh my god.

1084
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,720
Zhang Chi.

1085
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,080
Shitou.

1086
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,480
You're so bad.

1087
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:44,960
I'm still a stone.

1088
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,280
You pay.

1089
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,800
Mr. Cheng, have some dumplings.

1090
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,520
Take them to Pan.

1091
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:23,320
Pan-chan, have some dumplings!

1092
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,000
Pan-chan!

1093
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,160
Dumplings!

1094
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:32,720
What's that sound?

1095
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,040
Pan-chan!

1096
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:41,680
Mister!

1097
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,840
What happened?

1098
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:44,880
I'm going to give birth.

1099
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,040
I'll get someone for you.

1100
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,520
Hang in there.

1101
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,760
I'll get someone.

1102
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,680
Madam Jang, bad news!

1103
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:55,840
What happened?

1104
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,640
Hua Zi's wife is about to give birth.

1105
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:58,880
Let's go and have a look

1106
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,360
Mrs. Li, Hua-ja's wife is about to give birth.

1107
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:00,720
Yes

1108
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:01,440
Hurry up.

1109
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,040
Hurry up.

1110
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,440
Go and have a look.

1111
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,120
Hurry up.

1112
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:04,880
Huazi's wife

1113
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:09,760
Is she going to give birth?

1114
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,160
The lamb water is going to burst.

1115
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:12,520
Inhale, exhale.

1116
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:13,680
Is she going to give birth?

1117
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,200
I'll call Hua Zi now.

1118
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,560
Liu, call 120.

1119
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:20,120
Hurry up.

1120
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:20,840
Okay.

1121
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,440
Huazi Huazi

1122
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,120
Come back. Your wife is going to give birth.

1123
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,120
Come back quickly.

1124
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:28,760
Hang in there.

1125
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:30,560
Hello?

1126
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:32,560
120.

1127
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,440
A pregnant woman is about to give birth.

1128
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,160
She's at 42 Po Chai Lane.

1129
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,080
Come on.

1130
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,160
I'll take the call.

1131
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,040
I'll go with you.

1132
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:43,680
I called.

1133
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:44,400
Have some water.

1134
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,000
Hang in there.

1135
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,480
It'll be done soon.

1136
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:55,600
Her blood pressure is high.

1137
