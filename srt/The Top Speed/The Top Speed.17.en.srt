00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:06,040
National Radio. And Telvison Administration

2
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,960
I got it. My heart is beating back.

3
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,759
Come on

4
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,039
Grandma! Grandma!

5
00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:44,160
Can you hear me?

6
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,920
I'll take you to the hospital.

7
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,200
monitor, monitor.

8
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,680
A little forward. A little forward. Okay.

9
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,560
Be careful.

10
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:52,080
Relax.

11
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,160
Slowly

12
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:55,880
Slowly.

13
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:56,680
Slowly.

14
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,560
OK. Up.

15
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:02,640
Be careful.

16
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,320
Thank you.

17
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:09,600
It's okay.

18
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,040
Team Two, stay here.

19
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,160
The rest of you, go.

20
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,440
Why did you come in?

21
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:42,960
It's dangerous.

22
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,880
I have to come in if you come in.

23
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:49,960
Aren't you afraid?

24
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,760
I was scared just now.

25
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,040
Me too.

26
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:00,520
I'm not afraid of death. I...

27
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,560
I'm afraid I won't have the chance to tell you.

28
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,560
I like you.

29
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,280
I know you don't want a colleague.

30
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,160
But I have to tell you

31
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:45,400
WHO love me WF

32
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:45,520

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,440

38
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,080

39
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,400
This way please

40
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,120
Okay.

41
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,960
Jiangdong Emergency Center.

42
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
The advanced work commendation meeting

43
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,920
begins now.

44
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,320
First, let's welcome Director Sun

45
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,000
to the stage to talk to you.

46
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:31,760
Welcome.

47
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,440
Comrades,

48
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,760
The emergency center in front of the hospital

49
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,320
has always put the people's health

50
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,280
in a strategic position that comes first.

51
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,080
The priority is to build

52
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:54,440
for the people of Jiangdong.

53
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,280
Use good medical services.

54
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,760
and excellent medical technology.

55
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,400
and good medical ethics.

56
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,520
shoulder the trust of the Party and the people.

57
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,640
Be the first line of defense for the health of the people of Jiangdong.

58
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,360
In this gas station,

59
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,080
in this gas station,

60
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,440
Dr. Zhang Chi, Dr. Qi

61
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,120
was threatened

62
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,000
in a critical situation,

63
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,440
I will never give up on saving patients.

64
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,200
In extreme danger,

65
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,360
they developed their brave spirit of fearless.

66
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,280
Because of their clever response,

67
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,280
not only did they avoid the gas station,

68
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,840
the risk of the explosion,

69
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,120
and saved the nation's property.

70
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,520
and the safety of the people

71
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,880
and the safety of the children.

72
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,800
To commend the bravery

73
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,320
for being selfless and fearless.

74
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,920
On behalf of the Health Commission,

75
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,520
on behalf of the Health Commission

76
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:00,040
to the two medical doctors.

77
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,160
At the same time,

78
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,200
of the advanced group.

79
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,680
OK.

80
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,440
Please come to the stage to receive the award.

81
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,320
Okay.

82
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,600
Okay.

83
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,039
Okay, thank you.

84
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,919
Okay.

85
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,600
Is this real gold?

86
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,080
Dream on.

87
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,320
I have several of these.

88
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,400
You have a few. This is a city class.

89
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,160
Qi Tuo.

90
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:13,840
Sister Ding.

91
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,200
Didn't you ask for leave today?

92
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,000
I handed in my resignation letter.

93
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,840
Qi, that day...

94
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,000
I was really scared that day.

95
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,840
So I ran away.

96
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,760
I didn't know I'd hurt you.

97
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,360
You know my daughter is still young.

98
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,840
She called me during the day

99
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,080
She said she just got a certificate for the sports event.

100
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,080
to show it to me at night.

101
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,160
I was thinking,

102
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:47,920
I was thinking

103
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,640
if something happens to me tonight,

104
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,600
I can't go back.

105
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,440
What should I do if I can't see her again?

106
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,200
I can't let my daughter lose her mother.

107
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,560
Sister Ding, I don't blame you.

108
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,080
I can understand such extreme situation.

109
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:01,600
Really.

110
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,520
But I'm not qualified

111
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,680
to be a doctor anymore.

112
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,560
I'm sorry.

113
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,600
It's already autumn.

114
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,520
Why is it still so hot?

115
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,120
Yeah.

116
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,240
What's going on?

117
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,200
It's so hot.

118
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,520
What's wrong with me blowing my girlfriend's fan?

119
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,160
Girlfriend?

120
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,280
What?

121
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,640
Girlfriend?

122
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,360
What did I say?

123
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,000
Something must be wrong.

124
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,160
They lived together before.

125
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,280
How could it be okay

126
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,640
We didn’t get together at that time.

127
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,400
Qi Qi, wake up.

128
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,080
Come on, tell me the truth.

129
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,600
What?

130
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,360
Are you two together?

131
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,080
Only you and Zhang Chi are in love.

132
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,560
I knew it. There must be something wrong.

133
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,080
This...

134
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:00,080
Qi Qi has got a girlfriend. I don't.

135
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:07,080
Why am I the only one single?

136
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:07,560
It's on you two.

137
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,040
So sweet.

138
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:08,640
It's on me.

139
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,160
Wind.

140
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,360
Here.

141
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,080
I've ordered everything.

142
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,600
The ingredients are ready.

143
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,120
I added oyster sauce vinegar

144
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,200
and fried soybeans.

145
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,840
Do you have a request?

146
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:55,920
No.

147
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,600
Where is Zheng Bo?

148
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,560
I didn't call him. It's just the two of us today.

149
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,360
Why are you so serious?

150
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,080
Just say it

151
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,520
I'm with Qi Tuo.

152
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,800
What did I say?

153
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,200
I told you there's something wrong between you two.

154
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:17,840
Something is wrong.

155
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,520
You don't admit it.

156
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:22,680
I...

157
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,840
I'm not really angry.

158
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:27,760
I'm angry.

159
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,080
because both of you didn't tell me.

160
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,080
and kept it from me.

161
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,680
That's great.

162
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,160
Well...

163
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,760
I told you

164
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,480
to keep an eye on my master.

165
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,720
I was just kidding.

166
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,400
I don't really have feelings for her.

167
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,080
I know her too well.

168
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,880
She took me to the emergency center.

169
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,960
I was also her first pupil.

170
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,880
She's too straightforward. She'll suffer losses.

171
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,600
I'm afraid you'll make things difficult for her.

172
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,560
Let me be serious.

173
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,320
My master

174
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,280
seems tough,

175
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,320
but she's actually gentle and kind.

176
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,640
She's really a good person.

177
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,400
You must treat my master well.

178
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:07,640
Otherwise,

179
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,120
I'll come to you to ask for punishment.

180
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,040
Chengyuan.

181
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:15,600
Thank you.

182
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:16,920
A toast to you.

183
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:19,880
No, if you toast to me,

184
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,320
don't use water then.

185
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,240
Let's drink.

186
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,480
Drink with me till we drop.

187
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,920
Boss, four bottles of iced beer.

188
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:26,840
OK. Coming.

189
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:29,520
Come on.

190
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,520
Your wine.

191
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:30,920
Thank you.

192
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:31,520
Thank you.

193
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,320
Get up.

194
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,080
Here.

195
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,840
Be good to my master.

196
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,000
Senior.

197
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,280
You scared me.

198
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,840
The couple I knocked finally came true.

199
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,600
Tell me.

200
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,840
What's there to say?

201
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,360
When adults have feelings,

202
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,360
let it be.

203
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,360
I'm so happy.

204
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,360
But it's dangerous.

205
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,360
If anything happens to you two,

206
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,880
if anything happens to you.

207
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,200
That's right.

208
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,800
By the way,

209
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,520
you chose it yourself even if you sacrificed.

210
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,600
You have no idea.

211
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,880
how scary it was

212
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,720
How scary was that?

213
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,880
It was full of gasoline and blood.

214
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,040
Dong Liang was holding a lighter.

215
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,320
It can fall on the ground instantly.

216
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,480
Then it will explode.

217
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,800
I was so scared that I really wanted to fall out.

218
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,680
Just run away

219
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,840
Your hand is scratched.

220
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,960
It's okay. It's just a minor injury.

221
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,720
I'm fine.

222
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,680
But you didn't run.

223
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,960
It's impossible to be mentally valuable.

224
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,360
That's because Zhang Chi is inside.

225
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,680
Can I leave him alone in there?

226
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,480
The power of love

227
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,680
You two have risked your life

228
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,000
with each other.

229
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,000
What's next?

230
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:50,880
What next?

231
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,600
We need to make a plan later.

232
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,320
You have to

233
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,120
in your future plan.

234
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,680
No need.

235
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,040
Just get along.

236
00:15:59,080 --> 00:15:59,840
It's so complicated.

237
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,440
No, there must be a process.

238
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,080
In that case,

239
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,840
I have to call

240
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,600
my senior brother-in-law

241
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,640
and teach him a lesson.

242
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,960
Yes, teach him.

243
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,080
Tell him how to do it.

244
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,840
I'll help you. I'll help you.

245
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:12,880
I dare not call him for real.

246
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,720
You really...

247
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,040
Let me help you. You say it.

248
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,480
Ms. Jiang.

249
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,520
I haven't seen you for a while.

250
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,440
I heard you were in a lawsuit.

251
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:25,720
Don't mention it.

252
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,040
My wife divorced me with my child.

253
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,000
Coming.

254
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:30,760
Sorry to keep you waiting.

255
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,400
Sorry.

256
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,280
Come on.

257
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,080
Let me introduce.

258
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,200
Mr. Qi Xuejun.

259
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:36,760
Mr. Qi.

260
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,640
Have a seat.

261
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,680
Let me introduce them one by one.

262
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:39,840
Have a seat.

263
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:40,680
Qi

264
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,120
This is Ms. Jiang.

265
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,080
My brother.

266
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,280
Mr. Bai.

267
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,680
Mr. Wang.

268
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,840
Mr. Wang has a tea house.

269
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,400
is looking for a seller.

270
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,760
Qi's tea room.

271
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,200
Isn't business supposed to be popular?

272
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,200
Really?

273
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,400
Then we can work together.

274
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:57,760
Yes.

275
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,160
Let's add each other on WeChat later.

276
00:16:59,200 --> 00:16:59,760
Let's add each other on WeChat.

277
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,840
Let's talk later.

278
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,560
Okay, let's talk.

279
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:03,680
Come on.

280
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,200
Come on, fill your glasses.

281
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:06,960
Today

282
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,480
our Mr. Qi.

283
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,400
Come on, everyone.

284
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,319
Here, Mr. Qi.

285
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:11,960
Sorry.

286
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:13,839
I...

287
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,400
I can't drink. I can't.

288
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,680
I feel dizzy after drinking.

289
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:17,839
I can only drink drinks.

290
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,040
I'm really sorry.

291
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,920
It's okay to drink a little today.

292
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,119
Just a little.

293
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,200
Don't drink too much.

294
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,480
It's okay. We're friends.

295
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:26,599
Be casual. Come on.

296
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:27,839
Come on.

297
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,920
Come on, everyone.

298
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,680
Come on, Mr. Qi.

299
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,840
Come on, raise your glasses. Cheers.

300
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:33,240
Come on.

301
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,320
Nice to meet you.

302
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:03,280
Aren't you all going to give me a drink?

303
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,720
Get me some wine.

304
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,400
Good for you.

305
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,080
You've drunk him away. Why are you still drinking?

306
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,440
Get the wine. They drink.

307
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,120
Let's go Qi That's it

308
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,400
Get the wine

309
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,240
I'll drink with you next time.

310
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:15,280
Bring me wine.

311
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,600
Bring wine

312
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,280
Bring wine.

313
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,320
All done

314
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:23,680
That's all.

315
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:24,560
Let's drink.

316
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:25,840
Hurry.

317
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,360
Drink.

318
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,120
Cool.

319
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,120
Let's go

320
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,720
What's wrong Qi

321
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,000
Sorry

322
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,080
What's wrong Qi

323
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,400
Don't follow me

324
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,520
What's wrong?

325
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,840
Don't follow me.

326
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,440
Stop following me.

327
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:56,840
I'm sorry.

328
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,240
It's my fault.

329
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,360
It's my fault.

330
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:09,560
Let's go.

331
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,400
Sorry.

332
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,120
Let's go home.

333
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,400
Sorry.

334
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,160
I'm sorry.

335
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,120
I'm sorry.

336
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,400
It's my fault.

337
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,080
Slow down.

338
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:31,560
Here.

339
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:34,960
Watch the steps, uncle.

340
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,400
Come on.

341
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:41,680
Stand still.

342
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,000
Auntie, don't be angry.

343
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,720
Introduce some tea merchants to me.

344
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,080
I had no choice but to drink too much.

345
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,360
It's okay.

346
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,400
Help him upstairs. Thank you.

347
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,080
Here's the stairs.

348
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:55,400
Be careful.

349
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:56,400
Here.

350
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,840
Come on.

351
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:01,800
Slowly.

352
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,840
Slow down.

353
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,560
Lower his head.

354
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,440
Heads up.

355
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Right. Turn his face to one side.

356
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,560
Don't choke the tube when vomiting.

357
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:23,840
Watch your waist.

358
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,680
Why are you so drunk?

359
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,440
It’s my fault.

360
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,560
By the way, Qu,

361
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,120
don’t tell Qiqi about what happened today.

362
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,800
Don't worry. I won't say it.

363
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:50,800
Thank you.

364
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,560
By the way, Aunt Zeng,

365
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,560
I'm afraid Uncle Qi

366
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,680
if Uncle Qi wakes up at night.

367
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,000
How about I stay in the living room tonight?

368
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Call me if you need anything.

369
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,280
I'm flattered.

370
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,000
It's okay. I'm really worried. The point is...

371
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:04,560
Okay.

372
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,360
There's a guest room next door. Thank you.

373
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:10,080
Okay, I'll go down first.

374
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:10,600
Okay.

375
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,080
Call me if you need anything.

376
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:11,720
Okay

377
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,840
Qi Qi Qi

378
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:28,560
Stop drinking

379
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:28,960
What's wrong?

380
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,560
Get up.

381
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,560
Stop drinking.

382
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,080
Leave me alone.

383
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:32,960
What are you doing?

384
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,280
What's wrong, Uncle Qi?

385
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,280
Qi, auntie

386
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:35,880
Let's go

387
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,280
Stop drinking Qi

388
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,840
Don't touch me

389
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,240
Qi, get up Qi

390
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,560
Do you have to drink like this?

391
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,560
Stop drinking Qi

392
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,360
Stop drinking Get up

393
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,040
I'm sick. Get up.

394
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,240
I'm sick. I want to drink.

395
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,560
I'll drink with you another day, okay?

396
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,120
Get up

397
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:53,760
Qi

398
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:57,120
Qi

399
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,120
Qi, Qi, Qi

400
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:28,840
Auntie

401
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,760
Aunt, I'm done packing up.

402
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,760
Thank you.

403
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,640
Thank goodness you're here today.

404
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:41,160
Otherwise, I really don't know what to do.

405
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,080
I promised to keep it a secret for Uncle Qi.

406
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,440
I thought it was just a little fetish between men.

407
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:49,840
I didn't take it seriously.

408
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,040
I didn't expect it to be so serious.

409
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,080
It's my fault.

410
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,040
I shouldn't have kept it from you.

411
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,520
It's not your fault.

412
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,960
He has Alcohol dependence.

413
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,320
Alcohol dependence?

414
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:07,840
Yes, sir.

415
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,760
He's addicted to alcohol.

416
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,840
In fact, all these years,

417
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,640
all these years.

418
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,400
But I think it's not easy for him

419
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,200
to do business outside.

420
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,560
He just pretended not to know.

421
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,200
That's how he is now.

422
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,200
What should I do?

423
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,600
According to your description,

424
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,840
From my initial judgment,

425
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,520
your wife is addicted to alcohol.

426
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,760
I suggest you bring him to our hospital

427
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,400
for a comprehensive examination.

428
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,320
Drinking will hurt your liver.

429
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:49,280
It could also cause mental trauma.

430
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,520
He has a physical examination every year.

431
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,400
And the indicators are normal.

432
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,640
I'm just worried about his alcohol addiction.

433
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,720
In this case,

434
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,160
you should go to Neurosurgery.

435
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,880
He needs psychological intervention when necessary.

436
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:07,040
I suggest he do a comprehensive examination.

437
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,080
so that we can treat him.

438
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,440
He can't drink much.

439
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,520
Just a few sips.

440
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,280
I'm worried.

441
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:20,640
I see.

442
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,760
I've never seen your wife either.

443
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,320
So I can't make the right decision

444
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,440
his situation.

445
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,720
You need to talk to him

446
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,160
and communicate with him.

447
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,760
Don't avoid doctors.

448
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:41,280
Is there any medicine

449
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,520
to suppress his alcohol addiction?

450
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,520
You need more vitamins.

451
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,720
quality protein and multiple minerals.

452
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,960
especially vitamin B2.

453
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,640
I'll give you an order later.

454
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:55,960
Go to the pharmacy to get it.

455
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:57,840
Normally,

456
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,520
keep the diet balance.

457
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,960
Exercise and healthy mood

458
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,880
This is a good way to suppress it.

459
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,400
Okay, thank you.

460
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,080
Sorry to bother you.

461
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:10,880
Okay.

462
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,400
He's been controlling the amount.

463
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,520
Nothing happened.

464
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,440
I didn't expect this to happen today.

465
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,840
Uncle Qi usually can drink.

466
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,760
I don't know what happened today.

467
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,840
By the way,

468
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,200
what did Uncle Qi say

469
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,400
when Uncle Qi was ill.

470
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,520
Sorry, I was wrong.

471
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,080
I don't understand.

472
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,840
Is something bothering him?

473
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,840
Qi

474
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,080
Over 20 years have passed

475
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,040
Why can't you let it go?

476
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,760
What happened 20 years ago?

477
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,160
Nothing.

478
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,040
Aunt.

479
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,720
Uncle Qi

480
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,280
very serious.

481
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,960
If he gets drunk again

482
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,880
it'll be very difficult for him to get drunk again.

483
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,640
What we need to do now

484
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,040
is to figure out the source

485
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,400
and think of a solution.

486
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,640
If this goes on,

487
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,080
if Qi Tuo finds out,

488
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,520
she will be so sad.

489
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,520
Twenty years ago,

490
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,160
Uncle Qi had a car accident

491
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,600
due to negligence.

492
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,840
and hit a woman.

493
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:42,360
She was badly injured.

494
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,720
He was not rescued.

495
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,320
Uncle Qi

496
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,920
very guilty.

497
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,120
for a long time.

498
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:54,080
I drink more and more frequently.

499
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,000
Every time I think about this,

500
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,440
he would drink to drown his sorrows.

501
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,200
So many times.

502
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,080
Finally, I rely on alcohol.

503
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:16,760
It's okay, ma'am.

504
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,360
We'll go to the hospital tomorrow

505
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,680
and give Uncle a check-up.

506
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,040
Qi, have the porridge first

507
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,960
I'll go get the medical report

508
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,720
Have some porridge. It's good for your stomach.

509
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:44,640
Let me feed you.

510
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:46,960
No.

511
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,520
I really feel bad.

512
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:49,920
I really don't want to drink

513
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:54,600
Come in.

514
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,360
Aunt Zeng.

515
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,200
The doctor has checked Uncle Qi's examination report.

516
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,040
Nothing wrong.

517
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,280
You can go home and rest tonight.

518
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,000
I don't know how to thank you.

519
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:05,120
for keeping you busy from last night.

520
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,880
It's my pleasure.

521
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,600
When I started my business,

522
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,200
you and Uncle took good care of me.

523
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,120
Right, Qi?

524
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,600
Qu.

525
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,480
Thank you.

526
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Sorry for the trouble.

527
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,120
Alright, don't blame yourself.

528
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,000
Take care.

529
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,360
I'd better call Qi Qi.

530
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,840
Why?

531
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,480
You're in the hospital.

532
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,840
You can't keep it from her.

533
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,720
What are you thinking?

534
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,360
Don't fight.

535
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,880
Don't let her know this.

536
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,240
Now you're scared.

537
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:37,720
When you lie in the wine jar,

538
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,320
why didn't you think about your wife and children?

539
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,240
I said I can't hit them.

540
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:41,880
I can't control you.

541
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,120
I'll let Qi take care of you.

542
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,360
Can you stop messing around?

543
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,240
Me?

544
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,640
How am I messing around?

545
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,360
Auntie, have a seat.

546
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,760
She's busy and tired.

547
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,480
Let's not tell her.

548
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:01,600
Besides,

549
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,480
Even if Qiqi knows it now,

550
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,480
we can only be anxious, right?

551
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,560
Why are you in a hurry?

552
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,960
Even Yuanzhi can't see it.

553
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,320
Yuan.

554
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,640
Aren't you on night shift?

555
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,560
Why are you here now?

556
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,520
Yes, it's the night shift.

557
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,400
Secretary Liu

558
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,080
He said

559
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,680
with Director Song tonight.

560
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:35,920
So he asked me to go with you.

561
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,160
I'm afraid you can't make it.

562
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:38,920
Thank you. Let's go.

563
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,280
Wait a minute

564
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:42,800
Take it.

565
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:45,960
What are you doing?

566
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:46,920
I don't want the money.

567
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:47,840
I'm doing an investment.

568
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,200
Why are you doing that?

569
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:49,920
You have to get out of the car.

570
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:50,920
I don't have the energy.

571
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,160
Here is 200,000 yuan.

572
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,040
is enough for your early development cost.

573
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:54,760
I...

574
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,040
Consider it my investment, okay?

575
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,160
Take it. You're welcome.

576
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,920
Okay, I'll count you in.

577
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:04,800
Thank you, Yuan.

578
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:05,560
Let's go.

579
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,400
Get in.

580
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,080
Zhang.

581
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,960
He is the young man I told you about.

582
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:15,840
Zheng Bo.

583
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:16,560
Yes.

584
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,560
Hello

585
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,440
Hello.

586
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,760
Zheng Bo, an emergency doctor.

587
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:20,560
Hello.

588
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,400
Hello

589
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,680
You are Xu...

590
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,400
Xu Chengyuan.

591
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,160
Zheng Bo's colleague and partner.

592
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:25,680
Yes.

593
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,800
Hello

594
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:27,520
Have a seat.

595
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,040
Have a seat.

596
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:28,440
Please sit.

597
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:28,800
Okay.

598
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,080
Zheng,

599
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:34,040
He's your senior.

600
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,640
He is the first

601
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,440
of our city

602
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,560
Senior

603
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,040
What senior?

604
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,680
I've been to your center a few times.

605
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,040
I heard a lot about you from Secretary Liu.

606
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,920
Since you and Chi

607
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:53,800
are colleagues.

608
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:54,800
Yes.

609
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,440
Don't call me senior.

610
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,200
Call me uncle.

611
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,960
No, no, no. You should call me senior.

612
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:00,600
Yes.

613
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,680
Call me uncle. It's a deal.

614
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:03,680
Okay.

615
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:04,680
Uncle Zhang.

616
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,160
Yes.

617
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:06,680
Let's eat.

618
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:07,040
Okay.

619
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:07,560
Let's talk while eating.

620
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,080
Yes.

621
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,440
Help yourself.

622
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:13,680
Zheng.

623
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,080
I heard about your project from Director Song.

624
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:16,920
Very good.

625
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:17,520
Thank you.

626
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,160
I have an idea.

627
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:20,840
Look.

628
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:24,520
The total population of our city

629
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:27,920
only 40,000 people can get an ambulance.

630
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:28,400
Yes.

631
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,440
In other words,

632
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,040
the Emergency Center has been working day and night.

633
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,160
We can't meet all needs.

634
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:33,560
Yes.

635
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,160
Before I retired,

636
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,640
before I retired.

637
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,800
That means we're here.

638
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,920
The patient is dying.

639
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,200
But the people around him

640
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,280
look confused.

641
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,960
I don't know how to save him.

642
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,080
So I was thinking

643
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,160
what you did

644
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,080
Pre-inspection division.

645
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,680
Yes, on one side.

646
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,560
On the other hand,

647
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,760
can we think of a way

648
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:05,400
to improve the public's emergency consciousness

649
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,160
so that the people

650
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,199
learn some first aid knowledge.

651
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,400
so that everyone

652
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,920
have the ability to save themselves.

653
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,840
Yes, recently,

654
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,679
this short video is very popular.

655
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,560
The social media is full of flowers.

656
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:22,159
I wonder if we can

657
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,920
adapt to the trend

658
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:28,320
and shoot some videos about emergency knowledge

659
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,159
on the Internet.

660
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,040
and promote it online.

661
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:32,639
to attract everyone's attention.

662
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:33,679
What do you think?

663
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:34,679
Mr. Jang.

664
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,679
No, Uncle Zhang.

665
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,960
You know about short videos too?

666
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:40,800
What are you talking about?

667
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,560
It's more than a short video.

668
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:45,520
I often watch this internet celebrity live stream.

669
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,560
Internet celebrity live stream?

670
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,560
That uncle is really following the trend.

671
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,679
I think it's a good form.

672
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,320
The audience

673
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:56,040
like watching it regardless of age or age.

674
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:56,679
Right?

675
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,920
And we can interact directly.

676
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,040
with each other.

677
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:03,760
As long as your content is creative,

678
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,520
it's easy to be accepted by young people.

679
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,280
To be honest,

680
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,440
I really

681
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,640
want to be

682
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,560
an internet celebrity who knows emergency knowledge.

683
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,680
Be an Internet celebrity. I think

684
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,160
Uncle Zhang, I think you can do it.

685
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,560
Uncle, you really follow the trend.

686
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,680
And I have many views

687
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:23,760
are the same as you.

688
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,160
I always think

689
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,520
emergency treatment is not only about doctors.

690
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,840
Because in our daily life,

691
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,280
in our daily life.

692
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:31,960
If the people

693
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,680
understand some common knowledge of emergency treatment,

694
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,920
While waiting for an ambulance,

695
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,560
we can make this patient

696
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,080
the survival rate.

697
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:40,920
Yeah.

698
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,520
So I think

699
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:46,760
we should promote it online and offline.

700
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,920
the importance of emergency treatment.

701
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,040
This

702
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:55,160
is also suitable

703
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,040
we've been advocating.

704
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,920
the purpose of caring for life.

705
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,320
Yes.

706
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,160
I have a bold suggestion.

707
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:04,760
Go ahead.

708
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,080
Uncle Zhang, how about

709
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,800
you do the app of Mr. Zhang?

710
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,160
What do you think?

711
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,080
Sure.

712
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:10,560
Okay.

713
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,320
But

714
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:14,520
our project has just started.

715
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,440
So the consultant's fee is...

716
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,920
Don't worry, I don't want money.

717
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,640
How could I ask for money

718
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:21,800
for the country and the people?

719
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:22,920
Right?

720
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,560
I can't let you work for nothing.

721
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:26,520
How about this?

722
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,440
is technical investment.

723
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:30,440
Okay.

724
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,040
Zheng,

725
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:37,320
you have a great partner.

726
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,200
Yes.

727
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,640
Well, let's propose a toast to the two uncles.

728
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:41,640
To you two.

729
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:42,680
Okay. Here.

730
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,680
Thank you, Director Song, for introducing Uncle Zhang.

731
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,760
And thank Uncle Zhang

732
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,080
for joining our big family.

733
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:50,920
Thank you.

734
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,200
We'll be family from now on.

735
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:53,800
Yes.

736
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,080
We're a family.

737
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:55,920
Come on.

738
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,160
When I can drink,

739
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,160
I will drink with you.

740
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,760
Okay, I'll wait.

741
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:02,400
Okay.

742
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,880
There's a girl passed out

743
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,520
A girl fainted.

744
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,760
0112 Xu Chengyuan's car team, please go immediately.

745
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,800
Copy that. Let's go now.

746
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:20,400
Yuan Yuan, hurry up.

747
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,640
Doctor!

748
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,440
Doctor, hurry!

749
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,000
Where is the patient?

750
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,080
Hurry, doctor!

751
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,400
Over here. She fainted.

752
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,480
Doctor, the doctor is here.

753
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,720
Don't worry. Be careful.

754
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,120
Watch your step.

755
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,120
What's going on?

756
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,800
This is our new employee.

757
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,320
We're in advertising.

758
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,600
We're here to change the ad today.

759
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,080
The girl suddenly fainted.

760
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,680
Maybe she didn't have breakfast.

761
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,000
Here, test your blood sugar.

762
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:05,360
Here, disinfect.

763
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,120
Doctor, please do something.

764
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:22,720
Low blood sugar.

765
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,120
Doctor, is she okay?

766
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,000
I'm fine. Let me see if she's injured.

767
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,120
Call the police.

768
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,880
Hello, is this 911?

769
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,000
Yes, the construction site of Qingcheng Road.

770
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,120
Yes, hurry.

771
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,960
There was a steel crash at the construction site of Qingcheng Road.

772
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,840
0112 cars request backup.

773
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,960
Hello, Sister Qi.

774
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:24,360
Yuan is penetrated by steel.

775
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,680
What do you mean?

776
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:26,880
Calm down.

777
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:27,520
Where are you now?

778
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,800
At the construction site of Qingcheng Road.

779
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,200
Okay, we'll be right there.

780
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:30,840
Right away.

781
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:47,880
Xu Chengyuan.

782
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:53,080
Yuan Yuan.

783
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,120
Here.

784
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,280
Here, Sister Qi.

785
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:02,120
Yuan Yuan.

786
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,600
Qi Tuo, slow down. It's slippery.

787
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,280
Qi, Zhang Chi, this way.

788
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,200
Coming.

789
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:07,960
Hang in there.

790
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:09,600
Oh my god.

791
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,360
It's penetrating.

792
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:12,880
Hold this for me.

793
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,360
Yuan Yuan, make way.

794
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,760
We're leaving today.

795
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,240
Yuan is treating this patient.

796
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,240
Suddenly a string of steel

797
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,520
on the billboard.

798
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,120
and pricked it.

799
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:20,960
Come on.

800
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,640
How could this happen to him? Yuan...

801
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:23,960
You put all the weight

802
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,000
on my leg.

803
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,080
It's okay. I'm holding it for you.

804
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,120
You can't move.

805
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,000
Don't move

806
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,000
It's close to the heart.

807
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,760
It could be in the heart.

808
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,480
We can only know

809
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,360
when we get to the hospital.

810
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,360
What's wrong with this girl?

811
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,640
Low blood sugar.

812
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:36,720
Don't move.

813
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,600
Did you call the fire?

814
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,080
I'll be right there.

815
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,320
It's okay

816
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,360
Did you get through? Down there.

817
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,200
This way.

818
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:53,760
It went through.

819
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,080
Is it deep?

820
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:55,760
It's on the ground.

821
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:57,400
Like this.

822
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:58,880
There's a steel bar down there.

823
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,120
Now they are wearing the same clothes.

824
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,120
Let's see if we can find a way

825
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,480
to separate them first.

826
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:02,880
After that,

827
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,120
we can send them to the hospital one by one.

828
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:04,600
Okay?

829
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:07,120
I'll try the size with a steel breaker.

830
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,480
I'll cut it if it's possible.

831
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:08,880
Okay?

832
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:09,960
Okay.

833
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,600
No. 8, bring me the steel breaker.

834
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:12,360
Hang in there.

835
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,840
Yuan, it's okay.

836
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,200
It's okay.

837
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:16,480
It's okay, Yuan.

838
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:17,640
It's okay.

839
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,360
You'll know when the hospital is done.

840
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,360
You didn't bleed too much, right?

841
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,480
How could this happen?

842
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,600
Hold on.

843
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,960
Wait, are you going to cut this part?

844
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:29,480
Yes.

845
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,120
Okay.

846
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,320
Well, comrade.

847
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:34,080
The steel is very close to the heart.

848
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,360
Please choose

849
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,480
the smallest way to vibrate.

850
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:37,600
If the vibration is big,

851
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,200
they'll easily break their blood vessels.

852
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,720
and cause secondary damage.

853
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:41,520
Please.

854
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,360
Okay, I'll check the size first.

855
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,960
Then we'll fix it, okay?

856
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:45,880
Okay, okay.

857
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,080
Far away, look up.

858
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,200
This seems a little small.

859
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,000
No, right?

860
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,480
It's okay. Hang in there.

861
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,360
I'm going to use liquid to break the tools.

862
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:56,720
Wait.

863
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,120
You need to fix both sides.

864
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,080
No problem.

865
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,080
No. 1, No. 2.

866
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,360
Bring the equipment team here.

867
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:01,720
Roger.

868
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:02,720
It's okay.

869
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:03,600
It's okay.

870
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,000
I need a doctor later.

871
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,760
fix this for me.

872
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:07,400
Okay, got it.

873
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,640
Hold it with both hands.

874
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:09,360
To reduce the shock, right?

875
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:09,880
Yes.

876
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:10,760
No problem

877
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:11,240
Qi Tuo

878
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:12,400
we have to keep him healthy.

879
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:12,960
Got it.

880
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,120
Make the whole floor

881
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:15,960
and upper part.

882
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:16,520
Got it.

883
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,760
The position here is a little small.

884
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:19,760
Maybe his hand

885
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:20,880
Can you lift it a little bit?

886
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:22,240
Okay.

887
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,960
Put your hands down. Yes.

888
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:26,360
Is this okay?

889
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:27,320
Yes.

890
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,120
It's okay.

891
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,200
It's okay.

892
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
We'll be apart soon.

893
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,240
Then go to the hospital.

894
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:33,760
I'll separate you soon.

895
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:34,720
so I sent you to the hospital.

896
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:35,640
Right away.

897
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:39,360
It's okay. He's fine.

898
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,600
It's okay.

899
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:41,840
It's okay.

900
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:42,960
It's okay.

901
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:49,680
