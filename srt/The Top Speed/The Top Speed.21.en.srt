00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:06,040
National Radio And Telvison Administration

2
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,160
Beihai, here's a toast to you

3
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:34,720
Come on

4
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,039
Come on, come on, come on

5
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,680
Look at this. Look at this. Look at this.

6
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,680
He only drank one kilo of liquor.

7
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,080
Shu Hua is getting married today.

8
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:49,400
As her family, I must do it.

9
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,320
When did you

10
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,440
become Miss Qin's family?

11
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,600
You have no idea.

12
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:01,080
Shu Hua and I grew up together

13
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,440
Zhang Beihai I tell you

14
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,919
If you treat Shu Hua badly

15
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:11,720
and bully her,

16
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,800
I won't forgive you.

17
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,560
I'll keep my eyes on you.

18
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,440
I'll supervise you for the rest of your life.

19
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,480
Come on.

20
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,280
Let's drink.

21
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,440
Have more wine.

22
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,680
I've been staring at you.

23
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,440
Happy wedding.

24
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,920
Happy wedding!

25
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,560
Cheers.

26
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:36,920
Let's eat.

27
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,320
Let's eat.

28
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,079
Honey.

29
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,640
Brother Zhang.

30
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,240
Brother Zhang

31
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:44,880
I'm Guizhi.

32
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,040
Are you home?

33
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,240
My son is sick.

34
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,840
Brother Zhang, are you home?

35
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,440
Why is it her again?

36
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,440
Brother Zhang, I'm Gui Zhi.

37
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,680
Brother Zhang, open the door!

38
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,680
Brother Zhang!

39
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,079
Brother Zhang.

40
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,800
Coming

41
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,960
Poppet, Poppet has a fever.

42
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,560
He was shivering just now.

43
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,440
He fainted.

44
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,480
Go take a look.

45
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,680
Go back and take care of the kid.

46
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,440
I'll be right there.

47
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,600
Okay, hurry up.

48
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,200
Okay.

49
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,720
How is it?

50
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,200
I got a fever reducer.

51
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,440
His temperature has dropped.

52
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,560
But I suggest

53
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,960
take her to the hospital.

54
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,560
It's all my fault.

55
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,800
I didn't take good care of him.

56
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:55,840
Don't cry.

57
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,320
The baby is fine now.

58
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,320
Be strong.

59
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:00,560
Okay.

60
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,800
I'm leaving.

61
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,920
Thank you.

62
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,680
Brother Zhang.

63
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,840
Thanks to you today.

64
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,200
If it weren't for you,

65
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,080
we wouldn't know what to do.

66
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,680
Now

67
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:19,800
Thank you.

68
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,080
Look at my house.

69
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,160
Thank you.

70
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,200
It's a big day.

71
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,240
What is he doing?

72
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,960
Brother Zhang.

73
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,800
Thank you so much.

74
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:40,680
You...

75
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,200
I brought you glutinous rice balls.

76
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,720
Sister Gui Zhi, you brought us delicious food again.

77
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,480
Did you make these glutinous rice balls yourself?

78
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,080
Yes.

79
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,720
I grinded the glutinous rice flour last night.

80
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,440
Dr. Sun, let's eat together.

81
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:20,960
I've eaten.

82
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:27,960
I like this one

83
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,920
Sister, is it also food in this box?

84
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,960
This is for Zhang.

85
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,400
He's in the garden outside.

86
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,320
Okay, enjoy your meal.

87
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,400
There's a lot here.

88
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,320
Okay, thank you.

89
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,040
Thank you.

90
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:42,800
Thank you.

91
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,200
Delicious.

92
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,040
Yimo, have one too.

93
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,480
You're so greedy.

94
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:53,720
I'm not eating.

95
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,560
Yimo, come here.

96
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,480
OK. Coming.

97
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,720
Hurry up. It's urgent.

98
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,320
I'm always an outsider.

99
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,680
For your mother,

100
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,800
for your mother.

101
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,040
But

102
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,160
Chen Gui Zhi went to the hospital

103
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,800
to provoke your mother.

104
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,960
Get some rest.

105
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,720
Don't worry. You'll get better.

106
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,200
Thank you, Dr. Qin.

107
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,080
Thank you.

108
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,960
Okay, next one.

109
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,400
It's you.

110
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,200
What's wrong with your heart?

111
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,680
Dr. Qin

112
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,440
I'm here to see you

113
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,560
I have something to tell you face to face.

114
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,920
If you keep hiding it,

115
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,840
I don't think it's fair to you.

116
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,280
Don't register if you're not here to see a doctor.

117
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,400
Don't occupy medical resources.

118
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,480
Zhang and I

119
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,320
are already together.

120
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,960
Can you quit?

121
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:15,840
Zhi Gang.

122
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,920
You may leave.

123
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:19,720
Okay.

124
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,560
We've been together for half a year.

125
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,440
I'm telling you now because

126
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,920
because I'm afraid you can't take it.

127
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,200
But people say doctors are kind.

128
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:38,960
Dr. Qin,

129
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,960
You either let Zhang go

130
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,200
and help us.

131
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,840
You don't care about him at all, do you?

132
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,200
No wonder he said

133
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,960
he couldn't stay in that house anymore.

134
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,800
He's like an ice cellar every day.

135
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,560
Dr. Qin

136
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,400
It's not good for a woman to be too strong.

137
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,200
You spend every day in the hospital.

138
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,840
You don't have time to take care of your husband.

139
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,920
Take care of the child.

140
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,280
He has been busy all day.

141
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,720
He doesn't even have a warm meal at home.

142
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,680
How can he live with you?

143
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,960
Are you done?

144
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,720
Brother Zhang.

145
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,480
for taking care of our family for so many years.

146
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,440
I know

147
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,320
his feelings for me.

148
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,600
The reason why I didn’t make it clear

149
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,080
because I am a widow.

150
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,800
I was afraid of dragging him down.

151
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,560
But he said he didn't mind.

152
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,280
Otherwise, he wouldn't have taken care of our family.

153
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,080
That long?

154
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,800
And my child likes him a lot.

155
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,080
He always calls him dad.

156
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,840
Dr. Qin, I really feel sorry for him.

157
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,320
I don't want him to suffer here with you anymore

158
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,440
Today,

159
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,680
I mustered up a lot of courage

160
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,200
to tell you this.

161
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,400
Please let him go and help us.

162
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,280
Next.

163
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,720
Have you heard?

164
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,800
That woman came to the hospital and asked Qin Shuhua to quit.

165
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,920
It's also spread in your department.

166
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,800
Yes, I just heard about it.

167
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,320
Dong Zi.

168
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,040
Pack up the car.

169
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:47,960
I need to use the bathroom.

170
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:48,680
Okay.

171
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,720
She is no match for Qin Shuhua.

172
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,680
Bei Hai is really blind.

173
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,320
Exactly. Why do you like her?

174
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,080
There's a big gap between a couple.

175
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,200
Think about it.

176
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,080
Men feel inferior after a long time.

177
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,680
He went out to find balance.

178
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,720
He has been secretly with that woman for a long time.

179
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,200
He even helped her raise a child.

180
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,680
Dr. Qin has been kept in the dark.

181
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:07,960
Poor thing.

182
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,400
Dr. Qin is an excellent woman.

183
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,680
How can her pride stand it?

184
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,400
That's right.

185
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,400
If I were you, I would've died.

186
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,920
Excuse me.

187
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,080
Is Dr. Qin Shuhua here?

188
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,960
Dr. Qin is on leave.

189
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,440
A leave?

190
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,800
She never asked for leave.

191
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,440
She said she's not feeling well.

192
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,200
She needs to rest for a day.

193
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,960
What's wrong with her?

194
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,440
Exactly.

195
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,680
How can you ruin her family?

196
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,960
Your mom's condition is getting worse.

197
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,160
When I heard about this,

198
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,680
It's too late.

199
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,560
I know you're home, Shu Hua.

200
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,320
Open the door, Shu Hua.

201
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,680
Shu Hua!

202
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,560
Shu Hua, open the door.

203
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,080
Yimo.

204
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,200
Come in.

205
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,800
Shu Hua, what happened to you?

206
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,280
Are you sick?

207
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,200
I just came back from the north of the city.

208
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,720
I heard about it.

209
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,800
Did Chen Gui Zhi go to the hospital?

210
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,440
Shu Hua, hang in there.

211
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,320
If Zhang Beihai really cheated on you

212
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,080
he doesn't deserve

213
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,400
to torture yourself like this.

214
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,320
Shu Hua, no matter what happens,

215
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,440
I will seek justice for you.

216
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:39,800
Stop it.

217
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,320
Stop it.

218
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,560
I don't want to hear it.

219
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,480
I'm tired.

220
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,600
Go home.

221
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,520
Go back

222
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,720
Zhang Beihai doesn’t deserve her

223
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,680
and let her down

224
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,520
I was afraid it would provoke her more.

225
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,880
So I've been waiting.

226
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,480
I wanted to wait for her to get better.

227
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,920
I didn't expect

228
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:17,240
was her death

229
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,760
Zhang Beihai, you bastard

230
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,320
You're a jerk

231
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,920
You're a jerk.

232
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,720
It's all your fault.

233
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,400
You should die

234
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:16,000
Zhang Beihai didn't say anything

235
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,560
I can see

236
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,600
I saw it.

237
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,720
From the moment Chen Gui Zhi met him,

238
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,000
to the two of them

239
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,000
Then Chen Gui Zhi went to the hospital to make a scene.

240
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:33,560
Until your mother was so dispirited.

241
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,040
I know.

242
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,760
Your mom is desperate

243
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Zhang Beihai

244
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,800
with Zhang Beihai

245
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,440
Should I

246
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,920
listen to Uncle Sun alone?

247
00:16:58,920 --> 00:16:59,240
Didn't you say

248
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,920
there's another Dong Zi in Jiangdong?

249
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,520
Where are you?

250
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,200
Otherwise,

251
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:02,960
I want to see you.

252
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,000
Zhang Chi, it's working time.

253
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:07,599
Zhang Chi.

254
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,520
Help me apply for leave.

255
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,440
Xue Xue.

256
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:16,240
Don't go home yet.

257
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,200
I have something urgent. Keep an eye on it for me.

258
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:17,760
Thanks.

259
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,560
I just got off work. I have a blind date.

260
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,440
Then buy me dinner.

261
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,079
No wonder I'm not in love today.

262
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:26,599
Go to work.

263
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:47,760
Coming.

264
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,400
Coming

265
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,520
I'm back.

266
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,920
Come in The noodles are ready

267
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,800
Come in

268
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,160
Let's talk inside.

269
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,480
Hello, Uncle Zhang.

270
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,560
Why are you here?

271
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,680
I came to see you.

272
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,760
You are...

273
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,200
I'm Qi Qi.

274
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,000
You're Chi's teaching teacher.

275
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,040
Dr. Qi, right?

276
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:17,480
Yes.

277
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,680
Welcome.

278
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:19,480
Perfect.

279
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,160
Let's eat jjajangmyeon today

280
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,160
The noodles are ready.

281
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,760
Come in, please.

282
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,040
Stop working.

283
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,240
We're not here to eat.

284
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,520
I have something to ask you.

285
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,160
You're asking about your mom, right?

286
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:42,720
Yes.

287
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,280
How did my mom die?

288
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,560
Suicide?

289
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,960
Why did she commit suicide?

290
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,960
You can't tell, right?

291
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,440
Let me answer it for you.

292
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,160
It's because you're with the patient's family.

293
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,240
She went to the hospital.

294
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,800
After that, the whole hospital

295
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,000
you stepped on my mom's dignity.

296
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,240
She felt ashamed.

297
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,240
That's why she committed suicide, right?

298
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,800
It's never like that.

299
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,000
Why don't you believe me?

300
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,240
Tell me what happened.

301
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,480
I trust you. Go ahead.

302
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:24,920
OK, Zhang Chi.

303
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,240
Let me tell you again.

304
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,320
Please trust me.

305
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,920
I've never done anything

306
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,520
to your mom.

307
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:31,880
Then why does my mom take pills every day 04577?

308
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,280
Then why does my mom take medicine every day?

309
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,240
I checked.

310
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,080
She took sleeping pills and painkillers.

311
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,080
She still can't sleep.

312
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,240
She has three surgeries a day.

313
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,840
She needs to focus.

314
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,760
Why would she waste her body?

315
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,520
Tell me.

316
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,200
It's been so many years.

317
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,040
I just want to know the truth.

318
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,520
I want to know how my mom died.

319
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,600
Is it that hard?

320
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,440
You won't tell me?

321
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:09,800
Okay.

322
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,320
Then don't ever say it.

323
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:15,680
Chi.

324
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:16,920
Uncle, I'll go.

325
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,440
I'll visit you next time.

326
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:49,840
Qi Tuo.

327
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,720
I want to be alone.

328
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:13,560
008401.

329
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,120
Your mom went to a dead end

330
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,200
Zhang Beihai

331
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,040
There's a big problem

332
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,280
It's been so many years.

333
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,760
I just want to know the truth.

334
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,120
I want to know how my mom died so hard.

335
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,760
Qi Qi.

336
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:31,200
Here is the authorization letter written by my dad.

337
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,200
I'll leave it to you.

338
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,760
I remember

339
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,040
your father taught you

340
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,240
to bear the consequences.

341
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,440
This time,

342
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,800
don't get me a lawyer.

343
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,560
You and your mom did a great job.

344
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:51,880
By the way,

345
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,000
Xianbing is a good man.

346
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:54,760
He's reliable.

347
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,800
Don't act like a boy.

348
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:57,920
like a boy.

349
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,200
Take care of her.

350
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,280
Don't work hard.

351
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,680
Protect yourself.

352
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,000
Do you hear me?

353
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:04,920
Yes.

354
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,240
Let's go.

355
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,840
Take care of your mom.

356
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,120
Okay.

357
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,200
Give it to me.

358
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,360
Sit there and take a rest.

359
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,080
Who is it again?

360
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:22,560
Coming.

361
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,200
Your takeout.

362
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:26,840
Thank you.

363
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,480
Enjoy your meal.

364
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,200
Bye.

365
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:31,360
Mom.

366
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,280
Come and eat.

367
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:44,840
When you're done,

368
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,120
I'll be on night shift tonight.

369
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,280
Lock the door yourself at home.

370
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,760
Get back to work. I'm fine.

371
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:57,960
Don't do this. Mom.

372
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:02,920
Here.

373
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,040
Eat, mom.

374
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,560
Hurry up and eat.

375
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:19,600
After dinner,

376
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,040
I'll go to work later.

377
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:21,600
I'll stay with you for a while.

378
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:22,680
It's okay.

379
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,600
Just do your work.

380
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:28,760
Eat.

381
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,360
Mom,

382
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,920
What kind of food do you like?

383
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,760
I'm fine with anything.

384
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,680
Eat

385
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,200
I have to go to work after eating.

386
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,240
Eat.

387
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:26,240
I wonder if your dad has eaten now.

388
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,080
Can you eat first?

389
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,120
Let's eat first, okay?

390
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,920
Zeng Li, don't do this.

391
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,240
Don't do this.

392
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:49,920
Eat up.

393
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,080
Eat.

394
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:12,760
Zhang Chi.

395
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:14,400
Director.

396
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,080
Have a seat.

397
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,760
You didn't go home after work.

398
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,640
Have a seat.

399
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,400
I have something to tell you.

400
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,080
Go ahead.

401
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,800
You've been here for a long time.

402
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:25,760
This morning,

403
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,400
our leaders had a meeting.

404
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,240
The permanent position has been decided.

405
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:30,400
Thank you.

406
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,960
You and Qi Tuo are divided into cars.

407
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,760
What's the schedule of the car team?

408
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,480
We'll be informed in the group chat.

409
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:38,480
Okay.

410
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,840
Go home early after work.

411
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,400
I'm leaving.

412
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,080
Aren't you on duty?

413
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,200
I'm going to...

414
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,360
I have something to do.

415
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,920
I'm back to pack my stuff.

416
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,520
and stay with my mom for a while.

417
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:52,240
Yes, you should spend more time with her.

418
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:58,680
Go on with your work.

419
00:28:59,080 --> 00:28:59,800
Qi Tuo

420
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:02,960
I...

421
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:07,920
looking for you.

422
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:11,520
What is it?

423
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:15,920
I'm sorry.

424
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:19,840
What?

425
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,800
Now I can prove that

426
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,600
committed suicide.

427
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,840
When I talked to Uncle Qi

428
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,200
and talking to you like that.

429
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,920
I was too impulsive.

430
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:38,920
I'm sorry.

431
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,120
I thought you were going to break up with me.

432
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,280
What are you talking about?

433
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,800
Don't be sorry.

434
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,720
It's okay. It's all over.

435
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:55,800
I understand.

436
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,880
I understand you very much, Zhang Chi.

437
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:00,880
Thank you.

438
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:05,480
I don't want this to affect us.

439
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:14,800
Go ahead.

440
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:15,600
Thank you.

441
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,240
Go.

442
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:19,600
Bye.

443
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:21,360
Yes.

444
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,040
That card

445
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,680
This card is my savings all these years.

446
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,720
and what my grandpa left me before he died.

447
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,800
Take it away. I don't want it.

448
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,440
Uncle Qi's matter will cost a lot of money.

449
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,360
It may not be enough.

450
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,480
Just take it.

451
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,800
I don't want this, Zhang Chi.

452
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,680
Don't be like this, JOJO.

453
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,880
I'm leaving. It's too late.

454
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:38,680
Sister Qi is here.

455
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,480
Why are you here?

456
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,120
Look at you.

457
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,000
I brought you some food.

458
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,560
Let's go buy supper.

459
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:44,360
Let's go together.

460
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,800
Do you want to eat supper?

461
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,800
Yes, you guys eat.

462
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,480
Let's go. Hurry up.

463
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,680
Listen to the phone.

464
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:50,680
Okay, I brought it.

465
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,120
You made it?

466
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,560
I bought it.

467
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,680
It reminds me of Dr. Zhang.

468
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,920
I'm penniless.

469
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,280
I'm afraid you can't afford supper.

470
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:02,800
Eat.

471
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,120
What are you thinking?

472
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,720
No matter how poor I am, I still have a house.

473
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,160
and I don't have a loan.

474
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,280
Have some water.

475
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,680
Yes, stop drinking.

476
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,600
This is tea. I can't sleep after drinking it.

477
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,160
Eat it when you're hungry.

478
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,680
Are you hungry? Have some.

479
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,480
I've eaten.

480
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:23,000
My mom, do you like

481
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:23,880
you sent her today?

482
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,040
No.

483
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:25,720
Why?

484
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,120
You took the aluminum box

485
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,480
she put it in the microwave.

486
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,880
She almost blew up the kitchen.

487
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,560
It's my fault

488
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,360
I should have taken that plastic box

489
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,120
that can be heated in the microwave.

490
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,120
Why are you blaming me?

491
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,040
You're not young anymore.

492
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,560
She can't even handle her own meals

493
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,360
Uncle Qi has been taking care of her all these years

494
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,720
I guess she's not used to it

495
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,440
See? I'm leaving after seeing you off.

496
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,360
Take a rest if you're sleepy.

497
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,920
Okay, go to bed early.

498
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,040
I'm leaving.

499
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,120
Take care.

500
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:08,480
Wait.

501
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,480
Thank you, Xianbing.

502
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,560
Thank you, Qi.

503
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,120
I'm leaving.

504
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:32,920
Be careful.

505
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:21,560
Hello.

506
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,679
Hello, is this Mr. Zhang Chi?

507
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:24,600
Yes.

508
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:25,719
Who are you?

509
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,600
I'm from Falia Heart Research Center.

510
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,800
We're very interested in

511
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:31,800
the cardiac surgery project you're working on.

512
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,000
After our internal consideration,

513
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,880
we sincerely invite you

514
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,040
I hope you can work here.

515
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:39,679
Thank you.

516
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,719
But I replied to your email before.

517
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,239
I can't go.

518
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,040
We heard about your hand.

519
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,040
I feel sorry for you.

520
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:50,800
But your assignment

521
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,679
is very meaningful

522
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,120
to our Heart Research Center.

523
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,800
We still want to fight for a chance to work with you.

524
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,560
If you stay in the emergency center with your skills,

525
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,120
It's a waste of talent.

526
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,240
You don't have to give us an answer now.

527
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,360
Please think about it.

528
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,280
We'll contact you in a few days.

529
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,280
Okay, thank you.

530
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,000
AIGO

531
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,320
0104577.

532
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:01,560
Water.

533
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:02,920
Life.

534
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,240
If it doesn't work, you can stay in the emergency center.

535
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,280
I can make you shine.

536
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,480
I still have a distance

537
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,600
a mature ER doctor.

538
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,240
I'll keep trying.

539
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,360
Thank you.

540
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,440
What brings you here today?

541
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:50,680
Is it about work

542
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,720
or Chi's?

543
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:54,920
Today,

544
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,040
to bother you today.

545
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,720
Actually, I want to

546
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,800
to verify something with you.

547
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:03,040
About Aunt Qin's suicide,

548
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:06,160
Are you hiding something from me?

549
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:09,680
You...

550
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,920
Why do you think so?

551
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,280
Last time when Zhang Chi came,

552
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,680
when Zhang Chi came.

553
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,680
He may take your silence

554
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,280
your silence.

555
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,120
But in my opinion,

556
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,360
you couldn't tell me

557
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,720
that you can't say?

558
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,360
No.

559
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,120
I'm not hiding anything.

560
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,120
You think too much.

561
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:34,920
Have some tea.

562
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:42,560
Uncle Zhang.

563
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,560
I was the little girl in the car

564
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,680
I was the little girl in the car.

565
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,880
You carried me out of the car.

566
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:08,120
So this is not only related to Zhang Chi,

567
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,360
but also me.

568
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,280
Qi.

569
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,360
what happened back then

570
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,520
is the matter of our previous generation.

571
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,000
It has nothing to do with you.

572
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:26,280
And

573
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,640
And I never blamed your dad.

574
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,400
Thank you, Uncle Zhang.

575
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:41,280
I know Zhang Chi has always treated you as his target.

576
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:44,640
I think your father-son relationship

577
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,520
has something to do with this.

578
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,000
Now everyone tells him

579
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,400
Aunt Qin committed suicide.

580
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,280
It's hard for him to accept this.

581
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,160
Qi,

582
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,520
I have nothing to say

583
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,240
about Aunt Qin.

584
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:10,800
Uncle Zhang.

585
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,880
I'm actually selfish.

586
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,160
I love Zhang Chi very much.

587
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,920
I think he is a broad-minded person.

588
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,640
After he found out my dad was a hit-and-run,

589
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,120
he didn't want to leave me,

590
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,360
but also helped me a lot.

591
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,160
So I was thinking

592
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,880
it's time for you and your son

593
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,880
to forgive each other?

594
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:41,520
If you miss so much time

595
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,760
because of a misunderstanding,

596
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,520
What a pity.

597
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,800
I feel sorry for you.

598
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,760
Me too.

599
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,000
If this matter

600
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,480
is like a stone,

601
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,480
in his heart,

602
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,480
he will be very sad in his life.

603
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,160
Since young,

604
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,400
Mrs. Qin as his role model.

605
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,880
I want to be an excellent cardiac surgeon.

606
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:14,040
Although he was assigned to our emergency center,

607
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,760
I won't hinder him from becoming

608
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,480
an excellent emergency doctor.

609
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,760
But I really hope

610
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,680
no matter

611
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,400
or in our emergency center,

612
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,400
out of love.

613
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,000
not shackles.

614
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:33,920
But Chi

615
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,160
is not suitable for cardiothoracic surgery.

616
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,400
The ER suits him better.

617
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:39,920
You can't say that.

618
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,280
I think he should choose for himself.

619
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,640
We have to respect him.

620
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,520
If he continues to stay in Cardio Surgery,

621
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,760
I'm really worried that one day

622
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,400
he will be like his mother.

623
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,640
What do you mean?

624
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:05,280
Zhang Chi, these are great.

625
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:06,760
It's marked clearly.

626
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,000
I can understand it.

627
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:08,880
That's good.

628
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,400
I was afraid you wouldn't understand.

629
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,880
You're the food I brought.

630
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,760
Just heat it in the microwave.

631
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,800
I'm sorry.

632
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,480
I'm so useless.

633
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,760
Sorry for the trouble.

634
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,000
No, aunt.

635
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:25,360
If Qiqi and I weren't working in a special way,

636
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,400
Otherwise,

637
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:29,000
I don't think you should enter the kitchen for the rest of your life.

638
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,360
I have another favor to ask you.

639
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:34,520
Go ahead.

640
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,640
Teach me how to cook.

641
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:37,400
No need.

642
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,760
Aunt, I've done it every day.

643
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:39,920
Just heat it up.

644
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,160
That's too troublesome.

645
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,280
It's a long way.

646
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:43,760
Teach me how to do it.

647
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,480
Let's start today.

648
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:46,760
The dish you sent

649
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:47,760
is called

650
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,160
Sweet and sour ribs.

651
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:51,760
This...

652
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,520
Let's make this. Qiqi likes it.

653
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,240
Qiqi likes chicken drumsticks

654
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,600
and braised pork?

655
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,760
That's because it's cooked outside

656
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,400
It's not as delicious as the ones cooked at home.

657
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:02,880
Okay.

658
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:04,240
Do we have ribs at home?

659
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:04,600
Yes.

660
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:05,520
Come on.

661
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:06,520
The first column.

662
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:10,880
Auntie

663
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,160
The ribs are a little cold.

664
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,280
Let me tell you.

665
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,400
Auntie, the frozen meat

666
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:16,160
The first step

667
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,800
you have to put it in this warm water.

668
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:18,640
and thaw it.

669
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,000
It might take 40 minutes.

670
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,280
to an hour.

671
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:28,680
Sorry to bother you today, Uncle Zhang.

672
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:29,840
I'll go back first.

673
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:30,920
Qi.

674
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,040
Wait.

675
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:50,400
Give this to Chi.

676
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,560
He will understand after reading it.

677
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:58,440
Okay.

678
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:01,160
