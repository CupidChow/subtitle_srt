1
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:06,040
National Radio. and Telvison. Administration.

2
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:36,360
Jiaqi.

3
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,920
I'm here. I'm here.

4
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,840
I didn't see you. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here.

5
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,920
I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here.

6
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,320
I saw you were busy.

7
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,759
I was really busy today.

8
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,759
I didn't see you.

9
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,240
Wait for me.

10
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,680
Let's eat something nice tonight.

11
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,039
No. You're too busy to eat.

12
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,440
I'm leaving. Send me a message.

13
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,720
I'm really mad at Zheng Bo.

14
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,440
I wonder if he found out.

15
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,800
He didn't call me after I left.

16
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,800
or texted me.

17
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,960
I don't know what it means.

18
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,240
He's a straight man.

19
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,120
He treats you like this.

20
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,320
and to other women.

21
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,360
So don't worry.

22
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,720
Senior.

23
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,880
I want to be different from other girls.

24
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,160
I have to be a special one.

25
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,200
Can you understand?

26
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,680
I don't know.

27
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,880
What should we do then?

28
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,640
I'm speechless.

29
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,680
Did you lead your department?

30
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,640
Steel.

31
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,040
Who is?

32
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,360
We're all soft.

33
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,400
Come on.

34
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,120
Oh my god.

35
00:02:59,120 --> 00:02:59,840
It broke again.

36
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,360
It's okay.

37
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,640
I can change the rope this time.

38
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,840
It's hard to find here.

39
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:06,560
Wait a minute.

40
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,600
What else? Another red one.

41
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:11,640
Is it all?

42
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,560
Yes.

43
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,440
All here.

44
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,160
Senior.

45
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,160
Let bygones be bygones.

46
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,800
I believe my sister never resented you.

47
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,160
I didn't dare to come here before.

48
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,920
I'm not afraid anymore.

49
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,160
You asked me to come here.

50
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,680
I'm here too.

51
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,400
Look forward.

52
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,840
By the way, how are things going between you and Dr Zhang?

53
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,840
They're frozen.

54
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,200
I can't do it.

55
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,080
You're still stiff.

56
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,120
Aren't you both too rational?

57
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,640
How can I be rational?

58
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,959
How are you?

59
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:18,880
Let me tell you.

60
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,720
When you're in love, you need someone to move forward.

61
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:21,959
Take the initiative.

62
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,160
It's not about being passive.

63
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,400
He hasn't figured it out yet.

64
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,560
He's confused.

65
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,240
You haven't thought it through, have you?

66
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:29,840
No.

67
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,680
It's useless to think it through alone.

68
00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:37,680
I don't know if I've thought it through.

69
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,440
I heard that your department

70
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,960
Zhang Chi and Chen Xue

71
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,520
One is going to Gansu.

72
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,320
You're so smart.

73
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,480
What did you say?

74
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,440
Are you going?

75
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,159
I've decided.

76
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,400
Qi Tuo

77
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,680
Come in.

78
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,040
Did you drink?

79
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,600
I drank a little with Kiki.

80
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:36,159
I'll get you some honey water.

81
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,120
No.

82
00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:38,360
I'll leave after a few words.

83
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,640
I've decided to go to Gansu for an exchange.

84
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,440
You're going?

85
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,400
I'm here to tell you

86
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,720
about us.

87
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,200
I've thought it through.

88
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,720
Go wherever you want to study.

89
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,160
I'll stop being pretentious.

90
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,320
Qi Tuo

91
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:09,880
I...

92
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,600
I was about to tell you this.

93
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,040
I'm not going abroad.

94
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,160
I'm not going to the research center.

95
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,640
I've decided to stay at the emergency center.

96
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,640
You're not going?

97
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,360
You wanted to go for a drink last time.

98
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,640
You're afraid I'll be unhappy and you won't go again.

99
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,640
Don't be like that, Zhang Chi.

100
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,080
Don't do anything that kid did.

101
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,960
Be mature, okay?

102
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:48,920
You have to be responsible for what you said.

103
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,800
Do you know what you want?

104
00:06:57,159 --> 00:06:59,360
Don't give up

105
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,400
just because you don't want me to be upset.

106
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,640
I won't give up what I want because of you.

107
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,560
I'm done.

108
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:06,680
Hello? Hello?

109
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:07,880
Secretary.

110
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,920
I've decided.

111
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,880
to go to Gansu for a month.

112
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,360
Great.

113
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,400
Then I'll officially report to the organization.

114
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,800
You should get ready too.

115
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:17,720
Okay.

116
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:18,520
Okay.

117
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,360
Senior.

118
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,240
You're finally here.

119
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,880
Are you asking me to help you move?

120
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,600
I have to purify my soul.

121
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,440
I want to break up.

122
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,559
You're giving your soul trouble.

123
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,679
Throw these things away.

124
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:41,440
Donate

125
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,240
Come on, help me get it to the door.

126
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:43,600
Let me do it.

127
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,920
It's quite heavy.

128
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,080
What are these? Let me see.

129
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,240
Books.

130
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:08,840
Look at this.

131
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,520
If my sister were still alive,

132
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,320
she would study medicine too.

133
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,880
In front of your hospital?

134
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,600
in front of your hospital?

135
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,760
We have to be in front of the yard.

136
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,800
These aren't the only things that should be broken.

137
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,760
It's time to take it off.

138
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:52,920
Jiayi.

139
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,920
I need to go somewhere far.

140
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,920
I might not be able to visit you for a while.

141
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,000
Let me tell you.

142
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,800
I always think

143
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,200
Zhang Chi is the right person.

144
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,480
I came to show off to you.

145
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,360
Look now.

146
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,200
Obviously not.

147
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:23,920
But it's okay.

148
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,360
I've grown up.

149
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,080
I can digest it.

150
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,080
Jiayi.

151
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,120
I came here

152
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,920
to tell you something.

153
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,200
I feel quite upset.

154
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,080
I always feel that

155
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,000
you would resent me.

156
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,880
Today I think

157
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,720
it's me.

158
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,360
I blame myself.

159
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,520
I don't want to do this anymore.

160
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,040
This?

161
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,000
I'll take it off.

162
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,720
I'll put it here.

163
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,640
Don't forget me.

164
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,520
Sun Jiayi.

165
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,160
Thank you.

166
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,560
Bye.

167
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,440
Who is it?

168
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,160
Coming.

169
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,400
Who is it?

170
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,640
Chi.

171
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,160
Come on in.

172
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,160
I want to eat earlobes

173
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,320
Did you buy it today

174
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,280
Yes.

175
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,720
It's very fresh today.

176
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,640
Sit here and eat some fruits.

177
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,640
I'll make it for you.

178
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,440
Is this earlobes fresh today?

179
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,320
Eat more.

180
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:48,840
What's wrong?

181
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,160
Is something bothering you?

182
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,720
It's about work.

183
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,320
It's about work.

184
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,320
Tell me if you need anything.

185
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,280
After all, I've been doing first aid all my life.

186
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,040
I can always give you some good advice.

187
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,600
It's about work.

188
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,720
or work.

189
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,040
It's you and Qi Qi.

190
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,720
What's wrong with you two?

191
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,600
She's going to Gansu tomorrow morning.

192
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,000
She'll study for a month.

193
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,040
One month?

194
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,840
You should accompany her tonight.

195
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,840
It's quite sudden.

196
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,600
She accompanied her mother today.

197
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,040
I don't understand

198
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:53,920
I don't understand.

199
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,040
But your mom and I

200
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,280
I felt that

201
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,520
you should

202
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,280
communicate more.

203
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,600
If you need anything,

204
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,920
don't keep it to yourself.

205
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,160
Say it out.

206
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,080
The most taboo

207
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,400
is to let them guess.

208
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,160
Chi, make it yourself if you want tea.

209
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,160
Shu Hua.

210
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,480
Chi grew up fast after you left.

211
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,240
It's over 17m.

212
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:51,760
Today,

213
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,080
I bought him a blue tracksuit.

214
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,720
You said he looks good in blue.

215
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,560
Shu Hua.

216
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,280
I have good news for you.

217
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,200
Chi got the highest mark

218
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,440
in Jiangdong High School.

219
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,520
His grades are better than yours.

220
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:10,800
Chi has always been the top student in school.

221
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,920
I heard he won an award recently.

222
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:14,800
I'm really happy for him.

223
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,599
Chi.

224
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:19,160
89 points. But it's hot.

225
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,800
Chi represented the school

226
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,599
on behalf of the school.

227
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,520
He's great.

228
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:28,000
That's our kid.

229
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,760
If you were here,

230
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,280
you would be proud of him.

231
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,480
Shu Hua.

232
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,160
I saw a girl on my way out today.

233
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,960
She looks like Chi.

234
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,040
So cute.

235
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,760
You'll like it when you see it.

236
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:48,400
Chi has grown up and doesn't smile much.

237
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,200
It's a pity.

238
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:53,680
Shu Hua.

239
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,720
Chi got into the Joint Clinical Department.

240
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,200
That's his first choice.

241
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,680
Chi will become

242
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,320
as excellent as you.

243
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,840
Shu Hua.

244
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,240
I wish you were here.

245
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,240
Maybe

246
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,360
you can continue to tutor him.

247
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:41,800
It's okay.

248
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,360
It's okay I'm holding it

249
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,480
Excuse me

250
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,600
Excuse me

251
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:34,840
Slow down.

252
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,480
Dr. Zhang, there's no bed in the ER.

253
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,280
Need to be pressed.

254
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:43,960
No problem.

255
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,360
Come on, family members, step back.

256
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,480
You may leave.

257
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:47,840
Okay.

258
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,480
I'll wait here.

259
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,240
Why is the patient's blood oxygen...

260
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,320
75 percent.

261
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,320
Zhang, come here.

262
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:13,800
Intubation.

263
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,960
The patient's blood oxygen is back to 90.

264
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,840
When the patient's blood oxygen stabilizes,

265
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:45,720
take her to the CT scan.

266
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,160
Okay.

267
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,240
Don't worry.

268
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,000
Let's do a CT scan later. CT scan.

269
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:49,800
Check it.

270
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,600
Slow down.

271
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:55,480
Let's go.

272
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:57,480
Be careful.

273
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,800
Don't follow her.

274
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,960
Go through the procedures first.

275
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,320
Zhang.

276
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,240
Take him in.

277
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:34,720
Okay.

278
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,480
Doctor, how is the test result?

279
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,320
The patient has been examined.

280
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,800
and the brain doctor has diagnosed him.

281
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,680
I'll tell you now.

282
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,800
The patient's brain stem is bleeding a lot.

283
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,800
Even if the surgery went well,

284
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:50,960
if the surgery goes well,

285
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,720
he can't be completely sober.

286
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,400
The best result is paralyzed in bed.

287
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,400
He's unconscious.

288
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,920
You mean

289
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,160
Lifang is going to lie on the bed

290
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,920
and lie in bed forever.

291
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,920
Can I go in and have a look?

292
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,960
Okay, I'll take you in.

293
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:36,600
Lifang.

294
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,680
You've suffered.

295
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,720
I know you've suffered.

296
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,440
We...

297
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,200
not suffer anymore.

298
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,800
Not anymore.

299
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,320
Doctor,

300
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,200
I've decided

301
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,320
give up the treatment.

302
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:03,960
Are you sure?

303
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,960
Yes.

304
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,160
With the consent of the family,

305
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,320
we decided to give up

306
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,600
for emergency treatment.

307
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,160
into a general ward.

308
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,280
The family can accompany

309
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,400
or avoid it.

310
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,320
I'll stay here with her.

311
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,160
Lifang.

312
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,600
The needle is gone.

313
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,920
The needle is gone too.

314
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,560
You won't suffer anymore.

315
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:49,200
You were afraid of pain when you were young.

316
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,080
Even a mosquito bites

317
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,320
even a mosquito bites.

318
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,800
All these years,

319
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,200
you still act like a little girl.

320
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,320
You told me before

321
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,440
when you leave,

322
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,200
I'll donate all the useful organs.

323
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,320
I said

324
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,480
Me too.

325
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,320
Let's donate.

326
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:22,560
How about this?

327
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,560
It seems that

328
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,200
still together.

329
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:52,800
Spring is clear and clear

330
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:59,560
I'll make a bamboo hat for you.

331
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:20,440
Lifang. Lifang.

332
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:22,840
Lifang.

333
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,280
We're almost there, right?

334
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:51,840
Almost there.

335
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,080
Two or three minutes.

336
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:12,320
Here.

337
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,200
Okay, thank you.

338
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,040
You're welcome.

339
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,200
Who is it?

340
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,200
Who?

341
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:08,920
Dr. Qi.

342
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:11,040
I brought you some fruits.

343
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,080
Thank you, Dr. Zhou.

344
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,320
Thank you.

345
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:40,679
Qi Tuo

346
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,480
I got a temporary mission this afternoon.

347
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,679
so I couldn't see you off.

348
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:48,199
Are you in Gansu?

349
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,480
Your phone was turned off when I called.

350
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,679
I was worried about you.

351
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:13,600
Lunch.

352
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,520
Don't give it to her.

353
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,040
She'll choke later.

354
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,760
I've eaten the third one.

355
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:53,200
Chi.

356
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:54,360
Someone is looking for you.

357
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,200
Dr Zhang.

358
00:37:59,040 --> 00:37:59,720
You again?

359
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:01,560
Didn't I tell you last time?

360
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:02,960
Who is it?

361
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,320
This is the man

362
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,040
who married Zhang Chi with his household register.

363
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,960
Really? Again?

364
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,240
Qi Tuo just left.

365
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,960
Now Qi Tuo and Zhang Chi

366
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:14,240
The relationship is really deep

367
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:15,720
Stop arguing.

368
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,040
Listen to me.

369
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,560
I'm not here to marry you.

370
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,440
I'm here to thank you.

371
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,600
You saved my life last time. Thank you.

372
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:25,960
It's my duty.

373
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,600
This is a silk banner for you.

374
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:30,800
And a banner.

375
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:34,080
I'll accept it on behalf of our center.

376
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:34,960
Thank you.

377
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,440
Sorry for the trouble.

378
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,200
Sorry.

379
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:39,600
It's okay.

380
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,200
Well,

381
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,200
Who is Huang Hao?

382
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,440
Where is Huang?

383
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,800

00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,560
I'm not an unreasonable girl.

402
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:52,840
But before I passed out,

403
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:55,080
I remember his face.

404
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,320
That's why I relied on him psychologically.

405
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,080
But he already told me.

406
00:39:59,160 --> 00:39:59,840
It's okay.

407
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,560
I explained it clearly.

408
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,080

409
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,840

410
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:06,440

in such a critical situation.

413
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,560
to avoid me being unconscious,

414
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,360
so I brought trouble to you and Dr Zhang.

415
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:17,600

416
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,440
Anyone would do that.

417
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,480
Saving the dead and helping the wounded. Love is infinite.

418
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:24,440
So,

419
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,680
do you have a girlfriend?

420
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,440
It's good if you don't have a girlfriend to marry me.

421
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:37,160
No, I...

422
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:37,800
Look at you.

423
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,320
I'm just kidding.

424
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,040
It's not the ancient times.

425
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,200
You saved me.

426
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,560
I have to marry you.

427
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,200
Although you saved me that day,

428
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,320
I don't remember you.

429
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,440
But I still want to thank you.

430
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:49,960
From now on,

431
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,560
I'll remember you.

432
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,080
But I can't marry you.

433
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,160
I won't marry you either.

434
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:57,920
It's okay.

435
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,920
Okay, it's good that you've made it clear.

436
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:02,720
I'm leaving.

437
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,160

Go away.

450
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,240
Don't do that.

451
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,840
He's here to thank me.

452
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:45,840
I don't mean anything else.

453
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,840
Besides, I don't like spring breeze.
