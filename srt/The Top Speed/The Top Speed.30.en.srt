1
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:06,040
You need to be careful. You need to be careful. You need to be careful. You need to be careful. You need to be careful. You need to be careful. You need to be careful.

2
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,640
Your knee is badly injured.

3
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,640
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

4
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:49,520
I thought

5
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,920
I could hold on.

6
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,160
Like this. Like this.

7
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:57,240
But today,

8
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,920
seeing her like that in Happy Wife's ward,

9
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,040
I feel bad.

10
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,639
I have to resign, Zhang Chi.

11
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:12,920
I can't do it.

12
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,520
If my knees

13
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:27,680
in the future,

14
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,920
I can't accept it.

15
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,760
I just don't want to leave.

16
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,880
I did a good job in the past ten years.

17
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,000
They all praised me.

18
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,920
I quit.

19
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,240
I don't know what I can do.

20
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,320
I can do nothing.

21
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,800
I thought I could work until I got old.

22
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:27,280
I feel like a needle in my heart.

23
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,040
Where is Qi Tuo?

24
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,040
Aren't you two always together?

25
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,920
She's looking for Secretary Liu.

26
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,520
Is she going to get promoted again?

27
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,360
The promotion is a bit fast.

28
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,400
Qi Qi has done a lot in the past two years.

29
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,640
I think it’s normal to get promoted.

30
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,880
Qi Qi is getting promoted

31
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,320
I think so.

32
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,680
I'll kill her when she comes back.

33
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,920
Stop persuading me, Secretary Liu.

34
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,320
I thought about it all night.

35
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,760
I thought about it.

36
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,440
if my physical condition

37
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,800
in the future,

38
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,240
in the future,

39
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:35,400
I can't forgive myself.

40
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:39,560
With your current condition,

41
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,440
you're not allowed to be on the front line.

42
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:41,920
001006.

43
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,520
But there are many administrative tasks in the center.

44
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,520
You can do it.

45
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,520
Which department do you want to go to?

46
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,200
Tell me.

47
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,000
The frontline is where I worked for a long time.

48
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,840
It's my value.

49
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,800
001006

50
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,159
0010

51
00:04:59,320 --> 00:04:59,760
How about this?

52
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,280
let me think about it.

53
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,840
If you leave,

54
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,040
it'll be a huge loss to our center.

55
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:11,800
Hello?

56
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,320
Yes.

57
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,400
Okay.

58
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,880
Someone from Roping Village.

59
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,800
Come with me to meet him.

60
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:24,920
OK.

61
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,240
They're here.

62
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:32,560
Dr Zhang.

63
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,560
Hello.

64
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,360
I'm Liu Zhi Gang, the secretary of the emergency center.

65
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,840
Hello, Secretary Liu.

66
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:37,760
Hello. Hello.

67
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,280
Hello, Dr Qi and Dr Zhang.

68
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:39,800
Hello.

69
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,600
Last time at the mudslide,

70
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,159
Luckily you came in time.

71
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,560
our village was safe.

72
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
The house is fixed.

73
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,760
The fields are running.

74
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,800
Everything is fine now.

75
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,360
Great.

76
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,080
Thank you so much.

77
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,040
Yes.

78
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,560
Everyone says

79
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,400
to thank you.

80
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,360
So he sent the three of us

81
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,360
to represent them.

82
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:03,680
Brocade banner.

83
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,080
Here.

84
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,360
Thank you.

85
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,280
This is what we should do.

86
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,080
We came here this time

87
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,680
When the villagers found out,

88
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,600
they prepared a lot of agricultural products.

89
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,040
Look at a big bag.

90
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,520
Please don't mind.

91
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,320
Thank you.

92
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,680
This is what we should do.

93
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,120
Take it.

94
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,560
Please don't laugh at me.

95
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,080
How about this?

96
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,760
on behalf of

97
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,680
on behalf of

98
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,600
Thank you.

99
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:30,760
Take it.

100
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,240
It's a gift from everyone.

101
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,440
Yes.

102
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,360
I heard that

103
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,840
I heard you sacrificed a comrade.

104
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,120
What a pity.

105
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,080
What's his name?

106
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,880
Such an excellent comrade should be remembered.

107
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,080
We're going to worship him later.

108
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,360
He saved our village.

109
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,159
By the way,

110
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,800
our village has studied

111
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,280
to set a memorial tablet

112
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,800
in the ancestral hall in our village.

113
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,240
It was comrade Cha Ming who sacrificed himself.

114
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,560
As an ambulance,

115
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,280
I work for the people until the last moment of my life.

116
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,080
you can remember him.

117
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,280
Thank you very much.

118
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,160
Dr. Qi, I remember you.

119
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,600
you hurt your knees to save me.

120
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,400
You're my second parent.

121
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,080
Don't be like that. I'm fine. I'm much better.

122
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,320
I went up the mountain every day after I was discharged.

123
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,880
I asked someone to ask some secret remedies.

124
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,080
I hope it's useful to you.

125
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,040
Take it.

126
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,080
Okay, I'll try.

127
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:36,840
Thank you.

128
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,760
You're welcome, Dr. Qi.

129
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,600
Since you're here, it's lunchtime.

130
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,600
Let's eat together in our canteen

131
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,600
It's okay. Go ahead.

132
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,080
Go on with your work. We're leaving.

133
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,000
We're leaving.

134
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,560
Thank you.

135
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,440
Thank you

136
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,320
Thank you, Secretary

137
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,080
Thank you

138
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:51,440
Thank you.

139
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,040
Bye.

140
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:53,600
Okay.

141
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,280
0104577.

142
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,080
Hello, Qiqi.

143
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:17,760
Hello, mom.

144
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,240
Are you asleep?

145
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,120
No.

146
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,080
You didn't sleep at this hour?

147
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,560
Nothing.

148
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,320
I just miss you OMEONE

149
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,680
I'm happy to hear that

150
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,560
I have something to tell you.

151
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,320
By the way,

152
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:35,760
I went to see your dad yesterday.

153
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,200
I went to see your dad yesterday.

154
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:36,720
I went to see your dad yesterday.

155
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,160
I went to see your dad yesterday.

156
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,080
He kept asking you.

157
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,600
Is my dad doing well?

158
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,560
He's okay.

159
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,360
He has a bad temper and a loud voice.

160
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:47,880
Okay.

161
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,600
I'll take a few days off to visit him.

162
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,160
However,

163
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,760
your dad told me

164
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,600
I was angry with you

165
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,800
because of your work.

166
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,240
and even went to your company.

167
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,840
He felt embarrassed

168
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,640
He asked me to apologize to you.

169
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,000
Let me think.

170
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,840
Luckily you didn't go.

171
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,600
If you went yesterday,

172
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,800
your dad would be so proud.

173
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,080
in front of you,

174
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,160
in front of you.

175
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,000
But Qiqi,

176
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,160
listen to me.

177
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,520
You've grown up.

178
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,280
You have to understand your parents.

179
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,080
It's for your own good.

180
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,080
Now, Zhang Chi is by your side.

181
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,800
He can protect you.

182
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,680
we feel much relieved.

183
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,240
and we can be at ease.

184
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:43,920
You

185
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:48,080
Just do what you like

186
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,280
We support you SOMEONE

187
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,160
Nothing else

188
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,720
Go to bed early.

189
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,160
Go to bed early, EONE.

190
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,360
Call me if you want to eat anything.

191
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,680
I’m hanging up, mom.

192
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:54,800
Mr. Dai.

193
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,920
I’ve thought it through.

194
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,560
I've decided to stay in the emergency center.

195
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,080
Thank you.

196
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,440
Mom.

197
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,920
I'm here to see you.

198
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,040
My dad is fine.

199
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,560
Don't worry.

200
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,120
I will take good care of him.

201
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,680
Also,

202
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,400
I always treated you

203
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,440
as my role model.

204
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,920
I work hard to become an excellent cardiac surgeon

205
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,680
to cure more complicated diseases.

206
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,080
But...

207
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,000
I broke my promise.

208
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,760
I decided to stay at the emergency center.

209
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,000
Although the work here is different from before,

210
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,960
we can continue to save people.

211
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:00,600
And

212
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,840
with a group of people I love.

213
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,280
I hope

214
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,960
you can bless me.

215
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,120
And most importantly,

216
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,720
the girl I told you last time

217
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,000
is Qi Tuo.

218
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,440
We're getting married.

219
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,640
She is

220
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:27,240
kind, cute and ambitious girl.

221
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,800
I love her so much.

222
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,640
Please bless us.

223
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,480
Chi.

224
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,200
Chi.

225
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,640
Beihai.

226
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,920
Where are they?

227
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,240
Chi.

228
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:56,760
Chi.

229
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,960
Surprise!

230
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,960
What are you doing?

231
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,880
Mom, happy wedding anniversary.

232
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,640
I'm so busy.

233
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,400
How could I forget this day?

234
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,320
Thank you, Chi.

235
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,560
You're so thoughtful.

236
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,600
The kid is here.

237
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,760
I'll go wash my hands.

238
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,200
Okay.

239
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,040
Where's Chi?

240
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,200
I was waiting for you, so I ate first.

241
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:42,480
Sit.

242
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,480
You know what?

243
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,960
I really like to see you wearing a white coat.

244
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,680
Oh, right.

245
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:53,960
What?

246
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,160
Here.

247
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:00,800
This is

248
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,040
You bought it?

249
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:06,800
Let me tell you.

250
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,600
I went to the emergency room

251
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,160
I passed by the next town.

252
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,120
I saw a piece of clothes hanging on the counter.

253
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,960
I thought it was perfect for you.

254
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:14,960
Wait for me.

255
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:15,760
The door is closed.

256
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,760
I've been riding for more than half an hour.

257
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,760
I found it again.

258
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,440
Is it pretty?

259
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,320
Yes.

260
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,600
When I first saw this dress,

261
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,240
I thought

262
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,960
it's custom-made for you.

263
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,600
Just like when I first saw you,

264
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,280
Beihai

265
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,400
This dress

266
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,680
is the most beautiful dress I think.

267
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,560
Thank you.

268
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,880
I'm glad you like it.

269
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,160
Yes.

270
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,520
Hello, Jiaqi.

271
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,440
Uncle, happy 60th birthday.

272
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,760
Wish you good health and good luck.

273
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,440
My niece is the best.

274
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,720
Still thinking about your birthday.

275
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:02,880
Thank you.

276
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,800
Unfortunately, I have something to do tonight.

277
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,560
I can't go back.

278
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,520
Otherwise, I would have a drink with you.

279
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:10,119
At my age,

280
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,280
I don't care if it's my birthday or not.

281
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:15,680
As long as you young people have fun.

282
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,599
I'll make it up for you when I get back.

283
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,160
Love you.

284
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,400
Okay, thank you.

285
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,040
Bye, uncle.

286
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:37,680
Who are you?

287
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,520
Your takeout.

288
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,880
I didn't order takeout.

289
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,600
Are you Mr. Sun Yitouch?

290
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,120
Yes.

291
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,160
That's right.

292
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,080
Yimo, it's your birthday today.

293
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:16,720
This is for you.

294
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,360
Take a break, your eyes.

295
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,120
Drink some water.

296
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,000
Thank you, darling.

297
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,920
No audience.

298
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,360
Don't watch it at home.

299
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,600
Who should I show it to?

300
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,440
I'm improving my own business.

301
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:56,760
Our Xianbing.

302
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,360
Are you tired, Xianbing?

303
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,600
You're being nice.

304
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,240
Is something wrong?

305
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,040
No.

306
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:10,920
What do you have? Tell me.

307
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,000
I really didn't.

308
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,720
I promise you if you don't break the rules.

309
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,680
Do you miss the time when we were in the same car?

310
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,360
I do.

311
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,680
I didn't like this job

312
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,000
I didn't like this job.

313
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,680
until you slowly fall in love.

314
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,120
as an emergency doctor.

315
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:33,800
What else?

316
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,360
And most importantly,

317
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,680
I fell in love with you again.

318
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,560
Look.

319
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,120
I opened your eyes to find beauty.

320
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:41,680
right?

321
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,560
Yes, you are beautiful.

322
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,440
Do you want to ride with me?

323
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,120
Your car.

324
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,800
I thought about it today.

325
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,880
I think being an ambulance driver is cool.

326
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,280
Who?

327
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,280
Don't care who will be the driver.

328
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,920
Look, being an ambulance driver

329
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,040
It's very good to drive.

330
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,000
It's a wind-riding switch.

331
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,160
And I feel very accomplished.

332
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,040
I can be on the front line.

333
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,440
I sit in the car every day.

334
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,360
I know that feeling.

335
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,280
Who will be the ambulance driver?

336
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:11,480
Me.

337
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,440
Are you crazy?

338
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,480
An ambulance driver has to be a stretcher.

339
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,800
You have to kneel every day.

340
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,360
No I don't squat

341
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,240
Not many squats a day.

342
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,240
The point is if I ride with you,

343
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,600
you can squat for me. You can squat a few more times.

344
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,920
No, we can ride the same car.

345
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,120
I can even squat.

346
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,600
We opened the emergency center.

347
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,480
Why is this...

348
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,880
You said you were the driver

349
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,720
as a driver.

350
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,600
Calm down.

351
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,680
I'm not ready.

352
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,360
I'll go to training for three months. I'll get a certificate.

353
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,360
What are you training for?

354
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:39,920
In our center,

355
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,120
No ambulance driver is a female driver.

356
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,800
Why can't I be the first female driver?

357
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,600
What's wrong with a female driver?

358
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,880
Is she smaller than you?

359
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,600
I want to go, Zhang Chi.

360
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,440
I keep my opinion.

361
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,680
So you didn't oppose it, right?

362
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,240
I...

363
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,040
Just keep your opinion.

364
00:21:59,120 --> 00:21:59,600
Keep it.

365
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,320
I...

366
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,200
I can't do anything to you.

367
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,440
Love you.

368
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,080
I'll tell Mr. Liu tomorrow.

369
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,200
Does it hurt?

370
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,200
No, my toothache is not my leg.

371
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:19,440
I'm telling you, it's lucky that your left leg and left knee are injured.

372
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,200
You can't even step on the brake.

373
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:30,520
Zhi Gang.

374
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,080
Let's start.

375
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,120
Okay, start.

376
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:33,640
Ready. Ready. Ready.

377
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:35,960
This time,

378
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,600
the activity of caring and saving lives

379
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,080
to combine online and offline.

380
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:41,720
The purpose is

381
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,000
is to spread medical knowledge to the citizens.

382
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,920
Of course. Register online.

383
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,600
The promotion and offline

384
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,280
are led by our centre

385
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,080
to make emergency medical knowledge known.

386
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:55,360
Our registration age is not limited.

387
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,600
Men and women can participate.

388
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,840
It'd be better if the teenagers are willing to come.

389
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:01,960
Let's start with the doll.

390
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,360
The content of learning

391
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,920
is for 10 minutes.

392
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,520
CPR and Helmlick Law.

393
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,800
Yes, only 30 hours.

394
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,960
and pass the assessment,

395
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,520
you can get the student certificate.

396
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,080
Not bad.

397
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,200
I think it's feasible.

398
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,480
I think

399
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,920
this kind of activity is meaningful.

400
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,960
But I still have an idea.

401
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,120
It won't be enough if we just do it once.

402
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,000
I suggest we do it for a long time.

403
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:29,920
No problem.

404
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,880
We must stick to it for a long time.

405
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,800
Yes.

406
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,640
I hope the leaders of the emergency center

407
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,400
please give us a big support.

408
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:40,960
What is it?

409
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,480
For this event,

410
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,320
Why did you say

411
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:47,880
Because we call 120.

412
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,360
OK. Attention.

413
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:14,000
When a patient appeared in our house,

414
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,080
the community stopped breathing

415
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,080
Without heartbeat,

416
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:20,240
It's time for CPR.

417
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,240
First,

418
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,960
Lie down. Okay.

419
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,360
Second,

420
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,520
you must clean

421
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:29,320
if there's something in his mouth,

422
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,240
or he can't breathe.

423
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,560
Next,

424
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,440
Pull out the patient's zipper.

425
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,160
Show the chest completely.

426
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:41,320
Then press the center of the two nipples

427
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,960
Press it with your palm.

428
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,280
Hello, Yimo.

429
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,840
I'm here. Where are you?

430
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,880
I'm here too. Where are you?

431
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:45,480
You're here too?

432
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,200
I didn't see you.

433
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,640
I didn't see you either.

434
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,200
Did you go the wrong way?

435
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,000
No, I followed the GPS.

436
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,360
How about this?

437
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,760
You can share the location

438
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:57,760
in WeChat.

439
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:58,480
I'm looking for you.

440
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,720
Share the location?

441
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:01,560
I don't know how to use it.

442
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:02,800
Listen to me.

443
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,200
This stubborn volunteer...

444
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,720
Sun Yimo,

445
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,880
Why are you here?

446
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,120
Volunteer.

447
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,640
You're ten minutes late.

448
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:30,760
Zhi...

449
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:31,760
Return my late!

450
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,600
They're locating the bridge.

451
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,560
Tell me it's at the bridge.

452
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,120
I told you to open a place to share.

453
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,560
You don't even know this?

454
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,880
You're an intellectual.

455
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,440
Enough, stop talking.

456
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,440
Move the things.

457
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,160
You carry that and I carry this.

458
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,320
Let's go.

459
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,480
That way.

460
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,280
This way.

461
00:26:59,320 --> 00:26:59,760
This way.

462
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:00,560
This way.

463
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,360
The middle is so beautiful.

464
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,320
Okay.

465
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,120
It's flat.

466
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,120
Keep it straight.

467
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,840
You need to stretch yourself too.

468
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:11,880
I'll just move this way.

469
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,360
It'll come again.

470
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,160
Put it on your head. Try it.

471
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:14,880
Slightly.

472
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:15,520
Three-colored cup 95Q=27 cups

473
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,880
Friends passing by

474
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,640
Listen to me.

475
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,360
Emergency knowledge is very important.

476
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,760
Learn to save people as soon as possible.

477
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:31,600
When you get food poisoning, you need to throw up first.

478
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,160
Strengthen the fracture.

479
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:38,000
It's hot. It's cold water.

480
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:41,280
Soy sauce toothpaste doesn't work.

481
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,840
Gas poisoning, open the window.

482
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:47,160
Don't panic.

483
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,280
I didn't expect you to be so rough.

484
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,360
This is quite smooth.

485
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,600
What are you talking about?

486
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:59,480
Expensive old furniture, old electrical appliances.

487
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,440
The refrigerator, the TV.

488
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,720
It's for old appliances.

489
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,560
How do we recycle it? How much?

490
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,640
We are

491
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:10,880
We are

492
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,400
Come on, dad.

493
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,400
Give it to me.

494
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,240
Let's go home.

495
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:41,640
Zhang Chi.

496
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:46,160
Thank you for your hard work.

497
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,280
Thank you.

498
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,440
Dad, isn't this what I should do?

499
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,800
Let's go home.

500
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:52,920
Let's go home.

501
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:53,800
Go home.

502
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,560
Are you okay?

503
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,160
I'm fine.

504
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,160
Medical equipment check.

505
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,040
We have sufficient ampule.

506
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,160
The signal is normal.

507
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,160
The defibrillator has enough power.

508
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,120
Time is accurate.

509
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,120
Pharmacy check.

510
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,280
Five dopamine.

511
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,280
Two dopamine.

512
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,160
Two ammonia tea pills.

513
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:33,880
The medicine is sufficient.

514
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:35,800
Car check.

515
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,000
The car's functional appearance is done.

516
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:46,760
No problem.

517
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,520
As a shareholder,

518
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,040
this is my first time here.

519
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,360
The corridor is narrow.

520
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,120
Can't we find a better place?

521
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,760
It's still narrow.

522
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,520
Then invest more. Get a bigger one.

523
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,640
It's not impossible.

524
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,440
I also heard that

525
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,640
this Yi Kang app

526
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,880
is trying to work with the City Health Commission.

527
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,480
If we can get

528
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,240
by the government,

529
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,840
more people will know.

530
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:35,880
Let me tell you.

531
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,400
People like us

532
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,000
with business quality

533
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,040
It's not easy

534
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,360
to get support from the government.

535
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,880
Because the City Health Commission said

536
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,760
a healthy app like ours

537
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,920
can benefit the people.

538
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,360
So as long as we

539
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,800
according to their requirements,

540
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,040
we can cooperate successfully.

541
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,920
Zheng Bo has been working hard because of this.

542
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,040
But why didn't he tell me anything?

543
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,320
What's the use of telling you?

544
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,440
He made you worry for nothing.

545
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,440
If he has time,

546
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,040
he might as well fix some loopholes himself.

547
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,160
Alright, give me the stuff.

548
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,280
Get tired of it.

549
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,040
You have to download Yi Kang first.

550
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:34,920
I'm getting off.

551
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:38,800
It's tiring to rush here.

552
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,880
Uncle, dad, have a seat.

553
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:41,800
Okay.

554
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,160
Everything is ready.

555
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,000
Yes.

556
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:47,920
The hot dishes are just served.

557
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:49,440
You need to enter

558
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,120
Yi Kang app first.

559
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,240
How?

560
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,520
When you do the face check,

561
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,120
take your phone far away.

562
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,120
so that you can get

563
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,280
on your face.

564
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,800
Try it, right?

565
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,280
It's in.

566
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,040
I got it.

567
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,600
That's right

568
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,040
This is so convenient.

569
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,000
Zheng Bo.

570
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,520
Well done.

571
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,000
Thank you, uncle. Thank you, uncle.

572
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,880
No matter how busy you are,

573
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,640
take good care of Jiaqi.

574
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,600
Don't worry, dad.

575
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:18,680
Sure.

576
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,760
Okay, come on, let's eat.

577
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,080
Let's eat.

578
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,360
I'll peel it for you.

579
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,000
Peel shrimp.

580
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:42,600
Here.

581
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,320
No, I quit drinking.

582
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,720
After what happened last time,

583
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,600
I won't drink anymore.

584
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:49,560
I quit.

585
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,200
Okay, I won't force you.

586
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,960
Then drink water instead of wine.

587
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:57,440
instead of wine.

588
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:57,840
Okay.

589
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:58,080
Okay.

590
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:01,560
Dr Zhang.

591
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:03,960
Actually,

592
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,720
The old one.

593
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:07,680
I'm really sorry

594
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,200
Qi

595
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,480
Speaking of which,

596
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,440
the marriage between the two children

597
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,880
Qin must have

598
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,320
in the dark.

599
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,120
The past

600
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,240
the past.

601
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,720
Let bygones be bygones.

602
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,120
From now on,

603
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,960
we are a family.

604
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,000
Right?

605
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:32,480
Let's move on.

606
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:33,320
Here.

607
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:35,880
Wish you

608
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:37,960
You two

609
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,840
should respect each other and live happily.

610
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:42,720
Okay.

611
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:43,720
Be harmonious.

612
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,000
and have a baby soon.

613
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:46,960
Thank you, mom and dad.

614
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,360
Wish you health and longevity.

615
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:49,600
Yes.

616
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:49,960
Okay.

617
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:55,720
Qi Qi.

618
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,800
When you get married,

619
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,320
you have to change your temper.

620
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,320
Don't be too willful.

621
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,440
I have a good temper.

622
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:09,880
What do you want to eat?

623
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,080
Let's go back.

624
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:11,440
Okay.

625
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:12,560
Grapes.

626
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:14,719
That's a tip.

627
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:17,600
There's nothing I like.

628
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,080
What do I like to eat?

629
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:19,719
Chicken leg.

630
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,400
Chicken leg ribs

631
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:22,800
Ribs

632
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,239
Yes.

633
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,960
Xianbing's ribs are still delicious.

634
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,159
They organized it.

635
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,480
I thought they could bring some.

636
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:29,840
No main meal.

637
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,159
You two are done.

638
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,239
Are you happy?

639
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:33,360
Let me tell you.

640
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,960
I almost caught

641
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,080
such a big crab.

642
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,080
It's not that big

643
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,440
It's such a big crab.

644
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,000
You can't see them here

645
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:42,960
It's such a big crab.

646
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,120
It's just this big.

647
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:45,560
Come with me.

648
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:46,679
You're a fake couple.

649
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:47,600
Yes, it should be this big.

650
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:49,600
Why don't you just feed it?

651
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:50,880
Zheng Bo.

652
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:53,679
We caught a big crab just now.

653
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:54,880
We didn't catch it.

654
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:55,960
Take it back.

655
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:57,920
It hurts.

656
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,320
I... No.

657
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,400
When he did that, I...

658
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,000
I'm scared.

659
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,640
I'm scared. I'm really scared.

660
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,400
I'm really afraid

661
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,120
Who's calling for help by the sea?

662
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,400
Morphy's Law.

663
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,160
Don't talk nonsense.

664
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,080
Don't break it.

665
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,560
Chi, Qi.

666
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,920
How's your wedding?

667
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:13,760
What are you going to do?

668
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,080
Tell them how to do it.

669
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,720
I'm waiting for your reply.

670
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:19,000
Let me ask you. Do you want western style

671
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,080
On the lawn, buffet.

672
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,320
or Chinese?

673
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,160
Then find a hotel

674
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,640
Let's have a feast for eight dishes.

675
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,720
I think Chinese is good.

676
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,640
My senior must look good in Chinese clothes.

677
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,440
Say it properly. You're so hypocritical.

678
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,640
The clothes today

679
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,000
can't show her figure.

680
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:33,560
Imagine it.

681
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,120
Stop it, Zhang Chi.

682
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:35,600
The veil.

683
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,200
You think when the lid is covered,

684
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:37,920
Then lift it.

685
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:38,240
Shut up.

686
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:38,880
It's none of your business.

687
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,320
I'm the one who flirts with him.

688
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,160
It's none of your business.

689
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,320
It's you who flirted. Let's see.

690
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,800
Could it be...

691
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,920
in the middle of your wedding,

692
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,840
you received an emergency call

693
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,200
Then you have to get out.

694
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,400
Throw it into the sea.

695
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,720
Throw her, I'll save her.

696
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:54,720
Take care of it.

697
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:55,800
Take care of it.

698
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,600
The epidemic has been

699
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,000
was stolen.

700
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,000
It's gone.

701
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,240
Exactly.

702
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,040
It's been three years since we got married.

703
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,560
We can finally hold a wedding.

704
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,120
Zhang Chi, I'm a little nervous.

705
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,440
We're getting married today.

706
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,920
Isn't it normal to be nervous?

707
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,640
My hands are sweating.

708
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,400
No, I'm not nervous about getting married.

709
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,920
I'm afraid something might happen.

710
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,000
We have to save him first.

711
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,440
What happened? What are you talking about?

712
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,320
When we went out,

713
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,240
we often meet people who need our help.

714
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:06,800
We have to hurry.

715
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,480
When did this happen?

716
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,960
Do you remember that day at the football court?

717
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,720
Someone fell down after kicking.

718
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,000
And when we went to

719
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
we went to the resort together.

720
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,680
One of them went there directly.

721
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:16,800
We worked hard for them.

722
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,120
Isn't that a coincidence?

723
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,000
How can we get married so coincidentally?

724
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,320
No, no, no.

725
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,160
I'm scared.

726
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,920
Don't be afraid. It won't happen.

727
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,480
Okay, no.

728
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,000
Let's get married today.

729
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:28,920
All the best.

730
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,440
Look at that lady.

731
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,960
Don't make a fuss.

732
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,440
She can see you.

733
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,600
She almost fell in.

734
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,640
Almost. Gosh.

735
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,400
It's okay.

736
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,400
It's okay. We're getting married today.

737
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,320
We're getting married today.

738
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,400
Good luck.

739
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,200
Zhang Chi.

740
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:54,600
What's wrong?

741
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,200
Are you scared?

742
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,880
We're getting married today.

743
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,640
Good luck.

744
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:09,400
Oh my god, your hands are sweating a lot.

745
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,400
My feet are sweaty too.

746
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,160
Your feet are sweaty.

747
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:45,880
What time is it?

748
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,320
Did we go to the wrong place?

749
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:48,960
The car has been cleaned several times.

750
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,800
The car is scraped.

751
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,600
Where is he?

752
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,320
Don't wipe the bald skin.

753
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,640
You need to paint your skin.

754
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:54,960
Why are you so impatient?

755
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,680
It's your business. How can I not be impatient?

756
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,920
What time is it?

757
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,360
The newbie Mr. Lu mentioned

758
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,400
hasn't arrived yet?

759
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,240
Did you see that?

760
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,200
No, we've been waiting.

761
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,400
We've been waiting for a long time but he's not here.

762
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,160
Shall we welcome him?

763
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:05,920
What?

764
