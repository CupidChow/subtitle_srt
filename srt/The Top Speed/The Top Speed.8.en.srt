1
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:06,040
National Radio. And Telvison Administration

2
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,560
I've contacted

3
00:01:35,039 --> 00:01:37,560
a foreign heart research center.

4
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,840
Chinese specialist.

5
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:42,800
It's not easy to meet him.

6
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,800
at Junyue Hotel.

7
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,360
It's 5:30 today.

8
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,440
Because this expert

9
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:49,080
Let's go.

10
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,600
The schedule is full.

11
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,600
He’s going back tomorrow.

12
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,440
Mr. Dai, I have to go.

13
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,000
I’ll reply you later.

14
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,560
You should have told me earlier.

15
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,640
We can get out of the car.

16
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,880
You can get off now, really.

17
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,639
It's like going on stage for surgery.

18
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,080
No matter how important it is,

19
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,240
is not as important as saving people.

20
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,960
You're even online.

21
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,360
This concerns your future, Zhang Chi.

22
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,280
I don't know what to do

23
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,079
What's going on Ming

24
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:42,079
Why is it so narrow?

25
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,120
Can you get through?

26
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,440
Watch out.

27
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:53,280
The navigation shows it's in this alley.

28
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,079
The car is blocked. We can't get through.

29
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,400
Get the stuff and get off.

30
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,080
How did the car stop?

31
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,360
Dr. Qi Dr. Zhang

32
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,280
Hua Zi.

33
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,680
Are you driving here?

34
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,280
You...

35
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,680
In that shabby Chai Alley,

36
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,400
Mr. Cheng lives there, you know?

37
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,960
I know. We are in the same hospital.

38
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,000
Take us there. Hurry up.

39
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,640
What’s wrong, Mr. Cheng?

40
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,560
Call 120. Hurry.

41
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,079
Hurry up.

42
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:16,720
I'll take you there.

43
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,720
There are two alleys.

44
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,400
Keep up.

45
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:18,960
Follow me

46
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,800
Ming, park the car

47
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,960
Bring the stretcher here

48
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,280
Okay.

49
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,079
Hurry up, Hua Zi.

50
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:31,640
Hurry up. This way.

51
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,960
Is this the right way, Hua Zi?

52
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,400
No, don't worry.

53
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,960
Watch your step. Don't trip.

54
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,200
Gosh, it's quite deep.

55
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:51,840
Whose dog?

56
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:55,800
Hurry up.

57
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,400
You didn't go wrong.

58
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,520
How far is it?

59
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,240
Soon.

60
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,360
So deep.

61
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,120
We'll be there after a turn.

62
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,240
Oh, no. Not yet.

63
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:04,840
This way.

64
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,240
I can't get in there.

65
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,240
Go straight and turn right and walk into an alley.

66
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,120
Okay, thank you, Hua Zi.

67
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,560
Go back to work.

68
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,399
Where?

69
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:20,839
Here.

70
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,880
Is this Mr. Cheng’s house?

71
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,400
Doctor, you are finally here.

72
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,720
This house

73
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,440
Okay, where is it?

74
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,640
Here

75
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,120
Doctor, hurry up. He's inside.

76
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:31,440
Where is he?

77
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:31,960
He's inside.

78
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,960
Go and have a look.

79
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,280
Here?

80
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,640
Doctor, you are finally here.

81
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,120
Excuse me, please come out.

82
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,880
Are you conscious now?

83
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,280
Can you hear me, sir?

84
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,280
Okay.

85
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,240
How long have you been unconscious?

86
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,240
20 minutes ago.

87
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:54,560
Come on.

88
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,400
Take your blood pressure.

89
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,120
Sir, we are doctors.

90
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,240
Come in and give you a check-up.

91
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,240
Don't be afraid.

92
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,120
How old are you?

93
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,400
77 years old.

94
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,520
Next, Zhang Chi.

95
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,400
Is there any basic disease?

96
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,120
Normally, cardiovascular is not good.

97
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,720
I had a heart stent at the hospital last year.

98
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,720
He has a check-up every month.

99
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,960
The surgery last year.

100
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,560
Yes.

101
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,680
Here, over there.

102
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,960
Qiu-yi, is the blood pressure monitor normal?

103
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,560
Yes.

104
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,400
It's normal right

105
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,160
The lungs are fine.

106
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,240
Doctor, look.

107
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,960
Last Wednesday,

108
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,960
in the city East Hospital last Wednesday.

109
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,760
in the city East Hospital.

110
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,159
The doctor said he was in good condition.

111
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:37,960
This is medicine, right?

112
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,520
Yes, this is his usual medicine.

113
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,960
He takes it on time every day, right?

114
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,640
Yes.

115
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,760
There's nothing wrong with the film.

116
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,520
No problem, right?

117
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,520
If he hadn't quarreled with the hotel owner,

118
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,760
he wouldn't have been sick.

119
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:48,520
Later,

120
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,960
I'll get even with the boss.

121
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,480
Are you Mr. Jiang's lover?

122
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,400
No.

123
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,320
We're neighbors, not family.

124
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,040
Neighbors?

125
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,400
You know so much about neighbors.

126
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:00,640
Here’s the thing.

127
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,720
Mr. Cheng

128
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,640
his son and wife passed away.

129
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,520
Two years ago,

130
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,160
I got dementia again.

131
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,160
I don't recognize people anymore.

132
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,960
She's alone.

133
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,280
It's quite pitiful.

134
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,400
Usually,

135
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,720
take care of her.

136
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,320
You guys are so nice.

137
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,720
Thank you.

138
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,480
It's okay.

139
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,080
Thank you, doctor.

140
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,080
Thank you. Thank you.

141
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,840
Sir. Sir.

142
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,080
Nothing.

143
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,080
The indicators are all normal.

144
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:25,920
Take a break.

145
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,520
Take your medicine on time.

146
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,400
Sir, your hand is injured.

147
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,840
Let me disinfect it for you.

148
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,840
Prepare cotton swabs for him.

149
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:39,840
Son.

150
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,200
Son.

151
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,280
008401.

152
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,760
You're finally back.

153
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,159
I'm glad you're back.

154
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,080
I’m glad you’re back.

155
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:53,720
Mr. Cheng.

156
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,400
I'm an emergency doctor at 120.

157
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,320
I'm here to treat you.

158
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,080
Your birthday is in a few days.

159
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,480
I didn't get you a cake.

160
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,280
Are you mad at me?

161
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,280
Tomorrow.

162
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,640
I'll buy it for you tomorrow.

163
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:13,960
I'll buy you

164
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,960
your favorite cream cake.

165
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,640
Mr. Cheng.

166
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,400
Look carefully.

167
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,960
He's a doctor.

168
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,640
You got the wrong person.

169
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,400
My son.

170
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,280
I'm good.

171
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,400
Dad,

172
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,520
Your hand is injured.

173
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,600
Let me treat your wound first.

174
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,159
Buy me a cream cake in a few days.

175
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:41,280
Let's eat cake together.

176
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,159
Okay?

177
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:42,960
Okay.

178
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,640
I'll treat your wound first.

179
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,720
008401.

180
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,920
Give me a cotton swab.

181
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,080
Doctor, how is Mr. Cheng?

182
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:12,600
He's fine.

183
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,200
Coming, Hua Zi.

184
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,720
The indicators are fine.

185
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,320
It's just a small scratch. I'll be fine in a few days.

186
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:17,720
I'm fine.

187
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,200
That’s good.

188
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,720
We asked Mr. Cheng for his opinion.

189
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,960
He said he won’t go to the hospital.

190
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,520
He knows what he's doing.

191
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,080
But I think he's a bit confused.

192
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,600
He kept holding his hand and calling him son.

193
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,520
Mr. Cheng’s son is also a doctor.

194
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,720
When he went to support Wenchuan earthquake,

195
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,600
he was killed by mudslides.

196
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:38,640
The day he sacrificed was his son's birthday.

197
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:41,159
His wife passed away

198
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,200
and left soon.

199
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,840
He was an orphan.

200
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,920
As neighbors,

201
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,960
we should help them.

202
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,160
Buy rice and oil

203
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,720
cleaning and paying water and electricity bills.

204
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,520
are all under the neighborhood committee's charge.

205
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,160
Dr. Qi, Dr. Zhang, thank you.

206
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:07,720
It's okay

207
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,280
Call us if you need anything.

208
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,080
Okay, I'll see myself out.

209
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:10,520
OK.

210
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,280
Call Mr. Dai.

211
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,400
Mr. Dai, I’ve finished my car.

212
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,200
What time is it tonight?

213
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,400
Chi,

214
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,200
I want to tell you

215
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,040
the dinner tonight is cancelled.

216
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,600
In the afternoon,

217
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:35,080
they suddenly asked to meet in advance.

218
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,080
I can't hide it anymore.

219
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,960
I can only tell them

220
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,520
you have work to do.

221
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,920
But they think

222
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,920
you don't pay enough attention to the research center

223
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,280
and your attitude was not positive enough.

224
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,840
They turned me down.

225
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,280
I tried my best,

226
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,720
but they made another arrangement.

227
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,040
It's not that I don't care.

228
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:55,840
It's not that I'm not positive.

229
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,520
I’m trying to save the patient.

230
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,280
Between personal interests and patients,

231
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,640
you chose the latter.

232
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,600
It's undeniable.

233
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,160
008401.

234
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,640
I just feel so sorry for you.

235
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,080
As you know,

236
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,640
there are only one or two places.

237
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,080
A group of people squeeze in.

238
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,960
But I told them the truth.

239
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,520
But it's up to them

240
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,520
what they think next.

241
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,720
Thank you, Mr. Dai.

242
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,080
Sorry to trouble you.

243
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,280
I'll visit you next week

244
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,400
I'll visit you in the north of the city.

245
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:32,760
Bye.

246
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:34,840
I can't.

247
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,160
It's okay.

248
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,080
As long as my assignment is advanced,

249
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,720
it's only a matter of time to go to the research center.

250
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,720
Come with me.

251
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,080
How loud is the sound of waves?

252
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,400
I can cover up

253
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,320
and what I want to say.

254
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,080
The wind is strong

255
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,400
Blow away all the bad things

256
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,520
When I'm in a bad mood,

257
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,600
when I'm in a bad mood.

258
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,960
I'll feel better after a walk.

259
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,840
I used to come to the beach often.

260
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,640
Why didn't you come later?

261
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,520
What's wrong with you, Zhang Chi?

262
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,080
Dr. Zhang.

263
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,520
Doctor Zhang.

264
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,080
Bad news. The ventricular fibrillation of bed No. 17.

265
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:58,920
Go and have a look.

266
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:14,840
What happened?

267
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,080
I just came to check.

268
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:16,960
It suddenly happened.

269
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:21,720
Dr Zhang.

270
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,840
He has a cardiac arrest.

271
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,280
What should we do now?

272
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,760
Fill up

273
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,080
Speed up.

274
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:33,520
Okay.

275
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,480
ammonia acid, one gram of ammonia acid.

276
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,040
Hurry up.

277
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:36,840
I'll get it.

278
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,840
Chi, the leaders and department

279
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,160
Everyone wants to protect you.

280
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,640
and did a lot of work.

281
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,840
But the patient's family

282
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,160
the patient's family.

283
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:53,440
What the hospital has done is to suspend you

284
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,120
for six months.

285
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,520
Sir, is it wrong for me to save him?

286
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,440
If that patient doesn't get surgery,

287
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,560
he won't be able to live.

288
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,560
I told him before the surgery.

289
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,560
the operation is very dangerous.

290
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,000
And there are various complications after the surgery.

291
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,080
They all know it.

292
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,240
Chi,

293
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,880
I hope you can think about it calmly.

294
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,320
If you hadn't guided them too much,

295
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,680
if you hadn't led them too much?

296
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,760
I'm not doing it for...

297
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,800
I hope you can

298
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,240
in the future.

299
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,560
I will

300
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,120
I'll help you communicate in the hospital.

301
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,640
Take it as a vacation.

302
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,680
Xiaodie also said if she recovers,

303
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,760
she would go to the sea with Dr Zhang.

304
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,520
Although what you did is against the rules,

305
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,240
but I understand that you want to save people.

306
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,400
You did the right thing.

307
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,640
Don't be too sad.

308
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,520
Before coming to the emergency center,

309
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,280
I have two options.

310
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,680
One is the heart research center abroad.

311
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,040
The other is

312
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,160
the cardiothoracic surgeons in the city.

313
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,880
But we have to wait.

314
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,040
I don't want to waste time.

315
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,160
I want to keep saving people.

316
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,280
So I promised Secretary Liu

317
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,240
to come to the emergency center.

318
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,520
What do you think of our emergency center?

319
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,800
It's not as difficult as your heart surgery,

320
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,800
but we look good, right?

321
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,680
I think everyone

322
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,560
is full of enthusiasm

323
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,680
It's full of passion.

324
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,000
If it doesn't work, you can stay in the emergency center.

325
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,800
I can make you shine.

326
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,160
I still have a distance

327
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,240
a mature ER doctor.

328
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,920
I'll try harder.

329
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,800
Don't pick up

330
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,760
Can you play soccer?

331
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:30,640
Not bad.

332
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,760
There's a football field.

333
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,320
Your endorphin will come up soon.

334
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,640
Let's go. I'll treat you to dinner after kicking.

335
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,800
It's a little shaky.

336
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,000
Good boy

337
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:53,680
Come on.

338
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,280
Who's coming? I'm in a good mood.

339
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,640
Who's in a bad mood? Come on.

340
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,640
Aren't you going?

341
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,280
Who? I'm in a good mood.

342
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,680
Why didn't you kick me?

343
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,040
Hurry up I'm so happy

344
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,320
I'll be happy after the kick

345
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,400
Follow me.

346
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:06,800
Come on.

347
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,280
Give me your phone.

348
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,120
Yes.

349
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:13,880
Referee, switch.

350
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,160
A straight one. A straight one.

351
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,040
Do your best.

352
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,440
I'm tired.

353
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,520
It's only been a few minutes.

354
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,640
No, my equipment is not good.

355
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,800
Didn't you see

356
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,920
wearing those nail shoes

357
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,920
just step on my toes.

358
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:23,800
It's on my nails.

359
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,440
It hurts so much.

360
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,240
I'm unhappy again.

361
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,400
It hurts but I'm happy.

362
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,640
As long as you're happy.

363
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,040
Take a rest. I'll get you some water.

364
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,520
No, I'll go.

365
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,800
I'll buy some for them too.

366
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,440
You made friends?

367
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,160
My phone.

368
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,280
Over there.

369
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:40,920
Cheer up.

370
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:41,920
I'm happy.

371
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,040
One more.

372
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,040
Pass it here.

373
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,160
Take a break. It's our turn.

374
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,400
Let's go home. Let's go.

375
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,920
You missed a goal today.

376
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,520
I'll give you another kick.

377
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,160
Are you okay?

378
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:04,920
Are you okay?

379
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,640
Who kicked you with eyes?

380
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:14,920
Let me see.

381
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:15,920
How does it hurt?

382
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,040
What do you do?

383
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:17,800
I'm a doctor.

384
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,920
I saw you injured.

385
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,760
Let me check you.

386
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,400
I won't let you treat a doctor.

387
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,320
The elderly said

388
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,040
women can't

389
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,120
for the rest of her life.

390
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,560
Why are you so foolish?

391
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,040
There's no man or woman in front of our doctor.

392
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:29,800
Give it to me.

393
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,160
No means no.

394
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,280
I can't let you see it.

395
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,160
Why are you so stubborn?

396
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,760
You're injured now. What are you going to do?

397
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,040
Even if it hurts,

398
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,920
I won't let you treat me.

399
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,040
What are you waiting for?

400
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,280
Get her away.

401
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,240
Go away.

402
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:41,920
Let go.

403
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,280
Don't pull me.

404
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,160
What are you doing?

405
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,040
Let go.

406
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,440
Mind your own business.

407
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,680
Don't you understand me?

408
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,800
Let go of me!

409
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,040
Take her away!

410
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,680
Let go. No.

411
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,800
He's... Listen to me.

412
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:54,440
Wait.

413
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:55,920
What are you doing?

414
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,400
What are you doing?

415
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,560
What are you doing?

416
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,000
We are doctors.

417
00:18:59,040 --> 00:18:59,680
We are colleagues.

418
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,520
We are all emergency doctors in 120.

419
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,040
Stop it.

420
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,160
It hurts so much.

421
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,400
Call 120.

422
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,400
The sulfur is injured. I think it's swollen.

423
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,520
Look at the pain. Go and have a look.

424
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,400
He's a man. Can I show you?

425
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,400
Turn around.

426
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,520
It hurts so much.

427
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,400
Help him up.

428
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,680
I think it's full of blood.

429
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,520
Don't cover yourself. Let me check.

430
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,160
The blood is swollen. We need ice compress.

431
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,560
There's no ice.

432
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,280
There's ice water.

433
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,040
Put it here.

434
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,560
Hold the water.

435
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:37,800
Hold it.

436
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,160
Did you call 120

437
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,400
Yes, I did.

438
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,320
Feeling better?

439
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,520
Yes, thank you.

440
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,640
Where did you go?

441
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,120
How did you get it?

442
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,600
I just saw it.

443
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:13,600
Yes.

444
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,200
You're a good friend.

445
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,440
I failed to protect you.

446
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,240
You're a good friend.

447
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,240
It's okay. It looks scary.

448
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,720
Isn't it cute in the end?

449
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,760
What kind of scary is that?

450
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:25,720
What do you mean?

451
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,120
It looks honest

452
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,080
It's really scary.

453
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,600
One time I met

454
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,120
who got drunk after saving one.

455
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,720
He transforms after drinking.

456
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,200
Take a big bottle

457
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,480
shine on the back of my head.

458
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,360
11 stitches.

459
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,320
I still have a scar.

460
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,880
11 stitches.

461
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,120
Can you see it?

462
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,320
Your hair is growing out.

463
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,080
Let me do it

464
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:47,840
No, I can do it myself.

465
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,080
It's not easy to carry it.

466
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,200
This position is not good.

467
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,760
Be gentle when you work these days.

468
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,840
Otherwise, this piece

469
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,840
The fresh meat will be torn apart again.

470
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,320
It's okay, it's not peeled

471
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,200
It's okay

472
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:05,960
Okay, hang it.

473
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,600
Don't pull it. You hang it. Right.

474
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:10,960
It's just skin. It's okay.

475
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,000
Thanks.

476
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,160
Not bad.

477
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:20,800
Let's go.

478
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,320
Say whatever they say.

479
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,080
Let's go.

480
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,160
Go.

481
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,720
Why should I leave?

482
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,560
Let's eat.

483
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,720
Take a break.

484
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,920
When we talk about eating,

485
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,440
Think about what happened this afternoon.

486
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,040
physical

487
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,400
psychological pressure.

488
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,560
There were so many people just now.

489
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,280
Didn't you feel happier?

490
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,560
I was happy.

491
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,960
I was scared back.

492
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,800
It's good to distract your attention.

493
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,440
Thank you for helping me

494
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,520
for helping me.

495
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,200
The girl who went on a blind date last time was quite nice.

496
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,200
She's pretty too.

497
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,680
You don't have feelings for her?

498
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,800
We're not the same.

499
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,680
But I think she likes you.

500
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,440
If you want to be with her,

501
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,560
if you want to be with her.

502
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,160
Kiki, here's the thing.

503
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,440
Although my family background is ordinary,

504
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,320
but

505
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,800
if I stay with her

506
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:29,560
because I'm too rich.

507
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,920
First, I won't do that.

508
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,800
Secondly,

509
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,440
Youqian and your future happiness index

510
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,800
is not necessarily related.

511
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,200
By the way, I remember

512
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,400
I received a call from an idol.

513
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,200
A prank call.

514
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:47,040
A prank call from an idol.

515
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,440
Yes, that kind of red one.

516
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:52,160
But because she got married,

517
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,320
So she quit.

518
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,080
When I hear her voice again,

519
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,440
she came to call us.

520
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,200
Is she insane?

521
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,160
I think she's mentally ill.

522
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:05,080
She said after her husband married her,

523
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,560
after she married her.

524
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,320
Don't go out.

525
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,680
I'll be there at any time.

526
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:11,040
I think I've been depressed for a long time

527
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,200
after a long time.

528
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,600
So scary.

529
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,680
You remind me of something.

530
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,160
You'll suffer if you don't deserve the position.

531
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,560
This is the wealth of wealth.

532
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,920
I think I watched a show before.

533
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,320
A reporter interviewed her on that show.

534
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,080
When I went to her house,

535
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,520
she had a huge cloak room.

536
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,320
There was a whole wall with shoes.

537
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,200
Because I really like shoes.

538
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,800
I envied her so much.

539
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,920
I was wondering when I could have a wall

540
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,600
with my shoes.

541
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,840
But through this incident,

542
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,200
money is not that important.

543
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,400
When I went to the mall,

544
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,560
this pair of shoes.

545
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,280
Can you afford them?

546
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,080
No, it's not your shoes.

547
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,080
Jia Qi, you're right.

548
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,080
I think young people

549
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,280
should be down-to-earth

550
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,320
step by step.

551
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,200
That's good.

552
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,680
This is the most practical.

553
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,560
Am I right?

554
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,800
I didn't expect that we have the same idea.

555
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,080
I think our opinions

556
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,680
are quite consistent.

557
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,440
I don't want to share the same thought with you.

558
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:12,920
Stinky.

559
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,080
What do you mean by that?

560
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,600
I've heard of a straight man.

561
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,080
No, I mean...

562
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:18,800
a straight man.

563
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,680
I was wrong.

564
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:25,840
What are you doing?

565
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,840
Come here.

566
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,600
No.

567
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:31,960
Don't move.

568
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,680
What are you doing?

569
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,920
You're really lucky with that scar.

570
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,320
It didn't leave a scar last time.

571
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,160
This scar has long healed.

572
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:47,000
That scared me.

573
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:50,560
By the way,

574
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,320
are you off work tomorrow?

575
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,560
Yes, how did you know?

576
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,800
You don't have to get up early.

577
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,440
Let's watch a movie tonight.

578
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,080
Okay.

579
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,840
What kind of movie do you like?

580
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,720
Let's watch horror movies.

581
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,600
Horror movie?

582
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:11,920
I dare not watch it.

583
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,520
How about watching a comedy?

584
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,800
I'm not afraid. What are you afraid of?

585
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,680
I tend to think too much.

586
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:43,960
It's cold.

587
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:45,720
Cold

588
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,440
No need.

589
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,680
Let me tell you.

590
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,520
Don't wear shorts when you come out for a movie

591
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,680
The air conditioner in the room is very sufficient now

592
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:02,520
Okay

593
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,080
Thank you.

594
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:27,280
Why is she with him?

595
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,920
That's how love is.

596
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,560
It just happened.

597
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,960
But this man

598
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,960
doesn't like this woman?

599
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,560
I do. Why not?

600
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,520
Can't you tell?

601
00:26:59,320 --> 00:26:59,800
Here.

602
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:01,320
Chi.

603
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,160
Thank you.

604
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,040
Ming.

605
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:03,520
Thank you.

606
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:04,840
Sister.

607
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,040
You're bleeding.

608
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,080
What are you buying?

609
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:11,800
Pick a tea set for my dad to ease our relationship.

610
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:12,800
Buy a gift?

611
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:13,680
What about us?

612
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,560
Do we have a gift?

613
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,920
Yes, we've already bought it. We're all here.

614
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:17,840
I'll bring it to you later

615
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,920
Really what did you buy

616
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,400
A pair of sneakers for driving.

617
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,960
Everyone gets one pair. Everyone gets one.

618
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,920
It has to be my sister.

619
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,680
Everyone has a share. Me too.

620
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:28,800
What's the difference?

621
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,600
Do you know how big my feet are?

622
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:31,920
I know everything.

623
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,440
Don't always wear those leather shoes.

624
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,400
It won't bubble.

625
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:45,920
Okay.

626
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,800
Please tell us the exact address.

627
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:49,280
Yes.

628
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,440
The address is 118 Seochong-ro, right?

629
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:54,800
Okay.

630
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:56,360
Okay.

631
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,080
Which floor?

632
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,800
0106 Qi Tuo Group

633
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,720
70, Yeonseo Road, Wenting Ya Yuan Apartment.

634
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:03,800
Building 2, Room 601.

635
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,680
Someone fainted from chest tightness.

636
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,400
Hurry up.

637
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,840
Doctor, it's here.

638
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:07,560
Hurry up.

639
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,440
What's going on?

640
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,600
Honey, the doctor is here.

641
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,320
The doctor is here.

642
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,920
After lunch, he said his back hurt

643
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,600
and lying on the sofa.

644
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,920
I didn't get well.

645
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,920
I can't talk now.

646
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:20,920
What time is noon?

647
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,920
From 12:30 to 1 p.m.

648
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:23,920
Did you vomit just now?

649
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,920
Yes, I did. I vomited twice.

650
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:26,960
Do you have a basic disease?

651
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,440
Heart disease, high blood pressure?

652
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,800
Heart disease?

653
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,080
Heart disease?

654
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,920
Yes, I have high blood pressure too.

655
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:33,720
What about high blood fat?

656
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,200
I have some too.

657
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,720
Honey it's okay

658
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,160
It's okay. Hang in there, honey.

659
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,040
Don't scare me.

660
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,440
Be quiet. Be quiet.

661
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,600
Don't worry.

662
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:43,920
Your heart is not good.

663
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,520
Take a look at the ECG.

664
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,160
Hurry up.

665
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,520
Be quiet.

666
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,200
Calm down.

667
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,680
What's going on?

668
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:55,440
What's going on?

669
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:55,800
Zhang Chi.

670
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,520
How is it?

671
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,560
Heart attack.

672
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,680
Heart attack.

673
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,440
Our initial assessment is that he has a heart attack.

674
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,200
So we have to go to the hospital now.

675
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,440
Go into the tube, okay?

676
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,400
What if it's too late?

677
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,320
We'll make it. Let's go to the hospital.

678
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,200
I just checked on my phone.

679
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,800
Heart infarction needs a solution.

680
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,200
You can do it now.

681
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,560
So you have to hurry up.

682
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:12,960
We can decide

683
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,520
We can't decide until the test is done.

684
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:14,960
But...

685
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,440
What if it's too late?

686
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,600
Who will take responsibility?

687
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,280
So we have to hurry up, right?

688
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,200
Come on, give me a hand.

689
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,200
Wait a minute.

690
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,160
Don't move.

691
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,840
His head is swollen.

692
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:25,520
Where?

693
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,200
Here.

694
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:27,840
Did he fall down?

695
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,960
He just fell asleep on the sofa

696
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,440
and fell down.

697
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,560
When did you fall

698
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,520
I don't know I was in the kitchen

699
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,080
This could lead to

700
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,920
skull fracture or cerebral hemorrhage.

701
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,160
If we inject the solution now,

702
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,440
the bleeding will increase.

703
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,160
You can't hit him. You have to go there first.

704
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,280
The phone says

705
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,440
you need a solution.

706
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,520
You'll get a solution when you go to the hospital.

707
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,800
I didn't even know his head was injured.

708
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,560
If he had severe intracranial bleeding,

709
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,720
he will become a vegetative or paralyzed.

710
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:52,680
He's been quiet

711
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,680
for two or three hours.

712
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,280
Yes.

713
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,640
It'll be too late if we don't send him to the hospital.

714
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,960
We have to go to the hospital now.

715
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,360
Can we let him in the tube?

716
00:29:59,120 --> 00:29:59,880
He's in the hospital.

717
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:00,800
See you.

718
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,920
Call the Fourth Courtyard to open the green passage

719
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:02,320
OK.

720
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,160
Okay.

721
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,720
Honey, hang in there.

722
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,320
Hang in there, honey.

723
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,160
Sign here.

724
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,200
This...

725
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,840
What is this?

726
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:11,840
Family information.

727
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,120
Hurry up.

728
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,360
One, two, three.

729
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:23,520
Qiu, pack your things.

730
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,600
Look how slow the door is.

731
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,920
You need someone to stand in advance

732
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:32,640
to give it to you.

733
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,720
Let me turn around.

734
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,600
Look how smooth Hwang-yi is now.

735
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,280
Oh my god, this speed.

736
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,600
Dr. Zhang, you're amazing.

737
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,200
He really had a cerebral hemorrhage.

738
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,600
His family is so grateful to you.

739
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,920
I can't even calculate his head injury.

740
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:50,440
Give me your hand.

741
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:53,440
He pulled everyone back with one sentence.

742
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,440
He's a cardiac surgeon.

743
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,640
Isn't it normal to know this?

744
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,280
Yes, brother.

745
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,360
Aren't you a cardiac surgeon?

746
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,880
If I were a cardiac surgeon,

747
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,720
I might find out before he does.

748
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:01,640
Forget it.

749
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,880
With your IQ, don't embarrass yourself.

750
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,160
Why are you everywhere?

751
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,400
You're so annoying.

752
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:08,880
Should I say it or not?

753
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,160
Zhang Chi deserves praise today.

754
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,640
You know the process.

755
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,520
You even ask her family to sign it.

756
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,800
You can do it. You deserve praise.

757
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,080
Just verbal praise.

758
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,040
For Zhang Chi,

759
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,520
It's definitely worth buying you a meal.

760
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,640
I'll treat you to a nice meal next month.

761
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,800
It's just the beginning of this month.

762
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,120
Next month, you...

763
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,360
You owe me first.

764
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,360
I owe more than 300 meals.

765
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,800
Yes, Qiu'er has had more than 100 meals.

766
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,560
Let's go and have a look.

767
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,360
Let's go to the seventh floor.

768
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,800
Dr. Xiao, look.

769
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,680
Dr Zhang is in 120.

770
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,280
He seems to be having fun.

771
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:38,960
Right?

772
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,640
In our hospital,

773
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,080
in our hospital.

774
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,200
Let's go.

775
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,680
How can you eat more than 100 meals?

776
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,360
That's too much.

777
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:48,560
Don't move.

778
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:48,920
What?

779
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,280
What are you doing?

780
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,400
There's something on your hair.

781
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,640
Why did you touch me?

782
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:54,960
Who did that?

783
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,560
You're flattering me.

784
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,480
What are you talking about?

785
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:57,880
You...

786
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,400
Are you serious?

787
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:00,920
Look.

788
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:01,600
Why did you pick it up?

789
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,360
You picked up a random one.

790
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,440
You're serious.

791
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,080
Why are you so serious? Get in.

792
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,360
I just picked one up.

793
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,320
Lower your voice. Why are you so noisy?

794
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,160
Get this car up.

795
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,400
No, I...

796
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,080
I'm still looking for...

797
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,800
I'll find an excuse to...

798
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,120
Why are you shy?

799
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:16,880
What's wrong?

800
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,360
Zhang Chi is so funny.

801
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,280
Stay here.

802
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,360
We won't play with you.

803
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,200
It's too hot.

804
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:44,880
I'm alive

805
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:46,360
Oh my

806
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,040
Take whatever you want

807
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:48,840
It's my treat today.

808
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:49,920
Thank you, Chi.

809
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:50,280
Thank you water cream

810
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:50,640
Thank you.

811
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:51,880
Hello Welcome

812
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,800
One tea egg

813
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,120
Okay.

814
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,440
One oden.

815
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,880
Radish noodles and fish balls.

816
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,120
Hello, your tea egg.

817
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,800
You chose so slowly.

818
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:05,960
Okay.

819
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,280
Here.

820
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:09,360
Ming.

821
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,400
Zhang Chi's treat, Ming.

822
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,560
I want a tea egg.

823
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:16,880
Let's go outside.

824
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:18,800
There's no place.

825
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:20,840
No way.

826
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,120
It's getting dark.

827
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,440
Why is it still so hot?

828
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,680
This is the fire.

829
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,520
It's high to 36.7 degrees Celsius.

830
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,960
I've taken nine cars.

831
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,160
It's so lively.

832
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:34,680
We're done.

833
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:35,720
It's too hot outside.

834
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:36,800
Take it in and eat.

835
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:37,600
There's air conditioner inside.

836
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,640
Thank you.

837
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,280
Thank you.

838
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:39,640
You're welcome.

839
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,320
You're so fast.

840
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,280
Cool

841
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,720
So cool

842
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:46,840
Comfortable.

843
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,120
It's a bit crowded here. I'll sit over there.

844
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:48,960
OK. Is there a place?

845
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:49,640
Yes.

846
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:50,440
Have a seat, Qiu.

847
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,160
No.

848
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,440
My butt hurts after sitting for a whole day.

849
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,200
Chi, you're good.

850
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,080
You're getting more and more into the group.

851
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,640
You've risen in my heart.

852
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:01,840
Chi.

853
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:04,080
Since we want to integrate into the group,

854
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,440
should we get to know each other more?

855
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,560
How?

856
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,080
Love history.

857
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,360
How many relationships have you been in?

858
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,280
What do you mean?

859
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:13,360
Interesting.

860
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,360
No no no

861
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:16,639
I'm just curious. I'm just curious.

862
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:18,520
It's about love 04

863
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,360
It's the only way to integrate into a group.

864
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,080
I went to college at 15.

865
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:25,360
The girls in the same class are older than me.

866
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:26,880
15 years old.

867
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,159
Are you a straight A student?

868
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,120
Look, you're different from normal people.

869
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:31,120
How low EQ is he?

870
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,639
Later, when I got my PhD,

871
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:36,840
I had a classmate.

872
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,679
Really? How?

873
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,360
We're just studying the assignment.

874
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,880
Besides studying the assignment,

875
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:43,600
writing papers.

876
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,120
Besides writing papers,

877
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:45,840
and revising papers.

878
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:46,679
My goodness.

879
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,880
She went to

880
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:53,280
a research centre for heart transplant abroad.

881
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,120
We broke up at the airport.

882
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,880
and wished each other

883
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,680
to build their own fields.

884
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,080
The world of top students

885
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:00,880
Gorgeous.

886
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:01,560
Awesome.

887
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,280
I've integrated into the group.

888
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,360
You too.

889
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,880
You saw it.

890
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:09,840
That one.

891
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,120
Again?

892
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:12,560
Again

893
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:13,640
No.

894
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:16,800
Hello, Qu.

895
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,120
Qiqi, tell me when you get off work.

896
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,080
I'm at your home.

897
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,080
I'm cooking for you and your uncle.

898
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,640
I didn't order anything after work.

899
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,280
Why did my dad bother you again?

900
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:24,800
It's okay.

901
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,720
I'm alone too.

902
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,880
Uncle Qi is alone at home, right?

903
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:28,880
Just a couple.

904
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,960
Just do your work.

905
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,320
Don't always listen to him.

906
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,400
I can't go back.

907
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,120
Go home early. Bye.

908
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,360
Sister Qi.

909
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,200
The handsome guy with milk tea

910
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,760
He even went to your house to cook.

911
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,520
Stop acting weird.

912
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,240
I told you he's not my boyfriend.

913
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,600
He's my dad's friend.

914
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,120
Who would believe that?

915
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,040
But I think this handsome guy

916
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,320
is quite high.

917
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,080
Take care of your dad first.

918
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,800
and then be with you.

919
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,640
Brilliant.

920
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,400
I find your analysis is quite thorough.

921
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,680
How about I introduce him to you?

922
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,120
Didn't you say he looks like a foreigner?

923
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,800
I like Chinese.

924
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:05,520
Me too.

925
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,360
I didn't order anything after work again.

926
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:21,560
She works so hard.

927
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,080
She won't listen no matter how hard I try to persuade her.

928
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,880
Qi, children are blessed by their children.

929
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,200
Since Qi likes it,

930
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,680
we choose to respect it.

931
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,800
Don't think too much. By the way,

932
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,960
My client brought me a bottle of wine today.

933
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,440
Let's try it.

934
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:45,160
No, I don't drink.

935
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,880
It's okay to drink a little.

936
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,200
It helps with sleep, right?

937
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,960
You are always worried about Qi Tuo.

938
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,160
It's time to relax.

939
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,720
Only the two of us know.

940
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,280
Then...

941
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:56,800
A small cup.

942
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,080
I don't want to give you more.

943
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,320
Okay.

944
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:01,520
Here.

945
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,320
Hello, 120, Jiangdong City.

946
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,080
Do you need an ambulance?

947
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,800
