00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:06,040
National Radio. and Telvison. Administration

2
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,680
Are you feeling better?

3
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,520
Open your eyes and see

4
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,080
Is it as blurry as before?

5
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:41,520
A little better.

6
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,120
Come on. Come on. Come on.

7
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,800
Okay, I'll be right there.

8
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,800
I'll be there soon.

9
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,680
How many minutes left, Hwang-yi?

10
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,039
About 20 minutes.

11
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,360
Qi Tuo

12
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,680
This is the first time

13
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,680
in our emergency center.

14
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,039
Everyone gave way.

15
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,120
Was it like this before?

16
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,920
I didn't give in so much before.

17
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,520
When the ambulance passed two years ago,

18
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,840
no matter how hard you press the horn.

19
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,840
I think everyone has improved their quality in the past two years.

20
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,240
If you really give it to them, they will give it to you.

21
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:06,840
It's good.

22
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,840
It can help us

23
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,840
save us a lot of precious time.

24
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,039
and better.

25
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,360
I think it'll get better.

26
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,320
Come on.

27
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,840
Come on

28
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:25,920
Here we are, honey.

29
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,200
Qiu, be careful.

30
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,440
Slow down.

31
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,880
I'm watching

32
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,920
Here we are, honey. Hang in there.

33
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,720
Let's go

34
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,280
It's here

35
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:36,920
Let's go.

36
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:39,920
Doctor!

37
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,560
What's going on?

38
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,320
The lamb water is broken. He has high blood pressure.

39
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,440
I used sulfuric acid.

40
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,040
It's all written down.

41
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:44,640
Okay. Don't worry.

42
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,360
The obstetrics department is here.

43
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,200
Leave it to us.

44
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:46,640
Okay.

45
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,320
Okay.

46
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,640
Thank you.

47
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,680
What are you doing?

48
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,400
What are you doing?

49
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,240
My wife is in poor health.

50
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,079
I lost two children before.

51
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,320
The doctor said this might be the only child

52
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,360
in our life.

53
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,320
If my wife and child are gone,

54
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,920
I don't want to live anymore Thank you

55
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,920
Hua Zi, hurry up.

56
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,520
Go take care of her. Just wait.

57
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,960
Go, go, go.

58
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:11,360
Water.

59
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:15,960
EMSS Emergency.

60
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,280
OK. We’re safe this time.

61
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,000
Applause for ourselves

62
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,200
We should applaud for Hua Zi's wife first

63
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,480
It's not easy

64
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,400
Give me a round of applause.

65
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,200
If you're pregnant, I'll clap for you.

66
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,120
Applause please

67
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,240
OK, applaud for you.

68
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,920
That's more like it.

69
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,400
Let's eat something together.

70
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,560
I was about to have some.

71
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:51,960
Let's go.

72
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:57,920
Come on.

73
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,120
I bought you ice cream.

74
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,280
Thank you, Ms. Chen.

75
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,760
Thank you.

76
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,560
Come on

77
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,800
Here you go.

78
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:08,520
Thank you.

79
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,080
Gao.

80
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:10,840
Zheng Bo.

81
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,080
Have some ice cream.

82
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:12,800
Thank you.

83
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,240
Chen,

84
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,120
Your discrimination is quite obvious.

85
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,240
It's seven or eight yuan more expensive than ours.

86
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:19,680
Eat your ice cream.

87
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,680
Bo, I have something to tell you.

88
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,880
What do you think about what happened last time?

89
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,640
Last time I told you

90
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,960
we became sworn brothers.

91
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,360
I've always wanted a younger brother.

92
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,159
Now my parents know

93
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:36,360
I want you to be my brother.

94
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,120
I really want to see you.

95
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,280
What do you think?

96
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,520
Sister, is it so formal?

97
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,800
Of course.

98
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,240
We'll be family in the future.

99
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,240
My parents want

100
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,680
find you a boyfriend to settle down.

101
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:49,600
Don't worry. I'll be good to you.

102
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,480
Sister Chen is so cool.

103
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,040
Sister, I...

104
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:01,880
I need to take this call.

105
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,480
Answer it.

106
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:03,760
Pick it up here.

107
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,200
It's okay. It doesn't matter.

108
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:05,880
My dad.

109
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,640
It's okay.

110
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,680
Zheng Bo, what are you doing?

111
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,080
Dad, I’m in the handover room.

112
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,040
I'll talk to you outside.

113
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:12,680
Here.

114
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,680
Hello, uncle.

115
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,360
I'm Chen Xue, Zheng Bo's colleague.

116
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,880
Hello, Chen Xue.

117
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,320
Nice to meet you.

118
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:18,960
Dad.

119
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,600
Uncle.

120
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,360
I've been working with Zheng Bo for over a year.

121
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,680
I think he has a good eye for him.

122
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,360
And both of us are the only children.

123
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,600
We want to become sworn brothers.

124
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,200
I hope to get your support and approval.

125
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,360
Dad, don't listen to her nonsense.

126
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,360
I'm not. I'm serious.

127
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,880
My parents really like him.

128
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,280
They wanted to introduce him to someone.

129
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,280
He didn't even introduce me.

130
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,120
Next time, I'll visit you during my vacation.

131
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,120
Zheng Bo has a good colleague like you.

132
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,640
a good sister like you.

133
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,840
Thank you for taking care of him.

134
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,200
Zheng Bo, I'm hanging up.

135
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,760
Okay, Dad, stop talking.

136
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,800
I'm hanging up.

137
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:53,960
Zheng Bo.

138
00:05:59,320 --> 00:05:59,400
0501200.

139
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,400
What do you think?

140
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,840
What do you mean?

141
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,640
If you don't like me,

142
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,760
I won't bother you.

143
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:06,880
That's not what I meant.

144
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,680
Then why do you like me?

145
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,240
Why do you like me?

146
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,560
Because I think you're handsome.

147
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,120
And you work hard and work hard.

148
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,040
Most importantly, I think you're kind.

149
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,240
Isn't it good for us to be together?

150
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,600
Kiki.

151
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,240
First of all, I'm not handsome.

152
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,600
I'm not as hard-working as you said.

153
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,480
or as excellent as you said.

154
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,680
I'm just an ordinary person.

155
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,720
I think you've beautified me.

156
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:46,120
No matter what,

157
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,880
I told you my thoughts.

158
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,720
I have to respect your thoughts.

159
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,440
I understand.

160
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,000
I respect your decision.

161
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,680
The point is

162
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,320
I don't have so many thoughts now.

163
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,040
I...

164
00:06:59,159 --> 00:06:59,280
2005.

165
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,320
05012000

166
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,320
Think about it.

167
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,960
Look.

168
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,840
This is the legendary

169
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,600
drought or drought.

170
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,400
Yuan, you didn't see that.

171
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,720
I really don't know how to do it.

172
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:57,720
Zhang.

173
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,480
Don't just eat.

174
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,280
Look.

175
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,280
He's trying to provoke us

176
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:03,960
Seriously.

177
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,960
Why are you so demanding?

178
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,080
Why are you so picky?

179
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,160
Don't be ridiculous.

180
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,400
I don't have the right to be picky.

181
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,600
I'm from a small county.

182
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,480
I'm just ordinary.

183
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,320
Besides,

184
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,640
if I really meet a girl I like,

185
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,960
how can I

186
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,040
give her a good future?

187
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,520
Then you have someone you like.

188
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,840
Guys.

189
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,760
I'll tell you

190
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,520
I'll tell you immediately.

191
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,280
Okay?

192
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,960
Let's not talk about this.

193
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:31,720
Eat.

194
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:32,640
Okay.

195
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:34,440
He said he was anxious.

196
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:37,919
He said he was anxious.

197
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:39,440
Let's eat.

198
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,120
There's a great movie premiering tomorrow.

199
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:43,799
Are you going to watch it?

200
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,360
No, I'm on duty. I'm busy.

201
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,320
I have something to do this afternoon.

202
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,000
Okay, I'll go by myself.

203
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,560
Come on, this way.

204
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,600
Watch your steps.

205
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,480
Stop watching.

206
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,040
Come on.

207
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,240
Come on, come out and go this way.

208
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,560
I'm sorry.

209
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,360
The patient inside is in an emergency.

210
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,360
This way.

211
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,160
Hello, I'm an ambulance at 120.

212
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:16,760
What's wrong?

213
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,400
A girl is watching a movie.

214
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,640
She's having a seizure all of a sudden.

215
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,760
I think he's sick.

216
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,400
Did you call 120?

217
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,240
Yes.

218
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,400
I'm really sorry.

219
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,480
Ladies and gentlemen, please go out first.

220
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,400
Thank you.

221
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,920
Please make way.

222
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,160
Qianqian, what's wrong with you?

223
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,160
I'm your aunt.

224
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,040
Go away.

225
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,280
Don't do this. Don't scare me.

226
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,800
I'm an ambulance at 120.

227
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,040
Are you the patient's family?

228
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:35,520
Yes.

229
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,240
Did she have a similar disease before?

230
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:37,920
No.

231
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,560
Do you have a family history of epilepsy?

232
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,520
No.

233
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,640
Do you have a headache and disgust recently?

234
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,680
No, Qianqian.

235
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,640
Have you been hurt?

236
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,680
A wound?

237
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,680
No, it's here.

238
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,760
A week ago,

239
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,680
She stepped on the ladder and hung it on the wall.

240
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,480
I think she cut it with a nail.

241
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,920
This is serious.

242
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,160
Did you go to the hospital

243
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,160
It's not that serious.

244
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,400
It's just a wound.

245
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,640
I thought I'd be fine in two days.

246
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,400
You were too careless.

247
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,760
This nail is scratched.

248
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,160
<i>Acinecter bacteria can easily reproduce.</i>

249
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,040
causing tetanus.

250
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,360
Are you her mother?

251
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,920
No, I'm her aunt.

252
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,040
My sister's child

253
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,520
She came from another city to take the art exam

254
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,560
Hold her hand for me.

255
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,880
Don't let her get hurt.

256
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:20,880
Where is the patient?

257
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,640
Here.

258
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,280
Zhang Chi, why are you here?

259
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,040
What happened?

260
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:26,800
I bumped into him.

261
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,040
This kid has a cramp.

262
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,160
The ankle is here.

263
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,640
The nail was scratched. It didn't break the tetanus.

264
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,880
I suspect it's tetanus.

265
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:32,520
Probably.

266
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,040
Is this her family?

267
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:34,480
Yes.

268
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,280
We're going to the hospital now.

269
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:36,520
Are you okay?

270
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,400
Yes.

271
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,760
Here, stretcher. Hurry.

272
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,160
Prepare an vein for her when you get in the car. Hurry.

273
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,560
Slowly.

274
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,160
Don't touch it. Let's do it.

275
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,480
Come on. One, two, three. Up.

276
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,640
Be careful.

277
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,480
Qianqian.

278
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,480
Watch out.

279
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,800
Watch where you're going.

280
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,160
Qianqian, don't scare me.

281
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,480
It's okay.

282
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,400
Your grade will come out in three days.

283
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,760
Ballet is your dream.

284
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,160
You've been practicing for so many years.

285
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,560
It's okay. I'm here.

286
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,680
Stop smoking.

287
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,160
No.

288
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:22,560
Yes.

289
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,520
I'll follow you when you get to the hospital.

290
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,680
Get some rest.

291
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,040
It's not easy to take a day off.

292
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,400
I'm fine too.

293
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,520
The movie is over.

294
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,880
I'll be relieved if I know the result at the hospital.

295
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,800
Why is the heart rate and blood oxygen coming down?

296
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,280
What's wrong?

297
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,880
I'm fine. Don't worry.

298
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,000
Sir, please hurry up.

299
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,360
Are you okay?

300
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,120
How is it?

301
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:01,760
Dr Zhang.

302
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,360
Did you say

303
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,640
Did you say tetanus?

304
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,480
Yes.

305
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,920
What tetanus?

306
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,400
Virus brain inflammation.

307
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,040
We need to do a lot of tests.

308
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:11,600
003306.

309
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,120
He's in there. He's in a coma.

310
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,120
We need to go to ICU.

311
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,640
Here, Dr. Ko.

312
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,480
Fill in this list again.

313
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,040
Okay, I know.

314
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,040
Where are you going?

315
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,160
I want to see the patient's family.

316
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,520
Don't go.

317
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,480
Didn't you see the patient's family

318
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,640
in there?

319
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,520
Don't make it worse.

320
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:33,880
Actually,

321
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,160
it's not your fault.

322
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,640
When the patient came,

323
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,000
It was like a tetanus.

324
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,520
In such an emergency,

325
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,640
Who would've thought that the virus had pneumonia?

326
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,160
Don't blame yourself too much.

327
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,400
Go home.

328
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,760
You scared me.

329
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,680
What are you doing here?

330
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,520
The lights are off.

331
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,480
What are you doing here?

332
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,800
You scared me.

333
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,480
It's about the afternoon.

334
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,560
Did I tell you for nothing?

335
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,520
You're so stubborn.

336
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,640
Why don't you go to bed?

337
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:02,640
Are you serious?

338
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,520
What kind of mental capacity is this?

339
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,760
Don't do this, Zhang Chi.

340
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,640
Let bygones be bygones.

341
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,680
You just need to promise me.

342
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,520
Did you hear me?

343
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:20,920
Zhang Chi,

344
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,400
If you want to be a doctor with zero mistakes,

345
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,920
I'll tell you it's impossible.

346
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,680
You want to make a perfect mistake.

347
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:31,360
This is not realistic.

348
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,280
You're not a god.

349
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,880
Aren't we all humans?

350
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,880
Isn't it normal for people to make mistakes?

351
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,360
We won't do it again.

352
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,560
Just do your best.

353
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,400
I really don't like to see you like this.

354
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,280
Get up. Get up.

355
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,360
Zhang Chi, if you do this again, you...

356
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,120
Look at you.

357
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,040
Do you have to...

358
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,640
Go back to your room and sleep.

359
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,360
Snacks at night are bad for your health.

360
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,640
Why are you here?

361
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:41,880
Something's up.

362
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,880
Zhi Gang told me everything.

363
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,400
Because of your wrong judgment,

364
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,120
because of your wrong judgment.

365
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,480
Is that why you came to me?

366
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,040
No.

367
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,520
I'm here to tell you a story.

368
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,480
I'll leave after I finish.

369
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,280
I don't want to hear it. Go back.

370
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,520
I can't take a few minutes of your time.

371
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:02,800
Okay?

372
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:04,640
0104577.

373
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,280
That day, I received a mission to depart.

374
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,320
500 meters east from Beihai Post Office.

375
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,600
near Gyeongmin Shopping.

376
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,240
The tricycle collides with the tractor.

377
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,160
The two in the car are seriously injured.

378
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,080
Hurry up.

379
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,520
Copy that.

380
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,880
I'll be right there.

381
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,520
But two people got hurt.

382
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,280
We don't have enough cars.

383
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,280
Wang Dabao and Sun Yimo will go too.

384
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,040
Roger.

385
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:40,640
Excuse me.

386
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:44,640
Doctor

387
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,280
Doctor, you're finally here.

388
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,400
Please save my brother.

389
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,400
My brother is dying.

390
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,400
Doctor

391
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,280
Old Gu, you...

392
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,520
Dong Zi.

393
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,480
Go there.

394
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,000
Sir.

395
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,359
Gauze. Gauze.

396
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:14,880
Right away.

397
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:15,880
The gauze is over there.

398
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,040
Here.

399
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:17,880
Gauze.

400
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,280
Okay, right away.

401
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,040
Help me lift it.

402
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,920
One, two, go.

403
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,040
Be careful.

404
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:29,800
One, two, go.

405
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,160
Come on, help me hold it.

406
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,160
Here.

407
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,160
Help me move it.

408
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,120
Let me help you.

409
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,800
No, you're hurt. Stay here.

410
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,280
It's just a scratch.

411
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,880
I got hit here.

412
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,560
But we have to pull him out now.

413
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:55,880
Take it easy.

414
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:56,640
Okay.

415
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,880
Come on, help me

416
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,400
One, two, three.

417
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,480
Don't move.

418
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:08,760
Come on.

419
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,280
Slowly.

420
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:13,880
One, two, three.

421
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:15,640
Are you okay?

422
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,920
One, two, three.

423
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,400
Lift the stretcher.

424
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,920
Stretcher here

425
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,400
Excuse me.

426
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,240
Come on.

427
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:34,640
Here comes the stretcher.

428
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,880
Come on.

429
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,800
One, two, three.

430
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,560
One, two, three.

431
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,680
You were fine just now.

432
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,360
Dude.

433
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,160
What's wrong?

434
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,040
You were fine just now.

435
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,560
Why...

436
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,240
I came here today to tell you

437
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,880
0104577.

438
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,120
Don't blame yourself too much.

439
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:24,920
A doctor

440
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,760
can't understand all diseases.

441
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,040
or guarantee

442
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,160
100% correct.

443
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,040
Because of the complexity of the pathology,

444
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,880
no matter how excellent a doctor is,

445
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,760
can make mistakes.

446
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,240
especially

447
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,520
you can't be tolerant

448
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,520
your mistake.

449
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,000
In that case,

450
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,280
you'll only force yourself

451
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,760
to be a doctor.

452
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,760
Don't be upset

453
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,360
because of a mistake.

454
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,880
You need to learn from failure.

455
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,480
Cheer up.

456
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,040
and go back to work.

457
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,280
and try to save the next patient.

458
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,640
And?

459
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,040
try not to let tragedy happen again.

460
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,240
That's the only thing you should do now.

461
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,760
Okay, the story is over.

462
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,280
I'm leaving.

463
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,680
I'm coming in.

464
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,280
I've been looking for you.

465
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,720
Why are you looking for me?

466
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,800
I want to ask you about Dr. Zhang.

467
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:55,960
How is he?

468
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:56,840
Is he better?

469
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,920
I don't know the details.

470
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,680
But this matter

471
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,440
is a big blow to Chi.

472
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,800
What about Dr. Zhang?

473
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:07,600
I know.

474
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,680
What is this?

475
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,560
A app.

476
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,960
But it's not online yet.

477
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:15,960
During the test,

478
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,800
120 pre-inspection distribution.

479
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,840
Our center made it.

480
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,320
No.

481
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,440
When I was in college,

482
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,800
when I was in college.

483
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,800
Now I want to

484
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,080
to get funds.

485
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,280
Why didn't you tell me before?

486
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,440
My thoughts are immature.

487
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,080
But what happened to Chi

488
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,320
touched me a lot.

489
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,160
So,

490
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,080
I want to take this opportunity to complete it.

491
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,320
Then tell me

492
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,400
Are you interested?

493
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:45,720
Here you go. Here you go.

494
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,680
Look.

495
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,080
the medical equipment in our country

496
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,440
and emergency equipment

497
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,920
are all first-class.

498
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,400
and they are all international.

499
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,160
But the process is not complete yet.

500
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,440
According to scientific statistics,

501
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,480
the number 120

502
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,080
11 percent

503
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,960
needs emergency treatment immediately.

504
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,200
13 percent

505
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,400
needs to be hospitalized.

506
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,200
Only three percent.

507
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,040
needs surgery immediately.

508
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,840
But there's no restriction in our emergency room.

509
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,680
We have to leave after answering the phone.

510
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:22,080
You said you couldn't see patients during the day.

511
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,480
I don't have time to register.

512
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,800
The department won't receive you.

513
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,400
we have to call 120.

514
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,560
Even if we have three heads and six arms,

515
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,560
we won't be able to handle it, right?

516
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,200
Yes, the adjustment center understands.

517
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,720
But it's not his fault.

518
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,400
You want to call 120

519
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,080
they can only call 120.

520
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,800
So I think the fundamental solution

521
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,040
is division.

522
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:43,240
Jiangdong EMSS emergency.

523
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,320
This app

524
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,200
is to

525
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,080
the family and patients

526
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,800
to conduct a preview online

527
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,840
and then distribute it.

528
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,720
and distinguish

529
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,960
in the ICU.

530
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,720
ICU will be assigned to this hospital.

531
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,680
What about mild cases?

532
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,440
According to the size of this disease,

533
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,440
according to the area,

534
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,200
based on the area.

535
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,320
For example, assign them to this community hospital.

536
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,720
This will not only reduce the pressure

537
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,840
but also reduce the patient's anxiety.

538
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,920
and relieve the pressure

539
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,320
and emergency center.

540
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,560
I've set a new section here.

541
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,280
and added an online medical consultation.

542
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,960
Through the internet,

543
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:22,040
through the Internet.

544
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,920
By the way, we can make a lot of emergency knowledge

545
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:25,800
and medical knowledge.

546
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,600
This is good.

547
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,800
You can apply for funds

548
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,040
and send this app and do well.

549
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:31,960
Let me help you.

550
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:34,560
You...

551
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,800
You can't help me.

552
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,840
Why can't I?

553
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,600
When the app comes, It's done.

554
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,960
I will put all my savings

555
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:44,960
into it.

556
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,400
If I don't do well,

557
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,320
I might have to borrow money.

558
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:49,840
You

559
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,960
don't waste your time on me.

560
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,080
I'm not wasting time.

561
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,560
Liking you is my business.

562
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,400
Zheng Bo.

563
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,600
0106 Train Team.

564
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,960
Parents are calling from unit 3 of Lim Young Sa-ri Community.

565
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,440
The kid is not feeling well at home alone.

566
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,680
Please go there immediately.

567
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,040
Roger.

568
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:44,800
Excuse me.

569
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,440
Be careful.

570
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,160
My baby.

571
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,200
Are you her parent?

572
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,440
Yes, I am.

573
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,400
We suspect that

574
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,200
she ate something bad.

575
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,560
Let's go in for a check-up now.

576
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,680
What happened to you

577
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,440
I can't even open my eyes.

578
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:58,680
What's wrong?

579
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,000
When the kid called me earlier,

580
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:00,760
he was fine.

581
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,320
Why did it become like this suddenly?

582
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,280
No, let go.

583
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,960
Ma'am, she needs a check-up.

584
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,240
Can you let her in for a check-up first?

585
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:06,680
Let go.

586
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,560
Let me tell you.

587
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,160
Excuse me.

588
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,560
What should we do?

589
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,200
Did you delay

590
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,760
Did you delay it?

591
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,520
We rushed to your house

592
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,040
we rushed to your house immediately.

593
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,520
and sent it here without any delay.

594
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,160
Are you Jia's father?

595
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:21,640
Yes.

596
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,120
The child has been sent for a check-up.

597
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,640
This is the kid's check-up notice.

598
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,640
Please sign it.

599
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:26,720
I'll sign it.

600
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:27,160
Yes.

601
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:27,760
Sign it.

602
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,960
Sign it first. We'll tell you after signing it.

603
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:29,360
Okay?

604
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:29,760
Sign it.

605
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,240
Sign it. The kid is waiting.

606
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,960
Give it to me. Stop it.

607
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:34,960
I'm waiting for a check-up.

608
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:36,960
Okay.

609
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,160
I remember the worker number.

610
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:39,880
Don't run!

611
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:40,600
I'll remember you.

612
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,520
Just you wait.

613
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,240
Don't forget.

614
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:46,640
Baby.

615
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,280
It hurts, right?

616
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,840
It's all my fault.

617
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,440
I shouldn't leave you alone at home.

618
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,200
It's all my fault.

619
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,560
Can you be gentle?

620
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,880
Her blood vessel is too thin.

621
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:00,760
Hang in there.

622
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,960
Auntie, do it again.

623
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,640
Again?

624
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:05,880
Can you do it?

625
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,080
It's not that your child doesn't care about you, right?

626
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:07,560
No.

627
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,080
Do you want me to do it again?

628
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:09,800
What happened?

629
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,840
Her blood vessel is too thin to get in.

630
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:12,640
I'm the head nurse.

631
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:13,560
I'll do it.

632
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,800
It'll be fine this time.

633
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,440
Look at your hospital.

634
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,520
Are you responsible?

635
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,480
Find an intern nurse to tie the baby.

636
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,560
How about this?

637
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,120
Parents, this is the ward. You need to be quiet.

638
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,360
If you yell here,

639
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,960
will affect our rescue.

640
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,280
The child is quite serious.

641
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,280
He needs some rest.

642
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,560
Why don't you wait outside?

643
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,640
We'll take care of him.

644
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,520
A loser.

645
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,040
Something is wrong with the family.

646
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:54,880
Be careful later.

647
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,280
It's nothing.

648
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,880
The doctor just said

649
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,040
the child may be in a coma.

650
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,560
If it's serious,

651
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,600
his life might be in danger.

652
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,480
Let me tell you this.

653
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,280
I'm divorced.

654
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,400
I'm single.

655
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,520
Only one kid.

656
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,920
He's lying in there today.

657
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,160
If anything happens to him today,

658
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,040
I'll die.

659
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:21,680
Let's go.

660
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,240
A 60-year-old man with brain hemorrhage.

661
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:23,640
Let's go.

662
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,000
Stop. Stop. No one is allowed to leave.

663
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,600
Stop! Don't go!

664
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,240
How about this?

665
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,800
I'll stay and solve the problem with you.

666
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,560
Can you let them go out first?

667
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,480
No.

668
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,000
Saving people is more important.

669
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,400
Okay, I think it's good.

670
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,000
Go. Go.

671
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,320
Saving people is more important. Hurry up.

672
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,720
Let's go.

673
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,760
Hurry up, listen to me.

674
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,040
Hurry up.

675
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,280
Let's go.

676
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,560
Qiu, Huang, take out the stretcher.

677
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,320
Come on.

678
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,040
Let's solve the problem.

679
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,560
Come on, let's solve it.

680
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:46,960
Come on.

681
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,400
Tell me.

682
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,520
Dr. Huang, this is Jia Jia's father.

683
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:52,720
Here's the thing.

684
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:56,000
The patient is having throat edema and breathing difficulty.

685
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,880
We thought about what he touched 577

686
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,040
caused by something 577.

687
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,640
If it doesn't relieve,

688
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,080
we might need to cut the tracheotomy.

689
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,120
The family needs to be prepared.

690
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,360
Is his life in danger?

691
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,040
I'm not sure.

692
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,800
If the child is gone,

693
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,520
what's the point of my life?

694
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:26,880
Hu, call security.

695
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:28,800
Calm down.

696
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,280
I'm going to die with my baby.

697
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,000
Calm down.

698
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,040
Well, it's not a good idea to be anxious.

699
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,200
What's the use?

700
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,920
How is it, doctor?

701
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,160
Is there any sequela?

702
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,840
His wound is deep,

703
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,360
but after the follow-up rehabilitation treatment,

704
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,640
the normal life function will be fine.

705
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,200
I see.

706
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,280
He was a cardiac surgeon.

707
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,640
He always wanted to return to the operating table.

708
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:20,960
If that's the case,

709
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,640
will it affect his future?

710
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,600
To pick up the scalpel again,

711
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,240
to

712
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:32,920
It's a little difficult.

713
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,800
Doctor, does he know it himself?

714
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,600
The first thing he asked

715
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:44,920
when he woke up.

716
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,360
I told him the truth.

717
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,560
What did he say?

718
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,600
He just said thank you.

719
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:54,360
He didn't say anything else.

720
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:58,720
I have a question.

721
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,160
if the post-stage rehabilitation treatment is done,

722
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:01,840
008401.

723
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,040
How much can he recover to his original state?

724
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,120
008401.

725
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:05,600
The probability is 3401.

726
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,600
08401.

727
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:07,920
It's very low.

728
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,280
Okay, that's all for now.

729
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,880
Doctor, thank you.

730
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,360
Okay.

731
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,160
Okay.

732
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,280
Qi Qi, calm down.

733
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:31,520
How about this?

734
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,240
Mr. Lu and I have a meeting later.

735
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,640
Stay here with him.

736
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,800
Okay.

737
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:36,880
You go back first. It's okay.

738
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,040
Take care.

739
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:47,880
Jiangdong EMSS is in a hurry.

740
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,960
It's okay. It's just a minor injury.

741
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,360
I didn't say it can't be completely recovered.

742
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,360
It's possible no matter how low the probability is.

743
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:57,520
Zhang Chi.

744
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,000
Leave me alone.

745
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:06,880
Okay.

746
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:45,800
Mom, I won the first prize in the composition contest.

747
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,520
Really?

748
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,520
Amazing.

749
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,080
What's the title of the essay?

750
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,080
Tell me.

751
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:53,320
The essay title is my dream.

752
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:58,040
My dream is to become a cardiac surgeon.

753
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,920
Because my mom

754
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:04,440
is an excellent cardiac surgeon.

755
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,560
She said

756
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:09,080
a heart is the most fragile place

757
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,680
and the strongest place.

758
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,680
We must protect her.

759
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,920
She's like the sun.

760
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,520
warm and helping patients.

761
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:22,320
I want to be like her

762
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,200
like her.

763
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,800
and overcome the disease.

764
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,200
and become someone like her.

765
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:29,200
is my biggest dream.

766
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,320
Really?

767
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,760
Chi is amazing.

768
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,560
I'm not used to it without Dr. Zhang.

769
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,000
We've been working together for so long.

770
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,640
I wonder how he is.

771
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,280
If not, we'll have a day off.

772
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,280
Let's go and see him.

773
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,440
Sure.

774
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:57,480
Get in the car.

775
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,280
Stop dawdling. Hurry up.

776
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:58,800
Okay.

777
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,880
Have you heard about it?

778
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,239
Dr Zhang is in the hospital.

779
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:11,800
in order to stop a family member from hurting himself.

780
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,840
I heard.

781
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,280
It's quite serious.

782
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,840
He may never be able to perform surgery again.

783
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:21,120
If such a talented doctor

784
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:23,440
If you can't carry a scalpel anymore,

785
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,159
it'll be a pity for everyone.

786
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,600
Yeah.

787
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,400
Zhang Chi has been thinking about going back to Cardio Surgery.

788
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:30,920
This hand...

789
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,520
Thank you for coming.

790
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:51,800
Dr. Zhang, we heard that

791
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:54,000
you can't go back to the operating table because of your injury.

792
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:56,719
So we came here as soon as we had a rest.

793
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,720
to see how your hand recovered.

794
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,960
Chi, I have a relative

795
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,440
who knows experts in this field.

796
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,080
Shall I ask

797
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:05,920
if there's any other way.

798
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,040
Thank you.

799
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,480
Look at our relationship.

800
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,040
No need to thank me.

801
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,560
Dr Zhang, may I bother you?

802
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,920
Someone came to see me.

803
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,160
Why don't you go back first?

804
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,480
Brother, you're still seeing a doctor?

805
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:24,280
Oh my god.

806
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,800
We're leaving.

807
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,160
I'll visit you when I'm free.

808
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:27,600
Okay.

809
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,920
Don't forget to eat that big trotter.

810
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,480
It's good for your health.

811
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,040
No.

812
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,600
Why don't you take my stuff back?

813
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,720
No.

814
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:35,720
Dr Zhang.

815
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,280
I've brought you the film.

816
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:40,920
My nephew

817
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,120
is too young.

818
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,160
His family disagrees with his surgery.

819
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,040
Do you have

820
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,720
a more conservative treatment?

821
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:14,160
Mika!

822
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:46,840
Thank goodness.

823
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,160
I'm so grateful, Dr Zhang.

824
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:48,800
I'm so grateful

825
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,480
Thank you, Dr Zhang.

826
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,120
You're welcome.

827
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:51,840
Thank you so much.

828
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:52,800
Take care.

829
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,360
Don't worry. I'll visit you next time.

830
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,280
Okay, thank you.

831
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,480
Bye.

832
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,280
Bye.

833
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,160
Are you okay?

834
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,360
You're so well-mannered.

835
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:04,720
You're in a good ward.

836
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,240
You've turned it into an outpatient clinic.

837
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:09,280
No, it's just that colleague or classmate.

838
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,280
and the people they introduced.

839
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,360
asked me to see a doctor.

840
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,240
You're treating her yourself.

841
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,360
Look at your hands.

842
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,720
You should take care of yourself

843
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,040
and make fun of others?

844
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,600
I can't do this surgery anyway.

845
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,720
I'll do what I can.

846
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,480
I'm happy

847
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,400
to help patients like this.

848
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:30,840
Eat something.

849
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:33,720
Neck neck

850
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,160
It's a bit high

851
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,480
My legs are pressed again.

852
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:40,720
Get up.

853
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:41,840
Is this okay?

854
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:42,360
Sure.

855
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,480
But it doesn't matter.

856
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:49,440
I can go to the research center to study the assignment.

857
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:50,480
Well,

858
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,160
I've been thinking a lot these days.

859
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:55,680
It's quite contradictory.

860
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,840
I have my personal emotions

861
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,120
as a doctor.

862
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,480
I can't do surgery.

863
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,600
I think it's good

864
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,360
I think it's good.

865
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,240
At least you showed me hope.

866
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:14,920
Right?

867
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,600
Yes, Dr. Jang.

868
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,480
It's already happened.

869
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:20,520
you have to accept it.

870
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,680
Accept it before changing, right?

871
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:23,600
Yes.

872
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:24,360
Come on.

873
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:25,040
Right?

874
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:29,360
Thank you.

875
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,240
Why are you shivering? What's wrong with your hand?

876
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,280
Aren't you here to see a patient?

877
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,160
Are you...

878
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,040
I'm a bit...

879
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:52,920
Come on. Let's do it again.

880
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:00,040
Okay.

881
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,400
Did you buy the porridge?

882
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:02,720
Of course.

883
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,680
He made it with leftovers.

884
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,680
Just leftovers.

885
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,040
It's edible

886
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,360
Really? Yes.

887
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,240
You lied to me again.

888
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,800
He doesn't usually use that.

889
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:16,840
I can't taste it.

890
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:20,840
Try it again.

891
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,680
I think it's quite fresh.

892
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,160
Let me try it again.

893
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:28,360
The rest.

894
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:30,600
He is...

895
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:31,400
Impossible.

896
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:34,360
Didn't you buy it for me?

897
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:38,480
You can't drink it.

898
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:39,480
No.

899
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,120
Just make some vegetables

900
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:45,040
Right, there should be some pickles

901
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,600
No pickles are sold there.

902
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,120
I didn't take it. They asked me if I wanted it.

903
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,840
Your dad really takes good care of you.

904
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,200
You don't even know that porridge goes with pickles.

905
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,360
Give me two

906
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,160
No, it's not heavy.

907
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,360
I can carry it. Hurry up.

908
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,480
This is my right hand.

909
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,840
Can I take it with my left hand?

910
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,480
Don't shake that. Put it back.

911
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:10,680
Give me your phone.

912
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:11,800
Give me your phone.

913
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:12,920
Give me the toothpick.

914
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:13,920
Give me this. Come on.

915
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,160
Don't move that.

916
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,520
Enough. Go now.

917
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,720
We're almost there.

918
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,240
Don't shake it. Don't shake it.

919
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:22,840
Give it to me.

920
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,680
We agreed to drink this much today.

921
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:28,720
Look how much you poured.

922
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,600
Do you want your hand?

923
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:30,800
I'm happy.

924
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,600
It's good for blood circulation.

925
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,040
What quack? Nonsense.

926
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,400
When did he say that? Hurry up.

927
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:35,840
Here.

928
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,200
I wanted to tell you a big secret.

929
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:42,280
HitBLA.

930
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,000
Big secret.

931
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,000
It's huge, it's related to you.

932
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,120
Me?

933
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:49,520
Yes.

934
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:50,800
Then five.

935
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,080
Five?

936
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,040
The one in that pot.

937
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,080
in the pot.

938
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:58,200
My jellyfish

939
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:03,440
The five of them are jellyfish.

940
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,320
Because you were hospitalized,

941
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:07,200
I didn't dare to tell you.

942
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,080
I didn't want you to get angry.

943
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,200
Impossible. How could they...

944
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,040
Yes, I know.

945
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:12,840
This...

946
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:13,800
Listen to me.

947
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,200
They look exactly like jellyfish.

948
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,160
