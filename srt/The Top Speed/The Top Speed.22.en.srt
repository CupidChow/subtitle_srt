1
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:06,040
National Radio. and Telvison. Administration.

2
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,440
Are you looking for me?

3
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,920
"Look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look." "Look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look." "Look, you're here."

4
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,920
on my home.

5
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,440
You don't have to teach my mom how to cook.

6
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,280
She can't learn it.

7
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,440
I was going to teach her

8
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,440
how to use those electronics.

9
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,400
With a microwave.

10
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,960
Later she said you like ribs.

11
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,560
So I taught her a few dishes.

12
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,920
Just a few dishes.

13
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:01,680
Thank you.

14
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,040
You're welcome.

15
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,280
This is for you.

16
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:06,760
What is it?

17
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,039
I didn't see it.

18
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,039
Your dad asked me to give it to you.

19
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,160
You went to see him?

20
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:13,800
Yes.

21
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,680
I went to talk to him yesterday afternoon.

22
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,200
I think your relationship

23
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,680
awkward here.

24
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,560
I was wondering if it could help.

25
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,800
He gave me this and asked me to give it to you.

26
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,280
He and I

27
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,200
can't be solved in a few days.

28
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,040
Give me some time.

29
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,920
I want to share with you.

30
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,160
I know.

31
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,160
Go back and keep her company.

32
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:43,520
Okay.

33
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:44,800
I'm leaving.

34
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,320
Shu Hua.

35
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,680
I'm here to see you.

36
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,280
I'm afraid

37
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,520
I'll break my promise.

38
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,280
My son has grown up.

39
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,320
He wants to know the truth.

40
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,960
It's time

41
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,640
what happened back then.

42
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,080
September 15, 1983.

43
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,560
Today is the first time

44
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,800
since I graduated.

45
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,680
Now we're ready to remove

46
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,040
the left ventricle tumor.

47
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,760
A large blood vessel surrounded by a tumor.

48
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,920
We need to be extra careful.

49
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,399
Yes, Professor Wang.

50
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,040
March 5, 1985.

51
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,000
Today is a memorable day.

52
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,640
I've never had such a long surgery.

53
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,680
7 hours and 15 minutes.

54
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,000
The surgery is unprecedented.

55
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,320
Thank goodness.

56
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,880
We did it.

57
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,520
This case

58
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,720
is worth studying.

59
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,480
And the bigger surprise is coming.

60
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,440
November 28, 1987.

61
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,280
Chi is one year old today.

62
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,280
Are you tired today?

63
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,400
Not bad. What about you?

64
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,159
I'm not tired.

65
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,040
By the way,

66
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,040
Chi called me dad yesterday.

67
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,480
Really?

68
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,080
Yes.

69
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,680
Our son is so young and he calls him dad.

70
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,200
He's a genius.

71
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,400
Of course. You have to see who his father is.

72
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,640
You're so annoying.

73
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:07,640
Look

74
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,320
That's Dr. Zhang

75
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,560
with that widow Wang.

76
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,640
Really?

77
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
They are good.

78
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,680
Don't talk nonsense.

79
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,400
Listen.

80
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,160
Sister-in-law Gui Zhi told me herself.

81
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,040
They were all like that.

82
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,160
What is that?

83
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,640
Forget it.

84
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,520
We're neighbors.

85
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,800
Let's go.

86
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,920
What is that?

87
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,040
Stop it. He's here.

88
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,400
On this street,

89
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,240
in this street.

90
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,760
On July 9, 1989,

91
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,400
Rumors about Beihai and Chen Guizhi

92
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,400
is getting worse.

93
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,640
I don't think we can go on like this.

94
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,200
We have to end this.

95
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,680
Shu Hua, aren't we having dinner together?

96
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,680
Why did you invite Guizhi?

97
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,400
I need to talk to her.

98
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,560
The three of us can

99
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,680
with each other.

100
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,080
What do you want to talk about?

101
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,080
There are some rumors in the company recently.

102
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,520
I don't like it.

103
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,560
I don't want to wait any longer.

104
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,040
I just hope it can be solved as soon as possible.

105
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:20,800
Guizhi.

106
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,680
No matter what evidence you can bring out,

107
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,560
I won't believe

108
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,920
Beihai has an affair with you

109
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,560
What is it?

110
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,400
Personal love.

111
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,400
She went to the hospital to see me.

112
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,640
She said you two have been together for over a year.

113
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,680
and said you wanted me to quit.

114
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,159
You...

115
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,640
Guizhi.

116
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,200
How could you say that?

117
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,280
We're innocent.

118
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,400
You...

119
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,680
Calm down.

120
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,560
Listen to me first.

121
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,440
Guizhi.

122
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,280
You know what?

123
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,920
From the day I took the college entrance exam

124
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,200
I've known Beihai

125
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:09,800
At that time

126
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,640
he was still

127
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,520
who just entered the emergency station.

128
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,520
Over the past decade,

129
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,680
we've been through

130
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,320
We've been through a lot together.

131
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,880
We have the same values

132
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,920
and ideals.

133
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,920
I know Beihai

134
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,760
I trust his character unconditionally

135
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,919
Because I know

136
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:34,840
in the heart of Beihai

137
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,600
there is a very important thing

138
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,520
is to cure patients.

139
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,360
That kind of faith

140
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,360
almost occupies his whole life.

141
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,160
In such a spiritual world,

142
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,040
you will never understand.

143
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,120
The three of us are sitting here today.

144
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,680
no matter what you say or do,

145
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,160
no matter what you say or do.

146
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,360
But I still want to be honest with you.

147
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,600
no matter what you do,

148
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:03,840
no matter what you do.

149
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,760
our relationship

150
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,000
Because Beihai and I

151
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,360
can't be separated by an outsider

152
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,520
Do you understand?

153
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,440
I'm sorry.

154
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,120
I didn't know she would tell you this.

155
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,080
Why didn't you tell me?

156
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,320
Beihai

157
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,160
It's not a big deal.

158
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,080
You're so busy at work.

159
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:55,760
It's not worth it.

160
00:09:59,040 --> 00:09:59,920
Shu Hua.

161
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,120
Thank you.

162
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,000
Chi.

163
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,240
I believe you've seen

164
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,760
your mom's diary.

165
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,320
Let's talk face to face.

166
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,840
I'm here to tell you the truth.

167
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,840
This is my mom's diary, right?

168
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:06,720
Yes.

169
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,680
Twenty years ago,

170
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,800
At that time,

171
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,320
your mother was the youngest

172
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,680
in the city.

173
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,440
She's so ambitious.

174
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,560
She went to the hospital during the day

175
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,960
and at night,

176
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,520
I have to study the treatment plan.

177
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,400
The pressure is getting bigger.

178
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,080
I haven't slept for days

179
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,920
It's a common meal.

180
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,360
My wife is back.

181
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,720
Have some water.

182
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:01,680
You must be tired.

183
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,280
Thank you.

184
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:03,520
Listen.

185
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,680
Take a good rest.

186
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,320
I'll call you when the meal is ready.

187
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,080
Come on.

188
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,720
Let me help you.

189
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,320
Don't move.

190
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,800
Don’t go in the kitchen. Have a good rest.

191
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,120
Shu Hua

192
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,080
often worked until very late.

193
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,160
I can't share her pressure at work.

194
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,680
I can only take care of her in life.

195
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,440
As her medical skills get better,

196
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,320
more and more patients

197
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,880
came to see her.

198
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,640
Dr. Qin, how is my dad?

199
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,000
Don't worry. The surgery went well.

200
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,000
Dr. Qin, thank you.

201
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,760
Thank you so much.

202
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,960
You still operated on my dad when you were pregnant.

203
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,320
Our whole family

204
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,000
will be grateful to you.

205
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,000
Tonight,

206
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,360
in the ICU tonight.

207
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,000
He can be transferred to the general ward tomorrow.

208
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,800
Dr. Qin.

209
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,560
The patient in bed 403 is dying.

210
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,200
Got it.

211
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,320
Don't worry.

212
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:11,680
Wipe your sweat.

213
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,320
Dr. Qin,

214
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,040
Your back is wet.

215
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,160
It's okay.

216
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,400
The director said

217
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,320
not to exceed three operations a day.

218
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,520
This is the fifth one.

219
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,160
You shouldn't have picked up.

220
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,880
So is the patient's family.

221
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,240
He insisted on asking you to do it.

222
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,360
No one can do it.

223
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,400
Zhi Gang.

224
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,480
Do you know

225
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,880
their families sleep on the floor in the hospital.

226
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,960
The elderly suddenly got worse today.

227
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,040
I'm his doctor.

228
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,800
Naturally, I'll do the surgery.

229
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,320
You have a bad attitude.

230
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:05,160
You can't do this to the patient and family in the future.

231
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,040
I know. I won't do this again.

232
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,680
I'm just worried about your health.

233
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,120
Dr. Qin.

234
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,240
Are you okay?

235
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,560
Dr. Qin.

236
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,680
Thank you so much.

237
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,840
We came here to thank you.

238
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:23,960
You're welcome.

239
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,840
The surgery went well.

240
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,160
He'll be discharged in two weeks.

241
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,000
Then my dad's heart disease

242
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,400
with his heart again, right?

243
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,160
The patient is very serious this time.

244
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,600
Although the surgery was a success,

245
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,160
we still need to

246
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,880
it depends on the recovery condition at home.

247
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,720
When you go back,

248
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,880
when you go back.

249
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,760
Remember to bring the patient back for a check-up.

250
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,320
What do you mean?

251
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,280
You said it's 100% cured.

252
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,560
What do you mean by that?

253
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,400
It's not like that.

254
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,120
Doctor, please help us.

255
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,720
Did we do something wrong?

256
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,120
That's not what I meant.

257
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,920
If you can't cure me today, I won't let you off.

258
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,000
Who are you messing with?

259
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,560
Why don't you go to the deity?

260
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,560
Who do you think you are?

261
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,120
I'm talking to a doctor.

262
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,120
Why are you butting in?

263
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,800
Every patient has a different condition.

264
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,200
You want every doctor

265
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,720
to heal them, right?

266
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,920
Buy something and buy something to talk.

267
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,960
You like it?

268
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,240
We don't mean anything else.

269
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,840
We just want father to be safe.

270
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:22,680
I know.

271
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,080
I understand how you feel.

272
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,520
But surgery is risky.

273
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,840
If you don't want to take the risk,

274
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,680
if you don't want to take the risk.

275
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,520
You're not that good as a doctor.

276
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,120
It's all your hospital's doing

277
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,080
to trick us.

278
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:32,400
You...

279
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,120
Where is the family of the patient in bed Two?

280
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,200
Come and have a look.

281
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,200
What are you doing here?

282
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,440
Coming.

283
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:37,840
Let's go.

284
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,400
Don't be angry.

285
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,080
I'm not angry, so are you.

286
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:46,800
I'm not angry.

287
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,960
Don't touch the fetus.

288
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,200
What food did you bring me?

289
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,360
Fried egg with green melon.

290
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,400
I made you

291
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,640
a yellow croaker.

292
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,120
You've worked hard today.

293
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,360
Not at all.

294
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:05,960
Delicious.

295
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:16,839
Are you okay?

296
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,960
Even if you meet a patient

297
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,599
who don't understand her,

298
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:24,160
Shu Hua will be patient with them.

299
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,839
But after a few years,

300
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,760
she became worse and worse.

301
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,640
She needs to take painkillers

302
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,760
to make her feel better.

303
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,840
You've been having a stomachache for so long.

304
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,120
I asked you to take leave but you didn't.

305
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,840
Shu Hua, you're a doctor.

306
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,560
You are not made of steel.

307
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,960
Take care of yourself.

308
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,840
Stomachache, artery,

309
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,120
and a disc disc.

310
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,800
It's the doctor's problem.

311
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,560
Just bear with it.

312
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,920
There are so many patients in the hospital.

313
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,200
How can I ask for leave?

314
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,680
Since you were in charge of the surgery,

315
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,720
the first successful heart transplant in the city,

316
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,400
I'm quite happy.

317
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,440
On the newspaper and on TV

318
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,440
on the newspaper and TV.

319
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,120
But more and more people are looking for you.

320
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,400
I'm really unhappy.

321
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:35,680
If you say so,

322
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,120
then I can't take a leave.

323
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,800
If I rest one more day,

324
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,720
the patient will have to wait for me one more day.

325
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,080
It's useless to say anything to you.

326
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,360
Let me tell you.

327
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,520
I asked you to take leave but you didn't.

328
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,200
Later.

329
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,520
I'll ask for leave with your boss.

330
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,840
Don't make a fuss.

331
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,520
I'm fine now.

332
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,400
I'm in good condition. I'm fine.

333
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,120
You haven't slept for days.

334
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:58,840
Let me tell you.

335
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,200
When I get to the hospital,

336
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,640
and stand on the operating table,

337
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,680
I'm really energetic.

338
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,640
Don't worry. I'm fine.

339
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,400
When is he coming?

340
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,840
Why hasn't he come yet

341
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,360
It's been so long.

342
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,080
Why hasn't it started yet?

343
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,280
Dr. Qin,

344
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,200
We've been on the train for 36 hours.

345
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,960
Please help my dad.

346
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,000
Dr. Qin

347
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,760
Dr. Qin, my daughter is only one and a half years old.

348
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,840
She has congenital heart disease

349
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,520
Please save her.

350
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,040
Please.

351
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,520
Director Qin.

352
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,960
I got pregnant at 42.

353
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,720
The doctor said I had a heart attack.

354
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,960
What should I do? Help me.

355
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,160
Don't panic. Line up.

356
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,600
One by one.

357
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,200
I will call all of you.

358
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:34,840
Okay?

359
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,520
Okay, thank you, Dr. Qin

360
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,320
Don't worry.

361
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,160
Line up first.

362
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,160
Don't worry.

363
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:37,480
Okay.

364
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,080
Next.

365
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:49,640
Hello, Dr. Qin.

366
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,080
Have a seat.

367
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,400
What's wrong?

368
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,600
I feel

369
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,720
the heart rate is not enough.

370
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,960
My heart is not feeling well.

371
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,120
Okay, I'll listen to it first.

372
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,680
Next.

373
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,760
Hello, Wang Da Bao. What's up?

374
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,200
Hai, there was an explosion at the third People's Square outside the south gate.

375
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,840
A dozen people were seriously injured.

376
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,200
We're short-handed.

377
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,480
The director asked you to come back quickly.

378
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:33,400
Okay, I got it.

379
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,640
Ask Gu and Dong Zi to go first.

380
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,640
I'll meet you at the scene in 15 minutes.

381
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:37,640
Okay.

382
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,960
Nurse, please do me a favor.

383
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,960
Get some hot water for Dr. Qin later.

384
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,600
I have an emergency mission to take.

385
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,080
Okay?

386
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,080
Okay, got it.

387
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:48,720
Thank you

388
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:57,880
Excuse me

389
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,600
Excuse me. Be careful.

390
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,280
Excuse me

391
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,160
Slow down

392
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,160
What's going on

393
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,480
Excuse me

394
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,640
Make way Don't block the way

395
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,520
Save my son!

396
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,600
You're so irresponsible.

397
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,080
Don't be sad.

398
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:20,480
Doctor Wang.

399
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,480
This is the burn patient who exploded in the boiler.

400
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,280
How are his vitals?

401
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,080
What famous doctor?

402
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,280
You can't save my son.

403
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,600
You are so irresponsible.

404
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,200
The patient is breathing.

405
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,400
Call Dr Zhang back now.

406
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,640
Hai, the patient is dying.

407
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,520
Go in and have a look.

408
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,760
Dr Zhang, this way.

409
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,480
The patient is not breathing well.

410
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,280
We're short-handed.

411
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,400
Please intubate him.

412
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:43,960
Okay.

413
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:09,640
What's wrong?

414
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,280
Are you in a bad mood?

415
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:15,560
Here.

416
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,720
I'll peel an apple for you.

417
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:18,640
Okay?

418
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,080
Tell me.

419
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,080
Tell me if you're unhappy.

420
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,320
Tell me

421
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:46,720
Beihai

422
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,400
I think

423
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,480
I'm really sinful.

424
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,400
What are you talking about?

425
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,200
What sin?

426
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,760
You think you're useless.

427
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,840
Useless.

428
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,040
I've been studying for so many years.

429
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,640
and became a doctor for more than ten years.

430
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,720
But I can't even save the patient's life.

431
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,200
We are doctors.

432
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,400
We can cure patients.

433
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,320
but we can't save him.

434
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,520
I can't.

435
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,200
Then why call a doctor?

436
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,720
You should know

437
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,280
Isn't medicine a miracle?

438
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,960
Doctors are humans, not gods.

439
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,640
You're so harsh on yourself.

440
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,480
You'll drag yourself down.

441
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,720
The burden on your mom

442
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,400
is too heavy.

443
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,640
Except the pressure of work,

444
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,920
and the patient's complaints,

445
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,160
and me.

446
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,040
I hurt her more.

447
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,360
Do you remember

448
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,480
you were at home alone that year?

449
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,120
You got gas poisoning and went to the hospital?

450
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,240
After fighting with your mom,

451
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,640
I came back to apologize to her.

452
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
But it turned out to be worse.

453
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,400
I couldn't control my emotions.

454
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:23,920
I had a big fight with her in the hospital.

455
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:31,520
Shu Hua.

456
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,400
I'm sorry.

457
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,160
I'm sorry.

458
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,480
It's my fault.

459
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,440
I failed to control my emotions.

460
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:39,880
Please forgive me.

461
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,760
Why didn't you control yourself?

462
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,400
First,

463
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
because of the child.

464
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,040
I don't want to hurt Chi

465
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,000
because of our negligence.

466
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:51,600
Second,

467
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,000
when I went to work today,

468
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,360
a patient passed away.

469
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,240
I was in a bad mood.

470
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,760
It's the pressure of work.

471
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,400
Work pressure.

472
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,520
So you're taking it out on me?

473
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:08,520
No.

474
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,280
I didn't mean that. I also...

475
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,280
That's not what I mean

476
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,600
You did the same thing Zhang Beihai

477
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,480
You asked me to choose

478
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,160
Let me tell you.

479
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,640
I always have emergency surgeries.

480
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,000
I have more than 100 patients in the hospital.

481
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:19,880
How should I choose?

482
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Calm down.

483
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,000
Let's move on, okay?

484
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,640
Lower your voice. This is the hospital.

485
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,400
Okay.

486
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,680
He's sick. I'm sorry.

487
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,160
Calm down.

488
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,280
Don't touch me

489
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:34,000
Zhang Beihai we can't get over this

490
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,400
And Chen Guizhi

491
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,600
I didn't expect

492
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,880
what she did to our relationship

493
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,800
and eventually became a dagger

494
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,160
who hurt your mother.

495
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,600
Then why did Uncle Sun say

496
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,880
he saw you hugging Chen Gui Zhi?

497
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:00,800
Where did he see it?

498
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,800
He said the one behind the yard.

499
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:08,640
Brother Zhang.

500
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,360
Since you helped me so much,

501
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,880
I really can't tolerate anyone else.

502
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:12,880
Brother Zhang.

503
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,760
Guizhi, don't do this.

504
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,040
I have a lover and a child.

505
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,160
Brother Zhang.

506
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,000
Brother Zhang, I can't live without you.

507
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,920
My life is meaningless without you.

508
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,640
I can't live anymore.

509
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,160
Brother.

510
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:24,760
Guizhi.

511
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,400
Tell me if you have any pressure.

512
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,360
I can help you.

513
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,920
But you don't have to think about other things.

514
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,160
Chen Guizhi and I

515
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,000
with Chen Guizhi.

516
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,040
We never met again.

517
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,280
But I didn't expect

518
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,120
I saw you with Chen Gui Zhi.

519
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,160
Were you two together long ago?

520
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,600
Did you plan to

521
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,400
to dump Chi and me?

522
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:05,880
Shu Hua.

523
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,040
Were you dreaming?

524
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,480
What dream?

525
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,880
Do you think I can pretend that

526
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,880
if you avoid this question?

527
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:14,800
Do you

528
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,400
want to be with Chen Guizhi long ago?

529
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,280
Why did you let me see

530
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,640
you two being together?

531
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,880
His child calls you dad.

532
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,360
Why did you agree?

533
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,640
Why did you do that?

534
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,280
Are you a man?

535
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,280
Why not?

536
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,760
Why didn't you tell me openly?

537
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:31,800
Why?

538
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,040
I thought

539
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,480
she had too much pressure.

540
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,600
and lost control.

541
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,760
I just need to compromise

542
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,600
and protect her,

543
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,000
she will get better.

544
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,000
Unexpectedly,

545
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,880
her condition was getting worse.

546
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,640
Sometimes excited, sometimes depressed.

547
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,760
Sometimes,

548
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,120
hurt others and herself.

549
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,880
Shu Hua, what are you doing?

550
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,760
Put down the knife.

551
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,920
What are you doing? Put down the knife.

552
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,600
What are you doing?

553
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,400
Put down the knife.

554
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,400
Let go of me!

555
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,040
Put the knife down first

556
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,800
Zhang Beihai, I told you not to touch me

557
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,640
Tell me if you have any difficulties

558
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,680
Put the knife down.

559
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,680
You...

560
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,240
Dad, don't hit my mom!

561
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,520
Go, Chi.

562
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:53,880
You...

563
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,000
Put the knife down.

564
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,160
This is not the only time

565
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,680
is not the only time.

566
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:37,520
Shu Hua.

567
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,280
Shu Hua.

568
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:01,280
Wake up.

569
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:13,360
Wake up.

570
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,360
Wake up.

571
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,480
Wake up.

572
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,640
Wake up.

573
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,400
Wake up.

574
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,520
You scared me.

575
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,440
I couldn't do anything

576
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:03,440
I had no choice at first.

577
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,120
Then I finally realized

578
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,360
that your mother was ill.

579
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,440
I was too careless.

580
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,360
Didn't you take her to a doctor?

581
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,280
I've discussed it with her several times.

582
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,040
She refused to go with me.

583
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,000
I had to consult the doctor myself.

584
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,400
Beihai.

585
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,400
Qin's illness

586
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:32,680
is different from

587
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,160
are different.

588
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:35,880
Unconfirmed.

589
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,680
and there was no specific treatment plan.

590
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:42,520
But she killed herself many times.

591
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,520
That won't do.

592
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,840
Look at her illness.

593
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,000
is more like schizophrenia.

594
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,400
No.

595
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,280
When I was on the front line of emergency rescue,

596
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,480
at the frontline of emergency.

597
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,040
Shu Hua is not like that.

598
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,880
Her memory and cognition

599
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:58,880
not only did she not lose her memory,

600
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,520
but more outstanding than before.

601
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,120
And she doesn't know how tired she is.

602
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,160
Even when she's down,

603
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,880
she's still sober.

604
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,400
Beihai

605
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,000
If what you said is true,

606
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,880
the situation is more tricky.

607
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,159
Because Shu Hua's illness

608
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,440
is a blank

609
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:34,920
in the existing medical records.

610
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,840
There was no solution.

611
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,199
The medical conditions at that time were limited.

612
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,920
It was hard to confirm

613
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,280
for your mother.

614
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,840
I've been looking for domestic and foreign information.

615
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:52,920
Finally,

616
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:56,199
I finally have a clear answer.

617
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,080
Uncle Xu.

618
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:01,080
The foreign magazines you just told me

619
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:01,920
besides these,

620
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:04,440
besides these?

621
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,200
authority?

622
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,160
Isn't this enough for your research?

623
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,440
Xianbing, are you quitting the ER?

624
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,440
I'm going to change my career.

625
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,320
It's easy to be skilled.

626
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,200
I'll learn more.

627
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,400
There are some new publication books.

628
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,840
but I'm afraid we can't find them in China.

629
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:18,680
It's okay.

630
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,040
Tell me your name.

631
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,320
Let me think.

632
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,880
A double emotional disorder.

633
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,800
He has mania

634
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,560
and depression.

635
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,080
common mental disorder.

636
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,160
When mania attacks,

637
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,760
he was depressed and lost his sense of pleasure.

638
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,080
Less language activities.

639
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,040
and slow fatigue.

640
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,880
The clinical performance is complex.

641
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,400
The complex body

642
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,920
or high mood.

643
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,440
When they keep changing irregularly,

644
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:11,560
Along with distraction, rash and exaggerated.

645
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,040
thinking and high reaction.

646
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,000
Lower sleep

647
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,320
and language increase.

648
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,840
Why didn't you tell me back then?

649
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,040
That was the first time

650
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,560
the first and the only time she begged me.

651
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:36,960
She didn't let me tell you.

652
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,320
to tell you about her condition.

653
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,320
I'm writing my essay.

654
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,840
This is today's Chinese homework.

655
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:52,720
The title is the person I admire the most.

656
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:53,720
Who did you write?

657
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:54,960
Mom.

658
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,080
How did you write it?

659
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,960
The person I adore the most is my mom.

660
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,840
My mom is tall

661
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:07,440
A black and bright hair

662
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:11,960
A pair of dark and bright eyes.

663
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,920
She is

664
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:16,080
in the world.

665
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:19,040
and the best mom in the world.

666
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:22,560
She smiles and wakes me up every day.

667
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,920
and sent me to school.

668
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,960
Play in the park with me.

669
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,200
Buy me ice cream.

670
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,720
I love my mom.

671
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:34,800
I want to be a perfect person like you.

672
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,800
Why don't you write Dad?

673
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,680
Because mom can be in the newspaper

674
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:54,560
Work hard.

675
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,040
Shu Hua.

676
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:14,840
What's wrong?

677
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,200
Nothing.

678
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,560
Chi wrote well.

679
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:22,680
I'm touched.

680
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,280
Yes.

681
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,840
The child has grown up.

682
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:31,680
It's great.

683
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,440
Are you okay

684
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:45,440
Beihai

685
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,200
Promise me.

686
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:52,320
Don't tell Chi about my situation, okay?

687
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,480
You heard it.

688
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,920
Chi loves me so much.

689
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,040
He said his mom was his role model.

690
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:11,720
Think about it.

691
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,080
If he knows my situation,

692
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,440
how can I be his mother?

693
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,960
Will he still love me?

694
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,440
Please promise me, okay?

695
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,200
I beg you.

696
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:33,680
Please.

697
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,280
I promise you. Okay.

698
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:57,280
Your mother's heart disease

699
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,200
needs heart medicine.

700
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,920
That's when I made up my mind.

701
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,080
no matter what it takes,

702
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,200
I must cure her.

703
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:13,080
Come on.

704
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,680
I'm really not in the mood.

705
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,600
I don't want to run. Can you run by yourself?

706
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,120
I'm going for a walk.

707
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,600
Just a walk to digest

708
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,320
Can't you walk by yourself?

709
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,040
I can't walk.

710
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,400
Run by yourself.

711
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,440
The Mid-Autumn Gala is coming.

712
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:14,160
Are you happy?

713
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,480
Yes.

714
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,120
It's rare

715
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,960
in this small place.

716
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:20,600
It's hard to get tickets, right?

717
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,080
One vote is hard to get.

718
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,200
But your husband has many connections in Jiangdong.

719
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,400
Two tickets are nothing.

720
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:29,600
Thank you.

721
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:30,920
I'll get you some water.

722
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,120
Wait here.

723
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:39,200
Hello.
