National Radio And Tevion Administration

2
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,560
It's okay. Let's eat.

3
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,320
Should I call Shu Hua over?

4
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,440
No, I'm not eating either.

5
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,039
You just left.

6
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,280
She was so sad.

7
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,360
I don't understand.

8
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,880
You're lucky in love.

9
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:53,000
Why didn't you succeed?

10
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,720
Do you remember the new Xiaoyue

11
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,479
the new Xiaoyue in the station?

12
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,640
He's coming for you.

13
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,200
He's in shock.

14
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,760
He must have had adrenaline.

15
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,520
It's an allergic shock.

16
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,800
If it's hypoglycemia, you need glucose.

17
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,560
It says he ate.

18
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,440
How could it be hypoglycemia?

19
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,200
As for the specific questions,

20
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,280
the specific questions.

21
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,400
Then...

22
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,440
Everyone is here.

23
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,280
Let me introduce.

24
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,640
This is our new nurse.

25
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,520
Wu Xiaoyue.

26
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,440
graduated from Jiangdong No.2 Medical School.

27
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,520
So,

28
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,480
Qin's junior?

29
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,440
Yes.

30
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:30,640
Hello.

31
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,440
You know each other, right?

32
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,440
Dr. Sun went to the countryside before.

33
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,640
to promote emergency knowledge.

34
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,920
in our university staircase classroom.

35
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,920
I was sitting in the first row.

36
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,640
Dr. Sun was very professional.

37
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,920
and contagious.

38
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,160
It touched me.

39
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,440
I want to be

40
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,680
like you.

41
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,640
Perfect.

42
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,280
Dr. Sun doesn't have a girlfriend yet.

43
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,440
Old Gu, don't talk nonsense.

44
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,760
We're not the same age.

45
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,280
Alright.

46
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,560
Since you take Dr. Sun as your role model,

47
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,960
you should learn from him.

48
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:07,760
Yes.

49
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,440
Director Kang.

50
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,800
I'll bring them with me.

51
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,640
One more female comrade.

52
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,160
Follow the arrangement

53
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,560
Yimo Beihai Let's go

54
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:19,960
Coming

55
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:20,920
Just in time.

56
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,760
Take Xiaoyue with you. Okay.

57
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,440
Let her see.

58
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,160
Okay, let's go.

59
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,040
Go.

60
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,320
Hang in there.

61
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:34,800
What are you doing?

62
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,440
I have experience.

63
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,440
What experience do you have?

64
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,960
Don't hurt the kid.

65
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,840
What are you doing?

66
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,560
Sir.

67
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:42,960
Who is calling?

68
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:43,600
Doctor, it's me.

69
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,079
My son's foot is stuck.

70
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:45,800
Take a look.

71
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,079
You're bleeding.

72
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,040
Do you have claws?

73
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,400
It's okay.

74
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:54,440
Alright.

75
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,600
Dismiss

76
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,480
Dismiss

77
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:58,800
Here.

78
00:03:59,200 --> 00:03:59,680
Thank you.

79
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:01,600
It's okay.

80
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,200
I'll be fine soon.

81
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,320
Where are you going to school?

82
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,800
The kid is fine.

83
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:11,800
It's almost done.

84
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,040
Don't move.

85
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,560
Look, it's out.

86
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,480
It's okay. Don't move.

87
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,480
Don't move

88
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,320
Hang in there.

89
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:24,720
Thank you.

90
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,720
Dong Zi, take care of it.

91
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:28,320
Okay.

92
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,200
Here's the thing.

93
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,680
Xiaoyue, let me do it.

94
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,680
Dong Zi, let me do it.

95
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,320
It's okay. Let me do it.

96
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:40,600
It's okay.

97
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,320
Dr Zhang, you're amazing.

98
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,560
You can solve this in no time.

99
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,480
I was stuck when I was young.

100
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,680
This is my experience.

101
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,960
What about Sun Yitouch?

102
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:53,960
has his experience.

103
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,720
You have to learn, okay?

104
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:56,680
Okay.

105
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,440
Come on.

106
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,800
What do you think of Dong Zi?

107
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,200
I think he’s good.

108
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,440
Why don't you think about it?

109
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,840
I've liked Dr. Sun since college.

110
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,280
He has always been my goal in life.

111
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,800
and mine.

112
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:14,720
Mine.

113
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,480
Okay, you and Dr. Sun are a good match.

114
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,800
You're so stubborn.

115
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,480
Dr Zhang.

116
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,200
Well, I want to ask you.

117
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,320
why Dr. Sun doesn't get married?

118
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,160
Let me talk to him for you.

119
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,040
Xiaoyue is young and beautiful.

120
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,400
and she works hard.

121
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,080
But she thinks you're a dull person.

122
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:18,840
Morning, Xiaoyue.

123
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:19,960
Why are you so happy?

124
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:20,800
Morning, Yimo.

125
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,560
This is for you.

126
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,680
It's not a festival.

127
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,160
Why are you giving me a gift?

128
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,200
What are you two doing?

129
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,560
Wu Xiaoyue, please teach me a few questions

130
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:44,960
Zhang Beihai

131
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,200
Where is the book you asked me to bring

132
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:47,960
I found it for you.

133
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,080
Really?

134
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:50,960
Great. Where is it?

135
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,440
I'll bring it to you after work.

136
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,960
Why are you reading psychology books?

137
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:55,920
You need to study.

138
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,960
Live until you grow old.

139
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:10,000
I know what she's thinking.

140
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,360
But I didn't want to waste her time.

141
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,840
So I made it clear to her quickly.

142
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,040
Hey, Gangdong Emergency Station.

143
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,800
You need a car?

144
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,400
Where are you?

145
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,800
What's wrong with the patient?

146
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:27,840
Hurry up.

147
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,200
What are you doing?

148
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,400
Well...

149
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,840
The family hospital is full of leaders.

150
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,720
Director Zhao is afraid that you'll be straightforward

151
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,680
and offended someone.

152
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:44,680
and let me follow you.

153
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,200
You're afraid he'll pester you, aren't you?

154
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,320
No.

155
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,040
No need.

156
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:54,720
Go

157
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:55,960
Zhang Beihai

158
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,560
Yimo

159
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,080
Yimo.

160
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,040
I...

161
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,480
I like you.

162
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,080
I'm serious.

163
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,320
Xiaoyue,

164
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,680
I only care about work now.

165
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,080
I can't think about that.

166
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:24,720
I'm sorry.

167
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,400
From now on, mark it like this.

168
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:38,320
I can see it clearly.

169
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,480
Look what you wrote before.

170
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,680
Are you in contact with a patient with a mental illness?

171
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:51,920
Yes.

172
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,200
It's you.

173
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,080
What?

174
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,320
You

175
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,040
You're over 40 years old.

176
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,080
You don't get married and have children.

177
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,960
Are you mentally ill?

178
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,560
That's my personal freedom.

179
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,400
What does it have to do with my mental illness?

180
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,160
Xiaoyue is nice.

181
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,320
Pretty.

182
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,320
Kind and ambitious.

183
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,920
Since we entered this door,

184
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,200
since he entered this door.

185
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,080
Stop pretending.

186
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,440
Old buddy,

187
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,920
Don't argue with yourself, okay?

188
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,400
Xiaoyue is good,

189
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,920
but I've seen the best girl in the world.

190
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,400
I went to pick up my kid.

191
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,080
Now that I think about it,

192
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,240
you were looking for books

193
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,960
related to mental diseases.

194
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,080
for Shu Hua, right?

195
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,720
Why didn't you tell me back then?

196
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,200
In the end, I went to the mourning hall to beat you up.

197
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,240
I promised Shu Hua.

198
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,920
I can't tell anyone for Chi.

199
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,320
I didn't expect

200
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,800
this secret has been hidden for more than 20 years.

201
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:31,840
Beihai.

202
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,480
Sister Zhou.

203
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:33,600
Thank you. Thank you.

204
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:35,680
Thank you.

205
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,680
Let's sort out the documents for the last meeting.

206
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,200
Okay.

207
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:45,480
Director

208
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,200
Beihai, why are you here?

209
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,960
Why don't you rest at home for a few more days?

210
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,320
No.

211
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,600
Hai, is Chi okay?

212
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,160
Leave Chi with me.

213
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,680
I'll take care of him for a few days.

214
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:06,720
No need.

215
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,440
I'll send him home.

216
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:09,480
Don't worry.

217
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,080
Director.

218
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,040
Take care.

219
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:19,960
I'm leaving.

220
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:20,840
Where are you going?

221
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,080
Leave Jiangdong.

222
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:29,720
Let's talk.

223
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,440
There's nothing to talk about.

224
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,800
I'll wait for you at the small restaurant.

225
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,200
I won't leave if you don't come.

226
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:10,720
Bill, please.

227
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,440
Clean up the table.

228
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,160
Yimo.

229
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,160
Are you leaving?

230
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,600
If you leave,

231
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,400
I don't know when

232
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,480
when we can meet again.

233
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,440
I'll

234
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,680
as my farewell.

235
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,800
After so many years,

236
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,720
we don't get along.

237
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,280
You suddenly said you were leaving, right?

238
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,600
I'm really sad.

239
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,600
I didn't take good care of

240
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,760
for Shu Hua's death.

241
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,160
I know

242
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,200
you may never forgive me.

243
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,480
I...

244
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,040
Unfortunately,

245
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,480
you didn't come to the end of that day.

246
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,720
Time flies.

247
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:51,520
More than 20 years have passed.

248
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,920
We are old.

249
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,760
Let's drink.

250
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,480
I didn't expect

251
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,600
I can drink with you forever.

252
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,000
To be honest,

253
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,000
I didn't expect it either.

254
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,000
Come on.

255
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:20,040
Do you remember when your neighbor Dayong left,

256
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,760
after Dayong left?

257
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,720
Yes.

258
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,520
Our dream future

259
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,960
has come true.

260
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:45,960
Poor thing.

261
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,720
You haven't been married for long and haven't had a baby yet.

262
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,480
A white-haired man gives a black-haired man away.

263
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,520
Life is so fragile.

264
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,440
Hai, Yimo.

265
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,080
Stop thinking about it.

266
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,560
Let's think about something happy.

267
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,600
After many years,

268
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,920
when technology is developed,

269
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,360
it will be easy to cure a heart disease.

270
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,560
According to the research of domestic medicine,

271
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,840
it's possible.

272
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,240
Dr. Sun.

273
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,720
At that time,

274
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,440
changed a lot.

275
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,760
In ten years,

276
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,000
I think an emergency station like us

277
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,680
high buildings have to rise flat.

278
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,560
You need an elevator to go up and down.

279
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,000
You should have a lounge.

280
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,480
There should be a canteen.

281
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,520
There should be a man and a woman in your bathroom.

282
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:33,960
Yes.

283
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:34,480
Right?

284
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,600
By then,

285
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,760
we'll split into groups.

286
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,200
Each team has a professional driver.

287
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,040
Doctor.

288
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:40,840
Nurse.

289
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,160
and stretcher.

290
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:43,800
By then,

291
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,560
there will be a lot of girls.

292
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,160
You want to date someone, right?

293
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,080
By then,

294
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,240
we can

295
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,160
one ambulance each.

296
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,480
One phone for each.

297
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,360
We can get in touch wherever we go.

298
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:01,320
Yes.

299
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,000
There are more medicine equipment.

300
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,280
Dopamine, adrenaline,

301
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,280
and adrenaline.

302
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,720
Only then will the ER be more professional.

303
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,280
If you don't work hard,

304
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,560
If you don't work hard and don't make progress,

305
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,560
you'll be eliminated by the times.

306
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,800
Let me tell you.

307
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,520
I'm willing to be eliminated in that era.

308
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,920
I'll apply for the entrance at the emergency station.

309
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:23,839
I'm happy to see you.

310
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,920
Who are you to look at the door?

311
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Come on, let's drink.

312
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:27,920
To look at the door.

313
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,080
Cheers.

314
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,080
Pour some wine.

315
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,000
You apply to check the door tomorrow morning.

316
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,560
I'm not qualified now.

317
00:17:58,840 --> 00:17:59,320
Dr Xu.

318
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,720
After our review,

319
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,080
the steel

320
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,760
was too close to your heart.

321
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,000
The surgery went well,

322
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,240
it'll be fine to ensure your daily life.

323
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,320
But remember,

324
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,760
don't do

325
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,040
excessive strenuous exercise.

326
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,480
The workload of an emergency doctor

327
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,480
the workout

328
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,600
is too much for you.

329
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,600
My personal advice is

330
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:25,880
change a job.

331
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,040
Yuan, come out for dinner.

332
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,320
Coming.

333
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,120
Why are you back so early today?

334
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:43,840
Where's Jia Qi?

335
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,680
She's working tonight.

336
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,600
She finally got some rest.

337
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,040
Let's eat.

338
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,120
Why aren't you eating?

339
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,040
Are you not feeling well?

340
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,320
Why don't you tell the company

341
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,320
to rest for a while?

342
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,760
I heard that your annual leave

343
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,840
your annual leave.

344
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,400
Or here.

345
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,200
Listen to Mr. Lu's suggestion.

346
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,600
to go to the management post.

347
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,200
If you stay on the front line,

348
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,320
your body won't be able to take it.

349
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,320
I'm going to resign.

350
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,600
Are you sure?

351
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,960
I thought you wouldn't quit.

352
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,480
Are you really ready?

353
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,680
Yes.

354
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,040
I'll do it in a couple of days.

355
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,320
Think about it.

356
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,840
emergency work requires good stamina and endurance.

357
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,200
I can't handle

358
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,040
I can't take it.

359
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,120
I'm scared.

360
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,960
When I went to save someone,

361
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,680
but I was saved again.

362
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:51,840
Let me tell you.

363
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,680
I have psychological pressure.

364
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,600
Tell me whether it's big or not.

365
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:56,880
I understand.

366
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,880
What about your plan?

367
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:00,680
Have you made up your mind?

368
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:01,600
How about

369
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,480
go to work in the office?

370
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,760
I've thought about it.

371
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,600
But just think about it.

372
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,400
That's impossible.

373
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,400
Every day,

374
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,320
in the office every day.

375
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,560
in the office.

376
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,200
I would be so sad.

377
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,200
I'm so jealous.

378
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,120
Rather than not seeing you,

379
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,320
than not seeing you.

380
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,280
what you want to do.

381
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,840
is right in front of you.

382
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,560
But you can only watch it.

383
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:29,880
Don't worry.

384
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,000
I'm smart and talented.

385
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,280
I can do anything.

386
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,840
Okay, Yuan.

387
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,000
I support you.

388
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,120
Let's eat.

389
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:01,840
Zhang.

390
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,320
Chengyuan.

391
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,280
Are you back from your blind date?

392
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:09,320
Yes.

393
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:11,960
Congratulations on returning.

394
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,160
I'm here to resign.

395
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,160
You're quitting?

396
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,440
As a cardiothoracic surgeon,

397
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,160
What do you think?

398
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,160
Why didn't you discuss such a big thing?

399
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,280
How big is it?

400
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,400
It's such a small matter.

401
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,440
If I report to you,

402
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,600
Zhang Chi will kill me with a knife.

403
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,280
Right, Zhang Chi?

404
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,440
What a waste.

405
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,000
It's so hard for me to bring you out.

406
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,320
I just want to help my company.

407
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,160
to help my family.

408
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,280
to share the burden for our family.

409
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,160
You should take care of your heart.

410
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,600
Don't worry about me.

411
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Aren't you a professional?

412
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:08,760
You know.

413
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:09,720
It's nothing serious.

414
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,880
This is not an excuse.

415
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:15,160
you don't have to work hard or stay up late.

416
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,400
Are you jealous of me?

417
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,320
Let's go.

418
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,960
Okay, I'll find a place

419
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,840
and step on it.

420
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,560
I'll treat you to something fun.

421
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:26,560
Bye.

422
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:32,960
Jiangdong EM.

423
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,560
Don't cry, Xu Chengyuan.

424
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:59,200
08401.

425
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:04,080
08401.

426
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,320
I think

427
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,600
to work at 120 Emergency Center.

428
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:48,880
001006

429
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,720
can help you become a better doctor.

430
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,440
001006.

431
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,160
I'm going.

432
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,920
Why are you so down-to-work?

433
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,760
No.

434
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:12,320
I'm tired.

435
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:13,440
No.

436
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,760
I was a cardiac surgeon.

437
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,760
I had to do this surgery for four or five hours.

438
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,320
But I was standing and lowering my head.

439
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,040
It's all meticulous

440
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,200
But not like here

441
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,120
Go upstairs and downstairs running around

442
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,760
Are you tired?

443
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,000
No.

444
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,720
You need to get used to this kind of tiredness.

445
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,920
When did you get used to this tiredness

446
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:33,920
and enjoy it,

447
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,720
you'll become a real emergency doctor.

448
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,280
Understand?

449
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,160
How does it feel to work at the emergency center?

450
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,600
To be honest,

451
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:46,600
I don't think this job suits me.

452
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:49,480
What do you mean?

453
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,720
I was a cardiac surgeon.

454
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,680
what touched me the most

455
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,680
is that I often get in contact with difficult diseases

456
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,240
and solve their problems

457
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,160
through their own efforts.

458
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,040
Here.

459
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,600
I often encounter severe cases.

460
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,480
Most of them are minor diseases.

461
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,600
Your hospital emergency work is done.

462
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,240
Leave the rest

463
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,040
Leave it to us.

464
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:15,960
He's right.

465
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,480
We sent it to the patient.

466
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,840
Our work is over.

467
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,400
I think the reason you came with me

468
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,280
from me.

469
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,160
Chi, your work at the emergency center

470
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,160
just started.

471
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:34,360
Secretary.

472
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,840
I told you I won't stay here for long.

473
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,600
I think

474
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,960
no matter what major it is,

475
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,480
it takes time

476
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,480
it takes time.

477
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,160
I still believe that

478
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,400
you'll gain a lot

479
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,680
sooner or later.

480
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,600
What do you think of our emergency center?

481
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,960
It's not as difficult as your heart surgery,

482
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,920
but we look good, right?

483
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:00,840
I think everyone

484
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,680
is full of enthusiasm

485
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:03,720
full of enthusiasm.

486
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:10,600
Yes.

487
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,480
If you want to be a doctor,

488
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,720
it must be a difficult journey.

489
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:22,080
I hope a doctor with such ambition

490
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,240
More.

491
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,520
More. More.

492
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,520
Guys,

493
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,480
we had an appointment to attend a lecture that day.

494
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,640
None of you came.

495
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,120
I've been waiting for more than an hour.

496
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,920
Stop it.

497
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,120
My grandson is sick.

498
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,120
Take him to the hospital for an injection.

499
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,000
Are you okay?

500
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,280
I'm fine.

501
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:42,760
The day after tomorrow,

502
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,640
we have a square dance competition.

503
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,360
I've been busy rehearsing these days.

504
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,640
I'm really busy.

505
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:49,720
Zhang,

506
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,640
We have plenty of time.

507
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,640
Let's meet next time.

508
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,000
It's okay.

509
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,480
Where should we compete?

510
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,120
I have to go and support them.

511
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,280
to be your cheerleaders.

512
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,600
With this little thing,

513
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
we'll be prepared.

514
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,960
We can have a game without worry.

515
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:04,880
Zhang.

516
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,640
You're always carrying so many things.

517
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,880
Are you tired?

518
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:09,480
No.

519
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,120
What if someone

520
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,000
on the way?

521
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:15,800
This little thing

522
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,800
It can save lives.

523
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,000
You've been an emergency doctor all your life.

524
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,120
You don't even enjoy life after retirement.

525
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,120
You always save this and that.

526
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,600
Are you addicted?

527
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,280
You're right.

528
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,000
I'm addicted to saving people.

529
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,040
Look.

530
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,800
There are so many people on the street.

531
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:39,640
Everyone has parents, siblings and children.

532
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,240
Right?

533
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,720
What if

534
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,640
can't go back if something happens on the road,

535
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,120
How does it feel

536
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,400
How does it feel?

537
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,360
Come to the emergency lecture

538
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,280
come and listen to the emergency lecture.

539
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,280
Skills are not overwhelming.

540
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,280
Let's not save others.

541
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,880
we can use it in our own life.

542
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,000
Right?

543
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:01,880
Yes.

544
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,120
We have to find some time too.

545
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,120
Okay, I see.

546
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,480
I'll ask you out when I'm free.

547
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,360
Okay.

548
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,640
Come on.

549
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,880
Chi, why are you here?

550
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:16,640
Are you okay?

551
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,360
I'm fine.

552
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,720
I'm fine. Don't worry.

553
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:23,640
I...

554
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,920
I have something to do nearby.

555
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:26,880
I came to see you.

556
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,400
I just bought some vegetables.

557
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,640
Go home and eat.

558
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,280
Are you busy at the hospital?

559
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,880
I'll cook whatever you want to eat.

560
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,400
Son, don't worry.

561
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,240
There are two more dishes.

562
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:52,720
No hurry.

563
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,640
Chi, the meal is ready.

564
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,600
Let's eat.

565
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,800
Here, have some soup.

566
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,640
Eat the soup first.

567
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,600
I'll do it myself.

568
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,120
Leave it.

569
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:20,520
Here.

570
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,880
Eat more.

571
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,520
You don't like this dish, do you?

572
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,120
Dad.

573
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,880
Why don't you eat this?

574
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:50,640
Broken earlobes.

575
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,320
These are your and your mom's favorite dishes.

576
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,000
Eat more if you like it.

577
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,320
Nowadays,

578
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,560
are rare in the market.

579
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,480
It's rare to meet them.

580
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,560
Every time we meet,

581
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,320
I'll buy some.

582
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,760
I thought when you came back,

583
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,240
I'll cook for you. Eat.

584
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:20,520
Eat.

585
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:24,880
Okay.

586
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:26,560
Eat more.

587
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,000
I'm full.

588
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,120
I'm full

589
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:42,880
Eat a bowl of rice.

590
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,120
Go back later.

591
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,120
Go to bed early if there's nothing else.

592
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,160
Don't stay up late.

593
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,120
I'm a little tired today.

594
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,040
I don't want to drive later.

595
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,360
How about staying here tonight?

596
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,400
Sure.

597
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,240
Okay.

598
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,120
I'll boil some hot water for you.

599
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,280
Take a shower later.

600
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:04,400
By the way,

601
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,040
The quilt was just dried.

602
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,280
The sheets and blankets are all new.

603
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:11,920
Pajamas, pants, slippers are ready-made.

604
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:12,640
They're all new.

605
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:14,400
And...

606
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,280
Yes, I'll boil water.

607
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:34,800
Son.

608
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,800
Look what this is.

609
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,120
Mai breastmilk.

610
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:41,640
Yes.

611
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,040
This is your favorite

612
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,280
when you were young.

613
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,280
It took me a lot of effort to find it.

614
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:49,520
Drink it.

615
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,000
Drink it and go to bed early.

616
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,360
Drink the milk and go to bed.

617
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,120
Chi, wake up.

618
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:31,000
Chi, wake up.

619
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,400
Get up and eat.

620
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,160
Wake up. Time to eat.

621
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:50,720
Chi.

622
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,880
Chi, come here.

623
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,240
Coming.

624
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,280
Frozen with cold sauce

625
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,000
Smells good

626
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,520
What else do you want to eat? The kitchen is enough.

627
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,400
Look at your dad.

628
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,240
Try it.

629
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:24,480
Fried pork with earlobes. Your favorite.

630
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,240
Here.

631
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:30,640
Here, stir-fried eggs with tomatoes.

632
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,360
By the way, Chi,

633
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,480
this is your favorite fried rice with egg.

634
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,360
It's my first time.

635
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,520
Don't dislike me

636
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,400
Your mom's fried rice.

637
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,080
It must be the best in the world, right?

638
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,520
Stop talking nonsense. You should eat too.

639
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,520
Okay, let me try.

640
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,560
It smells so good.

641
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:53,800
Right?

642
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:54,680
Eat more.

643
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,280
Do you want this?

644
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,000
You order.

645
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:21,640
Order whatever you want.

646
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:22,480
Okay.

647
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,880
Roasted chicken wings and beef skewers.

648
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,480
Okay. These are all your favourites.

649
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,320
Waiter.

650
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:34,560
Hello, sir.

651
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:35,480
Thank you.

652
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,120
Thank you.

653
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,320
This is...

654
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:46,800
Open it.

655
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,400
This.

656
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,560
Why did you give me this today?

657
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,440
It's not cheap, right?

658
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,920
Do you know what day it is today?

659
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:00,120
It's our first month together.

660
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,560
This is a souvenir.

661
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,440
I'll try it on.

662
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,080
But Jiaqi,

663
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:08,760
I...

664
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,280
Mr. Zheng, Ms. Sun,

665
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,040
Happy one month anniversary.

666
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:22,600
Thank you.

667
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:24,360
Enjoy your meal.

668
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,720
Zheng Bo, you've made progress.

669
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:27,360
Jiaqi.

670
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:30,040
This flower is not as valuable as this watch.

671
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,240
What are you talking about? Give it to me.

672
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,000
Take a photo for me.

673
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:36,360
Okay.

674
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:37,560
Let's do it together.

675
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:38,480
Okay.

676
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:44,920
Wait, I'll put this watch...

677
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:48,920
Three, two, one.

678
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,000
Come in.

679
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,440
Secretary Liu, are you looking for me?

680
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,320
Come, sit down.

681
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,600
How are you recently?

682
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:11,520
Not bad.

683
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,240
I have something to discuss with you.

684
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:15,840
As you know,

685
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:18,000
the centre has a medical exchange mission every year.

686
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,880
Are we going to Gansu this year?

687
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:20,800
for a month.

688
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,240
The city leaders take it seriously.

689
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,240
You told me many times before.

690
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,400
you wanted to help the place.

691
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,360
So I called you here

692
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,240
to talk to you.

693
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:32,600
In the past,

694
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,000
I would've promised you right away.

695
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:35,720
But now,

696
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:37,720
you know our situation.

697
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,880
I'll think about it and give you an answer, okay?

698
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,360
Xiao Qiu, I'll take you back.

699
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,000
Sure.

700
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:47,760
Goodbye, Dr. Zhang.

701
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:48,240
Bye.

702
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,200
Bye, Dr. Zhang.

703
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:57,600
I finally found you.

704
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,480
I'm sorry.

705
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,320
Did you get the wrong person?

706
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,480
Don't you recognize me?

707
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,120
Peach.

708
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,000
Who is this? Do you know her?

709
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,600
You're the girl

710
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,080
in that village in that village.

711
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:09,600
Right?

712
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,400
You think of me?

713
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,400
Take a photo and send it to Qiqi.

714
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,080
I'm ready.

715
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,400
What are you ready for?

716
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,240
You said you would marry me.

717
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:19,120
I can marry you anytime.

718
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:21,360
When did I say I want to marry you?

719
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,520
What is she holding?

720
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,600
The household register.

721
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,400
No way.

722
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,000
It's going this far.

723
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,120
Is Dr. Jang that kind of person?

724
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,080
He doesn't look like him.

725
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:33,880
Is he so popular recently?

726
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,760
You promised me yourself.

727
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,960
I'm here for the appointment.

728
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,600
I never break my promise.

729
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,520
Miss, don't joke.

730
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,000
I have a girlfriend.

731
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,520
And my girlfriend and I are getting married soon.

732
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,720
Don't make such a joke.

733
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,360
Girlfriend?

734
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Do you have an ex-girlfriend?

735
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,240
Yes, I do.

736
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,600
You can turn this into your ex-girlfriend.

737
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,360
as your ex-girlfriend.

738
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,240
I'll give you some time to clean it up.

739
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,000
Then I'll come and marry you.

740
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,760
I can't stand it anymore. Let's go.

741
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,240
When did that happen?

742
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,200
Angry.

743
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:05,120
I'm sorry.

744
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:07,320
I don't know what I'm saying or what I'm doing.

745
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,000
I made you misunderstand.

746
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,200
But you...

747
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,000
Aren't you being a bit unreasonable?

748
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,480
You said

749
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,720
you wanted to marry me.

750
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,520
And you said, "Okay, okay."

751
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,600
If I can get out alive,

752
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,360
Will you marry me?

753
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,360
Have you forgotten?

754
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:25,360
That day...

755
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:28,000
I was afraid you would faint that day.

756
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,360
I said you would have a good life in the future.

757
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,480
When you said that,

758
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,360
another colleague of mine promised you.

759
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,720
His name is Huang Hao, not me.

760
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,000
Fine, I’ll marry you.

761
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,840
Huang Hao.

762
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,240
treat me to dinner.

763
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,000
