1
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:06,040
You can do it. You can do it. Come on. Come on. It’s like this. It’s like this.

2
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,320
How do you feel?

3
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,759
Move it. Move it.

4
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,120
I'll send you upstairs.

5
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,200
No.

6
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:41,680
My medicine box.

7
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,560
Where did I drop my medicine box?

8
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:45,640
You fell so badly.

9
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,520
Let's go to the hospital.

10
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,320
No.

11
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,800
I can't

12
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,000
in my medicine box.

13
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,280
You have to help me find it.

14
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,280
I'm speechless.

15
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,160
Thank you.

16
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,160
Okay, I'll help you.

17
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,760
Thank you, Zhang.

18
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,800
Here, take a look.

19
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,760
Do you need anything?

20
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,280
I found it.

21
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,520
The stethoscope is good.

22
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,160
Great.

23
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,640
Thank you, Brother Zhang.

24
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,400
Did you fall?

25
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,280
I almost didn't recognize you.

26
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,880
Luckily I met you.

27
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:12,920
Here.

28
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,280
Let me help you up.

29
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,400
Let's see if you can stand up.

30
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:16,520
Here.

31
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,280
It should work.

32
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,280
One, two, three.

33
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,120
Slow down.

34
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,400
Slowly.

35
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:24,880
Sure.

36
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:25,520
Okay.

37
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,040
Let's go.

38
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:28,920
Let me.

39
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,040
Here.

40
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,760
Slow down.

41
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,600
Slow down.

42
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,160
Fellow.

43
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,040
Fellow.

44
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,040
Help me.

45
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,560
Coming

46
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,040
Wait a minute.

47
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,200
Zhang.

48
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,120
Thank you.

49
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,160
You saved me again.

50
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,280
This is our fate.

51
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,760
I feel relieved

52
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,280
I feel relieved.

53
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,880
What are you doing

54
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,200
at this late hour?

55
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,760
Our medical school came to the village for free treatment.

56
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,200
It's too late today.

57
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,000
But there's still one restaurant left.

58
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,200
Zhang,

59
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,320
Can you let me finish this house

60
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,160
before I go back?

61
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,880
You're already hurt.

62
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,560
Let's go to the hospital.

63
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:29,920
Young lady.

64
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,040
Du Dae-yeong's house is so far away.

65
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,280
I can't even drive in.

66
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,040
There are still a few miles to get there.

67
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,760
It's dark and it's hard to walk.

68
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:38,920
That's even worse.

69
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,560
Mrs. Du has heart problems all year long.

70
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,920
She is at home alone.

71
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,440
I'm worried if I don't look at her.

72
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,280
Okay?

73
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,159
Okay, I'll give you a ride.

74
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,040
But I have a request.

75
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,440
When we arrive,

76
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,400
I'll go. You stay in the car.

77
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,560
No, I'm fine.

78
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,440
I'm fine.

79
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,160
Don't underestimate a fall.

80
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,200
With my first aid experience,

81
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,000
it doesn't mean you're fine.

82
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,400
You have to go to the hospital.

83
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,160
to see if there are any internal bleeding fractures.

84
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,440
Anyway,

85
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,560
you'll be my patient if you get in my car.

86
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:15,760
Listen to me.

87
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,520
I'll listen to you.

88
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:21,680
Thank you.

89
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,760
This is Du Dae-young's house.

90
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,520
Mr. Jang.

91
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,640
The road is slippery. Slow down.

92
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,040
Don't worry. I'm fine.

93
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,280
Wait for me here.

94
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,280
By the way,

95
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,800
I saved you twice.

96
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:09,880
This is for you.

97
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,520
This candy is very cute.

98
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,920
Save it for yourself.

99
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,080
This means you're lucky.

100
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:20,800
Thank you.

101
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,160
Okay, don't run around.

102
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:22,880
Okay.

103
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:15,800
Slow down.

104
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,400
Are you okay?

105
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,520
I'm fine.

106
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:27,920
Mrs. Du,

107
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,400
I just have a fever.

108
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,800
Her heart is fine.

109
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,440
Let's take her to the hospital.

110
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,680
Your face...

111
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,159
It's just a scratch. I'm fine.

112
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,560
Go to the hospital.

113
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,520
Ms. Zhou.

114
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,040
Is this okay?

115
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,400
Yes.

116
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:19,920
Okay.

117
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:20,920
Brother Zhang.

118
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,760
Why are you here?

119
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,040
Ms. Zhou told me

120
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,480
you fixed the antenna on it.

121
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,320
so I brought you food.

122
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,240
It's windy. You can leave.

123
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,880
I've been waiting for you downstairs.

124
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,760
You must have been up there for a long time.

125
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,480
Let me help you.

126
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,320
Take it.

127
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,559
I can't spare my hands.

128
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,559
Let's go down and eat.

129
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,440
Let me feed you.

130
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:49,800
Is it good?

131
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,560
Mrs. Du asked me to bring you this.

132
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,120
She said

133
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,320
you carried her down the mountain in time

134
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,320
and sent her to the hospital.

135
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,000
Actually, I didn't do anything.

136
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,320
You did a great job.

137
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,920
You're the best.

138
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,520
I think

139
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,600
being a doctor is different from others.

140
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,920
You have a righteous heart.

141
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,640
And you're like a hero in a novel.

142
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,960
It's not that exaggerated.

143
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,640
I just want to save more people.

144
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,360
Come on.

145
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,800
Let's save more people together.

146
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,320
It's not easy to get these two tickets.

147
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,760
Why did you ask Shu Hua out?

148
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,760
Shu Hua, why are you here?

149
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,040
Yimo, I'm here to see Zhang.

150
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,200
I haven't seen him for a long time.

151
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,560
Do you know where he went?

152
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,200
I don't know where he is.

153
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,040
This is the movie ticket for Huzan Love.

154
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,920
How did you get it?

155
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,920
I wanted to buy it for a long time, but I couldn't.

156
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,320
Shu Hua, do you want it?

157
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,040
I want it.

158
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,400
Of course I want it.

159
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,280
Yimo.

160
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,880
Are you really willing to give it to me?

161
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,880
That's great.

162
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,120
Thank you, Yimo.

163
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,520
I've always wanted to watch this movie

164
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,000
to watch this movie.

165
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,920
Thank you so much.

166
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:41,920
I'll get going then.

167
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,400
What happened?

168
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:13,920
Qin,

169
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,160
I can't live without you.

170
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,680
I feel uneasy.

171
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,920
Do you have something to tell me?

172
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,320
You want to see a movie with me?

173
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,880
I should treat you to a movie.

174
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,520
You can't pay for it.

175
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,400
Don't give it to me.

176
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,920
This is hard to get.

177
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,560
Yimo gave it to me.

178
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,560
I want to watch it with you.

179
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:34,800
You know?

180
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,760
This movie is so good.

181
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,160
I almost cried

182
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,400
I almost cried.

183
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,440
I thought they would never see each other again.

184
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,920
But luckily, it's a happy ending.

185
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,040
Otherwise, I might have insomnia tonight.

186
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,760
Meeting on such a beautiful mountain

187
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,400
We share the same dream.

188
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,160
Iron friendship.

189
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,280
How could we break up?

190
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,400
I knew it.

191
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,200
they'll be together.

192
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,800
If you say so,

193
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,160
It's a bit too much.

194
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,920
Their identities are so different.

195
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,280
It's quite stressful to be together.

196
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,040
Have you forgotten

197
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,320
They were on the top of Mount Lushan.

198
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,920
on the top of Mount Lushan.

199
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:17,800
What's wrong, comrade?

200
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,040
Sir, are you hurt?

201
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:19,640
Get up.

202
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,920
Why are you bleeding so much?

203
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,880
Stop running!

204
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,040
Chen Gui Zhi, you bitch, you want a beating?

205
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:28,760
Go to a store.

206
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,160
Look at you laughing like a flower.

207
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,520
Are you that short of men?

208
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,400
Shameless!

209
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,400
I'm not.

210
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,200
What's wrong with buying drinks for the kid?

211
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,520
How dare you talk back?

212
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,160
Go home!

213
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,280
What are you doing?

214
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:40,920
It's between husband and wife.

215
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,040
It's my family business. It's none of your business.

216
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,680
Don't hit women.

217
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,400
I hit my wife, you know?

218
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,880
No, don't do it.

219
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,000
What are you doing?

220
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,160
Calm down.

221
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,000
Calm down.

222
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,680
What are you doing?

223
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,440
Calm down.

224
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,760
Zhang, her wound is too deep.

225
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,160
We need to stitch her in the bathroom.

226
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:06,800
Calm down.

227
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,040
Your name is Wang Jianguo, right?

228
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,200
Yes, boss.

229
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,040
I lent you my bike.

230
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,560
It's not urgent.

231
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,800
I know where you live.

232
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,440
I'll go to your house in a few days.

233
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,400
and check on your wife.

234
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:34,680
Okay.

235
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,800
Thank you.

236
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,280
Do you look like a man?

237
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,440
Take good care of your wife.

238
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,800
Be a man.

239
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:42,560
Yes.

240
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,040
Brother, don't worry.

241
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,880
I'll take care of my wife and my bike.

242
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,280
Let's go.

243
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,400
Honey!

244
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:56,800
Honey!

245
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,440
Honey.

246
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,640
I'm leaving.

247
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,040
I...

248
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,320
Qin, let me send you home.

249
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:11,800
Let's go.

250
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:31,280
You seem different from usual.

251
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:32,440
I...

252
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,320
I didn't think too much.

253
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,160
We need to cure the disease.

254
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,400
How?

255
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,320
A man like him bullies the weak and fears the strong.

256
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,040
You won't cure him, right?

257
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,160
He'll hit his wife again when he comes home.

258
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,200
But I was a little excited just now.

259
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,680
I forgot you were still here.

260
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:55,760
Did I scare you?

261
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,280
I have a chance to see your other side.

262
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,000
It's quite interesting.

263
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,680
What do you think of my other side?

264
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,640
Do you like

265
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,160
Do you like anything?

266
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,160
I can't say that.

267
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,560
I was wondering

268
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,000
how bad a man should be.

269
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,280
Beat his own wife.

270
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,760
If I get married,

271
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,640
I'll make her happy every day.

272
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,200
Women are meant to hurt.

273
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:25,680
Right?

274
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,000
Is Lushan Love pretty?

275
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,160
Yes.

276
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,000
So pretty.

277
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,280
Let's go.

278
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,200
What are you thinking? Time to go home.

279
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,440
It's true. I'm late.

280
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,920
Are you going to see Physician Qin?

281
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,440
I've never seen you so active besides saving people.

282
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,640
Beihai

283
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,440
Emergency! Get out!

284
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,200
Now?

285
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:09,920
Dong Zi.

286
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,400
Let's go.

287
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,520
Jian Guo.

288
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:32,800
Jian Guo.

289
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,160
You're here.

290
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,520
Dong Zi, take the kid out.

291
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,200
Go play outside. Be good.

292
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,280
Let the doctor see your dad.

293
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,480
Did you smoke again?

294
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,280
Yes.

295
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,800
I can't persuade him at all.

296
00:18:58,960 --> 00:18:59,800
Wang Jianguo.

297
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,880
The doctor has confirmed that you have lung cancer.

298
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,240
If you keep doing this,

299
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,200
no one can help you.

300
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,760
I've been smoking for more than ten years.

301
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,680
It's hard to quit.

302
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,120
How can others quit?

303
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,280
You're the only one who can't quit.

304
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,760
Are you abandoning this family?

305
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,800
Dad. Dad.

306
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,920
How is the doctor?

307
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:27,640
Dad! Dad!

308
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:30,680
Wake up! Hurry!

309
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:31,920
Hurry up.

310
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,640
Jian Guo.

311
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,920
Dad!

312
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,480
Jian Guo, wake up.

313
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,160
Dad, how are you?

314
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:36,680
Jian Guo.

315
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,520
Jian Guo!

316
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,560
Jian Guo!

317
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,960
Jian Guo, wake up!

318
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:43,960
Jian Guo, wake up!

319
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:45,880
Gu, hurry up.

320
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:46,960
Okay.

321
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,400
Doctor, how is Wang Jianguo?

322
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,280
He's gone. My condolences.

323
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,160
Let's go.

324
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,040
Let's go.

325
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,480
Jian Guo!

326
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,360
You can't go in.

327
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,360
You can't enter the operating room.

328
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,120
You can't go in.

329
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:18,920
My condolences.

330
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,720
Calm down.

331
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,560
Mom! Mom!

332
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,720
Don't cry.

333
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,320
We're here. We're here.

334
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,000
Don't worry.

335
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:29,960
Jian Guo.

336
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,240
Jian Guo.

337
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,280
My condolences.

338
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,280
Why did she leave?

339
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,280
Don't cry, mom.

340
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,760
Dong Zi, it's time to get out.

341
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,240
Don't cry, Mom.

342
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,440
We're here.

343
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,800
I'll take good care of you.

344
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,000
Mom! Mom!

345
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,720
Don't cry.

346
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:06,560
Mom, don't cry.

347
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,640
And us.

348
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,240
I'll take care of you like Dad.

349
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,040
Mom.

350
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,280
My condolences.

351
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,480
Hai, are you okay?

352
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Brother, have some.

353
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,720
It's delicious. Have some.

354
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,200
A man like him

355
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,480
is a jerk.

356
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,720
How many times have I told him?

357
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,280
Stop smoking.

358
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:07,760
Now he's gone.

359
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,120
How can they live in the future?

360
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,520
This kind of person

361
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,080
doesn't deserve to be a father.

362
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,120
Exactly.

363
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,760
Look at his family.

364
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,360
He's as thin as bean sprouts.

365
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,920
Chen Guizhi is so unlucky

366
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,600
with such a man.

367
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,720
I think it's better to get a divorce as soon as possible.

368
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,800
You little brat.

369
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,400
You're still young. What do you know?

370
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,240
Chen Guizhi is uneducated and unemployed.

371
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,960
He can only rely on Wang Jianguo to support his family.

372
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,240
Life is a bit miserable.

373
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,920
But without him,

374
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,680
it would be harder.

375
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:42,880
At that time,

376
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,520
I should have scolded him harder

377
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,720
and wake him up.

378
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,720
Hai, we've tried our best.

379
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,560
If we could wake him up,

380
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,320
we wouldn't have come this far.

381
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,320
If we meet someone like him,

382
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,760
Don't say you're not responsible for your family.

383
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,520
it'll be irresponsible for your own life.

384
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,920
What else can I do?

385
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,960
Beihai, you

386
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,400
You gave all your salary for this month

387
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,880
What about you this month?

388
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,240
You guys take care of me.

389
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,720
I have no money.

390
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,640
This meal is on me.

391
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,720
Have some.

392
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,320
There's a donkey restaurant ahead

393
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:46,880
It's delicious.

394
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,680
I'll buy it for you.

395
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,720
Maybe it's closed.

396
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,680
Why are you giving me money?

397
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:25,560
I know

398
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,640
you are helping Wang Jianguo's wife and children.

399
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,040
Didn't you donate

400
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,120
to their family?

401
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,800
How did you know?

402
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,760
Who told you?

403
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:33,880
No one told me.

404
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,320
You help them.

405
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:36,680
I'll help you.

406
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,520
You have the money.

407
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,760
I'll take it when I use it.

408
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,240
You really don't need to give it to me?

409
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,480
This is the rule of the Zhang family.

410
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,280
My wife is in charge of the money.

411
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:29,680
Shu Hua.

412
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,960
I don't know how to face Chi.

413
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,800
He has his demands.

414
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,240
I have my persistence.

415
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,440
He did it for the truth.

416
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,160
And I

417
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:45,680
I can't let my son know the truth because of you.

418
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,120
What should I do?

419
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,560
Shu Hua.

420
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,480
I'm really afraid

421
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,200
will go the way you take.

422
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,360
Dr. Zhang, look over there and I'll go this way.

423
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,560
Tell me when you find it.

424
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,040
I'll help you with the procedure.

425
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,880
Okay, thank you.

426
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,520
It's okay.

427
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,080
Make it clear later.

428
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,160
Uncle Sun, it's really you.

429
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,040
It's me.

430
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:18,680
Hello, Uncle Sun.

431
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,400
Hello.

432
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:20,600
Uncle Sun.

433
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,520
I was supposed to

434
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,840
ask you out to find a tea house.

435
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,280
But we're working today.

436
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,960
You know our work nature.

437
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:28,960
I'm sorry.

438
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,320
It's okay.

439
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,360
It's understandable.

440
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,880
You really look like Qin.

441
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,160
But I didn't recognize you.

442
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,320
I'll leave you guys alone.

443
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,160
Qi Tuo.

444
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,680
Stay here with me.

445
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:44,680
Listen.

446
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:46,400
Okay.

447
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,160
Uncle Sun, have a seat.

448
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,680
OK. Have a seat.

449
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,040
I'll get you some water.

450
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:59,040
Uncle Sun, when you were young,

451
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,400
when you were young, right?

452
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,040
Your mother

453
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,520
always follows me around.

454
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:08,880
Here, Uncle Sun.

455
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,040
Okay, thank you.

456
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,240
She's famous for being bold.

457
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,160
to go down the river and climb trees.

458
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,600
She dares to do anything.

459
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,800
Even on the day of the college entrance exam,

460
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,680
on the college entrance exam.

461
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,160
I have to go even with a cast.

462
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,880
She's a girl I admire.

463
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,040
What a pity.

464
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,680
Have you been in touch

465
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,440
have you been in touch with my dad?

466
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,960
What's wrong, Uncle Sun?

467
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:42,600
Nothing.

468
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:47,400
I don't get along with your dad.

469
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,040
But

470
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,400
it's all a mess.

471
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:53,800
Forget it.

472
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,040
Do you know why my mom died?

473
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,880
How did you know?

474
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,040
Uncle Sun.

475
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,760
My mother grew up with you.

476
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,880
You and my dad are colleagues.

477
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,680
I remember on my birthday one year,

478
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,320
you bought me a birthday cake.

479
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,240
and my birthday.

480
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,880
If you know the truth,

481
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,040
please tell me.

482
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,240
I'm Liu Zhi Gang, a student of my mom.

483
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:21,800
told me.

484
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,040
He's now a secretary at our center.

485
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,040
He said

486
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,040
some rumors

487
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,880
between my parents.

488
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,120
Child,

489
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,040
It's been so many years.

490
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,120
Is it meaningful for you to pursue it now?

491
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,000
Yes.

492
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,320
I want to know the truth.

493
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,720
I want to know what happened.

494
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,800
I want to know why my mom committed suicide.

495
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,560
Do you really want to know the answer?

496
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:51,840
I want to know.

497
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,280
No matter what the truth is,

498
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,400
Actually,

499
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,440
it's my fault.

500
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,600
If

501
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,000
if I told your mother,

502
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,440
everything would be fine.

503
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:07,680
About your father and that woman,

504
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,600
about your father and that woman.

505
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:29,000
Shuhua Shuhua

506
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,600
Yimo.

507
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,280
What a coincidence. Where are you going?

508
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,440
I need to go to the emergency station to find Zhang.

509
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,720
Come up. I'll take you there.

510
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:41,800
No need.

511
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,440
I'll be there after two steps.

512
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:46,880
I'll walk with you.

513
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,960
Gu, you guys go back first.

514
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,520
You really don't have to come down.

515
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,720
It's only two steps away.

516
00:31:59,000 --> 00:31:59,400
It's okay.

517
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,320
I...

518
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,560
We haven't seen each other for a long time.

519
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,800
We can talk about your hospital.

520
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,240
Okay, let's go.

521
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,040
I heard

522
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,880
you've been Professor Wang's assistant.

523
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,720
It's mainly because everyone cares about me.

524
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,560
Otherwise, I wouldn't have improved so fast.

525
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:17,960
You're too polite.

526
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,040
You're so young.

527
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,960
at such a young age.

528
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,320
I'm sure you'll have a bright future.

529
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,320
But I think

530
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:29,040
this medical career is developing too fast.

531
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:30,120
Yimo.

532
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,720
I heard that a foreign hospital

533
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,520
has started to transplant artificial heart.

534
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:34,520
I really think

535
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,240
I still have a lot to learn.

536
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,400
But you can't work too hard.

537
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,120
Take care of yourself.

538
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:43,280
By the way,

539
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,440
I just got some

540
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,840
a few days ago.

541
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,280
I'll send it to you in a few days.

542
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,560
Really?

543
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,400
Great. Thank you, Yimo.

544
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,040
You're welcome.

545
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:56,800
Those books

546
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,880
I read two books.

547
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,720
It should help you a lot.

548
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:01,880
That's great.

549
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
I need it now.

550
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,160
I passed by your company a few days ago.

551
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,560
I wanted to go in.

552
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:08,880
But

553
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,840
No, no.

554
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:16,880
This really can't

555
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,040
I really can't.

556
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,240
I can't take your money.

557
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,840
Look.

558
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,000
Isn't that the little widow

559
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,000
Zhang Beihai

560
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,240
Look how close they are

561
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,120
Those who don't know

562
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,160
I thought they were a couple.

563
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:28,960
Seriously.

564
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,000
Don't listen to them.

565
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,720
They like to gossip.

566
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,560
I really don't want it.

567
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,000
I just brought it for you.

568
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,280
You're usually so tired

569
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,120
Beihai is a nice guy.

570
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,440
He's loyal and kind.

571
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,240
and helps people.

572
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,960
His biggest problem

573
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,960
is that he doesn't know his place.

574
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:56,120
He cares about everyone.

575
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,720
As time passed,

576
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,800
I don't blame others for having other thoughts about him.

577
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,040
Poppet has nothing to eat.

578
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,600
I understand.

579
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,840
But I just like Zhang.

580
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,840
Be careful.

581
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,000
Brother Zhang.

582
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:32,600
Here, have some water.

583
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,400
Be careful.

584
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:42,440
Why are they getting involved again?

585
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,400
Dad! Dad!

586
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,239
There's a big bug over there.

587
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,000
Why are you yelling?

588
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:55,800
Don't hit him.

589
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,960
He's just a kid. He's immature.

590
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,560
Who told you to talk nonsense?

591
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,000
Brother Zhang, you must be tired.

592
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,320
No.

593
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,000
Let me wipe it for you.

594
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:04,560
Let me do it.

595
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:05,760
Why are you here?

596
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,240
Guizhi, I know you meant well.

597
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,320
But

598
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,920
Let me do it.

599
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,640
I'm thirsty.

600
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:12,680
Boil some water.

601
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,000
Okay.

602
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,640
Why am I here?

603
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,000
We should do good things together.

604
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,000
Together.

605
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,360
What are you doing?

606
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,080
When I was fixing the door,

607
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,120
I asked you not to go.

608
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,480
What are you murmuring about?

609
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,560
Finish it and leave

610
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:33,320
No.

611
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,080
Who offended you again?

612
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,320
Zhang Beihai

613
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,080
Do you really not understand or are you playing dumb?

614
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:39,760
What's wrong?

615
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,560
Watch your behavior, okay?

616
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,120
Now everyone knows

617
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,320
you are dating Shu Hua.

618
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,120
Why do you always come to a widow's house?

619
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:47,480
I realized

620
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,240
you are really

621
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,320
so mean.

622
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,240
In broad daylight, everyone is watching.

623
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,000
He's in trouble.

624
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,200
so I came to help.

625
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,680
Let me ask you.

626
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,880
You agreed when the kid calls you father?

627
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,080
Are you out of your mind?

628
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,440
He just lost his father.

629
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,240
He called me dad. He's immature.

630
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,560
So I agreed. What's wrong?

631
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,360
You think too much

632
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,200
Zhang Beihai, the less you think

633
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,800
the more people gossip

634
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,200
Think about it.

635
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,080
There are so many children

636
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,240
It's not easy, right?

637
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,560
If people gossip about you again,

638
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,680
You don't take it seriously.

639
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,880
You're putting her in trouble.

640
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:21,800
You know what?

641
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,120
Is it so serious

642
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,320
Is it that serious?

643
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:26,920
Yes.

644
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,400
Hurry up.

645
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:57,200
Yimo, is Zhang here?

646
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,560
He hasn't come back yet.

647
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,000
Come in and wait.

648
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:09,440
Okay.

649
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,120
Yimo.

650
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:23,120
I saw there are five phones in the station.

651
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,320
Thank you.

652
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,880
You must be busy recently.

653
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,240
Not bad.

654
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:34,880
What happened to your shoulder?

655
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,560
It's okay. It's a little sore.

656
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,880
I had two surgeries today.

657
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,320
They're all heart tumors.

658
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,120
for almost ten hours.

659
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,920
At first, I was nervous.

660
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,080
But luckily the operation was successful

661
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,480
You came to see Zhang Beihai despite your hard work

662
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,200
Your relationship

663
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,240
who is more important

664
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,560
who should pay more

665
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,000
Doesn't Zhang Beihai know that?

666
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,120
Yimo, it's a good thing.

667
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,240
Why are you so anxious?

668
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,760
Don't be careless with me.

669
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:04,920
I know.

670
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,120
You're free now, right?

671
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,560
If you want to be with him,

672
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,440
no one can control you.

673
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,560
But we grew up together.

674
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,320
I sincerely advise you

675
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,560
You and Zhang Beihai are different

676
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,640
For so long

677
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,200
I can see

678
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,800
Zhang Beihai is not ambitious

679
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:24,920
Peace in the present

680
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:25,480
He can never

681
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,080
leave this small emergency station.

682
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,120
But you're different.

683
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,240
You graduated from a prestigious medical school.

684
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,440
When I was an intern,

685
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,360
I went to the operating table with the professor.

686
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,560
He became a surgeon after he became a regular employee.

687
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,760
Everyone knows

688
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,360
how much people value you.

689
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,240
You can be a professor in a few years.

690
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,320
Director Guo.

691
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,560
You have a bright future.

692
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,760
When you're with him,

693
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,120
with him.

694
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,480
Do you think you have a future?

695
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,440
I'm preparing for the exam too.

696
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,120
I'm going to work in the ER.

697
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,680
and develop in the hospital

698
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,800
we are not on the same boat as Zhang Beihai

699
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,240
You two

700
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,760
can walk together.

701
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,560
But he'll be on a crossroad sooner or later.

702
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:17,240
I don't want you to be sad in the future.

703
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:18,680
Shu Hua.

704
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:21,120
Since your relationship has just begun,

705
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,680
I hope you can reconsider

706
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,800
your relationship with him.

707
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,320
Yimo.

708
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,880
I know you said these for my own good.

709
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,240
But

710
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,480
I think treating patients

711
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:38,000
is the same

712
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,080
it's the same.

713
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,880
There is no distinction between nobleness and nobleness.

714
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,320
No matter what form it is,

715
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,920
no matter what title it has,

716
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,760
As the saying goes,

717
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,800
without reserved and calculating.

718
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,440
In my heart,

719
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,240
Brother Zhang is that kind of person.

720
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,320
He has great love.

721
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,880
He doesn't mean it.

722
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,320
nor pretends to be noble.

723
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,240
I admire his character.

724
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,640
You really fell into his trap.

725
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,200
What love? What good doctor?

726
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,240
He's idle every day.

727
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,320
He entertains cats and dogs every day.

728
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,760
Didn't you hear

729
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:10,680
what he said outside?

730
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,240
I was being nice. I...

731
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,920
I hope you don't be fooled by him.

732
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,480
Yimo, I'm an adult.

733
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,920
I have the ability to judge right from wrong.

734
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:22,000
Brother Zhang and I

735
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:22,920
our relationship.

736
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:23,760
I hope

737
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,560
you won't talk about him in front of me.

738
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:26,200
Okay?

739
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,560
Let's have some water.

740
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,120
It's like you've had two pot heads.

741
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:49,800
The more you drink, the more unhappy you are.

742
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,120
Come on, cheers.

743
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:57,760
You don't deserve it.

744
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,440
You...

745
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,200
You're like this stinky tofu.

746
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,560
Smell it. It stinks.

747
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:07,360
Eat it.

748
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,320
Smells good

749
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,240
Just like this cucumber

750
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:12,320
You need a beat

751
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,920
Why can't I speak?

752
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,320
Don't you know you have a bad mouth?

753
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:23,480
You're the one with bad mouth.

754
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:24,480
You ate stinky tofu.

755
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,480
You stink all over your body

756
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,120
I love cucumber

757
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,880
Why do you always steal what I like

758
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,800
You can just order one more.

759
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:37,880
Boss it's okay

760
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,800
I won't eat cucumber for the rest of my life

761
