00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:37,960
Wait.

3
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,600
Wait.

4
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:39,320
What's wrong?

5
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,400
Sir, what’s your name?

6
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,840
Yanyan.

7
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,479
Yan Yunyun.

8
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,600
Yunyun, don’t worry.

9
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,560
Don’t be nervous.

10
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,200
These two doctors

11
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,000
are the best doctors in our center.

12
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,160
We have to trust them.

13
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,680
We have to believe in fire.

14
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,680
Stop it. Stop it.

15
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,960
Hurry up. Stop talking.

16
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,720
Let's talk when it's done

17
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,320
Qi Tuo, put your hands on it.

18
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:11,680
Come on.

19
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,440
Come on. Come on.

20
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:16,840
Okay.

21
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,200
Hang in there, far.

22
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,600
I got it.

23
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,840
It's okay.

24
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,600
Chi, calm down.

25
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,440
Hold on.

26
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:27,960
Hang in there.

27
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,920
All right.

28
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,720
It's okay. Come on.

29
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:33,960
Alright

30
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,560
Slow down.

31
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,480
Slowly.

32
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,600
Slowly.

33
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,079
Slowly.

34
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,240
Stretcher. Come on.

35
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,079
Okay, right away.

00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,440
Come on.

37
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,320
Is Zheng Bo not here yet?

38
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:52,960
Coming.

39
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,200
Bo, hurry up.

40
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,079
Hurry up, Zheng Bo.

41
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:56,960
Hurry up.

42
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:57,960
Slowly.

43
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,840
He can only sit because he has difficulty breathing.

44
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,360
Sit down.

45
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,680
Zheng Bo, be careful.

46
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,240
It should be stuck in the soil.

47
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:02,680
Okay.

48
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,120
You have to dig out the soil first.

49
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,200
Come on.

50
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,680
Slow down.

51
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,360
Low blood sugar.

52
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,960
He can only sit when he can't breathe.

53
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,840
Slow down.

54
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:13,920
After the examination,

55
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,200
send him to the hospital for an X-ray.

56
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,200
Let's go there first.

57
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:21,720
Come on.

58
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,200
One two three

59
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,480
Be careful.

60
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,600
Hold it. Hold it.

61
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,120
Hang in there.

62
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,120
Slow down. It's okay.

63
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:31,600
It's slightly slippery.

64
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,079
It's okay.

65
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,720
Hang in there. It's okay.

66
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,600
Slowly

67
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,040
Take your time.

68
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,360
One, two, three.

69
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,680
Come on, Wang City.

70
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,320
Move back a little. It didn't match.

71
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,960
Okay, the front is matched.

72
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,480
Slow down.

73
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,800
Come, hold him.

74
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,720
I'll hold him.

75
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,320
Behind you.

76
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,080
Come on.

77
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,560
Lock it up

78
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,680
Yuan Yuan, get in the car. Hurry up.

79
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,000

80
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,960
Hurry, get in.

81
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,560
Close the door. Get in.

82
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,120
Close the door.

83
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,600
Slow down. Go.

84
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,000
Slowly.

85
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,720
Let's go.

86
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,040
Gauze.

87
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:32,560
Here.

88
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,520
Lift it.

89
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,680
Three, two, one.

90
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:49,760
Stretcher.

91
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:51,800
Stretcher.

92
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:55,760
Take your time.

93
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,320
Side. Side. Side.

94
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,920
Raise your legs here.

95
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,120
One, two, three. Okay, slow down.

96
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:08,760
Slowly.

97
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,760
Come on.

98
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,840
Let's go. Slow down.

99
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:15,760
Be careful.

100
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,280
Be careful.

101
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,520
Don't look.

102
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,840
The data is normal.

103
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,000
Jiangdong EMSS Emergency.

104
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,560
Only you are a doctor.

105
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,440
I can understand.

106
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,200
This is too close to the heart.

107
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,880
It's probably pricked.

108
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,200
Once you enter the operating room,

109
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,280
you might not be able to come out.

110
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,600
Stop it.

111
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,200
I won't die.

112
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,800
Why are you in a hurry?

113
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:51,520
Master.

114
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,280
Zhang Chi.

115
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,720
I'm really happy

116
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,520
I'm really happy.

117
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,240
Stop talking, Xu Chengyuan.

118
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,960
Let me finish.

119
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,840
If I go into the operating room,

120
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,280
I won't be able to get out.

121
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,520
I won't have a chance to say it.

122
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,040
Look.

123
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,440
Who would have thought

124
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,760
I would end up in this mess?

125
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,280
So,

126
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,920
I don't know

127
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,000
I don't know which one will go first.

128
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,440
Zhang Chi.

129
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,080
Master.

130
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,520
Take care of yourselves.

131
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,280
and be happy.

132
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,560
If you keep talking, I'll...

133
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,240
I'll scold you for real.

134
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,320
Fine, I won’t.

135
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:41,640
Jiangdong LMSS emergency.

136
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,480
I'm hanging up.

137
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,840
Master! Master!

138
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,200
What?

139
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,120
Come here.

140
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,040
Don't cry for me in front of Zhang Chi.

141
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,200
Give it to me.

142
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,760
Get me a needle and come quickly.

143
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,320
Okay.

144
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,920
I'll give you a needle.

145
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,840
Stop talking.

146
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,120
You don't listen to me.

147
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,040
It's okay. I'll be fine.

148
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:15,280
Jiangdong Emergency

149
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:16,160
Jiangdong Emergency

150
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,200
Don't worry.

151
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,000
Stop it.

152
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,280
I'll be fine.

153
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,200
I'm lucky.

154
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,000
Don't worry.

155
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:28,440
Jiangdong LMSS Emergency.

156
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:31,960
Gangdong LMSS Emergency!

157
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,840
The surgery is over.

158
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,159
Dr. Oh.

159
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:34,919
How was the surgery?

160
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:39,039
He's only two centimeters away from the heart.

161
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,120
It's only this close to the major blood vessel.

162
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:43,240
Where is he?

163
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,440
He's fine.

164
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,880
He's lucky.

165
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,320
But

166
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,600
he needs to be hospitalized for a few days.

167
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,400
Don't stay here. Go back and rest.

168
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,200
Thank you.

169
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,040
Thank you.

170
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,080
Thank you.

171
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,840
Let me tell you again.

172
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,960
no matter what happens,

173
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,560
be careful.

174
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,560
We must evacuate as soon as possible

175
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,240
we must evacuate as soon as possible.

176
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,440
This time,

177
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,360
is inevitable.

178
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,600
Fortunately, he was saved.

179
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,400
During his absence,

180
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,240
we need to

181
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,680
should be adjusted.

182
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:28,880
Zhang Chi.

183
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,400
You've been in the center for a while.

184
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,840
From now on,

185
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,840
you'll lead Xu Chengyuan's team

186
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:35,960
until he comes back.

187
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:39,640
Okay.

188
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:40,800
If anything happens, 008401.

189
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,880
If anything happens, 84001.

190
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,120
If anything happens,

191
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,720
if anything happens.

192
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:44,680
Got it.

193
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,640
What are you doing?

194
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,840
Are you making trouble for me?

195
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,320
The doctor doesn't allow you to be discharged.

196
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:12,960
You can't be discharged.

197
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,160
Why didn't you listen?

198
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,640
What doctor said?

199
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,240
I'm a doctor.

200
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,200
Who wants to be discharged?

201
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,360
Let's see who's going to be discharged.

202
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,120
You're leaving?

203
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,120
You scared me.

204
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,120
Sister Qi, Dr. Zhang, you're here.

205
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:21,720
Sit down.

206
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,840
No, sit down.

207
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:23,960
Sit here.

208
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,360
The doctor said

209
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,400
I've recovered.

210
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,800
I can't live here anymore.

211
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,560
I'll go crazy if I go on like this.

212
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,400
I'm going crazy.

213
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,800
Being crazy is better than being dead.

214
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,880
Are you... Do you have any superpower?

215
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,840
Are you Wolverine?

216
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,240
Why don't you stay in the hospital?

217
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,240
Do you want to die?

218
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,080
What's wrong with our center?

219
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,200
what's going on in our center.

220
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,800
We're short of hands.

221
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,240
I'm short of hands. Are you?

222
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:43,960
You're a loser now.

223
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,160
Do you know what you're doing?

224
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:45,920
I...

225
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,680
Sister Qi, stop talking about him.

226
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,560
It's still bleeding

227
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,360
Let me tell you.

228
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,800
If you don't stay here for 50 days,

229
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,080
I'll beat you until you stay for another 50 days.

230
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:53,840
Do you hear me?

231
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,160
Lie down. Hurry up.

232
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,120
Lie down. Hurry up.

233
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,480
Jia Qi is looking for you.

234
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,400
So gossipy.

235
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,960
Isn't that normal?

236
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,160
Well...

237
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,640
My app The investor

238
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,400
to talk to me.

239
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,160
You haven't confessed to her yet?

240
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,040
What are you waiting for?

241
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,040
I just want to make some achievements

242
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,040
and tell her something else.

243
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,320
She doesn't care about that.

244
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,320
Hurry up.

245
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,880
Okay.

246
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:22,920
Well...

247
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,640
I'm going to talk with the boss.

248
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,360
I'm leaving.

249
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,120
Bye. Take care of yourself.

250
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,360
Hurry up. Okay.

251
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,640
I'll listen to Sister Qi.

252
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,080
Got it.

253
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:33,880
Move.

254
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,200
Lie down.

255
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,640
Lie down.

256
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,400
What are you thinking?

257
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,640
Lie down.

258
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,120
Get out.

259
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:20,640
I said,

260
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,320
After I was discharged,

261
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,400
after I was discharged.

262
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,720
You don't need to go for the examination.

263
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,160
The doctor said

264
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,600
this is a critical time.

265
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,920
Don't take it lightly.

266
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,280
You should be more careful.

267
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:38,920
Don't worry.

268
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,440
Everything is under my control.

269
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,440
Stop working.

270
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,800
Take a rest.

271
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,400
Okay.

272
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,120
I'm going up

273
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,680
Qi

274
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,680
Let me see what's going on

275
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,480
Coming

276
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,760
Qi hurry up

277
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,200
It'll be ready soon

278
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,680
What's wrong?

279
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,880
What news?

280
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,960
Why are you laughing like that?

281
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,880
Why are you laughing?

282
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,200
I just want...

283
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,400
Let me see.

284
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,680
There's someone funny.

285
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,120
You didn't let me see it but you sneaked into it.

286
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,840
Watch some serious news.

287
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:57,840
Zhang Chi.

288
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,240
Dong Liang from the gas station is sentenced today.

289
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,120
He will be sentenced to life.

290
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,880
He deserved it.

291
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,320
When I think about it, I was really scared that day.

292
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,880
There was a mistake in the middle.

293
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,680
There are school kindergarten nearby.

294
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,400
Of course.

295
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,680
We're really lucky.

296
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,400
Yes, not two lives.

297
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,520
If it explodes,

298
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,400
no one can escape.

299
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,960
If we have kids in the future,

300
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,320
If something like this happens,

301
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,760
I can only go alone.

302
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,240
Someone has to take care of the child.

303
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,600
You're thinking too far.

304
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,680
You even have kids.

305
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,520
How can this happen so often?

306
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,040
No.

307
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,320
What do you mean? Haven't you thought about it?

308
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,680
No, that's not necessary.

309
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,480
You need someone to help you.

310
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,040
Listen.

311
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,880
Dating without marriage

312
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,400
is to play hooligans.

313
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,480
Haven't you heard of that?

314
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,840
Who's a bully?

315
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,120
Who said that?

316
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,880
If you do this, I won't be polite.

317
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,840
What are you doing, Zhang Chi?

318
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,680
Help me, Zhang Chi.

319
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,600
You have to take me to the hospital.

320
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,240
You're going to crush me.

321
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:21,760
I'm leaving.

322
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,360
Bye.

323
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,040
Let's go.

324
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:23,920
Let's go.

325
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:24,920
Let's go.

326
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,320
Okay.

327
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:28,800
What do you want for dinner?

328
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,040
Have a drumstick, Chi.

329
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:30,640
Make one

330
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,880
Chicken leg again?

331
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,040
I'm going to...

332
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,520
Wait, my mom.

333
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,200
What's wrong with Mom?

334
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:42,760
What?

335
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:44,640
What?

336
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:50,520
Mom.

337
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,360
What's going on?

338
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,120
What happened?

339
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:54,680
Qi Tuo

340
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,760
What happened?

341
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:56,920
Your dad.

342
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,760
Your dad was drunk driving.

343
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,240
The car went out of control and hit three people.

344
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,880
He quit drinking.

345
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,400
Why did he drink and drive? Why?

346
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,360
He has Alcohol dependence.

347
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:09,960
When did that happen?

348
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,200
Why didn't I know?

349
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,920
You told him to quit drinking.

350
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,240
he had been controlling it.

351
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,960
He just drank a little.

352
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,080
I think his business is hard.

353
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,080
I just turned a blind eye

354
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,960
I thought he could control it.

355
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,120
But unexpectedly,

356
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,360
I don't know what's going on.

357
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,760
I'm addicted to alcohol.

358
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,320
He's even better than before.

359
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,520
It's okay.

360
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,760
It's okay.

361
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,200
Is it serious?

362
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,200
I didn't see him either.

363
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,760
I heard they are all in the hospital.

364
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,640
Where is Qi Xuejun?

365
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,640
Get out!

366
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,520
Qi Xuejun, come out!

367
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,400
Are you Qi Xuejun's family?

368
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,640
My son went to school this morning.

369
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,760
I was hit by him.

370
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,760
Drinking and driving?

371
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,080
My dad went to buy groceries.

372
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,440
Why did I meet this crazy man?

373
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,000
Your husband is a troublemaker.

374
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:52,840
Let him out.

375
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,880
We are Qi Xuejun's family.

376
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,880
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

377
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,760
What's the use of apologizing?

378
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,000
Please calm down.

379
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,560
No one wants to see

380
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,840
what happened today.

381
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,320
But the most important thing now is to save the injured.

382
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,960
to minimize the damage to them.

383
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,400
Don't worry.

384
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,400
We will try our best

385
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,640
We'll try our best to satisfy you.

386
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,640
My name is Zhang Chi.

387
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,080
I'm Qi Xuejun's son-in-law.

388
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,440
This is my WeChat.

389
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,640
You can call me anytime if you need anything.

390
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,280
We will try our best to satisfy you.

391
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,880
We will never escape responsibility.

392
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:41,960
Have some water.

393
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,320
The doctor said

394
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,760
the treatment went well.

395
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,600
I guess Uncle Qi will wake up soon.

396
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,400
Who would have thought this would happen?

397
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,560
I was fooled.

398
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,200
It's fine as long as he's fine.

399
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,280
That's the most important thing, right?

400
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,080
Okay.

401
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:13,560
How is it?

402
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,400
Qu.

403
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,200
Did the surgery go well?

404
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,400
He said there was no fatal injury.

405
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,720
It's nothing serious.

406
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,000
It's my fault.

407
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,520
I shouldn't have kept it from you for Uncle.

408
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,760
If I told you earlier,

409
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,280
this wouldn't have happened.

410
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,880
You knew he had Alcohol dependence?

411
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,520
I went to a bar with him.

412
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,640
He was drunk.

413
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,640
When I sent him home,

414
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,440
Aunt told me.

415
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,200
I've been controlling it well.

416
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,000
It just relapsed recently.

417
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,760
Uncle didn't let me tell you

418
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,960
because he didn't want you to worry.

419
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,000
No, it was under control.

420
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,520
Why does it relapse?

421
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,520
What's the reason?

422
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,960
Maybe it's because

423
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,000
the car accident 20 years ago.

424
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,520
has hurt him a lot.

425
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,520
What do you mean?

426
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,280
20 years ago,

427
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,880
the car accident I was with my dad.

428
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,000
Yes, after the accident,

429
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,320
after the car accident.

430
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,400
The reason he was like this

431
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,640
because of the doctor who died in a car accident.

432
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,200
caused his stress disorder.

433
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,960
He can only paralyze himself with alcohol.

434
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,760
I heard that doctor is a cardiac surgeon.

435
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,520
He saved a lot of people.

436
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,400
and a child.

437
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,080
So over the years,

438
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,640
all these years.

439
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,280
My mom was the youngest cardiac surgeon

440
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,840
in the city hospital.

441
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,160
I'll go buy something.

442
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,520
Qi Tuo, I'm relieved that Uncle is fine.

443
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,520
Take good care of him.

444
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:43,960
I'll come back next time.

445
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,320
Qiqi.

446
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,080
Qiqi.

447
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:21,520
Dad.

448
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,440
How do you feel?

449
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,880
I feel...

450
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,520
Where is this?

451
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,560
In the hospital.

452
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,080
Did you drink and drive?

453
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,200
A car accident.

454
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,720
You're fine after the surgery.

455
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,720
Drive. There was an accident.

456
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,880
Did you hit anyone?

457
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,320
I don't want to see

458
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,520
20 years ago.

459
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,640
I made another mistake 20 years ago.

460
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:12,760
Dad.

461
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,520
Hey, hey. Hey.

462
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,760
20 years ago,

463
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,720
the car accident we had together.

464
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,160
in the car accident

465
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,400
What's his name?

466
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,200
How did you know?

467
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,880
Your mom told you.

468
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:50,440
Yes.

469
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,520
After that accident,

470
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,280
every time I think about this,

471
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,440
I feel scared.

472
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:05,840
All these years,

473
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:09,560
this has always been my problem.

474
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,320
Dad, do you remember

475
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,520
Do you remember her name?

476
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,160
Of course I do.

477
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,200
I've never forgotten.

478
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,320
Never.

479
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,160
Her name is

480
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,960
Qin Shuhua.

481
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:06,960
Zhang Chi.

482
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,760
Qi.

483
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,520
Qi.

484
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,520
Was that Zhang Chi?

485
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,440
Why did he leave?

486
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,720
Qin Shuhua.

487
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,760
Zhang Chi's mom.

488
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:55,440
Dad.

489
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,400
Zhang Chi's mom.

490
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,080
Dad, I need to go out.

491
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,520
I can't leave him alone.

492
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,720
I'll be right back.

493
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,120
Qi Qi

494
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:09,200
Come on.

495
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,960
Dad.

496
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,720
Doctor!

497
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,440
Doctor!

498
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,440
Blood oxygen.

499
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:26,000
Dad, I'm here.

500
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,000
The patient's cardiopulmonary function is not good.

501
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,320
He can't breathe on his own.

502
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,520
We have to intubate him immediately.

503
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,200
Does his family agree?

504
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,520
Yes, yes.

505
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,440
Dad, dad is fine.

506
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,560
It's okay.

507
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,240
What's wrong, Chi?

508
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,360
Are you not in a good mood without Sister Qi?

509
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,000
There's an old saying.

510
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,120
life and death

511
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,440
other than life and death.

512
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,000
Everything will be fine.

513
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,560
0108 Bulk Team, Emergency Mission.

514
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,640
An old man passed out at home in Sunshine Community.

515
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,000
Copy that.

516
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,840
Get out! Get out!

517
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,600
Qiqi.

518
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,200
Qiqi.

519
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,720
You're awake, dad.

520
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,600
How do you feel?

521
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,600
Not bad.

522
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,000
Let me ask you.

523
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,640
Did I hit anyone

524
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,760
Did I hit anyone?

525
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,200
How are they?

526
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,480
Dad, just take care of yourself.

527
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,600
I'll take care of the rest.

528
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,720
It's better to get yourself ready first.

529
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,360
Okay.

530
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,240
No matter how much it costs,

531
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,960
you have to compensate him.

532
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,960
Ask the best doctor to use the best medicine.

533
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:04,600
Okay.

534
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:05,720
No.

535
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,840
Get our tea room out.

536
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,600
Okay, I'll deal with it when I'm free.

537
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:14,000
Don’t delay your work.

538
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,320
Let Qu help me alone.

539
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,120
Don’t bother her.

540
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,600
She's not related to us.

541
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,480
Listen to me, Qi Qi.

542
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,200
Everyone has their own strengths.

543
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,480
I know more about Qu than you do.

544
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,720
Ask him to sell the tea room.

545
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,360
Just give him the commission.

546
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,760
This time,

547
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,600
I've caused you a lot of trouble.

548
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,480
You still need to handle a lot of things.

549
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,480
Stop talking and get some sleep.

550
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,000
I'll call him.

551
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,480
Qi Qi.

552
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,320
Zhang Chi.

553
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,640
to Zhang Chi.

554
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,640
Hello, Qu.

555
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,640
Can you do me a favor?

556
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,280
to see if

557
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:45,320
buy my dad's tea room.

558
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,920
It doesn't matter if the price is lower.

559
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,040
It's better to pay in full.

560
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,160
Okay.

561
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,440
Come and get the key whenever you have time.

562
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,560
Okay, thank you.

563
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:58,640
Bye.

564
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,440
Mom.

565
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,920
Mom, where are you?

566
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,400
Mom!

567
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,480
Mom!

568
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,920
Mom, where are you?

569
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:31,840
I'm sorry.

570
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,920
I didn't expect

571
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,080
would happen between us.

572
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,239
I'm sorry, Zhang Chi.

573
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,120
Don't be sorry.

574
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,080
It's not up to us

575
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,440
can't be decided by us.

576
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,320
My dad wants to see you.

577
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,120
and apologize to you in person.

578
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,200
OK?

579
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,080
Zhang Chi.

580
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:43,680
After that, I found out

581
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,960
the female doctor I bumped into

582
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,800
is the Head of Cardio Surgery at the North Hospital.

583
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:53,120
She worked hard all her life

584
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,840
and saved many lives.

585
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,200
I...

586
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,680
I'm really sorry.

587
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:04,680
I'm sorry.

588
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,800
I'm sorry to those who got hurt

589
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,200
in the accident.

590
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,080
I know.

591
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:17,240
The most helpless thing in the world is an apology.

592
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,320
But the only thing I can do now

593
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,080
is to apologize.

594
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,680
I'm so sorry.

595
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,680
I'm sorry.

596
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,320
Okay.

597
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,560
Take care of yourself.

598
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,560
It's my fault.

599
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,960
If I hadn't been distracted,

600
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,600
when she hit me,

601
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,720
I could have avoided it.

602
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:44,840
But I still...

603
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,200
What did you say?

604
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,080
When she hit me,

605
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,800
I turned my head

606
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,600
and talked to Qiqi.

607
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,320
Qiqi, are you happy?

608
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:58,200
Yes.

609
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,720
I wish I could come out every day.

610
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,960
Then you have to get 100 points every day.

611
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,480
No problem, Dad.

612
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,120
What's that? A new friend?

613
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:07,840
What's your name?

614
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:08,920
Ma Hua.

615
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,720
Ma Hua is so cute.

616
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,120
When I turn around,

617
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,800
she already hit me.

618
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,360
I still couldn't avoid it.

619
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,480
No.

620
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,960
You mean she hit you?

621
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,360
You didn't hit her.

622
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,800
Then she...

623
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:33,840
She committed suicide.

624
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,840
I didn't shirk my responsibility.

625
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,600
She did bump into me.

626
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,600
There's an accident report.

627
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:45,080
That's what the court police think.

628
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,120
Although I took the main responsibility,

629
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,000
but your mother...

630
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,720
It's true that she died.

631
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:55,480
I shouldn't have come.

632
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:57,720
Zhang Chi.

633
00:37:59,080 --> 00:37:59,920
Zhang Chi.

634
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:01,360
Zhang Chi.

635
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,120
Zhang Chi.

636
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,080
Zhang Chi.

637
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,200
He came to me today to apologize.

638
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,080
I can't accept it emotionally,

639
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:14,960
Reason tells me

640
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,360
it was an accident.

641
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,120
I'm here.

642
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:18,480
What did he just say?

643
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,360
My mom committed suicide.

644
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:21,840
What is he doing?

645
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,320
Isn't he shirking the responsibility?

646
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,480
Because of him,

647
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,600
because he shielded the responsibility.

648
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,200
I didn't mean to defend him.

649
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:28,840
He hit someone.

650
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,320
There's no excuse to escape.

651
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,560
But in that situation,

652
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,680
he had no reason to lie.

653
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,840
What's the point of lying?

654
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:34,960
I don't know what it means.

655
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,920
My mom is 28 years old.

656
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,720
when she was 28.

657
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:41,200
The first heart transplant surgery in the province

658
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,200
was done by my mom.

659
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,560
She's the best in the provincial city. She did so much.

660
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,680
She has such a successful career.

661
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,840
Her husband loves her and her son listens to her.

662
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:48,920
Why did she commit suicide?

663
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,360
I don't know why she committed suicide.

664
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,440
I want to know too.

665
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,200
I only know that my dad

666
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:53,840
he wouldn't lie.

667
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,440
I trust him.

668
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,080
He can't lie now.

669
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:00,840
Leave me alone.

670
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:07,600
Zhang Chi.

671
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,720
I really admire you.

672
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:19,960
You're the only one

673
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:20,720
You're the only one

674
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,080
I just

675
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,840
to make a bed for you as soon as possible.

676
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,320
Cut the crap.

677
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,960
Go back and rest for a month.

678
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:28,960
Don't rush to work.

679
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,480
Come to me for a check-up one month later.

680
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:31,920
Okay, I got it.

681
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:33,480
I'm a doctor too.

682
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:34,320
I know what to do.

683
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:38,480
My phone.

684
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,080
I'm leaving.

685
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,920
Okay, thank you.

686
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,480
Hello, master.

687
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:46,840
Do you have sharp eyes

688
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,080
or pleasant ears?

689
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:48,920
You caught me

690
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:49,840
I was caught by you.

691
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:50,800
You're discharged?

692
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,480
You confessed.

693
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,080
I've stayed here for 50 days

694
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,800
for 50 days.

695
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,600
I'm going back to the center tomorrow

696
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,720
and fight with you.

697
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,200
Well...

698
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,440
Something happened to my family.

699
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,920
I can't go back for a while.

700
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:04,960
What is it?

701
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,720
It's nothing.

702
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,960
I need your help.

703
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:16,720
Okay, I got it.

704
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:34,480
She did bump into me.

705
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,720
That's what the court police think.

706
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,040
I only know that my dad

707
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:38,680
he wouldn't lie.

708
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:39,160
I trust him.

709
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,880
He can't lie right now.

710
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,360
Mom, I'm done.

711
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,680
Okay, let me see.

712
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,040
Good.

713
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,040
Looks like you know a lot of words.

714
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,480
What book are you reading?

715
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:06,160
I borrowed math books from my neighbor.

716
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,280
This is the math for the third grade.

717
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,280
Can you understand it?

718
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,160
Most of them.

719
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,400
Let me give you a quiz.

720
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,280
What is a seduction theory?

721
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:24,480
Hook theory is a triangle.

722
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,960
The square on two angles

723
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:29,480
equals to the square on the diagonal side.

724
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,840
So A plus B equals C.

725
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,360
Sure.

726
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:37,320
Let me test you something harder.

727
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:41,840
What is intersection string theory?

728
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,560
The two strings intertwine in the circle.

729
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:45,800
Two lines separate at the intersection.

730
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,600
They have the same accumulation.

731
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:53,800
If string AB and string CD intersection is P point,

732
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:58,160
it means PA multiplying PB equals PC multiplying PD.

733
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:01,400
If the strings and diameters are intertwined,

734
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,480
it's half of the strings.

735
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:06,160
It's multiplied in a diameter.

736
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:09,840
between two lines.

737
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:14,120
Chi, you're amazing.

738
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,120
You got everything right.

739
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:18,680
Tell me.

740
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:19,840
What reward do you want?

741
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,040
I want to eat your cooking.

742
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,320
Read the book.

743
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,320
Mom, I'll make you fried rice with egg.

744
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:56,160
Hello?

745
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,240
Is Dr. Qin home?

746
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:01,160
Actor table.

747
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:01,800
