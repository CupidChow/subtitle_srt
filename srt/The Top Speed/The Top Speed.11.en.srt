1
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:06,040
You need to eat it. You need to eat it. You need to eat it. You need to eat it. You need to eat it. You need to eat it. You can eat it. You can eat it. You can eat it.

2
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,720
You should eat whatever you want.

3
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,000
and drink whatever you should.

4
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,200
You look like ginseng, bird's nest and deer's nest.

5
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:39,800
Pick whatever you want. I'll reimburse it.

6
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:41,560
You win.

7
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,840
It sounds like a big one.

8
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,280
I didn't tell you before.

9
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,800
I'm rich. My dad is rich.

10
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,360
A rich kid.

11
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,280
What you just said

12
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,440
will make her angry.

13
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:52,440
and aggravate her condition.

14
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,920
Fine, you know a lot.

15
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,080
You're all here.

16
00:01:59,120 --> 00:01:59,560
Uncle Qi

17
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,040
You're here too.

18
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,560
I was looking for you.

19
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,200
We met last time.

20
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,360
What's your surname again?

21
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,840
Vegetable.

22
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:10,560
What dish? His name is Zhang Chi.

23
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,080
My dad.

24
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,720
Come on, Xiaogua.

25
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,000
Come with me.

26
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,360
Yes, uncle. His name is Cucumber.

27
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,120
So funny.

28
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,120
What are you doing?

29
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,480
You're having an IV. Don't move.

30
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,079
Eat your gossip.

31
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:31,840
Uncle Qi.

32
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,079
What did I tell you last time?

33
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,200
What did you promise me?

34
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,840
You swore that

35
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:40,000
to protect Qiqi.

36
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,120
This is great.

37
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,640
He got sick in the rain

38
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,200
and fainted.

39
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,079
How did you protect her?

40
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,360
I'm sorry, Uncle Qi. I...

41
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,000
I promise it won't happen again.

42
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,280
Don't just promise.

43
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,200
Do something practical.

44
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,800
You care so much.

45
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,640
Why don't you give me some benefits?

46
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,720
I'll eavesdrop for you.

47
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,720
You eavesdrop?

48
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,920
I have ears.

49
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,560
This girl needs care.

50
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,560
Aren't you in the same car with her?

51
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,200
She got off.

52
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,800
Give her an umbrella when it rains.

53
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,920
Be careful.

54
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,079
Dr Zhang.

55
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:16,720
I'm sorry.

56
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,360
I forgot to tell you something.

57
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:18,920
Go ahead.

58
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,560
It's my daughter.

59
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,560
What's wrong with my daughter?

60
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,480
That's my daughter. Tell me.

61
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,720
Don't tell him.

62
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,079
No, it's not your daughter. It's my daughter.

63
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,360
My daughter is my daughter.

64
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,480
What's wrong with her?

65
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,280
No, I'm not talking about the patient inside.

66
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,440
I mean my daughter.

67
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,680
I'm sorry.

68
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,000
Dr Zhang.

69
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,079
Wasn't my daughter at your place before?

70
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:40,920
She had surgery.

71
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:42,920
And she has been recovering well.

72
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,200
But recently she found out

73
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,720
there's something wrong with her heart.

74
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,240
I'll send you the X-ray later.

75
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,520
Please check it for me.

76
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,240
No problem.

77
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,000
But my opinion can only be a reference.

78
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:53,960
It's mainly

79
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,400
your doctor's opinion.

80
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,400
Okay, thank you, Dr Zhang.

81
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,400
By the way,

82
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,200
I've arranged it for you.

83
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,080
Ask the nurse station

84
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,480
to take care of the patient in bed 38.

85
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,240
Call me if you need anything.

86
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,120
Okay, thank you.

87
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:06,680
I'm leaving.

88
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,280
Okay, send it to me later.

89
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:08,720
Okay.

90
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,040
Did you work here before?

91
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,720
I was a cardiothoracic surgeon in the north of the city.

92
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:21,000
Then why

93
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,400
become an emergency doctor?

94
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,800
It's just a coincidence.

95
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,480
Uncle Qi, don't worry.

96
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:33,200
I will take good care of Dr. Qi.

97
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,280
Besides,

98
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:37,280
what's wrong with you?

99
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,159
Is it serious?

100
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,400
Let me treat you.

101
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,159
It's okay. I don't want to see a doctor.

102
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,440
Why not?

103
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,159
Haven't you heard of that?

104
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,320
The disease doesn't grow.

105
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,480
It's obvious.

106
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,280
People are not sick.

107
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,280
When I came here,

108
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,840
everything is wrong.

109
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:54,600
I don't want to see it.

110
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,320
Uncle Qi, aren't you avoiding doctors?

111
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,720
You fainted.

112
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,160
This is the body signal.

113
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,600
It means you're sick.

114
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,960
Many major illnesses don't be treated when it's minor.

115
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,840
and become serious.

116
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,960
Let me give you an example.

117
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,600
For example, you have cancer.

118
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,880
If you start treatment early,

119
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,600
the healing rate is over 90%.

120
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,560
In the mid-term, 50%.

121
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,280
In the terminal stage, it'll be too late.

122
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,120
Stop.

123
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,440
Who are you cursing?

124
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,960
Who has cancer?

125
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,000
How could you say that?

126
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,400
What did you hear?

127
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,640
I'm not telling you.

128
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,360
Based on my years of understanding of romance novels,

129
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,520
there's something wrong between you two.

130
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,960
Do you have feelings for Zhang?

131
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:39,920
No.

132
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,120
Will you notice him?

133
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:43,920
Yes.

134
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,960
and his every move.

135
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,080
I'm also afraid that he'll get hurt.

136
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,360
Xu Chengyuan, let me tell you.

137
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,120
If you have something to do,

138
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,480
Why are you coughing here?

139
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,680
I'll kick you to death if I'm strong.

140
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:53,800
Look at me.

141
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,400
Look into my eyes.

142
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,080
Follow your heart.

143
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,360
Aren't you working the night shift?

144
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,080
I don't work at night.

145
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,080
I don't work night shifts at all.

146
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,320
You don't care about me at all.

147
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,240
Hurry up. My head is buzzing.

148
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:09,920
I'll call the police.

149
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,120
Okay, I'll go.

150
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,640
It's just an example.

151
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,920
Sorry, I didn't mean it.

152
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,720
Uncle Qi, I'm leaving.

153
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,080
You should leave as soon as you're done.

154
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:22,720
Director,

155
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,400
I can't go back in two or three days.

156
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,520
Can you arrange Zhang Chi

157
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,680
to other cars.

158
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,080
Good job. You know everything now.

159
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,120
Very professional.

160
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,440
Great.

161
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,840
Thank you, Director.

162
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,159
Okay, bye.

163
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,560
Well,

164
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,680
I've done the procedures.

165
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,159
You can rest here.

166
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,720
Don't worry about me.

167
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:46,920
I'm not far from here.

168
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:47,680
If you need anything,

169
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,960
ask the nurse to call me.

170
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,560
Take a rest.

171
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:51,920
Okay.

172
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,360
I know. I know.

173
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:00,960
Go back.

174
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,240
Where are you going?

175
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,560
I'm going back. What are you doing here?

176
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,560
Why are you going back?

177
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,680
The nurse station said

178
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,280
you have to stay here for three days.

179
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,160
Why should I stay here?

180
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,560
It's just a cold.

181
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,840
Why do you always avoid doctors like your dad?

182
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,120
Didn't I tell you?

183
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,960
your cold can be serious.

184
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,680
You can develop it into pneumonia.

185
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,800
Even if you cure pneumonia,

186
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,960
your lungs will be traumatized.

187
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,120
Just like a ball.

188
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,360
There's a calcification point on it.

189
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,720
Is it not as elastic as it used to be?

190
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,360
If you don't develop well,

191
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,560
it will become lung cancer.

192
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,720
Just shut up.

193
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,680
Get out. I'll get changed.

194
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,680
What's wrong with her?

195
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,280
Hold on.

196
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:42,800
Pick up the phone.

197
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,560
Pick up the phone.

198
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,960
Why aren't you picking up?

199
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,440
Where are you? Are you home?

200
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,840
No, I went to Grandpa's house for a few days.

201
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,240
No.

202
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,040
Why didn't you tell me?

203
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,920
Go to my grandparents' house.

204
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,120
It's okay. I'll just stay for two days.

205
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,360
I'm just asking. It's fine.

206
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:00,680
008401

207
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,760
Help your grandparents.

208
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,720
008401

209
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,360
I heard you passed out.

210
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:03,760
Okay.

211
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,120
008401

212
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,800
Are you really okay?

213
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,320
008401

214
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:06,720
Done.

215
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,000
Let me send you home.

216
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,800
No, I can't go home.

217
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,000
Go home.

218
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,680
Isn't it convenient for your mother to take care of you?

219
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,120
You don't understand. I can't go home.

220
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,360
It's okay. It's not hard for me.

221
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,760
In Jiangdong,

222
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,680
in Jiangdong.

223
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,000
Book a hotel.

224
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,040
Why...

225
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,679
Why are the rooms full?

226
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,000
Jiangdong Expo is coming.

227
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,200
Many people came.

228
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,120
The hotel should be full.

229
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:42,440
What are you reading?

230
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:45,240
I'll read it in a few days. It's hindering me.

231
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,440
We have a guest room.

232
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,920
If you don't mind, you can stay at my place.

233
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,480
Don't let your colleagues see you.

234
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,920
what's going on with us.

235
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,680
No, you're not guilty.

236
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,360
Who wants to think

237
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,360
as they want.

238
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,680
What ghost do I have?

239
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,480
Of course I'm not.

240
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,200
What am I afraid of?

241
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,040
Go if you're not afraid.

242
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,360
008401.

243
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,360
Let's go then.

244
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,240
008401.

245
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,360
Let's go to your house.

246
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:20,920
It's free.

247
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,680
I can pay you some.

248
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,200
I still have 80 cents.

249
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,600
Come in.

250
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,920
Your house is like Batman's house.

251
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,880
It's dark.

252
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,360
The vampires have the same tone.

253
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,680
Are you a vampire?

254
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,880
Like you've been to a vampire's house.

255
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,240
You're cute.

256
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,000
The jellyfish is so small

257
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,120
Seaweeds are cold

258
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,880
These are jellyfish for appreciation

259
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,000
Jellyfish.

260
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,920
Which room do I live in?

261
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,440
This way.

262
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:01,800
The one who hit the head.

263
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,560
Zhang Chi, is your painting broken?

264
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,120
The painting is like this.

265
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,240
Just like this when you buy it

266
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,600
Like a hole in jeans

267
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
This room, right? This is my room.

268
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,120
You sleep here.

269
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,560
Turn on the lights. The lights are...

270
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:23,800
Okay, good.

271
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:24,360
Thank you.

272
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,360
Well,

273
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,680
Why don't you get changed?

274
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,000
No.

275
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,240
Mine is also worn outside.

276
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:30,920
Yes, that one.

277
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,440
If you don't mind wearing mine,

278
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,680
Fine, I can wear anything.

279
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,000
You must be hungry.

280
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,000
Hold on.

281
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,320
Thank you

282
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,240
Why are you so nervous?

283
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,320
Okay, good.

284
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,440
Well, you look like that.

285
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,800
You haven't recovered yet.

286
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,240
so I didn't make you a drumstick.

287
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,440
It's light.

288
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,120
Try it.

289
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,360
OK. Zhang Chi, you're good.

290
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,480
You really know how to cook.

291
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,120
You need to feed yourself.

292
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,240
There are more ginger and onions.

293
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:16,880
It's for the cold.

294
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,680
Why are you sighing?

295
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,360
We need a cold dish

296
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,560
Let me take a cucumber for you

297
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,480
It's not about Oh-Ee

298
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,000
Let me tell you again

299
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,120
It's for appreciation.

300
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,320
It's not cold

301
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,360
I don't want cold

302
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,760
There are only five.

303
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,600
It's not enough for you to eat.

304
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,360
Actually, I can't eat much.

305
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,240
00315411.

0107 Xu Chengyuan's car team.

307
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,760
Unit 3, Building 7, Fugui Garden.

308
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,360
An old man fell down and fainted.

309
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,120
Please go there immediately.

310
00:11:59,320 --> 00:11:59,760
Copy that.

311
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,440
Who called 120?

312
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,200
What's going on?

313
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:02,920
I hit her.

314
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:03,800
Look at my mom.

315
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,240
I fell down

316
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,240
I fell down.

317
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,240
My mom has a problem.

318
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,440
Send her to the hospital.

319
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,800
Send him to the hospital. Hurry.

320
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,200
Hurry!

321
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,320
The muscle is weak

322
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,560
Yuan Yuan, build an artery. Okay.

323
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,240
Check blood pressure

324
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,320
Stop measuring blood pressure.

325
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,680
My mom takes it five times a day.

326
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,360
It's not fully equipped.

327
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,360
How can we treat it?

328
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,320
Take him to the hospital. It's too late.

329
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,360
Hurry up.

330
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,480
The patient's high pressure is 180.

331
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,360
It's very serious.

332
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,600
And the intracranial pressure is abnormal.

333
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,440
We must use medicine

334
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,440
to reduce her intracranial pressure.

335
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,000
so that she can be safe on the way.

336
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,040
Go.

337
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,120
No, send it to her.

338
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,000
If something happens later,

339
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,800
Okay.

340
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I respect your wishes.

341
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,040
We'll send him to the hospital immediately.

342
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,000
But I've told you

343
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,120
the seriousness.

344
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,680
Take the consequences. Sign a contract, okay?

345
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,040
Okay, I'll sign it. Hurry up.

346
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,000
Carry the stretcher. Hurry up.

347
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:48,880
Stretcher.

348
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,560
Hurry up.

349
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,560
Slow down. Waist protection.

350
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,360
One, two, three.

Building 12, Unit 1502.

354
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,320
A young woman can't walk because her legs hurt.

355
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,120
Please go immediately.

356
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:09,560
Okay.

357
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,000
If I sprain my ankle like this,

358
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,120
Does your ankle hurt?

359
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,440
No.

360
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,440
My legs hurt.

361
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,000
I was fine when I was sitting.

362
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,000
It hurts a lot when walking.

363
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,920
And I feel my legs are heavy.

364
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,560
Have you

365
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,240
bumped or bumped?

366
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:26,760
No.

367
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,200
I think

368
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,920
I've been sitting for too long

369
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:30,800
My legs are swollen.

370
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,200
Stand up and walk for two laps.

371
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,800
or rest for two days.

372
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,200
Call 120.

373
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,360
Cheeky.

374
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,680
Uncle, I'm suffering a lot.

375
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,320
That's right. That kid is suffering.

376
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,880
According to our initial judgment,

377
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:44,200
the child may have a vein thrombus of the lower limbs.

378
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,800
We need to go to the hospital

379
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,120
ultrasound or Cai Chao.

380
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:47,760
Soon.

381
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,680
Do ultrasound or Cai Chao

382
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,800
I don't think so.

383
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,120
It looks swelling.

384
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,320
It should be more serious.

385
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,200
Send him to the hospital first.

386
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:54,880
Stretcher.

387
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,680
Are you charging for random checks?

388
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:58,920
Doctor!

389
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,920
She's only 16.

390
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,480
Do you think she has a thrombus?

391
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,880
That's impossible.

392
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:04,480
Yeah.

393
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,360
You just want to make money, right?

394
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,440
That's ridiculous.

395
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,360
Yeah

396
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,240
It's okay, Lola.

397
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,560
You're her mother, right?

398
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,240
Yes.

399
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:12,800
Your child

400
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,360
We need to get him to the hospital.

401
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,800
Check if it's a thrombus.

402
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,240
If it's a thrombus,

403
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,680
the thrombus will stop the brain

404
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,920
it will cause cerebral infarction.

405
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,920
If the heart stops, it's a heart attack.

406
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,880
If the lungs stop, it's pulmonary thrombosis.

407
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,120
This is serious.

408
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,240
You have to decide quickly.

409
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,200
Aren't you afraid of taking responsibility?

410
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,680
I know you have the exemption order.

411
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,560
Give it to me and I'll sign it.

412
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,880
Yes, give it to my brother.

413
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,680
Yes, we'll sign it.

414
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:38,760
This...

415
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,360
How about this?

416
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,920
Send him to the hospital.

417
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,240
If it's not a thrombus,

418
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,480
I'll pay for the check-up.

419
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:44,920
OK?

420
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:45,680
Chi.

421
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,800
Okay, doctor.

422
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,440
I'll listen to you.

423
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,480
Come on, stretcher. Hurry.

424
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,600
Take a pillow.

425
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,480
Yes, put your legs on the bed

426
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,480
Ren Jie, put it on her.

427
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:58,360
Slowly

428
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,000
In case the leg

429
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,360
the thrombus will fall off.

430
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,200
Slowly.

431
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,120
Be careful.

432
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:10,880
Young man.

433
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,440
Wait.

434
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:13,920
Young man.

435
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,560
Thank you so much.

436
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,560
You're really a skilled doctor.

437
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,800
The doctor said it was a thrombus.

438
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,240
If you hadn't insisted that Na Na was sent to the hospital,

439
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,360
we would have

440
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,480
We almost delayed the child's condition.

441
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,200
Thanks to you.

442
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,360
for saving our baby.

443
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,440
You're welcome.

444
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,560
Sir,

445
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,360
if you don't feel well again,

446
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,040
you should listen to the doctor.

447
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,600
There are so many patients here.

448
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,920
Even doctors can't see it.

449
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,480
That's why

450
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,880
to make you spend money for no reason.

451
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,000
Yes.

452
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,000
You can continue with your work.

453
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,040
I'll pay the bill now.

454
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:47,680
Okay, go ahead.

455
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,680
Okay, thank you.

456
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:50,760
Chi,

457
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,680
How did you know

458
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,320
she had a sublimb vein thrombus?

459
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,880
I saw the patient's schedule.

460
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,040
I didn't see it from morning to night.

461
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,240
Staying up late is irregular.

462
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,600
It's easy to form a thrombus.

463
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,440
I see.

464
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,760
There were too many family members.

465
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,120
I'm afraid you can't handle it.

466
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,000
I have a headache too.

467
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,360
I'm afraid it's hard to unify the opinions.

468
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,440
and waste time.

469
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,000
But it occurred to me that

470
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,560
only the immediate family cares about patients the most.

471
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,920
And people should listen to her.

472
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,360
So I asked her mom

473
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,760
Isn't it more efficient?

474
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:22,600
Got it.

475
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,000
I really need to learn from you.

476
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,440
Get in the car.

477
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,440
Zhang Chi, your fridge is almost out of stock.

478
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,840
I went downstairs to buy some vegetables and meat.

479
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,720
You went to the supermarket?

480
00:16:59,200 --> 00:16:59,960
I just got off work.

481
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,360
Wait for me to cook.

482
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:17,920
Mr. Cui.

483
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,240
Here, take this.

484
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:20,440
016.

485
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,079
Thank you.

486
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,240
You're welcome.

487
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:23,480
See you tomorrow.

488
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:34,960
Yuan Er, thank you.

489
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,920
I guess it's the worst.

490
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,800
she might...

491
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,200
Why are you looking at me like that?

492
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:53,840
Did I offend you?

493
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,320
Yuan.

494
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:58,960
Something bad happened.

495
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:01,840
What happened?

496
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,560
Didn't you send an old lady off?

497
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,480
Do you know who she is?

498
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:05,920
That old lady

499
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,560
is just an ordinary old lady.

500
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,000
She's nothing special.

501
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:09,840
Who is she?

502
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,440
She's an important researcher.

503
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,280
He won countless awards in his life.

504
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,800
What national Natural Science first prize?

505
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,280
National Science Progress Award.

506
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,520
The three of us

507
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,840
with six hands.

508
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,960
An old lady enjoys special allowance from the National Affairs.

509
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,680
is a scientist who contributes to the country.

510
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,480
No way.

511
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,720
Did you have a conflict with her family?

512
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,200
Her family is complaining about you.

513
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,960
saying you didn't insist on being rescued on the spot.

514
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,360
It's irresponsible to delay the rescue.

515
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,720
Yuan, what's wrong with you?

516
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,000
Just let them be. Just complain if you want.

517
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,600
I've said everything I need to say.

518
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,480
He has signed the exemption order.

519
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,880
Yuan Er, keep it.

520
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,080
I'm afraid that she's a big shot.

521
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,480
You can't leave unscathed.

522
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,880
The law enforcement recorder has a full video.

523
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,880
And the contract is signed.

524
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,360
It has nothing to do with me.

525
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,360
Secretary.

526
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,640
Xu Chengyuan, have you heard?

527
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,360
A patient's family complained about you.

528
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,320
I heard.

529
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,000
The center has checked.

530
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,720
The family signed the exemption order.

531
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,240
and there's a legal video.

532
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,360
The complaint is not valid.

533
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,080
See? I told you.

534
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,600
This has nothing to do with me.

535
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:28,600
But the old lady

536
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,720
has entered ICU.

537
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:31,720
The doctor said

538
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,480
it's an emergency.

539
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,440
I don't think he'll last long.

540
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:38,280
001006.

541
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,520
Tell me.

542
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,080
Qiqi hasn't fully recovered.

543
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,240
before she recovered.

544
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,360
She said she'll stay with Kiki for a few days.

545
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,840
so we don't need to worry.

546
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,640
Qiqi is a grown-up now.

547
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,240
Why am I still worried about her?

548
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,320
I'm worried about her.

549
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,200
No matter how old she is,

550
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,760
she's still our daughter.

551
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,000
Do you think

552
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,880
should we let her go?

553
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,960
I still remember when she graduated from university,

554
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,840
she wanted to move out.

555
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,360
You didn't agree.

556
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,480
After so many years,

557
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,360
she never mentioned it again.

558
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,120
I haven't let her go enough.

559
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,600
She insisted on studying medicine.

560
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:45,880
I let her be.

561
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,960
She's an adult. She doesn't talk about marriage.

562
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I didn't urge her.

563
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,320
During festivals,

564
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,320
our relatives and friends

565
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,760
We didn't put her under much pressure.

566
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,640
Sometimes I think

567
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,120
you're a grown-up now.

568
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,400
living with us.

569
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,480
I'm busy at work.

570
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,240
I rushed back after work.

571
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:14,080
There's no room to be alone with boys.

572
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,720
Which boy can stand it?

573
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,880
You...

574
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,640
She always says she lives in Kiki's house

575
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,640
or in the center dormitory.

576
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,520
Do you think she lives there?

577
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,600
That means

578
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,400
she needs her own space.

579
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,840
You have a point.

580
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,120
I'll go to her office tomorrow.

581
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,000
She hasn't recovered yet.

582
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,120
She's still thinking about work.

583
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,600
They are in such a big center.

584
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,600
We need her.

585
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:50,880
Let her be transferred.

586
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,760
Just like her junior.

587
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,120
like her junior.

588
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,240
Right?

589
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,240
She's not tired. She makes a lot of money.

590
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,480
Don't cause her any trouble.

591
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,960
In your eyes,

592
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,000
I am the father who caused her trouble.

593
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:08,880
Suit yourself.

594
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,400
Forget what I said.

595
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,480
Today,

596
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,080
on behalf of my daughter.

597
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,200
Qi

598
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,360
According to the rules,

599
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,760
resignation is a big deal.

600
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,720
should be proposed by Qi Tuo himself.

601
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,760
I don't care about the rules.

602
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,480
whether you agree or not,

603
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,600
or not.

604
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:43,760
Anyway,

605
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,400
I don't allow my daughter

606
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,400
to continue.

607
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,880
I think you can see

608
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,360
Qi Qi really loves this job.

609
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,240
I know she likes this job.

610
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,120
That's why she worked so hard.

611
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,240
I put myself in the hospital.

612
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,000
But as parents,

613
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,080
do you want to see the kids so tired?

614
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,720
From the beginning,

615
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,880
from the beginning.

616
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,120
I've worked hard all my life.

617
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,000
What do I want?

618
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,400
I don't want her to achieve anything great in the future.

619
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,640
I just want her to live

620
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,360
and live happily.

621
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,400
Studying medicine is so hard and tiring.

622
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,720
To get into a good medical school,

623
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,120
From high school,

624
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,720
she has to work harder than others.

625
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:34,600
She went to college, other's children went on a trip,

626
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,840
and had fun.

627
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,200
But what about my daughter?

628
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,880
is still studying hard in the library.

629
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,240
I fell in love a while ago.

630
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,320
They got along well.

631
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,120
But because she was busy with work,

632
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,400
because she was busy.

633
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,840
So we ended up breaking up.

634
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,080
She doesn't even have time

635
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:51,880
to date.

636
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,240
Besides,

637
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,640
it's stressful to work.

638
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,480
Always stay healthy.

639
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,600
She keeps working when she's sick.

640
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,720
There are always patients who don't understand her work.

641
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,480
001006.

642
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,240
This is not working.

643
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,600
I'm suffering.

644
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,760
I have to be tough.

645
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,720
If you don't agree,

646
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,480
I'll come here every day.

647
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,240
I'll stay by the ambulance.

648
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,720
I won't let her continue.

649
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:21,840
Come on

650
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:22,880
Come on Qi

651
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,720
Calm down.

652
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:25,960
Jiangdong EMSS emergency.

653
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:26,240
Jiangdong EMSS. Urgent.

654
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,240
Calm down.

655
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:27,560
Jiangdong EMSS Heart

656
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:27,880
Jiangdong EMS

657
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:28,520
Jiangdong EMSS.

658
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,000
But

659
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:29,720
Jiangdong EMSS emergency.

660
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,720
I still need to ask

661
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,200
Qi Qi's consent.

662
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,120
What's wrong, Zhang Chi?

663
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:38,880
Call me if you need anything.

664
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:39,600
Secretary

665
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:41,960
Uncle Qi

666
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,880
I happened to pass by.

667
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,200
I heard what you said just now.

668
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,120
I have something to tell you.

669
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,640
What do you want to say?

670
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,880
Why are you everywhere?

671
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,600
What you just said is the pain of being an emergency doctor.

672
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,480
But what Qi Qi saw

673
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,240
is the sweetness of being an emergency doctor.

674
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:00,600
Sweet.

675
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,080
It's not sweet.

676
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,200
Through our efforts,

677
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:08,240
from the death line through our efforts.

678
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,720
and send them to the hospital immediately.

679
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,880
I know they can walk out healthy.

680
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,800
This is the sweetness of our ER.

681
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:19,600
Yes.

682
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,720
I remember when Qi Qi came to me

683
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,720
for a job interview,

684
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:24,760
she told me

685
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,000
she was fully prepared

686
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,360
she is fully prepared.

687
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:31,760
Of course Qi

688
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,640
We will definitely consider the family's opinion.

689
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,520
But we should respect

690
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,720
our opinions.

691
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,360
right?

692
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,240
Qi

693
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,240
When Qi Qi has recovered

694
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,760
let’s sit down

695
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,360
and talk about it.

696
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,320
What do you think?

697
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,640
Is Dr Zhang and Dr Qi here?

698
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,880
Are you looking for Dr Qi and Dr Zhang?

699
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:05,640
Dr Qi is not here.

700
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,640
Dr Zhang went out.

701
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,520
Why are you always against me?

702
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:09,880
Uncle Qi, I'm sorry.

703
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,760
I'm telling the truth

704
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,760
No one likes this job more than Qi Tuo

705
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:15,960
I hope

706
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,000
she can do what she likes.

707
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,120
Let me see you off.

708
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,080
Dr Zhang.

709
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:26,880
Hello.

710
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,080
Hello.

711
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:29,760
How is it?

712
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,000
How's your hand?

713
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,720
My hand has been in danger for seven days.

714
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,240
It's neither infected nor fever.

715
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,000
He's recovering very well.

716
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,400
Well...

717
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,880
I heard from the resident doctor

718
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,120
you found my palm in time.

719
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:44,960
It was handled well.

720
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,400
The surgery went well.

721
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,960
Thank you so much.

722
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:50,880
As long as you recover well.

723
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,240
I hope you recover soon.

724
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,480
This silk banner...

725
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,600
This is a fruit basket.

726
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,360
Please accept it.

727
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,960
You're too polite.

728
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,760
You hit Qi before.

729
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,880
Now she found your hand.

730
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,080
Xiao Qiu, stop it.

731
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,080
I'm just angry.

732
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,120
She even hit Qi.

733
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,320
She even said she'd apologize.

734
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,840
but I couldn't find her.

735
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,200
You hit my daughter.

736
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:12,880
Uncle Qi.

737
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,360
Are you Dr. Qi's father?

738
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,000
Please help me express my apology.

739
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:22,360
I said I'd apologize to you face to face.

740
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,360
Because...

741
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:24,880
I made a mistake 0104577

742
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,160
0104577.

743
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,080
My son and I

744
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,240
were saved by Dr Qi and Dr Zhang.

745
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,080
Our whole family

746
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,720
are very grateful.

747
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:38,240
If there's anything I can do,

748
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,720
What can I do to make you feel better?

749
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,320
Please tell me.

750
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,240
I'll do it.

751
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,360
What's the use of apologizing now?

752
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,600
Does it work?

753
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,640
Do you know how hard they work?

754
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:55,680
Look again.

755
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,560
All the children in the center

756
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,320
are raised by parents.

757
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,800
They are all obedient.

758
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,800
Time is life.

759
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,040
They are using their lives

760
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,920
for the patient's life.

761
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,200
She may not be a good daughter,

762
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,960
but she's definitely a good doctor.

763
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,080
A qualified doctor.

764
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,800
Mr. Qi, I'm sorry.

765
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,200
Dr Zhang, I'm really sorry.

766
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:27,600
Sir.

767
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,360
I have a suggestion.

768
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:31,800
I hope

769
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,240
no matter what kind of doctor you meet in the future,

770
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,200
or an emergency doctor,

771
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,720
or the doctors in the hospital,

772
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:41,360
I hope you can trust me

773
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,360
and change your positions.

774
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,840
Sure, I will.

775
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,720
I'm sorry. This banner. Hurry.

776
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,080
This...

777
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:50,600
I'm sorry.

778
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,320
I'm sorry.

779
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:53,840
I'm sorry.

780
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,600
Your dad came to the center today.

781
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,480
He asked Secretary Liu to resign.

782
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,680
He seems to be quite tough this time.

783
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,200
He even made her family feel ashamed.

784
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:22,840
You're back.

785
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,600
You are...

786
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,960
Huang sent me a message.

787
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,840
He said my dad went to Liu Zhi Gang and made a scene.

788
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:29,800
You knew it?

789
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,880
I'm waiting for my clothes to dry.

790
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:34,120
I washed your suit and put it there.

791
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,600
I have to go back and explain to him.

792
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:37,560
Let me give you a ride.

793
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,600
No, I've booked a taxi.

794
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,840
Thank you for taking me in these two days.

795
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,080
I'm leaving.

796
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,200
Talk to your dad.

797
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:45,720
I know.

798
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:22,720
Qi Xuejun, why did you...

799
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,200
Why did you go to my company again?

800
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,600
Can you tell me why?

801
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,960
You're ridiculous.

802
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,120
Qi Tuo, you are not young anymore.

803
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,360
Can you save us some trouble?

804
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,200
Why not?

805
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,200
Can you stop interfering with my life?

806
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,360
You're a girl.

807
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,720
I'm doing this for your own good.

808
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,680
What kind of girl is that?

809
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,600
I'm over 30.

810
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,680
Can you stop treating me like a four-year-old child?

811
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,560
You always come to my company.

812
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,200
You make me look like a pupil.

813
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,000
How can I raise my head

814
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,320
in front of my colleagues?

815
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,120
Yes.

816
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,960
I was a little impulsive.

817
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,480
But you can't leave the hospital

818
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,440
without a word.

819
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,840
without telling us.

820
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,200
You made me and your mother worried.

821
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:57,800
You know what?

822
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:58,880
I'm an adult, okay?

823
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,480
Dad, I'm an adult.

824
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,720
Can you give me some space?

825
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,480
Okay.

826
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,720
You're an adult.

827
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,240
Do whatever you want.

828
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,560
I won't care about you anymore.

829
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,560
You can move out.

830
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,080
I'm here to move out today.

831
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,120
I'm leaving now.

832
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,080
Qiqi, calm down.

833
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:17,200
Okay, let's go now.

834
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,600
How could you say that?

835
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,200
How could you kick her out?

836
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:21,720
You...

837
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,080
Let her be.

838
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:28,880
Don't be angry.

839
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,680
Just let her be.

840
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,600
She's really mad that she's going to move out.

841
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,480
Don't persuade me, mom. I have to go.

842
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,240
I won't persuade you.

843
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,360
I just want to ask where you're staying.

844
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,800
I'll stay with Kiki.

845
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,000
If you can't make it, just hang in there for a while.

846
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,080
Well,

847
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,400
where have you been these days? Can you tell me?

848
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,080
Zhang Chi's house.

849
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,480
Don't get me wrong. It's my sofa.

850
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,720
That's not what I meant.

851
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,480
I won't interfere with your life.

852
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,600
I just want to know if you're safe.

853
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,360
Is there anyone like my dad?

854
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,360
How old am I?

855
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,480
I'm always coaxing kids.

856
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,080
Can I have some space?

857
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:35,960
Am I asking too much?

858
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:36,840
No.

859
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,880
Your dad is a bit impatient.

860
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,440
but he's doing this for your own good.

861
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,080
Tell my dad I'm not mad at him.

862
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,320
I can take care of myself.

863
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:14,640
Jiaqi.

864
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,000
Hello, Senior. What's wrong?

865
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,240
Are you home?

866
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,360
No.

867
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,480
I'm still with my grandpa.

868
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,080
Why are you calling me so late?

869
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,640
Nothing.

870
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,840
Are you really okay?

871
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:26,960
I'm fine.

872
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:27,840
Let me ask you.

873
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,480
How are your grandparents?

874
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,480
They're all fine. What happened?

875
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,240
Okay, stay here.

876
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,560
I'm just asking. Is there anything else?

877
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,000
Okay, go to bed early.

878
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:37,600
Bye.

879
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:38,640
Bye.

880
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,080
What should I do?

881
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:34,639
Hello, Mom.

882
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:37,480
Did my dad take my ID card?

883
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,080
Do you know about this?

884
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:45,000
How can you steal my ID card?

885
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,440
You're wasting my time.

886
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,080
I just went to the hotel and I said to get a room.

887
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,679
I didn't have my ID card.

888
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,400
People will think I'm a criminal.

889
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,800
I almost called the police.

890
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:54,600
Am I a hacker?

891
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,880
What does this mean?

892
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:57,400
I'm speechless.

893
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,640
Is this an old society?

894
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,600
Do you have to push me to death?

895
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,120
I won't go back. I won't go back.

896
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,440
Talk nicely.

897
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:10,920
Are you trying to be tough?

898
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:11,960
He wants to be tough with me.

899
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,440
I must be tougher than him.

900
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,960
I'm a tough stone, Stinky Stone.

901
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,800
I won't go back. Tell him.

902
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,240
I don't have an ID card.

903
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,240
I won't take it home even if I live on the street.

904
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,200
Goodbye.

905
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,720
Amazing.

906
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,560
Sorry to bother you.

907
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,480
I have no choice.

908
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,560
So I came to you.

909
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,720
I'll make it short.

910
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,320
I broke up with my dad.

911
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,600
He hid my ID card.

912
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,400
I can't get a room now.

913
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,960
or rent a room.

914
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,560
I just went to the class room. I saw everyone was occupied.

915
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,720
Jiaqi isn't home either.

916
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,920
I'm thinking if it's possible

917
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,600
if it's possible to rent

918
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,440
It's okay.

919
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,440
I'll think of another way.

920
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,240
It's okay.

921
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,160
Come in.

922
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,680
Thank you for taking me in.

923
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,400
How should I pay the rent?

924
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:22,960
Don't worry about the rent.

925
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,320
Change your shoes first.

926
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:28,920
Okay.

927
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,160
You have to follow my rules when you live in my house.

928
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,800
We have to make three rules.

929
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:35,720
First,

930
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,360
Change your slippers first.

931
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,680
You can't walk around

932
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,800
in the room.

933
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:41,400
Okay.

934
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,880
Then go wash your hands in the bathroom.

935
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:44,640
Okay.

936
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:45,440
Don't sit.

937
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,960
Second, after entering the house,

938
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,800
you need to change into your home clothes quickly.

939
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,240
You can't show up

940
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,640
in my life space.

941
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,160
Third,

942
