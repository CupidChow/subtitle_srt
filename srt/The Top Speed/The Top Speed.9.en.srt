1
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:06,040
National Radio. and Telvison. Administration.

2
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,120
Gao.

3
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,840
Why are you so generous today?

4
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,720
You treat us to such expensive seafood.

5
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,720
It's really rare

6
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,160
Your house is really big.

7
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,960
Great

8
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:52,680
Is this your first time here?

9
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,720
There are surprises every time I come back.

10
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:55,840
Look at the kitchen

11
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,280
Look at the balcony.

12
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,400
Do you think my house can grow muscle, Gao?

13
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,560
Yes, you quit.

14
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,440
Aren't you exercising?

15
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,120
Practice.

16
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,000
Is it expensive?

17
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:13,720
The rent.

18
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,560
He's the landlord. Ask him. It's not expensive.

19
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,800
You want to rent a house?

20
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,320
Yuan.

21
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,560
He wants to rent a house.

22
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,160
If he's happy, he should rent a house.

23
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,560
No, this sofa...

24
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,079
This is Zheng Bo's exclusive spot to watch the ball.

25
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,280
This carpet.

26
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:47,680
Like this.

27
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,240
I've been renovating my house lately.

28
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,800
It takes at least half a year to decorate it.

29
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,280
I just want to rent a house outside.

30
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,840
But I've seen it before.

31
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,120
The nearest ones are rent in a year.

32
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,120
It's not appropriate.

33
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,440
What about the far one?

34
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,800
It's too expensive.

35
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,960
I'm looking for a realtor. I know.

36
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,720
Let me call you.

37
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,160
No, no, no.

38
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,680
That's what I mean.

39
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:09,800
Look.

40
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,240
Isn't Zheng Bo alone?

41
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,440
If I live here,

42
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,880
my girlfriend usually doesn't come.

43
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,560
She only comes here once or twice a month.

44
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,680
I can pay more than him.

45
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,320
You mean the rent?

46
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,720
Actually, staying here

47
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,280
the rent is not the point.

48
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,840
You need skills.

49
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,160
For example, Zheng Bo.

50
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,600
He cooks very well.

51
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,000
Fitness meal.

52
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,000
I can cook too.

53
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,160
Really?

54
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:41,960
Really?

55
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,040
Remove it.

56
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:44,600
Look.

57
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,280
Does no one usually clean up here?

58
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,320
Look.

59
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,120
It's not Gao.

60
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,240
Although

61
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,240
is a bit messy,

62
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,960
but everything has its location.

63
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,240
You need to tidy it up.

64
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,440
you might not be able to find it.

65
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,240
Really?

66
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,120
Did you eat this in the morning?

67
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,240
I haven't cleaned up yet. Let me do it.

68
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,800
Don't move. I'll wash it.

69
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,760
Let me do it.

70
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,000
Enough, Gao.

71
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,320
Go upstairs and choose a room.

72
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,240
The one on the left is good.

73
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,640
The left one is mine.

74
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,440
The one on the right is also good.

75
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,920
I'll go take a look.

76
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,120
Gao is so interesting.

77
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,000
Look carefully.

78
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:32,680
Zheng Bo.

79
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,320
Do you think

80
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,120
Zhang Chi is interested in my master?

81
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,440
No way.

82
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,480
It's impossible.

83
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,440
How are you so sure?

84
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,800
Who dares to have improper thoughts about your master?

85
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,560
Who dares?

86
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:48,920
Let's take a photo. Okay.

87
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,320
Okay.

88
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,640
Thank you, Yuan.

89
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:01,120
The three of us will live together soon.

90
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:08,800
Get off.

91
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,000
Look how you hit me.

92
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,120
Why are you hiding in the car?

93
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:14,880
Get off!

94
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:15,760
Get off.

95
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,480
You should at least look at him. Come down.

96
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,800
Come down and have a look.

97
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:20,560
Hello, is this 120?

98
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,320
There's a car accident here.

99
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,640
A motorbike guy got hit.

100
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,320
A woman was with a little girl.

101
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,920
Yes, Jianguo Road.

102
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,920
Can you hear me?

103
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,120
Excuse me, kid.

104
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,000
I'm a doctor.

105
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,080
Excuse me.

106
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,000
Mom, wake up.

107
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,080
Wake up!

108
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,680
Don't die.

109
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,760
Mom.

110
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,080
Open your eyes and look at me.

111
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,800
Mom.

112
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,680
Mom.

113
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,560
Are you a doctor?

114
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,640
Why didn't you save him?

115
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,440
We're in this situation. Hurry up and save her.

116
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,320
Mom!

117
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,800
Get out. Get out.

118
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,000
The police are here.

119
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,680
Get him! Get him!

120
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,680
Look how you hit me.

121
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,120
Are you drunk?

122
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,320
Drink alcohol.

123
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,560
He's awake.

124
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:25,560
He's awake.

125
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,120
You're amazing, doctor.

126
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,880
120 come here

127
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,120
This way.

128
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,560
Over here

129
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,800
Over there. Hurry up.

130
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,560
Excuse me.

131
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,200
Are you okay?

132
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,240
Can you talk?

133
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,320
Make way

134
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,440
Make way Make way

135
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,240
Excuse me

136
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,240
Be careful.

137
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,480
Don't worry, kid.

138
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,680
Your mom will be fine.

139
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,360
Thank you, uncle.

140
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,560
Thank you for saving my mom.

141
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,080
You're welcome.

142
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,560
I'm a doctor too.

143
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,760
It's my duty.

144
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,920
Does your arm hurt?

145
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:12,800
No.

146
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,560
You're brave.

147
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,920
When you get to the hospital,

148
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,080
I'll take care of it for you.

149
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,400
These two candy are for you.

150
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,440
Eat it in the car later.

151
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,240
Thank you.

152
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:29,560
Let's go.

153
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,200
Chi, don't worry. Leave it to me.

154
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,440
Get in the car with me.

155
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,080
Hello. Hello.

156
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:04,560
Hello?

157
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,520
Zhang Chi, are you free now?

158
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,160
Let's watch a movie together.

159
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,200
We bought a lot of tickets.

160
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,800
Watching a movie? What time?

161
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,160
The nearest one.

162
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,560
About an hour

163
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,240
in about an hour.

164
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,200
It's near your house.

165
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,880
I don't have time.

166
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,560
I have to go back and get changed. It's too late.

167
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,120
Change what?

168
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,440
Zheng Bo and I are leaving now.

169
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,800
We'll wait for you in front of the cinema.

170
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,440
Hurry up.

171
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,320
Okay, send me the address.

172
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,000
Why isn't he here yet?

173
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,920
Zhang Chi, come here.

174
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,760
They have the ticket.

175
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,440
Yes, I checked the ticket.

176
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,000
Why are you so slow?

177
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,320
What are you talking about? Inform me now.

178
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,480
How long will it take?

179
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,320
Okay, stop it.

180
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,880
Hurry up. Don't miss the first shot of the movie.

181
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,080
It's pretty. Hurry up.

182
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,120
What movie?

183
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,120
Love movie.

184
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,320
Are all romance movies so awkward nowadays?

185
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,320
This love story is really touching.

186
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:07,920
I also hope

187
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,320
I could have such a love.

188
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:19,560
Zhang Chi.

189
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,000
Don't you think this movie is great?

190
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,320
Right?

191
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,000
Where is Zhang Chi?

192
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,480
No one is here.

193
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,200
Isn't it too boring? Let's go.

194
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,440
This movie is so good.

195
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,800
I was so touched that I cried.

196
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,200
Why did he leave?

197
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,080
He doesn't appreciate it at all.

198
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,120
Am I right?

199
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,000
Who are they?

200
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,760
It's a waste of my money.

201
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,800
You can't even watch such a good movie.

202
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,320
Shut up.

203
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,800
I watched this movie today.

204
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,880
The three of us watched a love movie.

205
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,000
and sit side by side.

206
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:12,880
I think the audience

207
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,800
didn't even watch movies. They even watched the three of us.

208
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,440
Stop laughing.

209
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,440
The photo of the three of us

210
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,680
to my master.

211
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,120
He hasn't replied yet.

212
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,440
She must be busy.

213
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,760
When you asked her out for a movie this afternoon,

214
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,560
she said she couldn't make it today.

215
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,440
You have to keep an eye

216
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,000
to my master.

217
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,560
I'll treat you to a movie next time.

218
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,240
Forget about the movie.

219
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,120
At 6:20 this morning,

220
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,480
a car accident happened in front of Moon Xing Park.

221
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,000
A drunk driving man knocked down a mother and daughter.

222
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,360
A girl had a slight scratch.

223
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,680
Her mother is seriously injured and her life is in danger.

224
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,320
She's in critical condition.

225
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,320
Luckily, a passer-by

226
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,120
was brave and helped.

227
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,240
He insists on rescuing him.

228
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,440
for the rescue

229
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,240
for emergency workers.

230
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,120
Zhang Chi, isn't this...

231
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,080
Isn't this you?

232
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,880
Chi, you're on TV.

233
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,000
You saved someone before the movie.

234
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,880
Why didn't you tell me?

235
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,000
I ran and met him.

236
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:14,880
What?

237
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,880
Are you getting more and more interested

238
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,240
in the first aid industry?

239
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,360
It has nothing to do with me doing the emergency business.

240
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,680
I am a doctor.

241
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,120
It's a doctor's duty to treat patients.

242
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,640
Fine, you're quite proud.

243
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,920
You won't admit it, right?

244
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,000
Sooner or later, you will admit it.

245
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:33,880
Everyone.

246
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,360
Mr. Liu, you didn't order so much meat.

247
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,120
Did you serve the wrong dish?

248
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:39,680
Yes.

249
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:40,840
It's not wrong.

250
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,480
It's from me.

251
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,960
You're so generous today.

252
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,480
Young man,

253
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,240
Was that you on TV?

254
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,080
It's me.

255
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:50,960
Impressive.

256
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,120
You did a great job.

257
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,120
This is a little gift from the store.

258
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:55,960
Let's eat.

259
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,600
You're too kind.

260
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,480
I'm an emergency doctor at 120.

261
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,440
It's my duty.

262
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,600
You don't have to...

263
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,080
Well, you...

264
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,000
You know that.

265
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,200
We're all emergency doctors.

266
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,960
More, please.

267
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,360
No problem.

268
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,600
No matter how much we order today,

269
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,440
We have enough.

270
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:13,880
No, boss.

271
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,600
How is it? Take your time and order whatever you want.

272
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,720
Okay.

273
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,600
It's a bit awkward.

274
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,720
You even asked someone to send something?

275
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,360
It's okay. We come here every day.

276
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,080
We're close.

277
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,200
Great hero, here's to you.

278
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,240
Great hero.

279
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:37,960
Great hero.

280
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Eat something.

281
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,000
I've been eating instant noodles all the time these days.

282
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:02,800
I can't stand it.

283
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,040
I want to eat rice.

284
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,640
Boss, the five of us...

285
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,000
Sorry.

286
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:07,800
We only sell set meals.

287
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,800
It's two o'clock now.

288
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,640
There are only four left.

289
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,040
That's all we have left.

290
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,360
You guys eat.

291
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,000
I'll buy some at the convenience store.

292
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:17,680
No.

293
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,360
It's okay.

294
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:21,800
Let's go, Chi.

295
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,920
Boss, serve us all.

296
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:27,680
Okay, no problem.

297
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,760
Don't forget the meat.

298
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:29,920
Have some soup.

299
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,400
Okay.

300
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:31,520
Right, Sister Qi.

301
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,520
Did you see the news?

302
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,640
Dr Zhang is on TV.

303
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,040
Who is it, Chi?

304
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,000
Yeah.

305
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,400
Yesterday,

306
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,680
a driver drove drunk.

307
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,800
And Dr Zhang

308
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,920
saved an excellent female teacher at a school of deaf-mute.

309
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,920
and was shot by a passerby.

310
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,160
It's the evening news.

311
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,400
Keep a low profile.

312
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,760
It's true. In my mind,

313
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,760
He went up right away.

314
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,240
Aren't you hungry Take it

315
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,400
I'm tired. Hurry up.

316
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,280
Scoop more meat.

317
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,160
Okay, no problem.

318
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,160
Give me that first.

319
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,640
Boss, do you have braised eggs?

320
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,280
Chi.

321
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,120
Why are you outside?

322
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,040
Why don't you go inside and blow on the air conditioner?

323
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,160
There are too many people inside.

324
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,360
Here's your extra meal.

325
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,560
We all know that you're on TV.

326
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,040
Everyone is proud of you.

327
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:17,640
Come on.

328
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,520
Thank you

329
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,760
By the way, Sister Qi bought this for you.

330
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,760
Thank her for me.

331
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,000
Sister Qi.

332
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,280
I know you want to reward Dr Zhang.

333
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,880
Why don't you deliver it yourself?

334
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,640
If you send it yourself,

335
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,040
if you send it yourself.

336
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,040
Eat your food.

337
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,920
I'm starving.

338
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:44,920
Well...

339
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,400
I told him it was from you.

340
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,760
I'll give you a needle.

341
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,160
You can't accomplish anything well.

342
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:02,920
All exposed.

343
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,000
Chi.

344
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:21,760
Liu.

345
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,000
I knew you were here.

346
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,480
I heard

347
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,760
you often come here to look up information after work.

348
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,960
The administrator complained to me

349
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,520
he couldn't get off work early because of you.

350
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,560
It's my fault.

351
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,440
I'll try not to come out during the day.

352
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,520
I also heard

353
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,800
you saved people on TV.

354
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,000
You heard about it too?

355
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,000
You also heard about it, 517.

356
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,840
If it were in the past,

357
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,080
I might not have...

358
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,760
to persuade you to stay in our emergency center.

359
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,640
But now,

360
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,520
I really hope

361
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,120
you can reconsider

362
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,480
Stay here.

363
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,360
0104577.

364
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,240
Stay here.

365
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,840
Yes, Chi.

366
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,040
You

367
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,880
are born to be a good doctor.

368
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,080
Of course.

369
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,240
No matter you're a cardiac surgeon,

370
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,880
or an emergency doctor, I believe

371
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,599
you can get good grades.

372
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,599
But I did it out of my selfish desire.

373
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:11,480
I really hope

374
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,040
you can stay in our emergency center.

375
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,319
We

376
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,800
need doctors like you.

377
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,080
You're on duty too?

378
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:33,800
You too.

379
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,200
Why are you angry?

380
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,960
I heard you were an emergency doctor in the North District.

381
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,320
Help me find some connections.

382
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,400
and find a bed for my uncle at the orthopedic department.

383
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,560
It won't be difficult.

384
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:55,920
Here's the thing.

385
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,560
If you arrange a bed for your uncle,

386
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,400
the patient who should have been treated

387
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,560
will delay the treatment.

388
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,960
So I can't help you with this.

389
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,080
It's none of your business

390
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,800
to have a bed or a bed.

391
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,480
You'd better line up, 1200.

392
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,040
You'd better line up.

393
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,440
I have to go.

394
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,160
Don't go.

395
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,280
Here, take this.

396
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,840
I won't let you help for nothing.

397
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,040
When the bed is settled,

398
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,040
there will be more.

399
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,520
I can't help you with this.

400
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:22,840
Go back now.

401
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,560
Stop pretending.

402
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,520
You have neither money nor a house.

403
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,640
You didn't even accept my red packets.

404
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,920
You deserve to be a loser.

405
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,440
Luckily, I didn’t like you.

406
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:31,800
Zheng Bo,

407
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,200
How about

408
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:32,960
0502200.

409
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,440
What do you mean?

410
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,120
I confessed to you the day before yesterday.

411
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,200
You said you need three days to think about it.

412
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,440
Promise me you won't see any girl for three days.

413
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,200
Now,

414
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,160
you have no respect for me, right?

415
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,800
I don't care. You broke the rules.

416
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,920
You're my boyfriend from now on.

417
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,440
I'm sorry.

418
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,960
My boyfriend can't take your money.

419
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:50,720
Take it.

420
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,040
Are you two crazy?

421
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,360
You're the one who's sick.

422
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,160
You...

423
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:04,920
Jiang Dong emergency.

424
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,520
I heard everything, Jia Qi.

425
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,640
Yes.

426
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:08,720
You're welcome.

427
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,920
Jiangdong emergency.

428
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,080
I know you're helping me.

429
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,560
But your reason

430
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,080
is a bit ridiculous.

431
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,440
Ridiculous.

432
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,080
But it works.

433
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:18,920
Yes.

434
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,320
Congratulations on chasing me.

435
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,040
What are you doing?

436
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,960
Why are you blushing?

437
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:35,560
It's hot.

438
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,680
I did you a favor. Buy me a ride.

439
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,200
Okay.

440
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,400
Welcome. How many?

441
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,080
Two.

442
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,400
This way, please.

443
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,200
Okay, thank you.

444
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,280
We're here.

445
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:17,960
Mr. Zheng.

446
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,440
Why are you dressed like this?

447
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,560
How could you say that?

448
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,720
I like ancient style.

449
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,280
but I don't have time for work.

450
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,040
This is my new set.

451
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,400
You're the first one to see it.

452
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,560
What's that face? Is it pretty?

453
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,800
Yes.

454
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,800
You have a mission today.

455
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,040
What mission?

456
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,960
Take a photo for me.

457
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,560
It's too close. Step back a bit.

458
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,200
Okay.

459
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,560
Raise the camera.

460
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,280
It makes my face look smaller.

461
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:53,720
Okay.

462
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,320
Take a photo of the side too.

463
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,080
This position is okay.

464
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,960
If it's a whole body, put it up a bit.

465
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,560
Make my legs look longer.

466
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,280
Can you shoot like this?

467
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,040
Sure.

468
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,040
Really?

469
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:09,560
Yes.

470
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,320
Let me see.

471
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,080
Take a good look at this photo.

472
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,200
How tall am I?

473
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,320
How tall am I?

474
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,520
1.6m.

475
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,520
How tall is he?

476
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,080
1.6m.

477
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:33,040
It can't be more than 1.3m, okay?

478
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,960
I'm too short in this photo.

479
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,560
And this one.

480
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,040
Although the composition is OK,

481
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,200
but my whole body is weak.

482
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,400
Is it useless?

483
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:41,920
Yes.

484
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,440
There's another one.

485
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,680
Lift the camera a little bit.

486
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,080
If you want to

487
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,560
half-body or big head,

488
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,160
I want to make my face slimmer.

489
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,200
Just bend a little bit.

490
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,800
Do you understand?

491
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:57,560
Yes.

492
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:58,920
Come again.

493
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,320
Okay.

494
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,640
Is this the whole body? Raise a bit.

495
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:35,560
Okay.

496
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:39,800
Do I look good?

497
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,160
Okay.

498
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:40,800
Let me see.

499
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,560
Not bad.

500
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,840
Your photography skills have improved greatly.

501
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:47,560
Not bad.

502
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:48,640
Not bad.

503
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,640
How is it? I took it.

504
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,040
Not bad.

505
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,160
I'll post it on Moments.

506
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,920
Yes, send this one.

507
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,560
Don't send these two.

508
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,560
Don't send this one and this one.

509
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,840
Yes, you don't look well.

510
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,320
Why do you care so much?

511
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,280
Photographers can't give any suggestions.

512
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,080
Okay.

513
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,200
Let me take two photos for you.

514
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,280
No.

515
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,320
It's Mr. Cheng's son's birthday soon.

516
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,600
Hua Zi and Chi will hold a birthday party.

517
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,880
Mr. Yuancheng has a wish.

518
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,040
Join us.

519
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:19,480
Sure.

520
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,560
Happy birthday to you

521
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:30,280
Happy birthday to you

522
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:35,200
Happy birthday to you

523
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:39,200
Happy birthday to you

524
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,240
Here comes the cake.

525
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:44,720
Get ready.

526
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,200
Come on.

527
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,760
Make a wish.

528
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,000
Wish you health and longevity.

529
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,520
Come on, Mr. Cheng.

530
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,760
Blow the candles together.

531
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:00,200
One, two, three.

532
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,520
Happy birthday.

533
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,960
Come on, let's

534
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,200
Cut the cake.

535
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,680
Here.

536
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,760
Okay.

537
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,280
The first piece is for you.

538
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:13,600
Here.

539
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,520
Come on, you first.

540
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:17,720
You share this.

541
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,240
Give it to that lady.

542
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,400
Come on.

543
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,080
Mr. Cheng, what’s wrong?

544
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:26,880
What’s wrong?

545
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,520
You...

546
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,680
You are all good kids.

547
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,800
You're all good kids.

548
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:42,960
I know.

549
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,440
you did this

550
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,800
to fulfill my wish.

551
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,840
My son Ming Song

552
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,360
died in Wenchuan.

553
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:00,280
He was buried under the mudslide.

554
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,880
He can never go home again.

555
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:08,840
But it’s finally his birthday.

556
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,160
Mr. Cheng.

557
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,600
Don’t be sad.

558
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,840
We are all your children.

559
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,800
Let me tell you

560
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,840
about my neighbour and an emergency doctor.

561
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,520
When I was young,

562
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,760
in my hometown.

563
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,000
My parents work in the city.

564
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,440
I can't see them for a year or two years.

565
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,120
I grew up with my grandparents.

566
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,440
When I was 11,

567
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,520
I was very impressed.

568
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,920
My grandma put the remaining pesticide

569
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,760
into a drink bottle.

570
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,800
I'm small. I don't know what that is.

571
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:42,840
I made it

572
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,680
I made it with one bite.

573
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,800
I almost died.

574
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,160
At that time, my grandparents were in the fields.

575
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,080
My neighbors found me.

576
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,800
I called 120.

577
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,080
I remember when the car walked halfway,

578
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,520
the mountain road collapsed.

579
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,800
The ER carried the stretcher all the way

580
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,680
and drove me to the hospital.

581
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,800
Then the neighbors took turns to watch me.

582
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,800
to deliver water and food.

583
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,280
and pay the bill.

584
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,160
until I was discharged.

585
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:12,680
So I...

586
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,880
I had a special feeling

587
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,160
about emergency doctors.

588
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,320
I really want to do something for you.

589
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,440
Even a little thing makes me happy.

590
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,080
That's why

591
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:24,760
to meet you.

592
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,280
I deliver so many orders every day.

593
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,560
You have the most.

594
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,800
I know your filial piety.

595
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,520
all of us

596
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,560
Mr. Cheng’s child.

597
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,480
Mr. Cheng,

598
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,040
We’ll take care of you, okay?

599
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,640
Mr. Cheng, will you agree?

600
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,120
Yes.

601
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,040
We'll take care of you together with Huazi.

602
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,880
Yes, just say yes.

603
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,120
If you don't say anything,

604
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,800
I'll take it as a yes.

605
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,000
What a good boy.

606
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,640
Mr. Cheng, please say yes.

607
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,160
Okay.

608
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,080
Good Huazi

609
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,120
Sir, don't cry.

610
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,920
Hurry up and cut the cake.

611
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,400
I have to feed him first.

612
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,520
Here, have some cake.

613
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,960
Share the cake.

614
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,960
Let me cut the cake.

615
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,080
Here, I'll give you one.

616
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,440
I'll add strawberries for you.

617
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,200
Here, have some cake.

618
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:18,600
Thank you.

619
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,520
You're welcome.

620
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,640
You can't eat the cake with cream.

621
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,520
I didn't eat it.

622
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,760
I'll cut one for you.

623
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:24,760
Me neither.

624
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,080
Imitate me.

625
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,280
Not bad, little talent.

626
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,600
You're hiding something.

627
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,560
Yes, a musician.

628
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,520
This hobby

629
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,000
is the only hobby

630
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,080
in many hobbies.

631
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,560
Today is Mr. Cheng’s birthday.

632
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,960
I suddenly remembered when I was in college,

633
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,240
when I was in college.

634
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,120
I made him a greeting card.

635
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,480
But he came back late at night

636
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,560
and threw my card away.

637
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,360
He told me that if you have time,

638
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,040
you should read more books.

639
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:26,040
Does your dad think the card is too childish?

640
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,040
But he doesn't lack anything.

641
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,280
What should I give him?

642
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,040
The card I made myself.

643
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,240
I only made it once in my life.

644
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,120
I'm different from you.

645
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,960
When I was young,

646
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,040
my dad seldom went home

647
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,280
and rarely comes home.

648
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,520
Come home once in a while.

649
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,600
You don't even know what grade I was in.

650
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,000
Once I went home, he picked me up at school.

651
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,040
What happened?

652
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,040
I'm already in middle school.

653
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,720
He went to my primary school.

654
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,080
Uncle is so interesting.

655
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,840
This qin

656
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,520
was given to me

657
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,720
when I graduated from junior high.

658
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:13,040
He was against me playing the piano,

659
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,800
but he bought it for me.

660
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,040
I think

661
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,480
all fathers are the same.

662
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,040
He has a sharp tongue but a soft heart.

663
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,560
I can understand when we grow up.

664
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:24,760
I understand.

665
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:25,760
I understand.

666
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,520
I'll text my dad on WeChat.

667
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:33,520
That's my dad

668
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,200
who I love day and night.

669
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,240
What should I say?

670
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,920
Will he miss me?

671
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:06,800
Chi.

672
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,960
These are my medical notes for years.

673
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:14,720
It records my working experience for 40 years.

674
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,360
I hope it will help you

675
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,320
Dad Zhang Beihai

676
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,920
Zheng Bo is working today

677
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,600
I met that grumpy man again.

678
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,240
The one who stabbed his leg with a knife.

679
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,600
Didn't you save him twice?

680
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:10,920
Something happened again.

681
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,320
What happened?

682
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,920
His wife divorced him.

683
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,880
He got angry and got sick again.

684
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,920
He was beaten by a neighbor.

685
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,800
This neighbor is good.

686
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,400
I won't hold him accountable.

687
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,000
Otherwise, he'll be sentenced to three or five years.

688
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,480
That neighbor is so unlucky.

689
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,080
There must be something wrong

690
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,000
with someone like him.

691
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,320
What luck is he?

692
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,000
Poor guy.

693
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,400
He hit me with a few words.

694
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,560
His wife can't talk to others.

695
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:35,440
Yes.

696
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,280
Who is it?

697
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,280
I sent that photo in the group chat.

698
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:40,480
What photos?

699
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:44,640
It’s good.

700
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,120
On Mr. Cheng’s birthday,

701
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,280
On his birthday?

702
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,640
Mr. Cheng

703
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,800
Zhang Chi did a good job.

704
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:54,760
He deserves a reward.

705
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,960
Sir, add five pieces of beef for him.

706
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,560
Just add three slices.

707
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,760
Huang and I did a good job.

708
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,920
Why don't we have beef?

709
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:03,720
How dare you say that?

710
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:04,920
Your performance

711
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:05,600
You still eat meat?

712
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,920
Pick out your meat and give it to Zhang Chi.

713
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:07,920
Give it to me.

714
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,160
I prepared so well.

715
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,680
Huang is like a gangster.

716
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,240
Little Huang.

717
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,120
I was acting.

718
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,120
He kicked me out.

719
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,120
Forget it.

720
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,120
The noodles taste better than usual.

721
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,040
I'm hungry today.

722
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,560
0106 Train Team

723
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,160
We have a transfer mission.

724
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,040
The patient's stomach cancer is done.

725
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:52,240
He's transferred from the police hospital to Seongbuk Hospital.

726
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,120
Are we almost there?

727
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:02,560
Dad.

728
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,560
Did you walk halfway?

729
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:05,920
More than half.

730
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,440
Soon, sir. Soon.

731
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,160
Why are you in such a hurry? 120.

732
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,920
Dad, you're getting older and more like a kid.

733
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,040
Isn't 005,000 a surgery done by the police?

734
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,240
Isn't it a surgery done by the police?

735
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,680
Why is he transferred to the North?

736
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:52,920
This ward

737
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,120
This one.

738
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:54,680
Slowly.

739
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,440
Juliet.

740
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:57,800
Patient Ju Lifang.

741
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,920
A patient was transferred to the police hospital.

742
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,040
In this room.

743
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,520
I'm going to pick up the list.

744
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,120
Okay, go ahead.

745
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,320
You go first.

746
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,000
Dr Zhang, Dr Qi.

747
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,159
I need some time.

748
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,040
Okay, take a break.

749
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:11,280
No hurry.

750
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,280
Are you uncomfortable?

751
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,760
No, I'm fine.

752
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,440
Why are men and women in the same room?

753
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,280
The hospital is always like this.

754
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,239
Lifang! Lifang!

755
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:26,639
Old man, why are you here?

756
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:31,440
We'll be patients from now on.

757
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,239
What are you doing?

758
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,280
We'll talk about it when you recover.

759
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,639
I'm fine.

760
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:47,239
Does the surgery hurt?

761
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:48,560
No.

762
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:52,120
How did you know?

763
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,800
My daughter told me everything.

764
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:58,920
You know everything?

765
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,040
She has a sharp tongue.

766
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,640
Dad, mom.

767
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,280
Daughter.

768
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,880
Why did you tell her everything?

769
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,920
Dad, I can't hide it.

770
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,920
I feel clear.

771
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,560
At first,

772
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,040
I was scared.

773
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,280
Then I wasn't scared.

774
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,520
You will definitely come to see me

775
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:32,120
after the surgery.

776
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,440
You're amazing.

777
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,640
Aunt Ju, we have to do blood test today.

778
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,120
Again?

779
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,520
You don't need to smoke after today.

780
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,400
Nurse, be gentle.

781
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,320
She's a little dizzy.

782
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:53,640
Lifang.

783
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,280
Look at me.

784
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,640
Don't be afraid.

785
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,520
Let me sing you a song.

786
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,280
The water is clear

787
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:12,640
It's clear and clear.

788
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:16,920
I'll make a bamboo hat.

789
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:20,640
Send the red army.

790
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:24,440
The army loves the people.

791
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,680
The people support the army.

792
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,320
Sir, I'm sorry.

793
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:35,600
I'm late again.

794
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:36,480
Sorry to keep you from work.

795
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,600
I'll pick him up early next time.

796
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:39,880
It's okay.

797
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,120
You are doctors.

798
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,760
We understand that you're busy at work.

799
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,880
But I've never seen you pick me up.

800
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,400
You were my husband before.

801
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:47,520
Yes.

802
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,520
I was always busy in the department.

803
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,760
But I'll have time when I'm better.

804
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,240
Chi,

805
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,360
I'll pick you up every day, okay?

806
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,360
Mom is the best.

807
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,640
Say goodbye to your teacher.

808
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,240
Goodbye.

809
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,600
Bye.

810
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,520
We're leaving.

811
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,360
OK. Take care.

812
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:05,880
Thank you.

813
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,520

814
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,840

00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:31,760
Stop singing.

822
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:41,760
It's you.

823
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,240
You scared me.

824
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:44,880
Dad! Dad!

825
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,600
I just came back from the car.

826
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,000
I came to pick you up

827
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,000
so I came to pick you up.

828
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,760
I'll pick him up from now on.

00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,000
It's okay. I'll answer it.

830

00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,600
Just sing that song.

834
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:05,600

How I wonder what you are

837
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,360
Now let me ask him about him.

838
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,800
Are you with him right now?

839
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:53,840

00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:54,920

The left side of the car.

852
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:19,440

00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:49,720
Give it to me.

885
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,440
I really gave you a needle.

886
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,720
I didn't expect it to be him.

887
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:56,160
What a coincidence.

888
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,520
What a coincidence. Yeah.

889
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,080
The world is too small

890
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,960
Dr Zhang, Dr Qi, please wait

891
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,440
Did you find

892
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:05,440
the patient's palm?

893
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:06,800
We couldn't find him.

894
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,080
She lost too much blood.

895
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,440
so we sent her to the hospital.

896
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,440
What should we do?

897
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:11,960
It's the best time

898
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,160
is six to eight hours.

899
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:15,440
