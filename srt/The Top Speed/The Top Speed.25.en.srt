There's a mudslide in Ropyeong Village.

4
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,800
The casualties are unknown.

5
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,120
Zhang Chi, Qi Qi, send out the car to support immediately.

00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,360
Get out of the car.

Hurry up.

11
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,440
Let's go.

12
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,000
Ropyeong Village.

13
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,920
A major mudslide terrorism occurred.

14
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,280
Rescue team and fire team

15
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,040
[arrived at the scene 12 minutes ago.]

16
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,040
[It has been raining heavily recently.]

17
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:34,640
[and the rain switched,]

18
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,160
the soil in Ropyeong Village has been unstable.

19
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,240
It has caused some landslides.

20
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,320
There is still a risk of the second collapse.

21
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,920
All medical staffs need to take precautions.

22
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,120
Sister Qi, we're outside the disaster area.

23
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,000
Ming, slow down.

24
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,560
A rock fell down ahead

25
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,200
Did you see it?

26
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,120
Sister, there seems to be a landslide ahead.

27
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,680
Oh my god

28
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,800
Ming, how far is it?

29
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,920
I just checked

30
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,800
1.2 kilometers left.

31
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,920
1.2 kilometers. What should we do?

32
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,680
Take all the equipment and walk there.

33
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,480
Bye.

34
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:14,920
Take the stretcher.

35
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,800
Take them all

36
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,480
Take them all.

37
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,360
Don't forget the stretcher.

38
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,160
Take the stretcher.

39
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,680
Watch out!

40
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:39,680
Sister Qi, be careful.

41
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,000
Xiao Qiu.

42
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,760
Slow down, Xiao Qiu.

43
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,320
Slow down. Go there. Slow down.

00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,120
Huang, slow down.

45
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:51,800
Watch your steps.

00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,680
Let's go.

47
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,240

00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,000
There’s a kid here.

51
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,920
Someone's here! Someone!

52
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,560
Coming.

53
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,480
Come with me.

54
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,440
Don't cry.

55
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,240
Help him, comrade.

56
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,200
This way. This way.

57
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,440
The landslide must be marked.

58
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,000
Watch carefully.

59
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:45,680
Okay, no problem.

60
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,680
How long is the rescue team left?

61
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:50,920
Get rid of them quickly.

62
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,680
I'll contact them now.

63
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,240
Hurry.

64
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,120
Doctor!

65
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,560
We saved another one.

66
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,440
Stretcher!

67
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,560
There's someone over there.

68
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,440
Almost there.

69
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,480
There are two more here.

70
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,240
It's okay.

71
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:21,800
Slowly.

72
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,680
Thank you.

73
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,000

79
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:41,920
Okay.

80
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,240
Slow down.

81
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,200
Coming.

82
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,560
I'm not sure yet.

83
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,560
We've already cleared up a part.

84
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,200
Hello.

85
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,480
I'm Zhao Qingming from the rescue team.

00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,840
Captain Zhao, we're from the emergency center.

87
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,720
There's a landslide

88
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,360
There's a landslide.

89
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,680
Our car is blocked.

90
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,600
We walked here.

91
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,840
Can you clear the road?

92
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,480
and let our car in.

93
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,320
Got it.

94
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,840
I'll send someone to clean the roadblocks.

95
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,920
Just focus on your work.

96
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,920
Leave the rest to us.

97
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:28,840
Okay, thank you.

98
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,600
What's the situation now?

99
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,320
I'm the village head.

100
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,200
Most of them have been transferred out.

101
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,919
Some of them are trapped.

102
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,200
Where are the wounded?

103
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,240
Where are the wounded?

104
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,080
They are all here.

105
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,120
Come on. Hurry up. Let's go.

106
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,840

00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,840
Where are the patients rescued from the village?

00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,840
are here.

112
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,960
According to our initial judgment,

113
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,320
these four or five are heavy.

114
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,840
Some are light over there.

115
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,320
Help me with the treatment.

116
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,320
Okay, thank you.

and then check the wounds.

Qi Tuo, you go this way and I go that way.

122
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,600
We'll check the wound and classify it when we get there.

124
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,440

143
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:52,960
It's okay.

144
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,200
What's wrong?

145
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,080
Let me do a leg check

146
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,320

Doctor, we've cleared it up.

158
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,600
But a girl was seriously injured.

159
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,680
I dare not move her.

160
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,240

00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,440
Here.

197
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,480
Hello can you hear me

198
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,440
Hello can you hear me

199
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,200
Hello, lady.

200
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,240
Miss, can you hear me?

201
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,080
Miss.

202
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,960
Dr Qi, hurry.

203
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:55,920
Here's a heavy one.

204
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,200
Doctor.

205
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:57,720
Put it here.

206
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,320
Save my brother.

207
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,240
Save my brother.

208
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,480
Can you hear me?

209
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:03,920
Can you hear me?

210
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,120
Brother.

211
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,600
Can you hear me?

212
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,240
Do you have a history of heart disease?

213
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,200
I don't know.

214
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:09,840
What about high blood pressure?

215
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,720
I don't know.

216
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:11,360
Brother

217
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,200
Qiu, Qiu, Qiu.

218
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,840
My heartbeat and breath are gone. Come on.

219
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,320
I blinked

220
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,200
What's wrong?

221
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,480
Miss, what's wrong?

222
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,200
The doctor asked you what's wrong.

223
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,480
I'm so sleepy.

224
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,200
Don't be sleepy.

225
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,200
Don't fall asleep.

226
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,680
Your heart rate is a bit fast.

227
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,720
26 27 28 29 30

228
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:57,720
One, two.

229
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,320
Two

230
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,480
Chow-yi, move back a bit. Okay.

231
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,240
Bro

232
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,840
23 24 25 26

233
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,000
27 28 29 30

234
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,120
Chen Da.

235
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:08,720
Sister.

236
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,360
Defibrillator. Hurry. Defibrillator.

237
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,720
Does it hurt to press here?

238
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:15,960
Here.

239
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,840
My ribs may be broken

240
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,560
Here.

241
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,840
Move your legs.

242
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,200
Move your legs.

243
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:23,920
No.

244
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,480
I can't.

245
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,720
Why is his blood pressure so low?

246
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,320
60, 90.

247
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,200
There must be internal bleeding.

248
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,080
Hurry, open the vein.

249
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:29,480
Here.

250
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,200
Two grams of ammonia acid.

251
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,960
Don't sleep, miss.

252
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,600
Doctor, help me! Save my brother!

253
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:45,720
Save my brother.

254
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:49,600
Here, 200 yuan.

255
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:49,960
How much?

256
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:50,720
200, 200.

257
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:53,320
Done?

258
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:53,720
Yes.

259
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,080
Okay.

260
00:14:59,080 --> 00:14:59,840
Miss. Miss.

261
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,480
Chat with her. Don't let her sleep.

262
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,120
Okay.

263
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,240
What's your name?

264
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,840
Taotao.

265
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:05,960
Huangtao.

266
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,440
My family name is Huang too.

267
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,960
How old are you?

268
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,320
27.

269
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,480
27.

270
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,200
You don't look like someone from this village.

271
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,680
What are you doing here?

272
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,200
Photo.

273
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,320
Take a picture. Are you a photographer?

274
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:21,800
Don't sleep

275
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,000
Don't sleep.

276
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,840
25 26 27 28 29 30.

277
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,240
Not yet.

278
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,360
200.

279
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,200
200.

280
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,960
Come on.

281
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,840
We have to send her out.

282
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,080
Send her to the hospital as soon as possible.

283
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,080
There's no stretcher.

284
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:43,560
What should I do?

285
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,480
Miss, don't sleep.

286
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:55,720
Huang'er.

287
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,080
Hold her head and her shoulder.

288
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:57,480
Okay.

289
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:58,960
Door. Come on.

290
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,320
Relax. Okay.

291
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,600
Okay, neck. One, two, three.

292
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,480
Three.

293
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,720
Miss, don't sleep.

294
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,600
Where were we?

295
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,200
What kind of boyfriend do you want?

296
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,080
That's good.

297
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,960
If I can get out alive,

298
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,680
Will you marry me?

299
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,680
Fine, I'll marry you.

300
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,200
It's okay. It's not a big problem.

301
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,080
No problem, girl.

302
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,200
Don't sleep. I'll be right back.

303
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:32,960
It'll be ready soon.

304
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,720
We're almost done.

305
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,600
I'm sleepy.

306
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,240
I'm not sleepy. I'm almost done.

307
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,080
Got it?

308
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:40,840
Yes.

309
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:41,960
Can you hear me?

310
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,320
Can you hear me?

311
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,480
It's okay.

312
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,240
Tell the rescue team

313
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,000
to send him to the hospital.

314
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,480
Rescue team, help!

315
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,240
It's okay.

316
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:50,920
Bro

317
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,120
One two three get up

318
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,960
Watch out for the crossbeam.

319
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,800
Let's go.

320
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:01,840
Let's go.

321
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,599
Doctor!

322
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:05,319
What's wrong?

323
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,599
Several people in the house are seriously injured.

324
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,319
We dare not move.

325
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,440
Please save her first

326
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,240
Yuan Yuan, there's a heartbeat

327
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,240
Send her to the hospital

328
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:16,480
Did Lu Qing drive?

329
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,760
I can't drive. It's still cleared here.

330
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,720
Are you okay?

331
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:22,599
I'm fine

332
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,560
You've been kneeling for too long.

333
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,720
It's okay. I just need a rest.

334
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:27,440
It's okay.

335
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,480
Go and have a rest.

336
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:29,920
Have some water, Da.

337
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,160
Qiu, go and have some water.

338
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,000
Sister, calm down.

339
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,960
Besides, a falling stone blocked the road.

340
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,680
The strong guy in our village

341
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,320
Go help if you can move.

342
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:45,720
Li Huo Huo.

343
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:46,720
Coming.

344
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:47,720
Here.

345
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,680
Send him over.

346
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,200
Huang, tell Qi Tuo the situation.

347
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:55,680
Okay.

348
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:56,480
This way.

349
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:57,920
Let's go.

350
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,080
Sister.

351
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:43,840
What's going on?

352
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,680
Slow down.

353
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:45,600
What's going on?

354
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,840
My waist is injured.

355
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,720
His ribs are broken too.

356
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,320
He's unconscious.

357
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,120
We can't handle this, Huang.

358
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,920
Send the ambulance to the hospital.

359
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,440
Hurry up.

360
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,600
Come, give me a hand.

361
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,320
Help!

362
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,600
Give me a hand. Thank you.

363
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,200
Be gentle.

364
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,080
I'll go back to see Chi.

365
00:18:59,080 --> 00:18:59,600
Go back.

366
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,600
Huo, take it with you.

367
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:00,960
Okay.

368
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,720
Hurry up.

369
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,840
Is the road clear? Is it clear?

370
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,320
No. Five minutes.

371
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,400
There's one more here. He's badly injured.

372
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,200
Look. Hello. What's wrong?

373
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,600
I have chest tightness.

374
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,400
Stomach?

375
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,320
It's too sudden.

376
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:23,920
You're a doctor.

377
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,400
Yes.

378
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,320
I have chest tightness.

379
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,320
chest tightness, right?

380
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:27,920
chest tightness.

381
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,400
Doctor, come here. I feel much better.

382
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,440
Can you move your arm?

383
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,000
Much better

384
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,600
Can you move your legs?

385
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,720
Not bad.

386
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,160
Stand up slowly and see if you can walk.

387
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,200
Stand up slowly.

388
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,000
Let me help you.

389
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,320
One, two.

390
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:48,920
Thank you.

391
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,840
Is it okay?

392
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,440
Not bad.

393
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,520
It's okay, right? Then take her away.

394
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:51,840
Okay.

395
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,040
Thank you, doctor.

396
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,560
Thank you, rescue team.

397
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,640
Help me.

398
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,720
Hello.

399
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,120
Where did you get hurt?

400
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,480
It's too sudden.

401
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,600
I don't know what happened.

402
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,240
It happened all of a sudden.

403
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,200
I feel so bad.

404
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,960
I feel so dizzy.

405
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,720
Let me check for you.

406
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,320
Does it hurt here?

407
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:16,960
No.

408
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:17,600
Here.

409
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,320
It doesn't hurt.

410
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:19,840
Here.

411
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:20,680
It doesn't hurt here.

412
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:21,840
Here.

413
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:22,840
It doesn't hurt here either.

414
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,360
Lift your arm. Lift your arm.

415
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,840
It's okay. Move your legs.

416
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,080
Move your legs slowly.

417
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,240
Come on, try lifting it.

418
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,200
It looks like a trauma. It's bleeding a lot.

419
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,320
It's okay. It's just a trauma.

420
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,080
Let me treat it for you.

421
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,840
Thank you, Doctor.

422
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:48,480
Doctor!

423
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:49,840
Doctor!

424
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,840
My daughter is still on the second floor.

425
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,480
Go and save my daughter.

426
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,080
It doesn't matter if I'm old.

427
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,320
Go save her. Leave me alone.

428
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,120
Go save her.

429
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,560
Don't move. I'll bandage it for you.

430
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,840
Go and save my daughter.

431
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,440
I'm Zhang Chi. I'm Zhang Chi.

432
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,840
I'm in a three-floor building.

433
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,240
This house may collapse anytime.

434
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,200
We need help from the injured.

435
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,120
Copy that. Cha Myung got it.

436
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,320
I'll be right there.

437
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,360
Bro.

438
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,440
Get me a stretcher.

439
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:12,960
Give it to me.

440
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,600
Doctor.

441
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,720
Please save my daughter.

442
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,000
Save my daughter!

443
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,320
Please save my daughter.

444
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,240
Zhang Chi, I'm here.

445
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,320
Are you up there?

446
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,960
Ming, be careful.

447
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,320
Okay.

448
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,200
Take him out.

449
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:38,960
Okay.

450
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,200
Can you move your legs?

451
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,000
Yes.

452
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,120
Okay, I'll count to three.

453
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:42,960
Let's do it together.

454
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,960
One, two, three.

455
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:47,240
Hurry.

456
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:49,600
Let's go.

457
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:51,680
Come on.

458
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,200
Kid, are you okay?

459
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,800
I'm a doctor. I'll take you out.

460
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,600
My daughter.

461
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,080
Watch out!

462
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:37,680
Give it to me.

463
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:38,600
Rada

464
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,440
Give it to me.

465
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,480
Let's take her away first.

466
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,360
Ming.

467
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:53,720
Ming

468
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,480
Dada get him away first

469
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:00,840
Come.

470
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,680
Help! Xiao Qiu!

471
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,840
Sister Qi!

472
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:28,720
Sister.

473
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:01,920
How could this happen?

474
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,080
How could this happen?

475
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,720
He's just a driver.

476
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,720
How did the driver get hurt so badly?

477
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:07,960
It's okay. He's in surgery.

478
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,320
Trust the doctor.

479
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,440
Okay, it's okay.

480
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,000
I trust the doctor.

481
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,200
he will be fine.

482
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:15,720
It's okay.

483
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,920
My son will take the high school entrance exam this year.

484
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,120
He promised to take him on a trip after the exam.

485
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,240
Sorry, sister-in-law.

486
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,040
Come, sit here.

487
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:25,600
Sit here and take a rest.

488
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,520
I promise you.

489
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,120
Ming will be pushed out later.

490
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,080
I promise you, okay?

491
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:31,520
Qi Qi.

492
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,040
OK.

493
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,760
Doctor, how is Cha Myung?

494
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,120
We...

495
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:49,720
tried our best.

496
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,360
I tried my best.

497
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:53,760
What do you mean?

498
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,960
He's seriously injured.

499
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,280
We really did our best.

500
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,080
Doctor.

501
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,920
Doctor, please save him.

502
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,560
He might be saved.

503
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,760
He's only 41 years old.

504
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:06,800
No.

505
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:09,560
Sister-in-law.

506
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:10,680
Sister-in-law!

507
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,360
Sister-in-law

508
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,520
Sister-in-law

509
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,760
Come on. Put him down.

510
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:51,000
Next, let's invite Director Sun of the Municipal Health Commission

511

[None of the villagers died]

517
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,240
all villagers died.

518
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,800
All medical workers who participated in this rescue

519
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,320
have made great contributions.

520
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,080
On behalf of the Municipal Health Commission,

531
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,320
and decided to make an exception and get accepted in advance.

532
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,000
Besides,

533
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,280
we have to commend

Driver Cha Myung.

536
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,600
Unfortunately, one of our comrades

537

one of our comrades died

538
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,040
and left us forever.

Hello, everyone.

553
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,720
I'm Cha Ming's wife, Liu Le.

554
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,640
I’m here today

555
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:54,200

560
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,400
Thank you for your concern.

561
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:07,800
As her family,

562
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,120
our biggest happiness

563
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,040
is to see our family.

564
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,640
Go to work happily.

565
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,640
and come home safely.

566
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,560
But my husband

567
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,880
as a member of the emergency center,

568
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,200
I know him well.

569
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,360
When the Party and the people need him,

570
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,560
he stood up

571
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,400
In order to save people,

572
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,720
he left us forever.

573
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:36,680
Although I feel sad 401,

574
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,280
I feel sorry for 08401,

575
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,960
I feel proud of him.

576
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,120
He's an excellent ER.

577
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,120

We can't let him die in blizzard.

579

we are destined

581
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:12,600

on our shoulders.

584
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,400
Do you remember our oath?

00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,120
I swear.

586
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,840

and never get tired.

593
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,840
We need to improve ourselves.

594

and fully develop.

595
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:42,600

What's the emergency center?

634
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,120
This is a barrier

635
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,120
to another world.

636
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,400
The meaning of our existence

no matter where the patient is,

638
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,640

and advanced equipment?

641
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,720
Even in the most dangerous environment,

642
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,000
even the shortest supplies,

643
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,400
we have to try our best

644
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,000
to save our lives.

645
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,000
Please remember.

646
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,720
Emergency in front of the hospital

647
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,000
is to seize every second.

648
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,120
is to fight with the Grim Reaper.

649
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,280
Our job...

650
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:51,560
Oath to the heart

651
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,640
The start is the sprint.

652
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,400
The beginning is the final battle.

653
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,200
What's up?

654
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:30,720
Look.

655
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,720
It's been more than 20 years.

656
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,560
Why are you still the same?

657
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:35,840
Come, sit down.

658
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,840
You've changed a lot.

659
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,720
You've gotten old.

660
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,480
Your hair is white

661
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,480
I'm old.

662
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,840
Boss, serve the dishes.

663
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:49,920
Coming.

664
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,480
Have some water.

665
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:02,920
Here.

666
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:05,840
Enjoy.

667
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,120
It's been more than 20 years.

668
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:09,920
Why are you still the same?

669
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,880
Life is getting better.

670
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:17,320
But this is what I want the most.

671
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:19,440
Right.

672
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,760
This is your favorite.

673
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:23,760
Try it.

674
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,440
Eat it first.

675
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,320
Try it. Is it still the same?

676
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,159
What do you think? Say something.

677
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,600
Look at you.

678
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,760
Come on, let's drink.

679
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,600
Let's go.

680
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:57,760
If

681
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,160
found out

682
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,880
from my child.

683
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:04,320
I will never drink with a rough person like you.

684
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:05,720
That's right.

685
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,160
This is your name

686
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,440
my name.

687
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,320
my name forever.

688
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,720
Sun Yitouch.

689
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,760
The ink of ink.

690
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,440
You're uneducated.

691
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,840
Come to think of it,

692
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,600
You were asking for a beating.

693
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,080
You didn't behave properly.

694
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,680
You always rebel against me.

695
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:47,960
You're hopeless.

696
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:49,640
How about this?

697
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:52,080
We will organize

698
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,080
every week.

699
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,400
Yimo, you'll teach them.

700
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,760
Director, I can teach him.

701
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,360
But I can't teach him.

702
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,800
You're still angry.

703
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,360
Tell me, what's next?

704
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,400
Tell me, what's next?

705
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,920
What's below?

706
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,040
What's next?

707
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,080
I wrote it in the book.

708
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:10,960
If you have any questions,

709
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,920
or any words you don't know, you can ask me.

710
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:15,560
Look.

711
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:17,960
Can I get up now?

712
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:18,800
I'm so proud.

713
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,200
To be honest,

714
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,280
for half of my life.

715
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:27,560
Here we are.

716
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,320
I still broke my promise to Shu Hua.

717
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,520
Shu Hua will forgive you.

718
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,200
But I won't forgive you.

719
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:37,760
Tell me.

720
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:40,880
how can you

721
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,200
deserve Shu Hua?

722
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:51,520
Director Zhao came to me

723
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,520
and told me something similar.

724
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,880
Beihai

725
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,320
Come to my office

726
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:11,760
What's wrong?

727
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,200
Director, what's wrong?

728
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:17,520
Sit down.

729
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,960
Here, I just made it. Try it.

730
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:22,640
Good tea

731
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:24,960
No.

732
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:26,560
What can I do for you?

733
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,400
Look.

734
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,760
Our emergency station

735
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,640
is getting bigger.

736
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,320
More and more people.

737
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,320
Recently, many new doctors came.

738
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,320
My wife has finally become a mother-in-law.

739
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:46,720
Even you are a senior now.

740
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,000
I thought

741
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,840
to transfer you to administrative position.

742
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,200
Help me manage it.

743
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,080
Boss, are you going to promote me?

744
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:58,880
Yes.

745
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,080
How about promoting you to be the deputy director?

746
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,520
I knew it.

747
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,640
There must be something bad.

748
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:06,760
What are you talking about?

749
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:09,440
Isn't it good that I promote you to deputy director?

750
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,840
Wait until I retire and you take over my job.

751
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:12,520
That's great.

752
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,520
I can't do administration.

753
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,080
Find someone else

754
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,080
Zhang Beihai, what do you mean?

755
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,520
Boss you know

756
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,400
I can't stay in the office.

757
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,880
I like running outside.

758
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,080
You can ask someone else for help

759
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,160
Zhang Beihai

760
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,880
Why are you so unreasonable?

761
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,560
Look.

762
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,640
Qin is in the newspaper.

763
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,200
Aren't you worried?

764
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,080
Beihai

765
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,640
She didn't tell me about this.

766
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,320
I don't know.

767
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:57,440
Beihai

768
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,400
How old am I?

769
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,160
Let me tell you.

770
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,760
Couples should follow the same steps.

771
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,520
He's so diligent.

772
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,440
You'll get further and further.

773
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:10,840
Madam, don't worry.

774
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,640
I'm not far away from Shu Hua.

775
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,640
Even the newspaper can't get in.

776
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:21,520
Cut the crap.

777
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,080
Are you going to transfer to the administrative post?

778
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,160
No.

779
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:27,280
Boss,

780
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,640
I'm really not suitable for this job.

781
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,640
I'm good at being on the front line.

782
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,400
You brat.

783
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,640
Beihai is nice.

784
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,440
If you're not married,

785
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,440
I'll introduce my third daughter to you.

786
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:56,280
If he wasn't married, you wouldn't have come.

787
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,760
Our family has already decided.

788
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:00,880
Don't joke with me.

789
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,760
I'm not a joke.

790
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:07,640
I was angry when I saw you.

791
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,880
Shu Hua is younger than us,

792
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,760
but his pursuit for medicine

793
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,120
than us.

794
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,840
She was our pride back then.

795
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,440
Hai, sister-in-law is in the newspaper again.

796
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,520
That's right, Beihai

797
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,880
Your wife is a celebrity now.

798
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,320
She's all on the newspaper page.

799
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,640
Qin is capable.

800
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,520
I'm going to the Health Department for a meeting.

801
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,320
I often run into her.

802
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,160
She's already the representative of the hospital.

803
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,480
Beihai, let's go

804
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:40,280
Coming

805
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,160

Zhang Beihai

808
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:52,160
What's wrong?

809
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,160
Shu Hua is busy with work and often not at home.

810
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,040
Can you stop

811
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:58,880
with those girls?

812
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,360
Behave yourself.

813
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:02,760
When did I

814
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,400
with a girl?

815
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,600
What's wrong with me?

816
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:06,760
No.

817
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,520
My wife is not jealous. Why are you jealous?

818
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,640
Can you be serious?

819
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:12,360
You're not serious.

820
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,760
I told you you and Shu Hua are not suitable.

821
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,120
Let me tell you.

822
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:17,800
It's over.

823
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:19,520
You...

824
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:20,360
How can I...

825
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,880
Dong Zi's third grandmother introduced you a boyfriend.

826
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,040
Go on a blind date.

827
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:24,760
Got it?

828
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,760
Are you crazy?

829
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,520
How dare you talk about me?

830
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,480
I worked so hard for your blind date.

831
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,240
but you didn't like any of them.

832
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:37,240
Take care.

833
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:39,520
Come, sit here.

834
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:43,000
Three dishes, please.

835
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:44,120
Okay.

836
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,520
No stinky tofu, add some meat.

837
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:47,120
Okay.

838
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:48,880
Buy me dinner.

839
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,880
The sun is rising from the west.

840
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,400
Do you need my help?

841
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:54,560
What can I ask you for?

842
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,120
Can't I treat you to a meal?

843
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:00,160
I found you highly educated people are suspicious.

844
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,240
Thank you.

845
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:04,240
Let me do it.

846
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:06,280

859
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:28,880
I've discussed with Shu Hua.

860
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,520

861
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:32,400
Is that necessary?

862
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,240

863
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:37,760

867
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:49,000
He must be feeling unwell.

It's okay. Let's eat.

869
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,920
