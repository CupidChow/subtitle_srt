1
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:06,040
National Radio. and Telvison. Administration.

2
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:33,920
Then...

3
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,840
[You're going to be like this.] [You're going to be like this.]

4
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,000
I haven't decided.

5
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,720
How could I not?

6
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,360
He has changed his shift.

7
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,000
He did something.

8
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,360
How could you not think it through?

9
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,240
Let's go.

10
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,000
Why don't you put on a lipstick?

11
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,840
No, your lips are a little dry.

12
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:02,760
You're the one who's dry.

13
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,840
Hello, Dr. Qi.

14
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,280
I'm a community police officer near your hospital.

15
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,680
How many times have we met?

16
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,800
Let's add each other's contact.

17
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,280
I have a boyfriend.

18
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,000
I'm sorry.

19
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,040
Okay.

20
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,280
Am I the last one to know?

21
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,440
Zhang Chi.

22
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,840
You said you're not a three-year-old.

23
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,880
We had a fight that day.

24
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,480
I acted on impulse.

25
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,480
You're in your thirties.

26
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,160
You made this decision on impulse?

27
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,160
If you hate the ER,

28
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,120
or us,

29
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,440
You think Cardio Surgery is the light of your life.

30
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,600
You can just say it.

31
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,040
If you tell me, I'll respect you.

32
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,040
I don't think so.

33
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:21,880
Stop talking to me.

34
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,440
You're so boring.

35
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,040
I asked you out just to discuss with you.

36
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,200
Are you discussing?

37
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,079
0104577.

38
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,280
0104577

39
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:57,520
0104577.

40
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,839
Why didn’t you introduce me?

41
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,320
Is there anyone in your team

42
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,920
who is 1.8 meters tall

43
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,360
in his thirties?

44
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,760
Do you think I'm not small enough

45
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,040
or you think I'm too young?

46
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,760
You're almost 40 years old.

47
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,560
Stop pretending to be young.

48
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,440
Don't joke with me.

49
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,320
What are you talking about?

50
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,120
Can I?

51
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,880
You are...

52
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:40,880
Have you forgotten?

53
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,159
We met at the intersection

54
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,040
at Yunshui Road and Dongcheng Road.

55
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,280
I'll leave you to it.

56
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,760
Yunshui Road, Dongcheng Intersection.

57
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,600
Excuse me, officer.

58
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,360
Step back.

59
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,360
I have a serious cold.

60
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,160
I'm afraid I'll catch you.

61
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,000
Step back a little bit.

62
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:24,640
Hello.

63
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,120
Please show me your driving license and driving license.

64
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:26,440
Thank you.

65
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,040
You should wear a mask too.

66
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,159
It's the season now.

67
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,600
The virus cold is very serious.

68
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,360
Be safe.

69
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,840
No, thanks.

70
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:53,560
Put it on. I'm an emergency doctor.

71
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,600
I have a lot of cold like this lately.

72
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,560
Thank you.

73
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,880
You're a doctor.

74
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:01,920
Good job.

75
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:05,600
You can go now.

76
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,440
By the way,

77
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,560
disinfect it.

78
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,920
You just had contact with me.

79
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,200
This is for you.

80
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,880
Next time after registration, disinfect it

81
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,760
to prevent it.

82
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:19,760
I'm leaving.

83
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,400
Okay, bye.

84
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,320
It's you.

85
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,159
You had a fever.

86
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:39,600
You had a fever and almost lost your head.

87
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,480
I was thinking not to get infected.

88
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,280
I was really touched.

89
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,600
I thought you were cute.

90
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,320
I was looking forward to seeing you again.

91
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,840
Did you get better?

92
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,600
Just a false alarm.

93
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,760
It's all done.

94
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:52,720
That's good.

95
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,880
Don't you want to assign a boyfriend?

96
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,159
My name is Lu Ziyang.

97
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,880
I'm 28 years old. I'm single.

98
00:06:58,159 --> 00:06:59,360
Can I do it?

99
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,600
I want to assign myself to you.

100
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,560
Are you kidding me?

101
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,200
Then I'll take it seriously.

102
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,000
Really?

103
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,120
Okay.

104
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,520
Let's add each other on WeChat.

105
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,080
Okay, my phone is in my bag.

106
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:29,560
I'll get it.

107
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:24,920
Dr. Jin.

108
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,280
You've seen the patient.

109
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,680
What do you think?

110
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,600
Not long ago,

111
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,480
I just operated on a similar case.

112
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:33,600
It's fine.

113
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,480
That's great.

114
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,280
I'm counting on you for tomorrow's surgery.

115
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:38,360
Of course.

116
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,360
By the way,

117
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,159
Who is this patient to you?

118
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,840
Why did you invite me here?

119
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,160
Besides, it's not a complicated disease.

120
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,560
This patient

121
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,040
the patient directly.

122
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,600
But you have to help me with this.

123
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,800
I know how to make broccoli.

124
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,800
There's no need for shredded potato just now.

125
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,920
All the slices here are delicious.

126
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,040
What's wrong, master?

127
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,160
You're going to be a good wife and a good mother.

128
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,680
Go away!

129
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,680
It's hot.

130
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,480
My mom.

131
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,840
You're a grown man. Almost six cards.

132
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,920
You can't even cook

133
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,360
You should have told me earlier.

134
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,520
I'll share the menu with you.

135
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,240
I cook it every day. It's very simple.

136
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,120
Send it to me.

137
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,120
It's very useful. 0102002.

138
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,360
I'll send it to you.

139
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:31,600
Got it.

140
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,560
Huang, Qiu, let's go.

141
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,600
Let's go.

142
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:36,920
Yuan Yuan, we...

143
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,000
Hello, Jia Qi.

144
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:17,920
What are you doing?

145
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,440
I just opened the app you gave me. [Application]

146
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,240
I'm reading it.

147
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,160
Are you free tonight?

148
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,560
Let's have dinner at the same place.

149
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:25,560
I'll be right there.

150
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,800
Zheng Bo.

151
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,720
Did you hear anything?

152
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,120
No.

153
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,040
Listen carefully.

154
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,040
the sound of the air conditioner.

155
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,160
I think this place

156
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,120
a perfect office.

157
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,040
It's a pity to be a restaurant.

158
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,800
I...

159
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,360
I've already ordered.

160
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,000
But I forgot to ask them to serve the dishes.

161
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,280
Waiter, serve the dishes.

162
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,440
Just starve me to death.

163
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,120
Sorry, Jiaqi.

164
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,600
I'm too busy.

165
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,240
I ordered all your favorite dishes.

166
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,800
That means it's really stable this time.

167
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:32,920
Yes.

168
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,120
But

169
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,360
I still want to do better.

170
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,600
I knew it.

171
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:41,800
Zheng Bo.

172
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,360
I’m proud of you and your project.

173
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,120
You broke the rules.

174
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,120
You're my boyfriend from now on.

175
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,920
Congratulations on hitting on me.

176
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,160
Let me help you.

177
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,040
I didn't expect that we have the same idea.

178
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,400
I think our opinions

179
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,880
are quite consistent.

180
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,800
I don't want to share the same thought with you.

181
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:13,880
Then why do you like me?

182
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,000
Why do you like me?

183
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,480
Because I think you're cool.

184
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,120
And you work hard.

185
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,960
Most importantly, I think you're kind.

186
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,120
Isn't it good for us to be together?

187
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,440
Jiaqi, I'm just an ordinary person.

188
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,080
I think

189
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,440
You make me look good.

190
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:35,800
Zheng Bo.

191
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,080
I didn't make it clear last time.

192
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,800
I'm telling you now.

193
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,720
I like you.

194
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,600
We are different.

195
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,560
I can't give you happiness.

196
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,800
I'm happy only when I'm with you.

197
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:48,840
Don't you understand?

198
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,960
If we are together,

199
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,840
you'll suffer more.

200
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,360
So what?

201
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,200
I just need to be with you.

202
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,720
Kiki, you deserve someone better.

203
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,200
In my heart, you are the best.

204
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,440
We are suitable to be friends.

205
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,640
It's okay.

206
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,480
Even if you don't admit that you like me now,

207
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,400
your life is long anyway.

208
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,480
So what if I wait for you for two days?

209
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,600
One day,

210
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,760
I will let you appear on my marriage certificate.

211
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,640
When the app comes, It's done.

212
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,000
I will put all my savings

213
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,000
into it.

214
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,400
If you don't do well,

215
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,400
I might have to borrow money.

216
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:43,880
You

217
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,000
don't waste your time on me.

218
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,600
I'm not wasting time.

219
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,760
Liking you is my business.

220
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,880
Zheng Bo, come on.

221
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,600
Since I want to share happiness with you,

222
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,760
I’ll share the pain with you.

223
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,240
Zheng Bo.

224
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,640
I really hope

225
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,760
your talent won't be defeated by reality.

226
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:18,880
That's all.

227
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:19,520
C PEAK

228
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,120
Kiki.

229
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,440
Actually, I want to tell you

230
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:42,800
I...

231
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,800
How does it feel?

232
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,160
I don't know what this feels like.

233
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,080
How is it?

234
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:15,840
I'm fine.

235
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,320
Failure is the mother of success.

236
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,720
If they don't invest in us,

237
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,680
It means they have a bad taste.

238
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,800
You'll regret it later.

239
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,440
I used to be a failure.

240
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,400
But then what?

241
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,680
I became a receiver too.

242
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,160
And I have so many good colleagues.

243
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,040
Most importantly, I'm in a relationship with you.

244
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,160
It's okay.

245
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,280
Let's go. I'll treat you to dinner. Cheer up.

246
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:31,720
It worked.

247
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,560
I said the financing was successful.

248
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,400
How much?

249
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,200
Five hundred thousand.

250
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,440
Five million.

251
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,440
How did you deal with them?

252
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:52,400
I...

253
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,920
I told them

254
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,200
about my project.

255
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,040
I told you you can do it.

256
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:05,800
Let me do it.

257
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,560
It's okay.

258
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,119
Okay?

259
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:07,760
Okay.

260
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:08,760
It's okay.

261
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,240
I'll bring you whatever you drop.

262
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,680
I'll hold it for you. No need.

263
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,480
Are you okay?

264
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,240
Yes.

265
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,079
Yes.

266
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,560
Thank you

267
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,359
these days.

268
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,440
Don't mention it.

269
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,560
That's what I should do.

270
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,359
It's okay. Did you quarrel with your wife?

271
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:23,240
You can move in anytime.

272
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:24,680
Stinky mouth.

273
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,200
What are you arguing about?

274
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,200
I'm here to play with you.

275
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:28,680
Right?

276
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,640
Fine.

277
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,360
By the way,

278
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:32,680
What?

279
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,360
Did you leave something?

280
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:34,800
No.

281
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,640
Something big.

282
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,560
Next month, next month.

283
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,440
Let's have fun together.

284
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,560
Congratulations

285
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,360
Thank you.

286
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,240
It's nice.

287
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,680
That's great.

288
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,120
Let me treat you to dinner tonight.

289
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,360
Not tonight.

290
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,480
I...

291
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,640
with my mother-in-law tonight.

292
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,320
Okay, let's go.

293
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,000
Let's go.

294
00:17:59,080 --> 00:17:59,560
I'm leaving.

295
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,240
See you off.

296
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,320
The car is here, right?

297
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,240
Here we are.

298
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,880
Alright, see you.

299
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:08,800
Okay.

300
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,440
Don't come here again.

301
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,560
Stinky mouth.

302
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:12,800
I mean

303
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,240
don't quarrel with your wife.

304
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,080
No.

305
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,200
Don't fight.

306
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,440
You can do it alone.

307
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:17,880
Sure.

308
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:18,360
Okay.

309
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:18,760
Give it to me.

310
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,320
Be careful.

311
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:19,920
Please.

312
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:20,440
Bye.

313
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,080
Bye.

314
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:22,440
Greasy.

315
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,000
Bye. Bye.

316
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:23,320
Bye.

317
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,680
Okay, let's go if he doesn't go.

318
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,440
Let's have a meal.

319
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,520
I'm going to ask Kiki out for dinner.

320
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,640
Well, let's go.

321
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,800
I'll get changed and go back to the office.

322
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,120
Hurry up.

323
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,720
Hello, Dr Xu.

324
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,760
I'm Yan Yunyun.

325
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:00,560
The girl

326
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,720
who had a steel accident with you.

327
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,520
Hello, I'm Xu Chengyuan.

328
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,880
Just call me Yuan.

329
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,440
I've always wanted to thank you.

330
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,080
How's your recovery?

331
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,600
Not bad.

332
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,960
I just look scary.

333
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,640
but it didn't hurt the vital part.

334
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,840
I'm recovering well.

335
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:23,760
What about you?

336
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,840
may not recover as fast as you.

337
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,240
I don't usually exercise.

338
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,680
The defendant Qi Xuejun

339
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,720
violated the Traffic Code of the People’s Republic of China.

340
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,480
Drunk driving car on the road

341
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:13,040
It's considered a dangerous driving crime.

342
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,840
The crime that the public prosecution accused is clear.

343
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,280
The evidence is sufficient. The charge is established.

344
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,040
According to the forensic analysis,

345
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,640
the defendant Qi Xuejun

346
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,480
has long been addicted to alcohol.

347
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,840
When the disease occurred, he had some sort of mental hallucinations.

348
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,760
It's subjective and malignant.

349
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,360
And he pleaded guilty after he was found guilty.

350
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,840
and repent.

351
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,600
and actively compensate and look for medical resources.

352
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,920
to do the best to save the injured

353
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,520
and get forgiveness from his family.

354
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,880
I will be lenient with you.

355
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,280
The verdict is as follows.

356
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,560
The defendant Qi Xuejun will be sentenced to one year in prison.

357
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,920
Immediately executed.

358
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,200
I should have kept an eye on him.

359
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,320
It's all my fault.

360
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,480
If he does well,

361
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,440
his sentence will be reduced.

362
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:58,680
Aunt, don't be too sad.

363
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,240
Dr. Qi

364
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:04,720
I'm sorry.

365
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,960
I'm really sorry.

366
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:08,720
After what happened,

367
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,080
your family won't hide from it.

368
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,080
to compensate.

369
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,200
We all know

370
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,600
all of this.

371
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,480
Thank you for forgiving my dad.

372
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,080
Thank you.

373
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,320
Speaking of understanding,

374
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,480
for the sake of Dr. Zhang.

375
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,080
Are you talking about Dr. Zhang Chi?

376
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:23,960
Don't you know?

377
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,840
Dr. Zhang apologized to us repeatedly.

378
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,040
He even contacted my brother

379
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,840
Professor Guo, the director of Yanxi Hospital.

380
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,320
to save my brother.

381
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,200
If not,

382
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,320
I won't forgive Qi Xuejun.

383
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:38,840
Yes.

384
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:39,880
If Dr. Zhang

385
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,400
contacted the chief surgeon of the Western Courtyard,

386
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,560
My sister has issued a critical notice

387
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,760
I'm really grateful to him.

388
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,480
Dr Zhang calls me every day

389
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,880
to ask about my husband's condition.

390
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,280
We were really touched.

391
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,960
He even gave my husband's film

392
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,720
to some experts in hospitals.

393
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,720
and finally decided on the consultation plan.

394
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,360
Thanks to him, my husband recovered.

395
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:12,560
Here.

396
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,080
Leave the paper with you.

397
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,480
No, I have it.

398
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,040
Do you have time?

399
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,320
I want to talk to you.

400
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,840
Sister Qi

401
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,840
There's a new comer. Let's go and have a look.

402
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:30,960
Let's go.

403
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,080
Chi, come with us.

404
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,560
Clean up the table.

405
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,200
Mr. Lu.

406
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,320
Sit down, Zhang Chi.

407
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,600
OK, everyone is here.

408
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,840
Let me introduce you two.

409
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,240
Chen Da.

410
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,680
Harbin Medical University, 008401.

411
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,080
from Harbin Medical University.

412
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,560
Li Huo Huo.

413
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,200
graduated from Tianjin Medical University.

414
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,480
From now on,

415
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,440
officially joining our emergency center.

416
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,920
Welcome.

417
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,720
Welcome

418
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,680
Hello, everyone. I'm Zhang Chi.

419
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,840
the new emergency doctor.

420
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,320
Let him join me.

421
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,080
Do your work first.

422
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,960
Or I'll kick you out

423
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,160
or I'll kick you out.

424
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:19,680
Qi Tuo

425
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:21,640
You take Chen Da.

426
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,280
Okay.

427
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,000
Zhang Chi.

428
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:25,520
Take Li Huo.

429
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,200
I have an important task for you.

430
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,520
Take him out before you leave.

431
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,280
Do you hear me?

432
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:32,720
010120.

433
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,160
Okay.

434
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,040
Got it.

435
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:38,680
Chen Da.

436
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,920
Just sit there.

437
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,800
0106 Train Team.

438
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,320
There are many rear-end collisions near Lincheng University.

439
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,280
There's a severely injured patient. Please go there immediately.

440
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,760
0112 Zhang Chi-car Team.

441
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,640
Chenwei holiday hotel, Chaofeng District.

442
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,240
A woman attempted to jump from the rooftop of the building.

443
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,280
[Please go to the scene immediately.]

444
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:41,440
Sir.

445
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:42,760
We're from 120.

446
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:43,680
What's going on?

447
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,040
Girls are not in a stable mood now.

448
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,560
Our people and firefighters

449
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,400
have gone up.

450
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,680
Xianbing, Xianbing, what's going on?

451
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,040
Her mood is unstable now.

452
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,280
She could jump off anytime. 4577.

453
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,400
Try to comfort him.

454
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,080
It's only been seven minutes.

455
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,200
Ming is amazing

456
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,840
Yeah, thanks to Ming.

457
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,040
and the two car owners.

458
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,760
Now everyone is getting more and more elegant

459
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,520
Dr. Qi

460
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,040
The machine shows that the patient's family hasn't paid yet.

461
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,440
Did you see her family?

462
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,000
Her family is

463
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:19,840
a very little kid.

464
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,480
I'll go and ask

465
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,360
if there's anyone else in her house.

466
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,000
Okay, Dr Qi

467
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,200
I'll tell you later

468
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,920
Kid, do you remember my phone number?

469
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,360
My mom is sick.

470
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,360
Tell him

471
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,280
to come to the hospital to take care of you and your mom.

472
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,520
No dad.

473
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,560
There's only me and my mom at home.

474
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,680
Uncle, you're amazing.

475
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,360
That lady is amazing too.

476
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,280
Thank you for saving my mom.

477
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,760
My mom is sick.

478
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,040
Do you need to pay?

479
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,040
I need to pay.

480
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,040
My mom has money on her phone.

481
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,200
She can't pay until she wakes up.

482
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,560
Can I pay you with my pocket money?

483
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,520
I don't charge you.

484
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,480
You have to pay the hospital.

485
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,360
I see.

486
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,200
Here, this is my favorite chocolate.

487
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,200
Milk flavor.

488
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,080
This is for you.

489
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,680
Okay.

490
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,080
I don't think you like chocolate.

491
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:28,800
Jelly.

492
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:38,680
Biscuit.

493
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,280
Isn't this Ma Bo-ri?

494
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,480
So cute.

495
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,040
She's my best friend.

496
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,680
Uncle, do you like all these?

497
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,960
You give all these

498
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,080
to me.

499
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,560
Are you willing?

500
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,360
Yes.

501
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,920
But my mom said

502
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,840
we should thank those who helped us.

503
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,480
I like this.

504
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:33,720
Thank you.

505
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,520
Really? That's great.

506
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,280
Uncle, my mom said

507
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,200
when you're in danger,

508
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,960
let me take this out.

509
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,360
See if it's enough.

510
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,920
Good job.

511
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,040
There's no rush.

512
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,680
We'll talk after mom wakes up.

513
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,280
Here, put this away.

514
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,440
I'll take you to your mom.

515
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,800
I'll call you later.

516
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:15,760
What's the matter?

517
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,760
can you call me directly?

518
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:19,920
Here.

519
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:21,200
Come on.

520
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:22,280
Let's go.

521
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,040
But

522
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,800
Ming has pasted it several times.

523
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,840
It's quite a year

524
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,280
050035 is right.

525
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,760
But those patients can't remember the driver.

526
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,720
They can only remember doctors.

527
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,720
But they don't know

528
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,240
The driver is a doctor too.

529
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:55,760
Let's go.

530
00:31:59,240 --> 00:31:59,760
Ming.

531
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,240
We'll wait for you in the car.

532
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:01,920
Okay.

533
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,360
Thank you, Chi.

534
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:27,320
Bye.

535
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,280
I'm leaving.

536
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,040
Rest early.

537
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:29,720
Master.

538
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,840
How do you feel on your first day?

539
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,240
Master, I just have one feeling.

540
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,680
I think you're amazing.

541
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:38,560
I have to learn from you.

542
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,280
Sister Qi is back.

543
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,120
Did it go well?

544
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:41,760
Yes.

545
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,760
Chen Da did very well on his first day.

546
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,040
You know what? We saved a person who jumped off the building today.

547
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:46,720
It's very exciting.

548
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:47,400
Dong, emergency.

549
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,080
That girl is so pretty.

550
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,280
She has bright eyes.

551
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,200
staring at you.

552
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,280
Okay.

553
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,480
Will the sun really come out?

554
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,440
Yes, I will.

555
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,040
Why did you save me?

556
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:09,000
It was so dangerous.

557
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,480
but you still let them stop.

558
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,000
You comforted me and told me to hold on.

559
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,719
Wait, wait. What's wrong?

560
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,199
Sir.

561
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,639
What’s your name?

562
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:26,600
Yan... Yan Yunyun.

563
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,800
Yunyun, don’t worry.

564
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:31,840
Don’t be nervous.

565
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,360
These two doctors

566
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:36,320
are the best doctors in our center.

567
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,280
We have to trust them.

568
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,040
We have to believe in fire.

569
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:53,159
I was so scared.

570
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:55,840
I couldn't help thinking

571
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,000
if I would die like this.

572
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,200
Your words kept supporting me.

573
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,640
and kept me going.

574
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:05,480
So...

575
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,520
thank you for saving me.

576
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,840
Because I'm an emergency doctor.

577
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,880
He will save you

578
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,000
will save you.

579
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,280
Because this is our duty.

580
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,800
Then why did you ask me to see the sunrise?

581
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,160
To see the sunrise?

582
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:34,880
because of me.

583
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,800
I came here

584
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,520
I came here with my friends.

585
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,280
I think it's beautiful here. Look.

586
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,560
Isn't it beautiful?

587
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,800
So I want to share it with you.

588
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:07,880
Look.

589
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,640
The sun is out

590
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,160
What's wrong?

591
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,720
Does your heart hurt?

592
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:27,720
My heart hurts.

593
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,880
Let's go to the hospital.

594
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:31,720
Let me help you up.

595
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Jiangdong City Weather Station.

596
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,560
At 12:14 today,

597
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,160
continue to release the yellow warning signal of thunder and lightning.

598
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,720
[It's estimated to take eight hours.]

599
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,920
[there will be a strong landslide]

600
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,520
[there will still be strong landing.]

601
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,280
Please be careful of

602
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,800
flood, mudslides, mountain slides,

603
00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:00,000
landslides, flood and other natural disasters.

604
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:03,080
The masses need to strengthen geological disasters like this.

605
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,440
[to prevent traffic travel.]

606
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,160
Time for breakfast. I bought a lot.

607
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:12,800
Sister Qi, you're so nice.

608
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,720
Thank you, Sister Qi.

609
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,640
I love you so much.

610
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:16,920
Thank you, Sister Qi.

611
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:17,800
Bring me a bun.

612
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:18,880
Big buns.

613
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:19,920
Chi, aren't you eating?

614
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:20,720
I have.

615
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:21,960
Thank you.

616
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,080
Thank you, Qi.

617
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:25,560
Where is Xu Chengyuan?

618
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,960
He took a leave. He went on a blind date.

619
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:29,280
A blind date?

620
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:29,680
Yes.

621
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,960
Why did you ask for leave for a blind date?

622
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:31,840
He's out of town.

623
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:32,960
It's a blind date now.

624
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,840
I'm telling you, men and women don't know the opposite side.

625
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:35,800
Will they be cheated?

626
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,680
No, it's true. Stop laughing.

627
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,440
Zheng Bo.

628
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,400
Wrong number.

629
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,400
Call Xu Chengyuan.

630
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,440
Xu Chengyuan! Xu Chengyuan! Xu Chengyuan!

631
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:42,400
Got it.

632
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:45,920
Hurry up.

633
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,800
How about changing an apple?

634
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,720
This is all color on your nails.

635
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:54,960
It's okay.

636
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,840
Orange has many vitamins.

637
00:37:58,720 --> 00:37:59,680
Who called me?

638
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:00,960
My master.

639
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,960
went on a blind date, right?

640
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,680
Yuan, don't be fooled.

641
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,120
Don't transfer the money. Is it a man or a woman?

642
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:09,920
How is it, Xu?

643
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,800
How was your blind date?

644
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:13,120
Why are you so gossipy? I'm fine.

645
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,280
I don't believe it.

646
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,960
Did the girl not like you

647
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,640
and you're not in the mood to work?

648
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:18,560
That's right.

649
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,360
Thank you for your concern for Yuan.

650
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,560
When we

651
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,840
when we come back.

652
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,800
Sorry to bother you.

653
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,840
Yuan, bring sister-in-law back

654
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:38,920
Treat us to dinner.

655
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:43,120
All you care about is eating.

656
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,120
Go back to your work.

657
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:45,400
Bye.

658
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,720
Yuan is really getting a girlfriend.

659
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,440
It's really a blind date.

660
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,520
0104577

661
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:07,440
Thank you.

662
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,240
It's nothing.

663
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,120
If it weren't for me,

664
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,240
you wouldn't be lying here.

665
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:15,640
Don't say that.

666
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:16,800
If it weren't for you,

667
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,160
I would have died long ago.

668
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,000
Luckily, you sent me to the hospital.

669
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:21,840
But...

670
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:22,920
No buts.

671
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:23,960
The doctor said

672
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,280
I'm fine.

673
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,400
I'm just too tired.

674
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,400
By the way,

675
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:32,120
although you got hurt lighter than me in this accident,

676
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,840
but you need to take care of yourself.

677
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:34,520
You know?

678
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,160
Well,

679
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,080
What about your work?

680
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:44,960
Just keep working for now.

681
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,680
If it doesn't work, I'll quit.

682
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,160
I'm not the only one in the ER anyway.

683
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,400
You can still turn without me.

684
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,680
Don't feel pressured.

685
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,000
Should I go buy breakfast now?

686
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,000
What do you want to eat?

687
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,800
Okay, I'll buy what you like.

688
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,640
Soy milk and fried dough sticks.

689
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:05,520
Okay.

690
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:06,840
Add some vinegar meat for me.

691
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:07,240
Okay.

692
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,680
I'll peel it for you later.

693
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:11,560
Wait a minute.

694
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:12,680
I'll be right back.

695
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,840
Take it easy.

696
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,640
So beautiful.

697
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,120
Here we are.

698
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:28,160
Hello

699
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,320

Okay?

Let's give him a round of applause.

716
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:20,440
Hello.

I'll stop filming.

722
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:29,680
How can I live without you?

Come on. Let me teach you.

725
