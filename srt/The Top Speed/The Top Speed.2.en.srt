You didn't reply my messages.

00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,320
Wait, Qiqi.

56
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,440
Go back now.

57
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:36,760
I...

58
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,320
Are you done?

59
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,480
Okay, sister.

60
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,560
Go back now.

61
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:40,600

62
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:43,800

63
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:44,760
Qi.

64
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,000
This way.

65
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,400
Mr. Bai has been lying here.

66
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,440
so we didn't dare to touch him.

67
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,560
Here, doctor, take a look.

68
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,160
He's moved this time.

69
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,240
He's lying on the floor.

70
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,040
Which hospital do you want to go today?

71
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,000
Mr. Lin, can you hear me?

72
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:15,960
We...

73
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,519
Mr. Lin.

74
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,720
The pupil reflex is a bit slow.

75
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,720
It's a bit slow.

76
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,680
Mr. Lin, can you hear me?

77
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,160
When did you faint?

78
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,159
It's been half an hour

79
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,000
The temperature is a bit high. 38 degrees.

80
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:34,960
Take your blood sugar. Up.

81
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,280
Half an hour, right?

82
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:38,840
Yes.

83
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,720
Mr. Lin. Mr. Lin.

84
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,880
His rhythm is not in sync.

85
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,560
Blood pressure is normal.

86
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,720
What's his blood sugar?

87
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,000
Wait.

88
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:49,400
7.5 is a bit high.

89
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:53,440
I suspect a cerebral vessel accident.

90
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,520
Check my legs.

91
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,600
Is it also Qingzi?

92
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,040
There's a purple on his ankle.

93
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,520
Is this his first time fainting?

94
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,280
He fainted several times.

95
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,560
But he woke up every time.

96
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:03,680
010.

97
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,160
He has a fever and Leno symptoms.

98
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,280
and fainted.

99
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,760
I suspect it's a heart tumor.

100
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:09,840
Send it to the north of the city.

101
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:10,880
Northern city Yellow Stretcher

102
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,600
Hurry up

103
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,600
Ming, stretcher, hurry

104
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,440
Hurry up, stretcher

105
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,720
Hurry up.

106
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,520
Get the oxygen ready. Okay.

107
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,400
Hurry up.

108
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:24,840
Xiao Qiu, hurry up.

109
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,280
Come on.

110
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:26,880
Dr. Xiao.

111
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,760
Dr. Xiao, you're here.

112
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,680
I suspect it's left cardiovascular tumor.

113
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,720
Arrange an examination.

114
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,400
This tumor is very unstable.

115
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,280
It may fall at any time.

116
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,159
Okay. I've informed Cardiothoracic Surgery.

117
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:36,840
They'll send someone right away.

118
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,680
Great!

119
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,560
He's in a hurry.

120
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,159
Zhang Chi, did you really go to 120?

121
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,120
Aren't you suspended?

122
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,159
Dr. Wu.

123
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,120
Don't do CPR unless necessary.

124
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:45,320
in case the tumor breaks.

125
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,400
Forget it. I'll go with you.

126
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,000
Zhang Chi.

127
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,240
Dr. Xiao, hurry up.

128
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,320
Hurry, push it in.

129
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,159
Hurry up. Walk faster.

130
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,159
You can go back

131
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:56,280
and then you can go back.

132
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,520
We have to clear our duties.

133
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,720
Your emergency work

134
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,720
is done.

135
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,240
What about the treatment?

136
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,120
Leave it to us.

137
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,440
Let's do our job.

138
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,600
He's right.

139
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,280
We sent it to the patient.

140
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,560
Our work is done.

141
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,120
Mr. Lin's condition is really complicated.

142
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,320
I'm worried that he might be in danger.

143
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,240
I understand.

144
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,160
We still have another group of patients

145
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:29,960
waiting for us.

146
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,320
Recognize the work scope.

147
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,720
and follow the rules and regulations.

148
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,440
It's something you should do

149
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,720
you should do, right?

150
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,240
Let's go.

151
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,520
Come in.

152
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,240
Secretary.

153
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,360
You want to see me?

154
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,360
I have two books for you.

155
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,400
Emergency Medicine.

156
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,520
This is a good book.

157
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,960
It has made hundreds of cases.

158
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,080
and provided many

159
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,640
distinguished diagnosis technology.

160
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,640
It's very practical.

161
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,320
Many real cases

162
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,040
were compiled by your father.

163
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,520
I'm a student of your mother.

164
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,000
He took care of me.

165
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,520
I should take care of you now.

166
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,440
How does it feel to work at the emergency center?

167
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,840
To be honest,

168
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,840
I don't think this job suits me.

169
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:52,720
What do you mean?

170
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,960
I was a cardiac surgeon.

171
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,920
what touched me the most

172
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,920
is that I often get in contact with difficult diseases

173
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,480
and solve their problems

174
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,400
through their own efforts.

175
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,280
Here.

176
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,840
I often encounter severe cases.

177
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,320
But

178
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,280
it's just a minor illness.

179
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,120
I think the reason you came with me

180
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,000
from me.

181
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,240
I wish I were still in the Cardiac Surgery.

182
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,000
Is saving people in cardiac surgery the only way to be saved?

183
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,800
You found it in time today.

184
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,680
Mr. Lin's illness

185
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,680
And send him to the corresponding hospital immediately.

186
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,440
This process is not called saving.

187
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,680
No.

188
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,880
Chi, the hospital treatment is important,

189
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,440
but emergency treatment

190
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,360
is also an important part.

191
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,799
Don't forget

192
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,000
In the emergency center,

193
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,679
This is closer to death.

194
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:44,000
What about a person?

195
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
No matter what he does,

196
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,840
or what social status he is,

197
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,400
are ordinary people.

198
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,320
As long as you have

199
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,640
your work,

200
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,520
you can become a glowing body.

201
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,640
instead of

202
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,200
a special job.

203
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,440
I know what you're thinking.

204
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,000
But I have something to tell you.

205
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,520
At this stage,

206
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:09,200
Don't ask about the future if you do good things.

207
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,480
Qiu, prepare some supplements.

208
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,200
Dr. Qi.

209
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,760
Can I have a word with you?

210
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,360
Go ahead.

211
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:44,880
Well...

212
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,440
I know I still have a lot to learn

213
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,040
in the hospital.

214
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,000
But in the future,

215
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,480
can you leave me

216
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,440
can you leave it to me?

217
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,320
Let me show my specialty.

218
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,760
Dr. Zhang is positive about work.

219
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,880
That's commendable.

220
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,200
Sure, I'll try my best to cooperate with you.

221
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,920
But you must abide by the rules.

222
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,200
Especially the person in charge of this car.

223
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,200
That's my order.

224
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:05,600
Okay?

225
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,200
No problem.

226
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,760
We're here. Wait a minute.

227
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:08,640
We're here, right?

228
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,480
Okay, thank you.

229
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,320
Well, Dr. Qi,

230
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,880
What's your coffee flavor?

231
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,160
I bought coffee.

232
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,800
Don't drink coffee.

233
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,480
I'm working the night shift.

234
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,720
Isn't coffee refreshing?

235
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,480
Why don't you go to the toilet?

236
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,720
There are more patients at night than during the day.

237
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,760
You're full of coffee.

238
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,440
I have to take you to the toilet. I'm crazy.

239
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,600
We didn't get out of the car.

240
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,040
What's wrong with drinking coffee?

241
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,600
Do you know when you're leaving?

242
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,000
Do you know when you'll go to the toilet?

243
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:33,880
Don't drink.

244
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,320
Return or drink after work.

245
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,320
You're even drinking coffee.

246
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,920
You're making trouble.

247
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,640
What's wrong with you?

248
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,840
Mr. Lin.

249
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,440
Dr. Xianbing.

250
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,760
Why are you here?

251
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,640
I came to see you.

252
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:17,760
How do you feel?

253
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,080
Do you feel uncomfortable?

254
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:19,760
It's good.

255
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,240
Are you checking the rooms?

256
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,840
Don't worry. I won't die.

257
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,080
I heard

258
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,440
you don't agree to inform your son to visit you.

259
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,520
Why should I?

260
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,000
I have medical insurance and pension.

261
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,640
and signed the exemption letter.

262
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:34,880
By then,

263
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,320
I'll lie on the operating table.

264
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,440
If I can't save him,

265
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,640
it means God wants me.

266
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,440
This is fate.

267
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,120
It's none of your business.

268
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,240
Didn't you

269
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,840
wanted your son to visit you?

270
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,520
He's really hospitalized this time.

271
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,840
Why don't you want him to come?

272
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,960
I used to pretend to be sick.

273
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,560
I just wanted my son

274
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,000
to chat with me more.

275
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,520
He's really sick now.

276
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,760
I don't want to be his burden.

277
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,960
By the way, Dr. Xianbing,

278
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,760
I need to apologize to you.

279
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:07,960
For what?

280
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,760
I really didn't expect

281
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,200
In just a few seconds,

282
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,560
in just a few seconds.

283
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,440
and got such a serious illness.

284
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,120
In the past,

285
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,680
I called 120 a lot.

286
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,560
I don't know how much trouble I've caused you.

287
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,000
and caused you so much trouble.

288
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,000
I've been thinking these days

289
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,120
if it's really because of me,

290
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,320
because of me,

291
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,120
I'll be in big trouble.

292
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,840
I really have to apologize to you.

293
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,640
No, no, no.

294
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,400
Mr. Lin, how about this?

295
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,640
You can call me

296
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,680
you can call me.

297
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,080
I'll talk to you, okay?

298
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,120
You said that.

299
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:43,640
I did.

300
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,840
I'll really hit you then.

301
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,640
Really?

302
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,640
Bed 20, Lin Guangwen.

303
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,080
Dr Zhang, you're here.

304
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,080
Injection, right?

305
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,680
Mr. Lin, the injection.

306
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:53,960
OK, Director.

307
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,040
Zhang Chi.

308
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,600
Why are you here?

309
00:12:59,200 --> 00:12:59,800
Dr. Wu.

310
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:00,720
Zhang Chi.

311
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:02,680
Director.

312
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,080
Mr. Lin.

313
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,920
I have something to say to the director.

314
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,720
Go ahead.

315
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,040
Director, I didn't expect to meet you.

316
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,360
Chi,

317
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,520
was sent here by you, right?

318
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:20,360
Yes.

319
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,160
How is Mr. Lin's test result?

320
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:24,960
Look.

321
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,040
Director, I'm not a cardiac surgeon now.

322
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,280
I'm at 120.

323
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,160
It's not appropriate.

324
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,080
Enough.

325
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,160
I know what you're thinking.

326
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,160
Let me tell you.

327
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,960
It's just a transfer and suspension.

328
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,160
As a consultant,

329
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,840
and help them to diagnose difficult diseases.

330
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,720
It’s approved.

331
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,040
Mr. Dai.

332
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,080
Zhang Chi is no longer a member of our department.

333
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,920
It’s inappropriate to show him the patient’s information.

334
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,640
Besides, it's not good for us if this gets out.

335
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,480
Dr. Wu

336
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,280
The surgery of Lin Guangwen

337
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,840
is very difficult.

338
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,840
We discussed

339
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,480
in the consultation,

340
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,520
but they are not ideal.

341
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,640
What we all agree now is

342
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,600
to have the operation immediately.

343
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:17,720
Director, how about

344
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,720
the plan today?

345
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,840
Dr. Wu, calm down.

346
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,320
Just listen to Dr. Zhang.

347
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,400
Tell me.

348
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,080
Director,

349
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,320
Mr. Lin called 120 before.

350
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:34,160
I sent him to our hospital.

351
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,520
Dr. Xiao said he was fine.

352
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,520
But I just saw the results.

353
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,720
the other three organs

354
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,720
Why is there such a big problem?

355
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,720
Yes, Dr. Xiao told me

356
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,520
his blood pressure was low when he came in.

357
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,400
He had a low fever.

358
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,000
After communicating with his family,

359
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,720
I didn't give him a full examination.

360
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,720
Now it seems

361
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,520
he has a big problem.

362
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,840
So I suggest

363
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,400
adjust yourself first.

364
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,600
Eliminate the risk of surgery.

365
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,760
After discussing the surgery with the patient,

366
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,160
I'll think about it after I confirm it.

367
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,520
I think

368
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,160
Dr. Zhang, your opinion

369
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,080
Our department will take it seriously later.

370
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,920
Director, I'll leave you to it.

371
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:16,840
I'll visit you next time.

372
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,400
Okay.

373
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,200
Dr. Wu, what else do you want?

374
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:30,920
Director.

375
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,640
Lin Guangwen.

376
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,080
I'm his doctor.

377
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,720
I know him best.

378
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,040
Please trust me.

379
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,400
0106 Train Team.

380
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,840
at Chao'an Apartment bus stop.

381
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,240
A man had chest tightness, breathing difficulty,

382
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,000
Excuse me.

383
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,240
Who called 120?

384
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,000
It's me.

385
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,880
What's wrong?

386
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,560
I have arrhythmia.

387
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,960
I just took a quick heart-saving pill.

388
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,800
Let me check it for you.

389
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:16,920
I'm much better now.

390
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,200
Isn't this brother-in-law?

391
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,560
Qi Qi.

392
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,160
What a coincidence.

393
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,920
It's okay. I feel better now.

394
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:25,680
I'm fine now.

395
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,840
Thank you.

396
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,160
Go to the hospital if you're sick.

397
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,480
Why are you running around?

398
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,720
I'm running around.

399
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,800
I was sick and insisted on going out.

400
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,240
to see you.

401
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,600
I don't know why.

402
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,000
I want to see my girlfriend.

403
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:39,720
to meet my girlfriend.

404
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,600
If it weren't for my heart, I would have called an ambulance.

405
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,760
you were the one who drove.

406
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,640
I can't even say these words to you.

407
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,920
We meet every week.

408
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,560
Yes, we meet once a week.

409
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,080
It's like a routine.

410
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,200
In your heart,

411
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,040
in your heart.

412
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,320
Your parents ranked second.

413
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,680
But what about me?

414
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,599
You never cared about me.

415
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,520
In your heart,

416
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,000
I'm the least important one.

417
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,000
Can you stop? Let's talk at home, okay?

418
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:10,800
Not enough.

419
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,680
Actually, you don't understand

420
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,880
what love and marriage is.

421
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,520
A relationship needs management.

422
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,760
We need to compromise and help each other.

423
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,040
I can’t solve

424
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:25,319
by myself.

425
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,800
I've figured it out.

426
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,840
I don't want to make things difficult for myself anymore.

427
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,920
Don't make it hard for yourself.

428
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,440
Let's forget it.

429
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:46,680
To be honest,

430
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,200
you're not gifted

431
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,920
in being someone else's girlfriend.

432
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,080
If you don't feel well,

433
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,520
we'll take you to the hospital.

434
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,000
No need.

435
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,480
No need to go.

436
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:16,960
Let's go.

437
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:32,680
Jiang A, 35798.

438
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,240
In your heart,

439
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,800
in your heart.

440
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,160
But what about me?

441
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,800
You don't know

442
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,320
what love and marriage is.

443
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,920
A relationship needs management.

444
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,080
We need to compromise and help each other.

445
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,800
Let's forget it.

446
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,280
008401.

447
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,480
I've asked Mr. Lu.

448
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,480
Qi Qi didn't ask for leave.

449
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,480
What happened then?

450
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:30,880
This is Sister Qi.

451
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,720
for seven years.

452
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,720
She's so sad.

453
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,120
Let alone seven years,

454
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,720
I dated my girlfriend for seven days.

455
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,520
I've been crying for a month.

456
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,720
Enough. Stop talking nonsense.

457
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,600
Fang Qi has gone too far.

458
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,120
I must avenge my master.

459
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,240
Coming.

460
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:45,760
Morning.

461
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,880
Good morning, master.

462
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:56,720
How about this?

463
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,320
invite Sister Qi to dinner tonight?

464
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,320
Relax, right?

465
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,600
What is it?

466
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,080
Nothing.

467
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,760
Master,

468
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,640
We're thinking

469
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,640
we haven't had dinner together for a long time.

470
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,480
Let's go together tonight.

471
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,080
Do you want to go?

472
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:19,720
Together?

473
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,880
Qi Qi, you look good today.

474
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,520
How bad do I look?

475
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,120
No, I look good.

476
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:31,840
Let our team

477
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:32,640
Hurry up

478
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,400
Yangyang don't be afraid

479
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,360
Yangyang, hang in there

480
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,120
Yangyang it's okay

481
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,320
Yangyang, hang in there

482
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,000
What happened?

483
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
A severe brain injury.

484
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,600
There might be other organs damage.

485
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,120
I suggest we send him to the ER.

486
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:45,840
Emergency OR.

487
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,320
Qiu-yi. Huang-yi.

488
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:50,880
Give it to me.

489
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,600
Tell Ming to put the car here first.

490
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,120
Sorry, family members can't go in

491
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,960
Yangyang

492
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,240
Yangyang

493
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:18,480
Doctor

494
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,240
Doctor! Doctor! Our baby!

495
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,240
I'm sorry.

496
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,400
The child's brain is severely damaged.

497
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,320
Now his pupils are wide and fixed.

498
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,760
He's brain dead.

499
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,480
It's impossible, Doctor. It's impossible.

500
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,360
Please save him.

501
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,760
That's impossible.

502
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:34,120
According to medical observation,

503
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:34,760
according to medical observation,

504
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,640
How many organs did the child have?

505
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,480
His heart may stop beating anytime.

506
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,120
What do you mean?

507
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,000
The child may die anytime.

508
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,360
Doctor.

509
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,080
Please save him.

510
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,000
My son

511
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:18,600
Mr. Yang

512
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,640
What's your son's blood type?

513
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,600
BB, B, Doctor.

514
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,400
Is my son still alive, doctor?

515
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,480
Is there any way

516
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,600
to save my son?

517
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,080
I'm on my knees.

518
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:29,880
Don't do this.

519
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,000
Doctor, please save him.

520
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,240
Don't do this.

521
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,120
No one wants to see

522
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,320
No one wants to see

523
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,400
I...

524
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,720
I know what I said

525
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,520
may have violated relevant rules.

526
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,520
But time waits for no one.

527
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,760
I have to say it.

528
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,920
Let me give you an example.

529
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:54,720
Some kids

530
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,240
are about the same age as your son.

531
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:56,760
Zhang Chi.

532
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,880
They have very serious congenital heart disease.

533
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,840
They've been waiting for the heart matching for years.

534
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,120
Do you know what you're talking about?

535
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,400
Are you willing to donate the baby's heart?

536
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,880
Mr. Yang, calm down

537
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,000
Calm down

538
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:08,720
I'm sorry.

539
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:09,520
Stop it.

540
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,720
My son is in trouble.

541
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:11,880
Why don't you save him?

542
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,320
Stop talking.

543
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,400
You still want his heart?

544
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:13,960
Come here.

545
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,600
You're not human.

546
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,240
If you donate your heart,

547
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,240
you can save another person's life.

548
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,080
Zhang Chi.

549
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,400
I know it's hard for you

550
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,720
to say this now.

551
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,720
Come here.

552
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,200
Do you know what you are doing?

553
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,840
Negotiate with the family.

554
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,680
It's about the organ donor.

555
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,040
What are you doing?

556
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,280
Too many patients are struggling on the death line.

557
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:46,960
They can't wait.

558
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,040
What kind of situation is this?

559
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,680
What are they going through?

560
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,560
I don't want Yangyang to be like this today.

561
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,280
Have you ever thought about

562
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,680
what their parents are thinking?

563
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,040
Have you considered their feelings?

564
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,320
You broke the rules, you know?

565
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,920
I'll admit it if you can save people.

566
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,960
Zhang Chi, you think too highly of yourself.

567
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,800
I'm your teaching teacher.

568
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,440
I'll report everything you did today.

569
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,080
Do you hear me?

570
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,160
Just report it.

571
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,560
I'll bear all the consequences.

572
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,560
With one more donor,

573
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,960
the more hope they can live.

574
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,200
Like Dan Dan.

575
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,280
Look. I'm going to the zoo with my mom.

576
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:30,840
Let me see.

577
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,760
This is a good painting.

578
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,320
Dan Dan.

579
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,320
When you get discharged,

580
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,680
I'll take you and mom

581
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,840
to the real zoo.

582
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,080
and see real animals?

583
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,160
Maybe I can't go.

584
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,040
Why not?

585
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:57,840
Dr Zhang.

586
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,800
I know I'm dying.

587
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:06,080
Dr Zhang, I'm not afraid of death.

588
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,320
I just hope

589
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,080
to be my mom's child.

590
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,320
I hope

591
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,760
I can be a healthy child.

592
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,920
and stay with my mom.

593
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,920
Then Mom won't cry for my illness.

594
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,080
When I first met Dan Dan,

595
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:21,760
she was two years old.

596
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,200
She waited for a suitable heart.

597
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,000
for three years.

598
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,000
In order to cure her,

599
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,840
in order to cure her.

600
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,000
A year and a half ago,

601
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,000
her dad ran away secretly.

602
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:39,000
Three years, her mother added a bed.

603
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,880
I don't want to.

604
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,600
She slept on the floor every day.

605
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,480
People in our hospital couldn't stand it and persuaded her.

606
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,080
She said, "Forget it if you want."

607
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,360
Don't lose your money in the end.

608
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,840
Do you know what her mother said?

609
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,640
Her mother kneeled and begged the director

610
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,840
she would never give up until the last moment.

611
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,520
She always says

612
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Doctors should do their best.

613
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,480
I'll do my best.

614
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:33,760
Are you coming?

615
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,400
Let's go, Chi.

616
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,640
You're back, Dr. Zhang.

617
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:25,920
I sprained my ankle.

618
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,400
No, I'm fine.

619
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,720
Why do you carry plasters with you?

620
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,800
This is what we emergency doctors need.

621
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,680
If you work for a long time,

622
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,080
your waist and legs will hurt.

623
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,680
It's convenient to prepare a pack.

624
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:44,800
Thanks.

625
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,080
You're welcome. This is the brand.

626
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:47,800
It works.

627
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:48,920
I'll send you the link.

628
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,560
Hello, are you Dr. Xianbing?

629
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,920
Mr. Lin, what's wrong?

630
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,560
The doctor said my condition is stable.

631
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,720
I can have surgery in two days.

632
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,960
Now I really want to eat some braised stew.

633
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,200
You want to eat stew now?

634
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,600
Okay, I'll think of a way.

635
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,280
Mr. Lin, just stay here.

636
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,480
No one is here.

637
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,400
This is good.

638
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,400
Don't eat too much

639
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:01,920
It tastes like this.

640
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,520
Try it.

641
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:06,760
I don't want it.

642
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,480
This fat is too high.

643
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,640
It's bad for the brain and blood vessels.

644
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,720
You can't eat too much.

645
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:11,480
Okay.

646
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,120
I've been craving this for a long time.

647
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:26,840
All right.

648
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,520
Alright.

649
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,520
Okay, the last bite.

650
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:31,600
Done.

651
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,000
I'm craving for your food.

652
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,160
I did eat the braised stew.

653
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,640
I have another wish.

654
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,520
Doctor Zhang.

655
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,240
Mr. Lin.

656
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,760
Do you know what tree that is?

657
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,000
That one.

658
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,640
I really don't know.

659
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,240
Hold on.

660
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,640
Let me check with my phone.

661
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,920
No need.

662
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,640
I asked you just now.

663
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,000
It's called thorn Tong.

664
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:03,840
The bamboo behind us is called Buddha Zhuzhu.

665
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:05,920
I know these.

666
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,400
These are rong trees.

667
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,920
Mr. Lin, you know so much.

668
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:22,640
Dr. Zhang.

669
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:23,720
Mr. Lin.

670
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,920
Can you take some photos with me over there?

671
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:28,280
Sure.

672
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,840
Right here

673
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,280
Right here.

674
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,360
Are you going to shoot standing?

675
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:40,880
Yes.

676
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:42,640
Hold it.

677
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,160
I'll move the car back.

678
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,840
Let me take a photo for you.

679
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:47,880
Okay.

680
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,040
Let's take a photo together.

681
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:54,400
Sir.

682
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,640
Excuse me, can you take a photo for us?

683
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:57,920
Thank you.

684
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:03,480
Here.

685
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,160
Wait a minute. OK.

686
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,760
One, two, three.

687
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,120
How was the surgery?

688
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,280
It's not looking good.

689
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,640
He was sutured and sent to ICU.

690
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,480
Dr. Oh is doing her best.

691
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,240
But

692
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,640
Mr. Lin asked me to take the anesthetics

693
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,720
he specifically told me

694
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,240
if he can't come down from the operating table,

695
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,240
let me give this letter

696
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,280
and these things.

697
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,120
Dr. Xianbing,

698
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,880
I can't say it

699
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,520
in front of you.

700
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,240
Let's use a letter to convey it.

701
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,880
I may look like a real man,

702
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:50,600
but I'm afraid when it comes to surgery.

703
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,680
I'm afraid I can't get down if I go up.

704
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,760
It's not that I don't want to inform my son.

705
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,600
The doctors and nurses called him,

706
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,840
but he won't pick up.

707
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,960
I told him to stop.

708
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,120
I don't want to be his burden.

709
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:10,760
But in my heart,

710
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:13,880
I really hope my son can come to see me.

711
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,400
I hope my son

712
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:19,719
when I do the surgery.

713
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,679
I'm glad you came.

714
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,400
Thank you so much.

715
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:30,679
Luoyang Bridge is our promise.

716
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:34,120
We used to go there

717
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:35,679
every few years.

718
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,120
When we were close,

719
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,679
my son said

720
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:44,120
I have to take a photo on my 70th birthday.

721
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,880
I thought I only need the last one.

722
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,719
I didn't expect it to be difficult.

723
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:54,360
Let's do it in advance.

724
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,200
If the surgery goes well,

725
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,240
Give me back my album.

726
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,240
I'll keep it.

727
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,720
If I can't come down,

728
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,440
burn the album to me.

729
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,960
I have no regrets.

730
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,240
Dr. Xianbing,

731
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:15,680
Thank you for helping me fulfill my last wish.

732
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,640
Thank you.

733
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:34,800
Dr Zhang.

734
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,320
Mr. Lin didn't make it.

735
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,120
He left this afternoon.

736
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,360
On the day of the accident,

737
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,320
why didn't you save my mom?

738
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,560
As an emergency doctor,

739
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,200
I should save those who have a glimmer of hope.

740
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,800
But you gave up on her just by looking at her.

741
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:06,920
With your ability,

742
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,720
give my mom one more minute,

743
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,560
and try your best to save her,

744
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,520
she has a slim chance of survival.

745
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:13,760
It's you.

746
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,360
didn't give her hope to live.

747
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,280
Liu, how did you

748
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,080
to work at your emergency center?

749
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,640
I know you're against the Emergency Center.

750
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,560
But I just have a suggestion.

751
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,920
You have the right to choose.

752
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,840
I don't want you to be depressed.

753
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,200
And I don't want you to lose your major.

754
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,240
001006.

755
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,040
I think

756
00:36:59,040 --> 00:36:59,480
001006

757
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,320
Come to the emergency center.

758
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:01,480
001006

can help you become a better doctor.

760
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:03,760
001006.

761
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,640
As long as you have

762
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,960
your work,

763
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,840
you can become a glowing body.

764
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,960
instead of

765
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,520
a special job.

766
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,280
Young man, let me ask you a question.

767
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,280
Which hospital is the nearest

768
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,160
Where is it?

769
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,760
You don't even know this?

770
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:54,320
00315411.

771
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,200
120?

772
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,400
Do you need an ambulance?

773
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,680
My brother passed out on the way.

774
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,120
Can you guys come and save me?

775
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,040
Where was it?

776
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,040
It's...

777
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,840
The fourth street.

778
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:31,120
The 10th Street, the 4th Street, right?

779
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,320
Fourth Street.

780
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,960
Fourth, one, two, three, four, the fourth street.

781
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,560
Where exactly is the fourth street?

782
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,120
On the roadside.

783
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,960
My brother is spitting foam now.

784
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:42,040
He can't hold on. He has a seizure.

785
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,200
Can you hurry up?

786
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,120
Do you have

787
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,640

788
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:47,320
Have a look.

789
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,560
Does the barbecue restaurant count?

790
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,760
Tell me the name of the barbecue restaurant.

791
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,560
It's called roast wings

792
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,760
What?

793
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:58,280
His shop name is "roast wings".

794
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,760
Do you have a wire pole around you?

795
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,840
You can tell me the number of the pole.

796
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,600
I can also locate you.

797
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:09,840
Radio pole.

798
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,600
Radio pole, me.

799
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,600
220KV City Pass T line 19.

800
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,440
Okay, I found your location.

801
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:20,920
I'll send a car.

802
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,720
Please wait next to the pole.

803
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,040
Make sure your phone is clear.

804
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,400
in case the doctor can't find you.

805
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,720
Please.

806
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,280
Hello, Jiangdong 120.

807
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,840
Do you need an ambulance?

808
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,440

809
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:35,840
I repeat.

812
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,160
Get drunk and go over there.

813
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,680

814
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Hello, the last order of Golden Mong Shop.

815
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,440
The down payment is only 300,000 yuan.

816
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,760
There are schools and mature commercial companies around.

817
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,160
Do you need investment?

818
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,000
Hello, please don't call 120.

819
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,720
Can we occupy the lives of the citizens?

820
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:56,880
It’s really...

821
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,000
Hello, Jiangdong City 120.

822
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:10,400
Doctor.

823
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,480
My baby's food is stuck.

824
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,440
I can't breathe now.

825
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,000
Don't cry. Calm down.

826
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,760
Crying will only delay the best treatment.

827
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,120
The ambulance will be here soon.

828
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,000
Turn on the speaker.

829
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,000
Do as I say.

830
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,440
Okay, I'll open it.

831
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,720
You stand behind the child now.

832
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,040
Separate her legs.

833
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,760
Put her between your arms.

834
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:29,720
Use your right hand.

835
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,840
touch the two horizontal fingers on the baby's belly button.

836
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:33,160
Then hold the fist with your left hand.

837
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:35,200
Hold it with your thumb.

838
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,720
Then wrap your left hand with your right hand.

839
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,880
Successively spike the patient's abdomen.

840
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:41,880
Five times.

841
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,160
How is it?

842
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,720
I still haven't vomited.

843
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,600
Then turn the baby over

844
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,720
and find the middle of the baby's breasts.

845
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:51,600
Can you find it?

846
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,320
Then hit it five times with your palm.

847
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:58,480
Two.

848
00:40:58,720 --> 00:40:59,160
Three.

849
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,000
Four.

850
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:00,560
Five.

851
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,600
I spit it out.

852
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:05,160
That's good.

853
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,000
The ambulance is on the way.

854
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,280
We'll do further tests later.

855
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:08,880
Thank you.

856
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:09,880
You're welcome.

857
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:10,600
Thank you, doctor.

858
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,600
Okay, wait for me at home. Okay.

859
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:19,720
Hello, Jiangdong City 120.

Okay, be careful.

866

00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,160
Okay, come here.

874
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:39,400
