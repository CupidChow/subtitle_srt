00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:06,040
National Radio. And Telvison Administration

2
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:37,840
Cheers.

3
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,800
To celebrate

4
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,120
the development of Zheng Bo app.

5
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:40,840
has grown a step.

6
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,560
[and you'll be able to see the future.] [You'll be able to see the future.]

7
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:48,800
But Yuan,

8
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,880
since you resigned,

9
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,759
it's been a long time

10
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,360
like this for a long time.

11
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,920
You don't go back to the second floor either.

12
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,160
Yes, long time ago.

13
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,600
I didn't expect

14
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,280
to be so busy in administration.

15
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:02,840
Right?

16
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,920
I miss the ER so much.

17
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:05,600
But

18
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,680
because of a special situation.

19
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,520
I can't go back.

20
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:10,400
Unfortunately,

21
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:11,600
That's right.

22
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,360
I only found out that

23
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,800
administration is really hard to deal with.

24
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,079
The kids under me

25
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,520
are always worried.

26
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,280
But it can't be helped.

27
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,360
Don't drink alone. Let's drink together.

28
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,600
What's wrong, Chi?

29
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,520
He's not in a good mood and keeps silent.

30
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,079
Is it because

31
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,360
about going abroad?

32
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,079
about going abroad.

33
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,640
That's why you're unhappy, right?

34
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,120
You should have told me earlier.

35
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,120
I'll send a message to my master.

36
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,360
My phone.

37
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:40,920
Yes, send it.

38
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,640
Don't.

39
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,400
You have to.

40
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,760
You have to tell me what's going on.

41
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,160
You have to let her know

42
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,079
what you think.

43
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:47,920
Send it now.

44
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,440
It's just an act.

45
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,800
Don't talk about me.

46
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,400
How?

47
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,280
Sister Qi.

48
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,280
Master

49
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,840
The three of us.

50
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:59,600
We're having dinner at Zhang Chi's house. Right.

51
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,840
We miss you so much.

52
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,760
We miss you.

53
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,280
exclamation mark.

54
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,560
I miss you.

55
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,400
exclamation mark.

56
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,360
exclamation mark.

57
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,280
Just wait to go back.

58
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,600
My master will definitely call me right away.

59
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,800
My master is passionate.

60
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,840
and optimistic.

61
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,400
Right?

62
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,560
She'll definitely reply. Don't worry.

63
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,600
Listen, men

64
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,280
you must tell them everything.

65
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,440
Sister Qi is such a good person.

66
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,400
Yes, look at my master.

67
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,440
She won't hide anything in her heart.

68
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,440
She can express

69
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,080
Unlike you.

70
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,399
I'm back.

71
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,320
Look at the video.

72
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:18,839
No.

73
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,000
Come on.

74
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,920
Have fun.

75
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,159
She must be tired.

76
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,280
Yes, she's tired.

77
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,080
Well, what time is it?

78
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,600
Only the three of us are still drinking here.

79
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,120
If we don't sleep, we'll go to bed.

80
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,440
Stop talking about it.

81
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,600
Yeah, cheers.

82
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,440
That's all.

83
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,920
Anyway,

84
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,640
Chi is going abroad.

85
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,160
We are your base camp.

86
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,840
Call me when you come back.

87
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,360
I heard

88
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,920
Chi, you're leaving at the end of the month, right?

89
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:18,560
What a pity.

90
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,720
When you left,

91
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,880
Sister Qi hasn't finished the exchange yet.

92
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,280
Don't forget us when you get there.

93
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,600
The music is so cheerful.

94
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,800
I'll change to a relaxing one.

95
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,200
Isn't it good to be happy, bro?

96
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,840
Let me dance for you.

97
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,120
No.

98
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,560
Well, I've been working hard lately.

99
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,840
Follow the music.

100
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,280
My back hurts.

101
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,880
Chi, where is the record player

102
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,800
Where is it

103
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,360
Where is it?

104
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:54,840
He forgot.

105
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,400
Don't worry.

106
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,280
How old are you?

107
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,400
Don't worry.

108
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,120
I've sent the ambulance to you soon.

109
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,280
I'll teach you what to do next.

110
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,120
I'll teach you what to do now.

111
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:11,840
Tighten your legs.

112
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,200
Put one of your hands

113
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,200
Don't sit on the toilet.

114
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,920
Hello, Gangdong 120.

115
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,200
Do you need an ambulance?

116
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,840
120 Emergency Command Center in Jiangdong.

117
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,000
Wei, Ni, get out!

118
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,520
Get out!

119
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,280
Let's go.

120
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,320
Hurry.

121
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,320
[A fire broke out]

122
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,640
There was a fire in Building 27.

123
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:38,320
0125 Snow Car Team

124
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,480
0110 Happy Car Team

125
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,760
0107 Zhang Chi-car team

126
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,680
Support immediately.

127
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,360
Fourth floor. Fourth floor. There seems to be someone here.

128
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,480
Come up and have a look.

129
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,560
Two more

130
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,280
It's okay

131
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,640
It's out

132
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,520
Sit down and take a rest.

133
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,800
Calm down, everyone.

134
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,000
It's dangerous here anytime.

135
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,920
Leave as soon as possible. Don't watch.

136
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,000
Please cooperate.

137
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,080
Leave as soon as possible.

138
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,120
Sir, what are you doing?

139
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,640
It's dangerous here.

140
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,160
Go back.

141
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:27,560
Comrade,

142
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,760
I'm an retired emergency doctor.

143
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,800
I can help.

144
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,520
We appreciate your kindness.

145
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,880
But the ambulance is on the way.

146
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,159
Before the ambulance comes,

147
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,320
before the ambulance comes.

148
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,880
I can help them when they come

149
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,120
Comrade, my name is Zhang Beihai

150
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,640
I've been doing emergency for my whole life

151
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,159
Everyone here knows me.

152
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,680
Don't worry. I won't be a burden.

153
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:47,560
Okay.

154
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,440
Thank you.

155
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,760
Stay away from the fire.

156
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,320
Be careful.

157
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:52,760
Okay.

158
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,280
120 is here.

159
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,640
Excuse me.

160
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,680
Excuse me. Thank you.

161
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,680
Is my leg broken?

162
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:32,799
Let's check first.

163
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,039
Rescue the critical patients.

164
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,240
Those who need to be sent to the hospital first.

165
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,440
Okay, Annie, let's go.

166
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:36,880
Okay.

167
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,080
Where did you get hurt?

168
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,440
This hand.

169
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,520
Excuse me.

170
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,520
Take this for her.

171
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,520
Are you okay?

172
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:01,680
I'm fine.

173
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,320
Ren Jie.

174
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,160
Come here and take care of this.

175
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:05,600
Okay.

176
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:06,880
Hang in there.

177
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:08,880
We'll take care of it for you.

178
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,680
Are you okay? Let me help you.

179
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,160
Hang in there.

180
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,320
Does your chest hurt?

181
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,160
Stretcher. Take it away. Hurry.

182
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,440
Stretcher.

183
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,240
Coming.

184
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:27,720
Two.

185
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,240
Slow down.

186
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:28,520
Let's go.

187
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,520
How are you? What happened?

188
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,520
Does your head hurt?

189
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,600
Hello, where did you get hurt?

190
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:38,680
Hold it.

191
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:39,880
You have to bear with it.

192
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,960
It's okay. It'll be quick.

193
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,040
Bring more water.

194
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,440
Chen Xue.

195
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,080
Move him out of the sun.

196
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,040
Okay, don't get tanned.

197
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,800
Are you okay? I'll take you to the shade.

198
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,960
Let's go to the shade over there.

199
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:08,680
Be careful.

200
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:09,720
Be careful.

201
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,520
Doctor.

202
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,600
This patient is a bit serious.

203
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,680
Come here.

204
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,680
Help!

205
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,720
Is anyone coming to save us?

206
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:32,680
There are two children.

207
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,520
Help!

208
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,400
Help! 0668!

209
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:35,840
Help!

210
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,840
Is anyone coming to save us?

211
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,840
Qiang, fourth floor.

212
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,560
There’s a kid.

213
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,000
Yes.

214
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,600
That kid is dying.

215
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,680
The two kids up there.

216
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:48,840
Gosh.

217
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:12,520
330668.

218
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,720
Cover your mouth and nose.

219
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,680
Annie, take care of it.

220
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,120
Okay.

221
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,320
Here, kid.

222
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,600
Let me check your nose.

223
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,280
Check your nose.

224
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,320
Are you hurt?

225
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,720
What about your body?

226
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,560
Doctor, there's a patient here.

227
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:52,680
Doctor.

228
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,000
How is it?

229
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,160
It's okay. Let go of your hand.

230
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,840
Put your hands down. Let me take a look.

231
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,440
Only your hand is burned, right?

232
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,400
Takato.

233
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,000
Ice pack for patients with mild diseases.

234
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,000
I don't have enough ice pack.

235
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,400
No one is here.

236
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,080
Come on.

237
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,800
Hello is this tap water

238
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:27,400
Yes.

239
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,280
Come on, get me a bucket.

240
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:28,680
Okay.

241
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,560
Thank you.

242
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:34,280
Okay.

243
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,280
Yuan Yuan

244
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,280
Give me the extra gauze.

245
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:40,720
Okay.

246
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,240
Gao.

247
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,840
Come on.

248
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,560
Take this gauze to reduce the temperature.

249
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,840
Physical cooling. Hurry up.

250
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,240
Okay.

251
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,720
Let me cool you down first.

252
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,280
Come on.

253
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,440
Come on.

254
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,160
Apply it.

255
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,960
Apply it. Apply it.

256
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,840
Can you hear me?

257
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,680
Can you hear me?

258
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,800
Yuan Yuan, ball breathing bag

259
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:47,560
Coming

260
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:53,320
0100457.

261
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,280
Stand away.

262
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Stop looking here.

263
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:05,440
Yuan Yuan.

264
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:06,240
Hurry.

265
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,200
The city, stretcher.

266
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:34,960
King City.

267
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:35,880
Stretcher.

268
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:09,240
Jiangdong emergency.

269
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:09,599
Jiangdong emergency.

270
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:53,800
Dr Zhang.

271
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:54,600
Master.

272
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,160
How is my dad?

273
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,600
He's still in surgery.

274
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,160
He lost too much blood.

275
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,800
There's a metal in his waist.

276
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,200
I think he hurt his kidney.

277
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,400
How long has it been?

278
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,720
Almost three hours.

279
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,520
It should be fine.

280
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,720
Master, I'm sorry

281
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,600
When I came here, Yuan Yuan told me

282
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,280
he was your father

283
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,400
It was chaotic.

284
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,480
I know I didn't handle many things well.

285
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,480
But if I knew

286
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,400
he is your father, I will...

287
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:21,960
Li Huo Huo.

288
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,520
Doctors must do their best

289
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,400
to face all patients.

290
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,960
We can't treat him differently

291
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,040
just because he's someone's friend.

292
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,520
Never think like that.

293
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,160
Okay.

294
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,920
You've never seen this before.

295
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,400
It's normal to be nervous.

296
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,520
When you experience more,

297
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,040
you'll be relaxed.

298
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,480
You go back first.

299
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,640
I'll stay here.

300
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,080
We'll accompany you

301
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,160
Which one is Zhang Beihai's family

302
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:25,840
I am

303
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,720
The surgery went well.

304
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,640
But we have to send him to the ICU.

305
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,480
for a few more days.

306
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,080
Great.

307
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,160
You're awake.

308
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:12,800
Water, right?

309
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,400
The water is a little cold. Get some hot water.

310
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,160
Why are you still here?

311
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,280
Are you quitting?

312
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,520
There are doctors and nurses here.

313
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,520
You don't have to keep me company.

314
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,160
I'm not that busy lately.

315
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:36,280
And the leader knows about your situation.

316
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,680
and didn't assign me so many tasks.

317
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,160
Be careful.

318
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:08,640
Okay.

319
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,520
How is it? Does your wound hurt?

320
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,080
Not bad.

321
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,480
As long as you can accept it.

322
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,360
If you use too much painkillers,

323
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,160
is bad for your health.

324
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:22,720
Yes.

325
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,040
How many times

326
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,960
in my life?

327
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,160
It's nothing.

328
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,040
Dad.

329
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,640
I fell asleep.

330
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,800
I dreamed of my mom again.

331
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,200
That day,

332
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,840
when I lived at home.

333
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,080
I dreamed of my mom too.

334
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,520
I dreamed

335
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,600
she made my favorite fried rice with egg.

336
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,480
You made earlobes.

337
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,720
The three of us are having a happy meal.

338
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,040
I don't know why

339
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,280
I've been dreaming of my mom lately.

340
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,360
She sent me to school.

341
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,520
and fly a kite.

342
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,480
I dreamed that she took me to the zoo.

343
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,360
Before I went to school,

344
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,600
she hid the apple

345
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,800
in my bag.

346
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,400
My mom in my dream

347
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,520
I'm always very happy.

348
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,400
When you get discharged,

349
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,520
let's visit her.

350
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,440
The weather

351
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,680
when you talk.

352
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,320
Is Qiqi coming back soon?

353
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,440
Almost.

354
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,960
I'm afraid Qi Qi can't get used to it.

355
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,680
Yes, over there.

356
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,800
It's windy and dry.

357
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,520
Son,

358
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,800
I want to tell you

359
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,200
you're going abroad for research.

360
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,440
I agree.

361
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,920
If you want to stay in the emergency center,

362
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,320
I'll support you too.

363
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,280
After all,

364
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,600
your dad has been doing all his life.

365
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,600
What I want to say is,

366
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,320
no matter what choice you make,

367
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:47,400
you must take care of your relationship with Qiqi.

368
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,080
This kid.

369
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,920
I really like him.

370
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:57,600
I know.

371
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,800
Mrs. Su, everyone is off work.

372
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,440
What about you?

373
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,440
I'll wait for him. He'll be back soon.

374
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,200
Okay, I'm leaving.

375
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,440
Bye.

376
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,560
These

377
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,960
are for you.

378
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,160
You scared me.

379
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,800
Why didn't you make a sound when you walked?

380
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:36,560
Do you remember

381
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,040
you once said a wish

382
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,560
that you want to have such a big shoe cabinet.

383
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,680
I remember this wish.

384
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,680
and wanted to help you fulfill it.

385
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:45,920
So,

386
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,360
every time when I get some results,

387
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,840
I buy a pair of shoes

388
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,360
and reward myself.

389
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,200
When I went to her house,

390
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,760
she had a huge cap room.

391
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,440
and a whole wall.

392
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,680
They're all shoes.

393
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,400
Because I really like shoes.

394
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,040
I envied her so much.

395
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,200
I was wondering when I could have a wall

396
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,600
with my shoes.

397
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,920
I was just saying.

398
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,840
It was a long time ago.

399
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,320
Buy one pair.

400
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,960
I wanted to

401
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,320
to buy all the walls

402
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,160
and then propose to you.

403
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,560
But today,

404
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,880
I bought half and you found out.

405
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,800
What's your plan for the future?

406
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:13,280
Plan?

407
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:14,880
Company?

408
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,560
What company?

409
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,160
Aren't we doing well now?

410
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,480
When will you propose?

411
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,480
I don't want to ask you again.

412
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,840
What are you doing?

413
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,320
Listen to you.

414
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,400
I don't want to hear the vague concept.

415
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:38,400
Three months.

416
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,280
Too long.

417
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,800
How about the end of this month?

418
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,280
I don't want to hear a question.

419
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,240
Kiki.

420
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:50,880
What?

421
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,240
Do you remember this card?

422
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,040
I've been carrying the first fund

423
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,880
I always have it with me.

424
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,320
and I don't have any flowers.

425
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,040
What?

426
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,080
You want to split up with me?

427
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:15,800
This card

428
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:19,080
is all I have so far.

429
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,040
Here.

430
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,400
It's all yours.

431
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,400
All yours.

432
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,240
All the things I promised you

433
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,600
has come true.

434
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:47,960
Kiki.

435
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,200
Will you marry me?

436
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:55,600
Yes.

437
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,400
Hello, Jia Qi.

438
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,600
Hello, Senior.

439
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:24,760
What are you doing?

440
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,320
I'm taking a walk downstairs.

441
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,240
Let me share some good news with you.

442
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,600
Tell me. What is it?

443
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,760
Zheng Bo proposed to me.

444
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,560
Really?

445
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,240
He's enlightened.

446
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,520
Not really.

447
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:47,240
I think he's kind of like me.

448
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,040
You know he's a fool.

449
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,800
How long do we have to wait for him?

450
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,160
Not bad.

451
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,160
Then I'll ask for the gift money when I go back.

452
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,240
Not that fast.

453
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,320
But I won't wait too long.

454
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,040
Good.

455
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,040
Your speed is like a rocket.

456
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,560
How are you guys?

457
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,720
How are you and Dr. Zhang?

458
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,080
No.

459
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,800
No, not much.

460
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:11,080
I heard Dr. Zhang is leaving soon.

461
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,360
You should find a time to talk.

462
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,240
It's okay. Let it be.

463
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,520
Take care of yourself over there.

464
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:21,600
Rest early.

465
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,080
Okay, you too.

466
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,240
Okay.

467
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,360
Text me if you need anything.

468
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:28,640
Bye.

469
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,280
Bye.

470
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:13,880
Yunyun.

471
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,520
Sorry.

472
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,680
I'm late.

473
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:18,960
No.

474
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,040
I came early.

475
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,120
Let's go.

476
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:56,960
Dr Xu.

477
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:00,160
Do you want to eat something?

478
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,040
Sure.

479
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:02,960
Anything is fine.

480
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:03,680
You choose.

481
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,040
Let's go to the skewers on the rooftop.

482
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,159
Or barbecue

483
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:11,159
or barbecue.

484
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,800
I'm a little traumatized.

485
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:17,040
What do you want to eat?

486
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,800
Do you like hot pot?

487
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:21,159
Okay?

488
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,159
Okay, let's have hotpot.

489
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,880
I could have caught it.

490
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:27,520
The clip

491
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,960
You're just a little stupid.

492
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,520
It has a pattern.

493
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,320
It has seven times in ten times.

494
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:34,520
Look.

495
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:34,960
What?

496
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:38,520
Xu Chengyuan.

497
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,800
And the Heart-piercing Lotus.

498
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:41,880
Pan Jinlian.

499
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:43,320
Heart-piercing Lotus?

500
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,679
Heart-piercing Lotus? It's really her.

501
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,520
Let's go and have a look.

502
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,159
Let's go.

503
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:50,080
Dr Xu.

504
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,800
Do you like hot pot?

505
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:55,639
Yes, I like clear soup.

506
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,360
What about you?

507
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,240
I like spicy food.

508
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,080
Let's order mandarin duck pot.

509
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,080
Okay.

510
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,200
What kind of movie do you like?

511
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,520
What kind of movie do you like?

512
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,200
They look good together.

513
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:16,640
Not bad.

514
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,080
Yes.

515
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:21,080
I like watching comedies or terror.

516
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:24,920
Did you notice?

517
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,160
No.

518
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:44,400
Dr Xu.

519
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,080
You like this style?

520
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:48,960
Come out.

521
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,360
Look at my favorite style.

522
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,680
Your shoelace is loose, Jiaqi.

523
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,800
Enough, Zheng Bo. Come out now.

524
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,640
Stop pretending. Come on.

525
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:55,800
What a coincidence.

526
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,800
What a coincidence. You are also dating here.

527
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,200
No, we...

528
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,520
It's not like we're on a date.

529
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,920
We're going to eat together.

530
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:04,640
Do you want to go?

531
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:05,680
Sure.

532
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,920
We were going to have hotpot together.

533
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:08,360
Okay.

534
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,760
Let's not eat.

535
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,800
We're going to watch a movie soon.

536
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,640
It's about to start.

537
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:13,480
Don't blink.

538
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,360
Let's eat together.

539
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:27,880
[flight SA256 from Gansu to Jiangdong]

540
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,640
[will land to Jiangdong International Airport]

541
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,240
at 10:40 in Beijing.

542
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:35,640
Please adjust your seat to the back and put the tableboard away.

543
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,240
I'm going out from here

544
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:37,960
I'll be right out.

545
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,200
I told her I'll pick you up.

546
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:12,800
She's not coming.

547
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,480
She's back.

548
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,040
I didn't leave.

549
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,480
They told me you left.

550
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:26,040
I went to Gansu to look for you.

551
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,600
They thought I went abroad.

552
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:29,920
You...

553
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,080
You went to Gansu?

554
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,680
I waited for you at your hotel for a week.

555
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,480
They said you changed places.

556
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,360
Why didn't you call me?

557
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,680
I was afraid that you would ignore me.

558
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,040
Why didn't you go?

559
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,640
I'm not going.

560
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:53,960
Hello.

561
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,080
I received your email.

562
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,040
Did you receive my reply?

563
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,480
It's not about the treatment.

564
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,080
The treatment you can offer

565
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,360
is very high.

566
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,480
That's not the problem.

567
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,960
The team you want to form for me

568
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,040
is also excellent.

569
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:19,440
This is my personal problem

570
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,080
It's my personal problem.

571
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,160
I can only say sorry.

572
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:35,600
Thank you.

573
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,000
Why?

574
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:56,600
Because of you.

575
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,360
Zhang Chi, we're not kids anymore.

576
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,280
I made it clear when I left.

577
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,280
If you don't go because you don't want me to be sad,

578
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,040
then you'll regret it.

579
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,480
I admit

580
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,640
even if I was drunk,

581
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:21,240
and promised to go abroad,

582
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,240
That's because I wanted to go abroad.

583
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,680
That's my mom's passionate career.

584
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,480
I've studied it for more than ten years.

585
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,360
So I don't want to give up.

586
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,680
You mean it, right?

587
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,800
If you break up with me,

588
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,360
you'll suffer for a short time.

589
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,040
You can continue

590
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,360
your favorite career.

591
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,560
You'll forget me soon.

592
00:39:59,280 --> 00:39:59,840
Really?

593
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,120
I can really forget it

594
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:09,360
Qi Tuo

595
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,360
I thought I was a lonely person.

596
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,360
I studied alone.

597
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,600
and study the assignment alone.

598
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,400
I'm good at cooking.

599
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,480
because I don't eat with others.

600
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,360
until I met you at the emergency center.

601
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:41,800
One day,

602
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,280
I brushed my teeth.

603
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,040
I suddenly laughed.

604
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,120
I...

605
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:00,040
When I look into the mirror,

606
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,000
I saw one day

607
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:05,680
I married you.

608
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:08,000
And you...

609
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:11,720
You're trying to steal the tap from me.

610
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,200
And we went to the supermarket

611
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,200
and buy your favorite chips.

612
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,320
You tried to cook again.

613
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,040
But it ended in failure.

614
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,800
This is definitely the last time.

615
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,000
Let's go together.

616
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,040
While we're resting,

617
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,920
while resting.

618
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:35,560
I'm just teasing you with a cold joke.

619
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,200
You came here to fight me.

620
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:42,640
I was so happy.

621
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:44,600
I'm not good at talking.

622
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,800
I know.

623
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,440
I won't go to the research center abroad.

624
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,240
I'll regret it.

625
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:49,720
But

626
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:54,560
I'll regret it for the rest of my life

627
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,600
I'll regret it for the rest of my life.

628
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,160
I can't leave you.

629
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,160
I'm more important than going abroad.

630
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:14,360
Have you made up your mind?

631
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:14,920
You can't go back.

632
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,040
You can't go there again.

633
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:17,560
There's no next time. You can't go.

634
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:18,240
No.

635
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,160
Are you sure?

636
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,360
