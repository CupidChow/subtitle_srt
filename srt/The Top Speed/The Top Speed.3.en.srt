1
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:06,040
National Radio. and Telvison. Administration.

2
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,479
Where's Kiki?

3
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,160
She went to the toilet. She'll be here soon.

4
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,720
Come on

5
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,280
Let's drink! Let's drink!

6
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:51,920
Come on. Come on.

7
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,800
This is too fast.

8
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,680
One more glass.

9
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,880
Don't worry. I'm not drunk.

10
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,000
I'll be back soon. Bye.

11
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,080
What are you doing?

12
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,880
Because I like you.

13
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,000
Haven't you noticed

14
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,120
Haven't you noticed?

15
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,640
Let's drink.

16
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,680
Let go of me!

17
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,320
Let go of me!

18
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,079
Drink.

19
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:21,800
Come on.

20
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:23,960
Come on.

21
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,840
Let go of me!

22
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:29,960
Let go of me!

23
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,040
Are you okay?

24
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:33,280
Not bad.

25
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,640
I'll come with you next time.

26
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,480
Zheng Bo.

27
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,400
Are you okay?

28
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,280
I'm fine.

29
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,040
What's going on?

30
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,600
Doctor, there's a patient inside.

31
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,720
In there, right? Yes.

32
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,160
Take us there.

33
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,160
Come in. Follow me.

34
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,360
I haven't drunk the wine worth thousands of yuan.

35
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,000
I just opened it.

36
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,800
You look fine, but you're bleeding.

37
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,520
Do you feel dizzy?

38
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,160
Here?

39
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,040
Here.

40
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,200
Does your arm hurt?

41
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,040
Let me see.

42
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:38,840
Sister Qi.

43
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,040
Why are you here?

44
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:40,960
Dr Zhang.

45
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,280
Jia Qi. Zheng Bo.

46
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,079
Why are you here?

47
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,960
I think it's dislocated. I just checked it.

48
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,640
Let me see it again.

49
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,800
No, how did you get hurt like this?

50
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,920
What happened? Let me see.

51
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,800
Do you feel dizzy?

52
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,200
What about your arm and leg?

53
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,520
Nothing.

54
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,200
It's okay, right?

55
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,280
Right here

56
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:55,960
My arm is dislocated.

57
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,640
What are you doing here?

58
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,600
What's wrong with you guys?

59
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,160
I'm glad I found her.

60
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,800
Otherwise, she might be hurt more badly.

61
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,600
Here, clean this wound for her.

62
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,600
Give me a triangle bandage.

63
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,040
Find it for me.

64
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,200
Senior, this is the new Dr Zhang.

65
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:10,920
from Cardio Surgery.

66
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,200
Dr Zhang.

67
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,720
Why don't you give me a try?

68
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,080
Come on, help her.

69
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,079
Hurry up. She's asleep.

70
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,839
So many people hurt her.

71
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,520
Fight with you?

72
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,040
No.

73
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,600
There's a pervert wearing a hat.

74
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,600
You're so pretentious.

75
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,840
What's wrong with your mouth?

76
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,400
He bit it inside.

77
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:35,600
Don't move.

78
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,400
It's okay.

79
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:36,960
Doctor.

80
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,960
Are you almost done here?

81
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:39,480
What is it?

82
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,640
There's a patient at the door.

83
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,600
Please come with me.

84
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,280
At the door, right?

85
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:42,960
At the door.

86
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,280
Okay.

87
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,400
Qiu, take care of her wound.

88
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:45,920
No problem.

89
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,159
Is it done?

90
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,480
Zhang Chi, come with me.

91
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,480
Hurry up. Stop embroidering. Hurry up.

92
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,720
Send her to the hospital.

93
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,159
Okay.

94
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:54,960
I'll deal with you later.

95
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,000
Guys, this man.

96
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,040
He escaped from the bar after committing a crime.

97
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,120
Luckily he didn't run far.

98
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,560
He fainted.

99
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,440
Please check it for me.

100
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,120
Take a look.

101
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,360
It's you.

102
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,560
Your head is bleeding.

103
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,800
Okay, I'll check it for you.

104
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,440
Do you feel nauseous and dizzy?

105
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,480
Your limbs are fine.

106
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,200
There's a wound here.

107
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,360
Clean him up.

108
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:29,680
Doctor.

109
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,120
What are you doing? Behave yourself.

110
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,560
What are you doing?

111
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,200
Let me.

112
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,680
I need to clean your wound.

113
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,800
It might hurt.

114
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,040
Bear with it.

115
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:48,880
Don't move

116
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
We have to do it again.

117
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,440
It hurts

118
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,080
Come on, wash it again.

119
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,360
Okay.

120
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,320
It doesn't hurt anymore.

121
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:01,920
It doesn't hurt anymore.

122
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,800
Take me to the hospital.

123
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,800
You move a little more.

124
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,680
Do you have chest tightness and shortness of breath?

125
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,040
Don't you feel short of breath if you move too much?

126
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,360
I have chest tightness and short breath.

127
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,040
My hand didn't grow like this either.

128
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,240
I hit you.

129
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,680
You're stamping your finger.

130
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,360
It's a typical expression of pulmonary hypertension. 0084V.

131
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,120
Can... Can someone die?

132
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,440
It will cause heart failure.

133
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,560
If it's serious, he'll die.

134
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,800
Oh, my. Doctor.

135
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,440
Doctor!

136
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,560
Huang.

137
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,000
Ask the transfer center to send another car.

138
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,640
Send another patient to the North Hospital.

139
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,760
It's suspected pulmonary hypertension.

140
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,120
Copy that.

141
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,440
Senior, how was that guy?

142
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,240
Is he badly injured?

143
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,040
Yes.

144
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,040
What did you do to him? 008400.

145
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:58,920
You're so cruel.

146
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,120
I'm scared. I'm really scared.

147
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:01,920
How scary.

148
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,240
I don't know where I got the strength.

149
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,800
I just copied something and smashed it.

150
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:05,800
Are you okay?

151
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,360
I... I'm fine. I have thick skin.

152
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,160
So I went in to cover her.

153
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,920
Can you move? Does your back hurt?

154
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,240
I'm fine. Don't worry.

155
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,040
Really?

156
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:15,600
Yes.

157
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,800
If it doesn't work,

158
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,440
you can pack with her for a check-up.

159
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,040
It's not hard.

160
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,360
Don't bother, sister.

161
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,160
Don't go to places like this again.

162
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,000
You're too old to jump.

163
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,240
There's no sign of him.

164
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,280
Are you feeling better, Zheng Bo?

165
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,480
Much better. It doesn't hurt anymore.

166
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,520
Thank you.

167
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,080
Tell me.

168
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,880
Why are you saving the beauty

169
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,920
from the novel?

170
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,280
No one

171
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,840
who's willing to marry me.

172
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,800
This is not right.

173
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,080
It's not right.

174
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,840
Even Kiki doesn't show her gratitude.

175
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,640
I mean this is not the right place.

176
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,080
It's complicated.

177
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,240
I showed up in time this time.

178
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,400
What if I'm not there next time?

179
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,680
Why don't you give her a pepper spray

180
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,720
or a home baton.

181
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:20,840
Just in case.

182
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,160
I have a better idea.

183
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,840
Kiki.

184
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,600
I have something for you.

185
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:41,919
Here.

186
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:43,919
What?

187
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,480
The place we went last time.

188
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,920
we shouldn't go there anymore.

189
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,360
Luckily I found out earlier that day.

190
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,800
Otherwise, you'd be in danger.

191
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,200
Fitness card. Yoga card.

192
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:55,600
Yes.

193
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,080
Yoga card. Fitness card.

194
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,400
and the library card.

195
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,200
and swimming cards.

196
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,760
and the library card.

197
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,600
If you're free,

198
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,400
when you're free.

199
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,640
For me?

200
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,640
Yes, for you.

201
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,640
You can go to places like this when you're free.

202
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:10,960
Thank you.

203
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,240
It's quite creative.

204
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,960
You're welcome. You must go there.

205
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,480
It cost me almost a month's salary.

206
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:16,760
Bye.

207
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,720
Not bad, Zheng Bo.

208
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,280
You're as strong as me.

209
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,720
Mr. Lu always complained that I'm thin.

210
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,800
If I don't exercise more,

211
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,040
Dr. Zhang.

212
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,040
Are you used to

213
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,560
the rhythm of our emergency center?

214
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,320
Not bad.

215
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,920
How long have you been running?

216
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,080
40 minutes.

217
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,040
We're all practicing.

218
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,080
Here we go.

219
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,960
Come on. Let’s start.

220
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,840
Zheng Bo is on the move.

221
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,440
Have a good chat.

222
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,080
How's your injury?

223
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,680
Much better. Thank you.

224
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,520
I think you should thank me today.

225
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,680
I suggest you put on makeup

226
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,520
Don't come to the gym.

227
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,320
Because if you wear makeup, you'll sweat.

228
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,440
It'll block your pores and get pimples.

229
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,920
And it won't heal your wound.

230
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,160
Okay, stop it. It's incurable.

231
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,320
Remember to remove your makeup.

232
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,400
No one touched you.

233
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:35,840
Pull me up.

234
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,040
Go quickly

235
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,320
When you screamed,

236
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,040
Why didn't you tell me?

237
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,800
What's wrong with you?

238
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,320
They are useless.

239
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,720
Are you out of your mind?

240
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,280
You're shaking.

241
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,080
Take a look.

242
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,040
I'm right.

243
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,040
Makeup shouldn't come to the gym.

244
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,040
It's bad for your health. It's not worth it.

245
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,200
You're crazy!

246
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,040
Gather around!

247
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:05,800
Call us.

248
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,840
Gather around.

249
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:09,560
Come on.

250
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,040
Let's have a battle. Swing the rope.

251
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,200
It's not fair.

252
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,680
Men and women compete with strength.

253
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,680
Who's competing with you?

254
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,200
We're competing for endurance.

255
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,200
It only counts if it exceeds 100 times a minute.

256
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,400
Then we

257
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,520
will be the winner.

258
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,640
Kiki will be the judge.

259
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,440
Why is she the judge?

260
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,320
Jiaqi just recovered.

261
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,560
The point is you have the nerve to dump her.

262
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,400
Thin people are tough.

263
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,960
Okay, are you ready?

264
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:39,440
Okay.

265
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:39,960
Let's start.

266
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,200
Xu Chengyuan is the first.

267
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:41,680
Come on.

268
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,040
Come on, Yuan.

269
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:44,680
Dr Zhang.

270
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,320
Master, you're the best.

271
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,200
Ready.

272
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,320
OK?

273
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:49,800
Yes.

274
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:50,680
Start.

275
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,200
We're far away.

276
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,680
Zheng Bo is strong.

277
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,920
Not bad, Xu Chengyuan.

278
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:57,560
Of course.

279
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,040
Chase Lee, 18.

280
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,920
Come on.

281
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,280
Come on! Come on!

282
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,280
57 58 59

283
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,400
The last minute.

284
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,800
The highest point now.

285
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:15,800
Come on! Come on! Come on!

286
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,440
Eighty.

287
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,280
That's my master.

288
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,320
What do you think?

289
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,680
My master is better.

290
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,320
From now on, you have to follow orders and listen to orders in the car group.

291
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,440
Master, you're great.

292
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,440
Great!

293
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,040
Awesome.

294
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,920
Madam, I'm leaving.

295
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,640
Dr Qi, thank you

296
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,840
for visiting Dan Dan again.

297
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:51,440
It's okay.

298
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,160
I'm leaving.

299
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,400
No, let me see you off.

300
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:54,960
I'll get some food too.

301
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:55,440
Okay.

302
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,040
Luckily, a female doctor came to accompany her.

303
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,440
I need to go get some food.

304
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,680
Or it's too late.

305
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,800
after dinner.

306
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,120
Why is she here?

307
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,320
Dr Zhang.

308
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,680
Dan Dan just fell asleep.

309
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,720
Dr Zhang, thank you so much.

310
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,840
Thanks to you.

311
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,560
You care so much about Dan Dan.

312
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,720
and take care of her.

313
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,960
I watched Dan Dan grow up.

314
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,200
Whether I'm in the north of the city or not,

315
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,360
I'll take care of her.

316
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,600
I don't think we can match a suitable heart.

317
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,200
The doctor told me

318
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,720
Dan Dan won't last long.

319
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,320
Dr Zhang.

320
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,560
Actually, I have a favor

321
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,800
a favor today.

322
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:26,680
What is it?

323
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,080
Dr Qi.

324
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,120
Do you have relatives of children?

325
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,080
You bought a lot of children's clothes.

326
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,200
I bought it for Dan Dan.

327
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,200
I bought this for Dan Dan too.

328
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,480
Dan Dan's mom is busy.

329
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,200
She hopes that when she leaves,

330
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,440
when she leaves.

331
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,360
I didn't know you'd visit Dan Dan.

332
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,840
You think I'm numb?

333
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,840
Anyway, at the hospital that day,

334
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,080
Yangyang's parents and I

335
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,480
for the baby's heart

336
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,480
you didn't support me.

337
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,840
I've been in the ER for so many years.

338
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,200
I've seen everything.

339
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,120
but it doesn't mean I'm numb inside.

340
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,360
It's easy to fold, Zhang Chi.

341
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,200
You need to do things in a way.

342
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,080
Don't rush forward with your head.

343
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,200
Don't think too much.

344
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,240
As a doctor,

345
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,680
all want to save patients.

346
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,960
but it can't be built on other people's pain.

347
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,960
Dan Dan's life is life.

348
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,480
Yangyang's life is also life.

349
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,720
We donate the body voluntarily

350
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,800
We can't decide anyone's life or death.

351
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:03,720
We can't decide

352
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,200
other people's choices, right?

353
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,840
We can only do

354
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,200
what we can do.

355
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,720
right?

356
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,560
Dr Sun

357
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,200
Dr. Zhang, Yangyang just passed away.

358
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,240
The donor is still fighting with his family.

359
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,600
But the family is very emotional.

360
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,480
and determined.

361
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,760
The transplant surgery only lasts six hours.

362
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,040
I think it's hard.

363
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,000
I'll be right there

364
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,480
Yangyang is gone.

365
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,680
Go away

366
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,680
Yangyang's dad

367
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,360
Get out

368
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:44,960
Calm down.

369
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,680
My son just died.

370
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,920
and you're here.

371
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,720
I'll kill you.

372
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,840
Don't do this.

373
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,840
I'll kill you!

374
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:57,360
You're in cahoots with the donors.

375
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,280
Leave.

376
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,000
We won't agree

377
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,480
donate Yangyang's heart.

378
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,319
Yangyang's mom

379
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,319
Auntie

380
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,720
Are you Yangyang's mom

381
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:31,920
Yes

382
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,240
Take it out.

383
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,200
Auntie

384
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,920
Our teacher said Yangyang is sick.

385
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,080
He can't come to school for a long time.

386
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,320
I asked my mom.

387
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:47,800
My mom said she needed a lot of money to get sick.

388
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,440
These are the money

389
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,200
for Yangyang.

390
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,080
This is for the three of us

391
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,440
The other one is Hanhan's.

392
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,680
But his mother didn't let him come out with us.

393
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,040
So she asked us to take the money with us

394
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,560
Auntie, this is Yangyang's textbook.

395
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,080
I thought he couldn't go to class

396
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,960
so I brought his textbook here.

397
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:21,920
Thank you.

398
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,920
Auntie, this is Yangyang's favorite toy.

399
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,720
I didn't give it to him before

400
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,920
Now I give it to him.

401
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,440
Thank you.

402
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,960
Thank you kids

403
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,200
I'll give these to Yangyang.

404
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,240
Goodbye auntie

405
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,200
Auntie

406
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,440
Can we meet Yangyang again?

407
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,480
We will meet again

408
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:08,080
Goodbye, auntie. Goodbye, auntie.

409
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:42,960
Dr Sun.

410
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:43,560
Dr Zhang.

411
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,080
The heart has been removed.

412
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,560
We're doing the suture now.

413
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:50,960
Thank you.

414
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,480
Dr Qi

415
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,920
Yangyang's mother finally agreed to the heart donation.

416
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,000
Come in

417
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,200
Secretary Liu.

418
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,120
Chi, come here.

419
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,720
Sit down.

420
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,640
I have something to talk to you.

421
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,880
I understand why you want to see me.

422
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,880
You knew without saying anything.

423
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:09,600
What?

424
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,760
You recruited me to the center not long ago,

425
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,120
I made such a big trouble 1004577

426
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,280
I let you down 1004577

427
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:17,480
and your efforts. 004577.

428
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,600
You made a mistake this time.

429
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,600
and violated the work regulations of the center.

430
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,880
and caused bad influence to the center.

431
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,720
It's not too much to punish you, right?

432
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,440
No.

433
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,840
I'll study hard

434
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,720
and learn from Dr. Qi.

435
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,000
Yes, you need to learn from Qi Tuo at work.

436
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,720
You made it this time.

437
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,760
you should thank her.

438
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,360
She worked for you

439
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,600
at Yangyang's mom's place.

440
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,440
She did more than you thought.

441
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,120
And her family kept complaining about you.

442
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,320
Qi Tuo said a lot of good words for you.

443
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,120
It's me

444
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,360
My name is Qi Tuo.

445
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,880
Are you the doctor?

446
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,720
Yes, my name is Qi Tuo.

447
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,880
How is Yangyang?

448
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,960
I'm here to apologize for that intern.

449
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,960
He's reckless.

450
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,200
and caused you a lot of trouble.

451
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,600
I'm sorry.

452
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,360
But I didn't

453
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,040
to tell you this.

454
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:37,480
What is it?

455
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:39,560
Let me tell you.

456
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,760
I'll get you a new tutor.

457
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,280
Dr. Qi doesn't want to train me anymore.

458
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,400
I knew you would think too much.

459
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,000
Here's the thing.

460
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,280
the city emergency association

461
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,560
and our emergency center

462
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,040
to set up an international emergency forum.

463
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,480
Qi Tuo is the top of our business.

464
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,120
So I sent her to represent the center.

465
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,400
and gave her a week off.

466
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,480
I can only change you to a teaching teacher.

467
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,120
When she comes back, you'll still...

468
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,520
With whom?

469
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,560
Xu Chengyuan from 0112.

470
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,120
I've called him.

471
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,520
I heard

472
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,680
Mr. Liu entrusted Dr. Zhang to you.

473
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,920
Yes, let me tell you.

474
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,360
I'm not as kind as my master.

475
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,640
I have to show him

476
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,120
how complicated the society is.

477
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,560
I think you'll have to return him

478
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,880
you have to give him a refund.

479
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,280
Who are you looking down on?

480
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:24,880
Let me tell you.

481
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,880
I'll definitely bring him back to my master.

482
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,160
Let's make a bet if you don't believe me.

483
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,000
Sure. How?

484
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,760
I bet if you lose,

485
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,560
you wash my socks for a month.

486
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,040
Not a month.

487
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,040
You are shameless.

488
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,400
What if you lose?

489
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,680
You think you will win anyway.

490
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,040
If I lose,

491
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,640
give you a red packet.

492
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,760
Sure, I can.

493
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,040
Wait, how much is it?

494
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,520
0112 Xu Chengyuan's car team.

495
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,560
Room 2102, Building 5, Zhixiang Community.

496
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,880
An old man is unconscious at home.

497
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,040
I'll be right there.

498
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:07,680
Copy that.

499
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,880
Doctor, hurry up.

500
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,840
How long has he been in a coma?

501
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,920
Please hurry up.

502
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,520
He had a stroke.

503
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,520
He has been lying in bed for more than ten years.

504
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,040
When he was sick,

505
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,000
we were cooking in the kitchen.

506
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:22,840
He had a stroke

507
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,800
and had a weak heart.

508
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,840
He has been lying in bed for more than ten years.

509
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Breathing bag.

510
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:29,640
Breathing bag.

511
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,520
Dad, wake up!

512
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,120
Yuan Yuan, build an vein passage.

513
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:37,520
Okay.

514
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,040
28, 29, 30.

515
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,760
Wang Cheng, heart rate monitor.

516
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,760
Excuse me.

517
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,000
Excuse me.

518
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:48,880
Excuse me.

519
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,400
Dad.

520
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,400
27 28 29 30

521
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,640
Be careful.

522
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,120
Get in.

523
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:18,960
Get in.

524
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,800
What are you staring at?

525
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:28,880
Just say it.

526
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
I believe you can see it.

527
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,040
Yes, I did.

528
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,000
Why do you bother if you can see it?

529
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,120
Stop acting.

530
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,000
Yuan Er, get a bottle of water.

531
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,040
Listen, Zhang Chi.

532
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,040
This is called final care.

533
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,400
Who will you care about when he's gone?

534
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,280
Of course I care about the living. 00102002.

535
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:03,680
What?

536
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,280
Do you think only patients need care?

537
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,040
It's not easy for the living.

538
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,520
They're traumatized.

539
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,160
Think about why they called us here.

540
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,760
to save the patient

541
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,680
save the patient.

542
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,800
We didn't do anything.

543
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,000
Just one word. It's too late.

544
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,400
The patient has left.

545
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,040
What do you want her family to think?

546
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,760
What does this mean?

547
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,360
It means the family didn't take good care of the patients.

548
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,160
He's not filial enough.

549
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,680
The family found out too late.

550
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,360
Do you know

551
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,480
will make the family feel guilty for the rest of their life?

552
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,080
Okay, give me a hand.

553
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:48,040
The golden time for heart arrest.

554
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:48,840
Four minutes.

555
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,600
What if we arrive in the last second?

556
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,560
Is it possible that

557
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,680
to save the patient?

558
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,160
As doctors,

559
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,320
take people from death.

560
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,600
Just for that little chance.

561
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,360
Okay, let's go.

562
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:04,800
0102002

563
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:05,440
0102

564
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,080
Let's go.

565
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:09,680
Let's go, Zhang Chi.

566
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,680
Why are you standing there?

567
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,480
Get in.

568
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,400
How did this happen?

569
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,840
I was fine that day.

570
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,000
Stop talking. Go to the Fourth Courtyard.

571
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,000
Get closer to home.

572
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,000
What's wrong with you?

573
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,080
What does this have to do with being close or not?

574
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:33,960
You must go to a specialist hospital.

575
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:34,480
Watch this corner.

576
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,520
Find a professional doctor.

577
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,800
The doctor said our mom can't afford it.

578
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,400
Go to the Fourth Courtyard. Closer.

579
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,040
Do you understand?

580
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:40,600
Give me some advice.

581
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,800
Don't let them waste time.

582
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,480
This disease needs professional hospitals.

583
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,520
Professional. OK.

584
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,120
I'll listen to you, okay? Go to the hospital.

585
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:47,600
Will you take responsibility if something happens?

586
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,000
Why should I? What's wrong with you?

587
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:50,480
This way.

588
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,360
Have you decided?

589
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,480
Which hospital should I send to?

590
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:54,600
Doctor, you are professional.

591
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,880
Which one is better?

592
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:56,840
I just told you

593
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,400
I already told you.

594
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,600
The old brand of the Fourth Courtyard.

595
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,800
The key is it’s close to home.

596
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:01,760
The Six College is a specialist.

597
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:02,880
The national clinical department.

598
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,880
Choose one. Choose quickly.

599
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:07,040
Doctor, the fourth hospital.

600
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,880
Can you stop arguing with me?

601
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:09,360
Go to the Fourth Courtyard

602
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,560
If you keep choosing,

603
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,760
it'll be too late to send it anywhere.

604
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,360
Listen to me, doctor.

605
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:12,840
The fourth hospital.

606
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,880
All right, all right, all right, all right

607
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,840
Send him to the hospital.

608
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,160
Yes.

609
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,000
You made your own decision.

610
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,520
Yes.

611
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,960
OK. Sign it. Hurry.

612
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,680
Hurry, doctor. Get in.

613
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,120
I heard that the canteen made braised pork this afternoon.

614
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,080
Well, we're running out of time.

615
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,040
What's wrong, Dr. Zhang?

616
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,600
Are you unhappy that you can't eat braised pork?

617
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:45,440
I'm thinking about what you mean.

618
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,920
You got it so soon.

619
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,280
What do you think? Learn from me.

620
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,040
Do you feel guilty?

621
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,520
I can see that you shirk your responsibility.

622
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,480
Okay, I know what you want to say.

623
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,600
Just now,

624
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,760
I didn’t choose the Fourth Courtyard for my family.

625
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:01,880
Is it about the Six Courtyard?

626
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,320
You saw it.

627
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,800
the old lady's son and daughter

628
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:05,840
are fighting.

629
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,840
If anything happens to Old Madam,

630
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,480
they will definitely

631
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,240
blame us for it.

632
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,080
Enough.

633
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,840
As your senior,

634
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,120
I'll emphasize three rules of driving.

635
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,000
First,

636
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,280
We'll have to send him to the hospital soon,

637
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:26,240
but you have to respect the family's opinion.

638
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,560
Unless you want to take the thunder.

639
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:28,400
Second,

640
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,840
You can't decide for your family and patient.

641
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,120
I can only make suggestions.

642
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,280
Third,

643
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,240
we must get the family to sign it as evidence.

644
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,680
It's written clearly on the list.

645
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,880
Take responsibility.

646
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:41,280
You said you don't want to take responsibility.

647
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,880
At the crucial moment,

648
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,160
I don't have time to play ball.

649
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,800
What do you mean by that?

650
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,280
When you were

651
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,360
in Cardio Surgery,

652
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,880
the patient's family has to sign this.

653
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,320
the patient's family to sign.

654
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,520
I'll try my best

655
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,520
I'll do my best.

656
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,840
That's my professional ethics.

657
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,840
Who doesn't try their best?

658
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,520
All right, I'm hanging up.

659
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,240
You just haven't suffered enough.

660
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,640
I don't accept that.

661
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,000
Dr. Zhang.

662
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,320
How about this?

663
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:12,600
After that,

664
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,840
I'll leave the car to you.

665
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:15,840
I'll cooperate.

666
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,360
You can do whatever you want.

667
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,240
But let me make it clear.

668
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,040
If you get into trouble, take care of it.

669
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:26,320
No problem.

670
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,840
Excuse me.

671
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,840
Come on. Where did you hurt?

672
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:30,320
Legs.

673
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,080
Can you move your arm?

674
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,400
Right arm left arm

675
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,480
Does it hurt here?

676
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,280
No.

677
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,480
Does it hurt here? No.

678
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:38,600
Here.

679
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:39,480
It hurts.

680
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,320
My bone is broken

681
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,360
Yuan Yuan, get the scissors

682
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,120
I'll straighten this for you slowly

683
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:43,640
Zhang Chi

684
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:51,880
Yuan Yuan, get the clapper

685
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,240
What happened?

686
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,480
Are you hurt anywhere else?

687
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:55,560
Go away!

688
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:56,760
Go away!

689
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:57,800
Don't save me!

690
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:58,760
I don't want to live anymore.

691
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,080
It's just a fight.

692
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,320
Do you want me to die?

693
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,600
If you divorce me,

694
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,640
I'll cut my leg and my wrist tomorrow.

695
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:05,920
I'll jump off the building the day after tomorrow.

696
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:06,520
Go ahead.

697
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:08,360
Don't touch me.

698
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,040
What are you doing?

699
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,520
Are you going to save me or not?

700
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,680
Why don't we save them after you're done arguing?

701
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,560
Of course.

702
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,800
The wound

703
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,760
may hurt the artery.

704
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:16,880
If he bled too much, he'll die.

705
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:17,840
Gauze.

706
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:18,880
Gauze.

707
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,280
Please.

708
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,320
Honey, please don't divorce me.

709
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,120
Please.

710
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:27,480
Hello.

711
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,080
Here's your medical fee and bus fare.

712
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:29,880
Is your family here?

713
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:30,840
Pay the bill.

714
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:31,400
No money.

715
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,160
Who asked you to save me? Ask someone for money.

716
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,000
My pants cost 3,200 yuan.

717
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:38,880
You cut my pants

718
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,080
without my permission.

719
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,360
Don't you understand?

720
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,680
Did I ask you to save me?

721
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,800
He insisted on saving me.

722
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,240
He saved me. Ask him for money.

723
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:49,840
I don't care.

724
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,360
I can pay for your car.

725
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,080
but you have to pay for the pants.

726
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,040
Look at you.

727
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,000
Others work to make money.

728
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:10,080
You worked hard all day.

729
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,080
It's more than 4,000 yuan.

730
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,240
That's rare.

731
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,400
You can't blame me for this.

732
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,600
I'm just giving you some experience.

733
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,600
What did you say?

734
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,520
I'm avoiding responsibility.

735
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,000
I was being kind.

736
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,360
I have no choice.

737
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,280
I can only let you experience it yourself.

738
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,320
You've suffered a mute loss, understand?

739
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,640
But I can understand you.

740
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,760
After all, you were a cardiothoracic surgeon.

741
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,280
We first aid doctors

742
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:43,160
we should bear the pressure we should bear.

743
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,880
Don't be self-doubt.

744
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,400
Emergency is a word.

745
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,120
Anyone

746
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,360
we may encounter

747
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,760
In critical moments, the condition occurred.

748
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,600
What about the family and the patient?

749
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,320
their pressure and emotions.

750
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,000
They can't control themselves.

751
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,760
Then take the first-aid doctor

752
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,800
to vent stress and emotions.

753
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,720
This afternoon

754
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,240
this afternoon.

755
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,760
Don't feel too burdened.

756
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,520
And all accidents

757
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:13,160
can be called an accident.

758
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,240
Especially between doctors and patients.

759
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,640
between doctors and patients.

760
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,480
But what doctor can guarantee

761
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:21,120
that nothing will go wrong?

762
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,760
The machines will break, right?

763
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,680
That's why doctors need to protect themselves

764
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,880
to save more people.

765
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,920
Doctors need to protect themselves.

766
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,160
Let's split up then.

767
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,280
In an emergency,

768
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,080
we are their last hope.

769
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,640
It's not the right choice for a doctor

770
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,080
Is this what a doctor should choose?

771
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:40,240
Jiangdong emergency.

772
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:40,920
Yes.

773
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,800
Dr Zhang is right.

774
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,600
You must stick to yourself

775
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,280
you have to stick to yourself.

776
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:48,320
Come on.

777
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:29,679
You're back.

778
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:32,120
Are you practicing

779
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,159
in the early morning?

780
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:34,760
Stop practicing.

781
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:35,800
You'll get hypoglycemia.

782
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:36,960
It's okay.

783
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,120
Let's move a little.

784
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,159
What did you buy?

785
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:40,920
Look.

786
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,639
Your favorite Eight Treasure Congee.

787
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,960
Qi Qi's favorite bean bun.

788
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:45,960
Eat more later.

789
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:46,600
All done.

790
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:04,200
Qiqi, come down for breakfast.

791
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:04,920
Coming.

792
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:20,960
Qi.

793
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:22,760
Come on.

794
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,760
Your dad bought your favorite bean bun.

795
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,320
Coming.

796
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,280
My daughter is finally here.

797
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,640
Hurry up and have breakfast.

798
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:31,840
Bean bun.

799
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,840
Come on.

800
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,280
Try it.

801
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:34,360
Give me a small one.

802
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:38,600
Is it good?

803
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,160
Yes.

804
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:46,200
You and Fang have been together for seven years.

805
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,920
Your relationship has always been stable.

806
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,440
Why did they break up so easily?

807
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,720
Mom, I'm going out after eating.

808
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:06,480
Master.

809
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,480
I told you to wait for me at the cafe.

810
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,400
Why did you have to come to the center?

811
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,600
You love this place so much?

812
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,240
The air conditioner in the cafe is so hot.

813
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,480
Don't blow on me.

814
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,600
So many colleagues only bought it for me.

815
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,960
You're disgusting, Xu Chengyuan.

816
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,680
I haven't seen you for days. Let me see.

817
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,120
You look really good.

818
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,960
What do you mean? Can I read books every day?

819
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,320
I need to get out to get better.

820
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,960
At least I have a normal rest.

821
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:28,520
Unlike here,

822
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,040
working day and night.

823
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,600
I have to have some free time.

824
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,040
What nonsense are you talking about?

825
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:35,960
Nothing useful.

826
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,120
What do you want from me?

827
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,960
It's about my junior.

828
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,120
I've been doing my best these days.

829
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,480
with all my heart.

830
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,760
But he doesn't do anything.

831
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,760
It's obvious that he's used to being loved

832
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,480
when I was in Cardiac Surgery.

833
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,640
I've never been on the first line of emergency rescue.

834
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:52,240
He doesn't know the complexity of work in front of the hospital.

835
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,640
Forget it if he caused trouble.

836
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,760
but he didn't listen to me.

837
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,360
Compared to me,

838
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,640
compared to me back then.

839
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,080
That's why I asked you to guide him.

840
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,400
to learn from you.

841
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,920
Yes, I know

842
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:04,640
what Master thinks.

843
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,840
I will take good care of him

844
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,120
to relieve his pressure.

845
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,280
Is that all?

846
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,760
You called me here for such a trivial matter.

847
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:11,280
No.

848
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,000
I thought we were at the cafe.

849
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,480
Think about it. We had coffee and chatted.

850
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,200
How can there be so many scenes?

851
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,000
Senior.

852
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,840
Senior, aren't you off today?

853
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,480
He... He brought me here.

854
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,640
I came all the way here.

855
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,200
Xu Chengyuan.

856
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,200
My senior is finally resting.

857
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,400
Why are you torturing her?

858
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,720
No, it's really important.

859
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,120
It's between us.

860
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,120
He's my junior.

861
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,920
I've been taking good care of him these days.

862
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,120
I'm trying to relieve my master's pressure.

863
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,760
You can help others?

864
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,000
Why don't I believe it?

865
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,360
Don't use your greasy trick

866
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,640
on Dr Zhang, okay?

867
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,240
That's right.

868
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:40,280
Look.

869
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,280
How much do you have against me?

870
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,760
Senior, I found that

871
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,920
Zheng Bo has been a little greasy lately.

872
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,720
Zheng Bo is greasy.

873
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,360
Who said I'm greasy?

874
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:49,920
Xu Chengyuan.

875
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,120
He said you are greasy, Bo.

876
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,760
Sister Qi, aren't you off today?

877
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,280
I'm taking a break. I've told you many times.

878
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,200
He dragged me here.

879
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:57,360
Kiki.

880
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,360
Didn't you say you're going to strengthen muscles?

881
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,280
I'm going to the gym.

882
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,280
Do you want to come with me?

883
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,640
I'm wearing makeup today.

884
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:03,480
I can't increase my muscles.

885
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,480
Why are you so rude?

886
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,560
She'll go. You take her, Bo.

887
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,280
She'll go. You take her, Bo.

888
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,640
She is so skinny.

889
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:08,240
She has to go.

890
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:08,800
That's it.

891
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,080
Once I hand over the document,

892
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,840
I'll wait for you in the gym.

893
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,200
Okay, get changed.

894
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,080
Go now. I'm leaving too.

895
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,960
Go and practice. Look how skinny you are.

896
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,680
You've arranged it so well.

897
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:18,080
I'm leaving.

898
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:18,960
What should we do?

899
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:19,960
What should we do?

900
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,520
I'll be off work soon.

901
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,120
What are you doing after work?

902
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,200
Are you going to have fun again?

903
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,560
I didn't say that.

904
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,480
Your face

905
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:27,640
is a face that wants to eat and drink.

906
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,680
You're especially like you in cards today.

907
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,240
I'm the king.

908
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,520
You're a big tortoise.

909
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,240
Master, you've gone too far.

910
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:36,800
Go back to work.

911
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:42,680
Tell me, what do you want to practice?

912
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,240
I think my legs are a little thick.

913
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,560
Can you

914
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,920
help me lose some weight?

915
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,360
Not thick. Very thin.

916
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,680
You can't be thinner.

917
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:54,960
If you lose weight, it'll be like a stick.

918
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,240
You can decorate the legs.

919
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:58,680
You need muscles.

920
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,120
You need strength training.

921
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,200
Do you usually practice?

922
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:01,680
No.

923
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,680
Let's warm up first.

924
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:04,000
Okay.

925
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:04,520
Don't get hurt.

926
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:06,560
This.

927
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,480
Okay look at my pose

928
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,240
Your feet

929
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,360
Wider than shoulder.

930
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,360
15 seconds left.

931
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,920
15 seconds left.

932
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:22,480
Come on.

933
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:25,240
Ten seconds.

934
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,520
No, five seconds.

935
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,920
Come on, give yourself five seconds.

936
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,200
Zheng Bo.

937
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,760
Give Sister Qi five seconds more.

938
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,240
Come on. Come on.

939
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,040
Come on. Ten more seconds.

940
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,360
Ten seconds to the world.

941
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,160
Ten.

942
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,040
Four.

943
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:43,760
Three.

944
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,640

Come here.

983
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:05,920

What is it? Why don't I know?

993
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:37,920
I promised your dad

994
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,480
As long as you're here,

995
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,320
as an emergency doctor for a year,

996
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,800

998
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:49,320
I'm not in the mood for this.
