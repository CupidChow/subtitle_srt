1
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:06,040
National Radio. and Telvison. Administration.

2
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:50,600
Kiki.

3
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,520
Has she been here for a long time?

4
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,720
I just arrived too.

5
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,600
Three glasses of water, please.

6
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:58,920
Sister.

7
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,640
Forget it.

8
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,720
What do you mean?

9
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,280
We...

10
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,920
Who told you to go on a blind date?

11
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,400
Your blind date hasn't come yet.

12
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,160
Don't worry.

13
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,960
Your blind date is someone else.

14
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,600
Well...

15
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,920
Xu. Lu.

16
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,800
Let me introduce.

17
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,360
Zheng Bo, an emergency doctor.

18
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,920
Sun Jiaqi, work in the transfer department.

19
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:50,840
They are

20
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,040
are the most handsome guys in our center.

21
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,640
I won't disturb you.

22
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,800
Take your time.

23
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,040
I'm leaving.

24
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,400
Take care. Okay.

25
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,160
Sister, let me see you off.

26
00:02:59,160 --> 00:02:59,920
All right.

27
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,400
Take your time.

28
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,240
Hello.

29
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,360
My name is Xu Jia.

30
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,920
I'm a local.

31
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,160
My name is Zheng Bo, from another city.

32
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,280
I'm from the northwest.

33
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,400
My name is Lu Zi Hua.

34
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,960
I work in a car sales service shop.

35
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,080
I just got promoted to manager this year.

36
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,840
I'm a local. I have a car and a house.

37
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:17,400
You're a manager so early.

38
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,040
You're really talented.

39
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,480
You're from the northwest? Yes.

40
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:20,840
Yes.

41
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,840
I think northwestern men are great.

42
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,600
and generous.

43
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,840
and manly.

44
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,160
Thank you.

45
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,600
I heard you work in the transfer department.

46
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,480
Are you usually busy at work?

47
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,720
We are like an emergency doctor.

48
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,360
like the first-timer.

49
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,720
There's a problem.

50
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,000
How will you take care of your family after getting married?

51
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,160
How long have you been here?

52
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,040
Did you buy a house?

53
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,160
Not yet.

54
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,240
Do you plan to buy a house?

55
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,520
Not yet.

56
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,400
Because the salary is relatively low.

57
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,920
If not for the time being,

58
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,360
can your parents

59
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,080
help?

60
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:00,720
I

61
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,040
respect my parents' opinions.

62
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,080
As a man, filial piety comes first.

63
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,040
Do you want to change your job?

64
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,600
I heard that a private hospital doctor

65
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,840
earns a lot.

66
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,280
If you come back so late after work,

67
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,280
it will definitely affect their rest.

68
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,160
Am I right?

69
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,959
How's your cooking?

70
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:17,720
Not really.

71
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,240
What you said makes sense.

72
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,040
Right?

73
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,800
I think

74
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,160
getting married

75
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:32,040
is like working together to start a company.

76
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,040
What is this called?

77
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,480
It's called joining hands and complementing resources.

78
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,240
You're right.

79
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,240
Handsome, which

80
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,520
in a car sales service shop?

81
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,520
I want to change a car recently.

82
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,920
I'll take you to the shop tomorrow.

83
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,720
What do you think?

84
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,720
Is there a discount if I see it well?

85
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,440
Of course.

86
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,480
Let's add each other on WeChat.

87
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,840
No problem.

88
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:03,840
Okay.

89
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,720
What kind of car are you driving?

90
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,400
In the end,

91
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,400
we set up a blind date.

92
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,280
Exactly.

93
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,960
We don't meet the standard of choosing a partner.

94
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:17,920
You're right.

95
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,840
I'm so hungry

96
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,840
I'm hungry.

97
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:21,840
I'm hungry.

98
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,640
Let's go eat.

99
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,520
Sure. What should we eat?

100
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,280
Hotpot.

101
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,800
Let's go. My treat.

102
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,240
Let's go.

103
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:27,600
Okay.

104
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,720
Qi.

105
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,520
I won't talk about

106
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,960
about love.

107
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,520
I trust you.

108
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,960
you can handle your personal feelings.

109
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,800
When you want to tell me,

110
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,480
I'm all ears.

111
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,360
Okay.

112
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,400
Qi Qi

113
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,840
Dad and mom are old now

114
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,040
When we were young

115
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:07,280
we lived our lives with our wives and children.

116
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,240
But now I'm old.

117
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,160
I just want to enjoy the joy of the world.

118
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,160
So, Qiqi,

119
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:17,800
You...

120
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,800
should understand me.

121
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,600
Don't think I'm annoying.

122
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,080
Sorry, dad.

123
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,960
I didn't spend much time with you.

124
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,240
Silly girl, why are you apologizing?

125
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,360
We should be grateful now.

126
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:39,400
Look.

127
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,480
your mom and I are in good health.

128
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,840
We are healthy.

129
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,600
You have your own career.

130
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,600
and we can live together.

131
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,159
I'm already satisfied.

132
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,720
But sometimes people

133
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,640
want more.

134
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,400
So don't mind.

135
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,480
I just hope

136
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,280
you can have a good family.

137
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,600
Got it, dad.

138
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,560
Doctor Zhang.

139
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,600
Dan Dan finally has a suitable heart.

140
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,000
The transplant surgery went well.

141
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,680
Really? That's great.

142
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,520
I'll go buy some food.

143
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,640
Okay, thank you

144
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,600
Yang's mom

145
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,720
Why are you here

146
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,640
Come in and have a seat.

147
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,080
I'll go to the canteen to get some food.

148
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,280
We'll talk later.

149
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,240
Okay.

150
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,159
Dr. Zhang, Dr. Qi

151
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,400
How is he?

152
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,400
How is the kid?

153
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,400
Mr. Dai said

154
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,720
the operation went well.

155
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,480
There was no other rejection.

156
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,400
The recovery is also very good.

157
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:02,960
Great.

158
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,280
Dr Zhang has been thinking about it.

159
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,400
Come here when you're free

160
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,240
Why are you here

161
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,240
The heart that Dan Dan matches is her son's.

162
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,320
She just wants to see if her son's heart

163
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,800
is still beating.

164
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,000
But the hospital said

165
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,560
donors and donors

166
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,800
can't know each other's information.

167
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,640
Yes.

168
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,440
It's like this.

169
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,880
But when she heard that this surgery was done in the city,

170
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,440
so she went to every hospital.

171
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,480
and finally found this place.

172
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,679
Actually, I really want to see her.

173
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,960
Thank you for saving my daughter.

174
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:43,960
Actually,

175
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,840
she's Dan Dan's second mother.

176
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,960
With her permission,

177
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,320
my daughter

178
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,960
match her son's heart.

179
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,520
By the way

180
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,160
Yangyang's mom has divorced her husband.

181
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:03,800
Really?

182
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,400
Actually, before the child died,

183
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,040
they had been arguing about divorce.

184
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,600
After the child left

185
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,600
Yangyang's mom lost the backbone

186
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,400
The man has always been weird

187
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,120
It's Yangyang's mom who didn't take good care of the child

188
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,280
He always scolds me when I call him

189
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,240
He always scolds me.

190
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,720
Look at her.

191
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,480
I can't bear to see her like this.

192
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,000
I thought

193
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,600
I brought Dan Dan with me.

194
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,520
If I have one more person to look after Dan Dan,

195
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,480
I'd love to.

196
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,640
And she's been taking care of Dan Dan

197
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,000
like her own child.

198
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,600
I...

199
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,400
What are you thinking?

200
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,800
Secretary, you're here. Have a seat.

201
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:22,680
OK.

202
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,320
Don't call me secretary outside.

203
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,440
We're not in the office.

204
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,080
Liu, Liu, Liu.

205
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,720
I've ordered the dishes. Do you want to take a look?

206
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,320
No.

207
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,200
Waiter, serve the dishes.

208
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,960
You invited me to such a fancy place.

209
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,960
to such a fancy place.

210
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,320
I'm fine.

211
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:46,200
I just have something to tell you.

212
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,080
Okay, I'm all ears.

213
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,800
I went to see Dan Dan today.

214
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:59,040
The girl who had a heart transplant.

215
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:05,040
and met the donor's mother.

216
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,440
That Sunny's mother

217
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:07,960
I knew

218
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,320
Originally,

219
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,320
there was something wrong with their relationship,

220
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,680
but nothing serious.

221
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,680
That's why

222
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:20,200
His mother decided to donate her heart.

223
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,680
They didn't get along because of this.

224
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,600
Then they got divorced.

225
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:29,960
I was thinking

226
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,080
if I was too impulsive.

227
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,320
Now I understand

228
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,800
why Dr. Qi stopped me.

229
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,440
I just wanted to save him.

230
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,560
I didn't expect

231
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,920
something bad would happen.

232
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,280
you may not know.

233
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,680
Qi Tuo

234
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,680
She was even deducted from the bonus.

235
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,680
She didn't tell me.

236
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,080
Yes.

237
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,200
Qi Tuo is such a girl

238
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,960
She has been like this for so many years.

239
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,240
She took the responsibility.

240
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,800
She has to take the responsibility.

241
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:08,720
She

242
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,600
She is a good tutor

243
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,800
and a good doctor.

244
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,480
Thank you.

245
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,440
Okay, let's eat.

246
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,440
Let's eat.

247
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,600
Everyone is here.

248
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,080
Director.

249
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,200
What are you talking about? Let me listen.

250
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,080
Okay.

251
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,440
There's only one purpose for today's meeting

252
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,120
is to invite Dr. Qi

253
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,560
to deliver the spirit of meeting

254
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,200
Let's applaud.

255
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,600
Applause. OK.

256
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,320
Dr. Qi, I'll leave this to you

257
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:04,720
OK

258
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,240
By the way,

259
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,240
Listen carefully.

260
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,720
I have to do a random check.

261
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,080
One more thing.

262
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,120
This Saturday

263
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,960
a marathon competition this Saturday.

264
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,120
Before you get off work,

265
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,840
come to my office

266
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,360
I'll assign the task.

267
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,480
Everyone, get ready.

268
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,480
Got it

269
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:29,800
Let's go.

270
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,320
Alright, let's get out of here.

271
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,600
Sister Qi, that's enough.

272
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,600
That's enough.

273
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,840
Do you think I like to talk?

274
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,680
He said he wanted to do a screening.

275
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,680
At least you know what to do.

276
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,720
Sister Qi, why don't you tell us?

277
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,880
I didn't even listen to it when I went out last time.

278
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,080
Then I'll tell you about it.

279
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,360
You've already been there anyway.

280
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,120
Don't you know about the random check?

281
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,840
The exchange I went this time

282
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,480
by Shiwei Organization.

283
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,480
The main topic is

284
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,200
in dealing with emergency hygiene,

285
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,560
The treatment and plan of the emergency system in front of the hospital.

286
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,840
From the SARS in 2003,

287
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,320
and then

288
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,080
the global avian flu.

289
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,120
I said he was so happy that he fell asleep.

290
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,320
No, I'm listening.

291
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,360
You're so sleepy.

292
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,480
I worked all night.

293
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,560
Can you listen to it?

294
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,720
No, I'm listening.

295
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,200
It's only ten seconds.

296
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,360
I don't like you the most.

297
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,560
You even got a notebook.

298
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,560
Why are you a rabbit again?

299
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,360
What? There's no rabbit?

300
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,120
Just say it.

301
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,480
There's no rabbit.

302
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,720
We are really interested in rabbit.

303
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,360
What rabbit?

304
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,840
She always said the rabbit.

305
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,440
Everyone is paying special attention to the rabbit.

306
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,080
Yeah.

307
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,880
There must be something about this rabbit.

308
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,080
Hello, are you from 4506?

309
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:57,840
Are you Dr. Zhang?

310
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:58,320
Yes.

311
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,080
Here, take it.

312
00:14:59,240 --> 00:14:59,680
Thank you.

313
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,880
I'm not in the mood for a girlfriend.

314
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:08,960
What are you thinking about?

315
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,600
Make money, buy a house.

316
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,880
Stop badmouthing me.

317
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,840
I bought a cream cake.

318
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,640
Share it.

319
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,480
It's rare, Dr. Zhang.

320
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,600
It's the first time you treat us.

321
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,960
Dr. Qi, which one do you like?

322
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,000
I don't eat cream. You guys eat.

323
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,720
My master doesn't like cream. I like it.

324
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:26,360
Thanks.

325
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,200
You're welcome.

326
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:27,960
Give me one.

327
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:29,360
0104577.

328
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,680
Thank you, Chi.

329
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,840
There's more here.

330
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:43,800
Hello.

331
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:44,920
Do you have

332
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,440
without cream?

333
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,240
Sorry, sir.

334
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,080
We don't have one here.

335
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:49,560
Hello.

336
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,800
Do we have

337
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,320
cake without cream, bread,

338
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,280
or cookies.

339
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,520
Sorry, we don't have any here.

340
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,920
What did you buy this time?

341
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,360
It's the first time

342
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,920
It's my first time treating you.

343
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,240
You don't eat cream cake.

344
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,360
I bought cookies again.

345
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,080
I didn't rest at noon.

346
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,360
I ran out to buy it.

347
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,640
This is a soda cookie.

348
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,280
In this cookie,

349
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,920
not cream but butter

350
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,640
And this is not even butter

351
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,240
Pay attention to work.

352
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,360
Don't always think about food.

353
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,760
Eat at least two pieces.

354
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,280
You're a big eater. You can eat both of us.

355
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,120
I'll give you a needle.

356
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,600
Whoever eats well will eat you two.

357
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:53,800
I don't want to learn.

358
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,080
You need to get a needle.

359
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,960
You look so happy, Mr. Cui.

360
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:16,920
Did you get paid?

361
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,720
You're risking your life to drive. The prize is 4,500 yuan.

362
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:22,720
Keep a low profile.

363
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,200
How much?

364
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,359
4,500 yuan.

365
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,440
Cui.

366
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,440
I almost broke my legs this month.

367
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,240
It's only 2,200 yuan.

368
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,320
You should treat us.

369
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,560
Yes, treat us.

370
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,040
We're not picky, Cui.

371
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,240
It's on you.

372
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,960
You can choose milk tea or pizza.

373
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:36,960
We're not picky about food.

374
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,160
Listen to me.

375
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,320
My salary

376
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,440
is only enough for one month's living expenses.

377
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,200
Please let me go.

378
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:45,800
Please.

379
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,280
We're in the ER, we make hard money.

380
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,080
We don't run our own company.

381
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,640
How can I have a high income?

382
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,640
You can still open a company for me.

383
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:57,840
No, no.

384
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,480
Anyway,

385
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,120
high income has nothing to do with emergency doctors.

386
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,760
I'm used to having less income.

387
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,040
The most annoying thing is the title is not good.

388
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,760
You can get a title if you pass the exam.

389
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,800
The problem is you can't pass the exam, Dr. Zhang.

390
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,160
When I took the last exam,

391
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,240
he asked me

392
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,720
how to operate breast cancer.

393
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,600
How would I know?

394
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,720
I'm not from the tumor department.

395
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,520
It doesn't make sense.

396
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,360
This is not completely in the industry, Sister Chen.

397
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,800
Explain it.

398
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,400
Otherwise, we won't be able to talk about it.

399
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,280
We emergency doctors

400
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,120
There's no specific way

401
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,480
there is no specific passage.

402
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,520
So we have to

403
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,120
with the doctors in the hospital.

404
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,120
I chose Internal Medicine last time.

405
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,120
That's the problem.

406
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,120
I got blind.

407
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,000
The advantage of our industry

408
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,720
is that we have manufacturing and stable.

409
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,600
But the salary is a little less.

410
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:51,800
So?

411
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,280
The only one who can stay here

412
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,120
has a car and a house.

413
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,520
Anyway, youngsters from other places

414
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,280
are doomed.

415
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,640
Even dating

416
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,360
in a relationship.

417
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,920
Don't you have a local girlfriend?

418
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:11,800
Besides,

419
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,400
you're the only young doctor in love.

420
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,160
Don't get me involved in everything.

421
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,120
Yeah.

422
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,280
Zheng, you're right.

423
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:19,720
Also,

424
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,800
Earth. Rich.

425
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,720
One word difference is a thousand miles away.

426
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:26,520
Hello, everyone.

427
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:27,360
Secretary

428
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,000
What's wrong?

429
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,920
We usually play together.

430
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,760
What are you doing today?

431
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,000
Let's be sad together.

432
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,920
We're discussing

433
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,120
It's not easy for us to find a boyfriend.

434
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,240
It's okay to assign

435
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,040
it's okay.

436
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,280
Boyfriend.

437
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,520
I'll sign up. Give me one.

438
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,520
Me too.

439
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,240
just to block your photo.

440
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,160
in order to stop your photo.

441
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,000
Milk tea I ordered for you

442
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,160
It'll be here soon.

443
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,040
Cheer up

444
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,080
Thank you, Secretary

445
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,400
Good luck, everyone.

446
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:08,680
Morning.

447
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,520
Delivery again?

448
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,440
Serve the angel in white.

449
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,640
Doctors,

450
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,920
Your milk tea is here.

451
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,920
Milk tea is here.

452
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:27,680
Come on

453
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,640
There are pearls here

454
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,240
I don't want this.

455
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,000
Which one do you want?

456
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,040
I want one with only pearls.

457
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:31,760
Okay, come on.

458
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,520
Here, straw.

459
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,400
Thank you.

460
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,280
This is mine

461
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:34,920
Yours Yours

462
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,000
I'm here to get milk tea.

463
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:39,640
Slowly.

464
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,520
I want this.

465
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:41,800
Dr Zhang.

466
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,240
Thank you

467
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,400
Brother Hua, my...

468
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,320
Dr. Chen

469
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,040
Dr. Chen, your Sachima.

470
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:55,640
Thank you.

471
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,640
Dr. Cui, your plaster.

472
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:58,800
You're finally here.

473
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,640
Zheng Bo didn't get the milk tea.

474
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,440
Here's a Sachima for you.

475
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,440
Dr. Gao.

476
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,920
Your biscuits.

477
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,400
Don't hit me.

478
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,640
Here's your drink.

479
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:17,920
Thank you.

480
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,920
Wasn't Hua Zi a deliveryman?

481
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,520
Why do you still buy things for her?

482
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,800
It's been years.

483
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,400
I often deliver orders here.

484
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,040
You were too busy to go to the supermarket.

485
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,520
So I set up a WeChat group

486
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,920
and brought all the doctors in.

487
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,520
I usually buy some small things

488
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,880
I'll send it here when I deliver the bill.

489
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,520
Doctor Zhang,

490
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,440
I forgot to invite you to the group chat.

491
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,920
Come on, scan it.

492
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,880
You can't always knock on your head.

493
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,440
It's easy for us to save you, you know?

494
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,400
Hang in there.

495
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,440
Look at the sweat.

496
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,880
Okay, got it.

497
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,280
I'll leave you to it.

498
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:50,640
Okay.

499
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:51,880
Thanks.

500
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,160
What's wrong with my memory?

501
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,120
The owner of the milk tea shop gave us a lot of snacks.

502
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:58,920
for you to taste.

503
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,800
Enjoy.

504
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,000
I'm leaving. There's another order.

505
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:02,640
Bye. Bye.

506
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,320
Bye.

507
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:03,840
Thank you, Hua Zi.

508
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:04,760
Be careful.

509
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,040
Everyone gets a share.

510
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,680
Here you are.

511
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:09,920
Save one for yourself.

512
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,680
What's that? I want one too.

513
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,800
I'll save one for Ming.

514
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,400
050350

515
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,280
Qi Tuo is such a girl

516
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,280
She takes the responsibility.

517
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,800
She shouldered it herself.

518
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,360
It's easy to fold when it's tough.

519
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,360
You need to do things in a way.

520
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,160
Don't rush forward with your head.

521
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,320
We can't decide

522
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,920
We can't decide anyone's life or death.

523
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,800
We can't control other people's choices.

524
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,440
Right?

525
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,840
We can only do what we can do.

526
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,360
Am I right?

527
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,320
You made it this time.

528
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,240
you should thank her.

529
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,080
She worked for you

530
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,240
at Yangyang's mom's place.

531
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,080
She did more than you thought.

532
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,680
She is a good tutor

533
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,840
and a good doctor.

534
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:41,440
Ladies and gentlemen,

535
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,680
What you are seeing now

536
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,240
is the scene of Jiangdong marathon.

537
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,200
Follow our camera and you can see

538
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,440
players from different countries

539
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,320
are warming up before the game.

540
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,480
and our medical team volunteers

541
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,680
are ready.

542
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,320
I believe today’s game

543
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,680
will be a success.

544
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,440
This marathon competition has full marathon.

545
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,200
Half-marathon mini marathon

546
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,240
Three games.

547
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,560
Do you have anything to say to your daughter?

548
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,200
Keep it up and do your best.

549
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,960
The youngest twelve and the oldest 47 years old.

550
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,800
Finally 219 people

551
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,800
stood behind me on the starting line.

552
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,720
Among the five foreign players,

553
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,720
from Kenya, America,

554
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,200
Russia, Norway and other countries.

555
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:15,560
Wang City.

556
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,280
Help Yuan Yuan pack her things.

557
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,800
Don't have empty cups

558
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:19,680
Pour it.

559
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,720
Don't lose anything.

560
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:25,800
What are you looking at?

561
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,240
You scared me.

562
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,960
Sister Qi can't see you again.

563
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,440
Who told you I'm looking at my master?

564
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,960
You're lucky this year.

565
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,560
I left the air conditioner on you.

566
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,240
No, last year Sister Ding and the car...

567
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,080
didn't get to drink any water from the beginning to the end.

568
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,240
What good luck is this

569
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:43,960
Right.

570
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,600
You have diarrhea and vomiting.

571
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,840
What muscle injury?

572
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,320
Low blood sugar is too much.

573
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,280
But this is what we do.

574
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,080
You're right.

575
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,760
Although this advocates national sports,

576
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,280
but marathon

577
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,280
Everyone is in the age stage.

578
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,360
There aren't so many high-intensity training.

579
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:01,760
It's easy to get into trouble.

580
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,040
The game is about to start.

581
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,320
Let's look forward to your performance.

582
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,520
On your mark.

583
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,040
So excited. Come on, come on.

584
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,480
Ready.

585
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:16,080
Come on! Come on! Come on!

586
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,320
It's starting.

587
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,520
Watch this side.

588
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,480
Okay, I'll get back to work.

589
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,160
They're leaving.

590
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,160
Hurry up.

591
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,040
You...

592
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:37,720
Don't get heatstroke.

593
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,160
Volunteer.

594
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,000
Drink more water.

595
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,160
Xu Chengyuan's team, Xu Chengyuan's group.

596
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,080
Copy that.

597
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,680
The second point ahead is muscle strain.

598
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,000
Okay.

599
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:14,800
Hurry, Yuan Er.

600
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:15,840
Take everything.

601
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:16,200
Okay.

602
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,440
Okay, let's go.

603
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,120
Let me see.

604
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,920
Is there any other problem?

605
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,200
No.

606
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,000
You must have cramps.

607
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,120
Stretch. Relax.

608
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:37,920
Hang in there.

609
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,640
Here, spray the medicine for him.

610
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:41,720
Okay.

611
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:45,880
Medical staff.

612
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,680
Okay, better?

613
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:49,560
Much better.

614
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,960
Get in the car and take a rest.

615
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,160
We need to control it now.

616
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,080
No, no. I have to continue.

617
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,160
The marathon spirit never breaks.

618
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,120
You can't go now.

619
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,160
Why won't he listen to me?

620
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:05,960
Seriously.

621
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:07,920
Are you okay?

622
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,120
Do you feel uncomfortable?

623
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,120
I feel chest tightness.

624
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:12,920
I can't breathe.

625
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,160
I know. You have a heart disease.

626
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,920
I'm only 25.

627
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,160
There's no heart disease.

628
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,960
You tend to die of sudden exercises.

629
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,080
If your heart can't handle it, you'll get sick.

630
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,600
It has nothing to do with age.

631
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,000
No hurry.

632
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,560
I'll CPR. Lie down.

633
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:25,920
Don't move.

634
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:26,600
Leave it to me.

635
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,200
What are you doing?

636
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,400
Stop!

637
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,600
Doctor, you're here.

638
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,760
I'm going to give him CPR.

639
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,120
He's not breathing. Get him a defibrillation.

640
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,120
He's fine.

641
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,600
He can talk and move.

642
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,880
What CPR are you doing?

643
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,200
Lie down.

644
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:31,440
Go.

645
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,080
200 joules.

646
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:42,600
Here, rubber.

647
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,120
Move.

648
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:03,360
You're awake.

649
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,320
How are you?

650
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,640
I'm fine.

651
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:08,840
His heartbeat is normal.

652
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,880
His lungs can't hold it.

653
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,040
He had a cardiac arrest.

654
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,320
You keep pressing him.

655
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,880
You're a good guy.

656
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,400
Doctor, luckily you're here.

657
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,880
Otherwise, my life will be in his hands.

658
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,360
All right.

659
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,560
Take a rest.

660
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,440
Give him some water.

661
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,560
Three, two, one.

662
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,520
0059 was sent to the hospital and quit.

663
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,200
What's wrong?

664
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:54,800
Hurry up, doctor.

665
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,200
Son, wake up, son.

666
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,240
Excuse me

667
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,760
Excuse me.

668
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,480
He has no heartbeat.

669
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,560
I just pressed his chest.

670
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,280
Look

671
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,200
When did you do it

672
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,280
You just pressed it, right?

673
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:07,680
Yes.

674
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:08,760
Got it?

675
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,600
There's a pulse in the carotid artery.

676
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:10,680
There's ups and downs in his chest.

677
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:12,720
I got it. I'm back.

678
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,440
Huang, stretcher.

679
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,480
Copy that.

680
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,080
How do you feel now?

681
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:18,600
What's wrong?

682
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,840
Come, lift your arm.

683
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:20,560
Yes, raise your arm.

684
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,280
Right arm.

685
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,000
Where does it hurt?

686
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:23,680
Show me.

687
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,960
Here it hurts here

688
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:25,880
This position, right?

689
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,120
Yes.

690
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:26,800
Okay, don't move.

691
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:27,800
Does it hurt?

692
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:28,280
It hurts.

693
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,280
Does it hurt like this?

694
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,000
Okay, don't touch him.

695
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,040
Does it hurt like this? It hurts.

696
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,240
Does it still hurt?

697
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,680
I think my ribs are broken.

698
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,680
My ribs are broken.

699
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,520
My son was fine when he came out.

700
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,480
How could his ribs break?

701
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,600
I saw you pressing him just now.

702
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,120
Did you break it?

703
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:45,600
Uncle.

704
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,600
I don't know.

705
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,040
I didn't mean it.

706
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,760
Just say you didn't mean it.

707
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,880
Are you crazy?

708
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,240
Are you saving people or harming people?

709
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,280
I'll beat you to death.

710
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:55,720
Calm down.

711
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,240
How could you do this?

712
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,560
He saved your son and you hit him.

713
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,680
I'll call the police if you keep doing this.

714
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,720
Go ahead.

715
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,120
Call the police to judge.

716
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,800
Can you calm down?

717
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:05,000
Rib fractures are complications of CPR.

718
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,040
It's normal.

719
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:08,040
The most important thing now is to save his heartbeat.

720
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,240
He's fine now.

721
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,200
What's important?

722
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:10,960
You are on the same side.

723
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,120
I'm in the marathon now.

724
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,800
The fourth rest point. Yes.

725
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:15,800
I'm a doctor.

726
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,800
The patient's family is making trouble.

727
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:17,800
We can't miss any of them.

728
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:18,560
Listen to me.

729
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,960
Article 184 of the Civil Law:

730
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,120
due to voluntary emergency rescue,

731
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,560
[due to voluntarily]

732
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,480
Rescue doesn't bear civil responsibilities.

733
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,080
Okay.

734
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,400
We know the basic situation.

735
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,560
What do you want to do?

736
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,320
Pay me. Pay me.

737
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:41,800
That's right.

738
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,120
We can't pay for it.

739
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,000
Why?

740
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,400
My son broke his rib for nothing.

741
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,480
Don't you know the law of good people?

742
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,760
What is good law?

743
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:53,000
According to the Rule of the People's Republic of China,

744
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,400
Article 184,

745
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,680
[due to rescuing,]

746
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,480
[and caused damage to the victims.]

747
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,560
The rescue doesn't have to bear civil responsibilities.

748
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,000
Is there such a law?

749
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:02,840
Of course.

750
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,560
The law is to protect

751
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,600
to protect those who are righteous.

752
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:08,400
Don't worry about being a good person and being extorted.

753
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,120
Something like this happened before.

754
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:10,960
It's on the news.

755
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,080
The court sentenced the rescuer not to blame.

756
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:14,280
What do you think?

757
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,480
Are you going to sue him or not?

758
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,600
Forget it.

759
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:21,600
This is great.

760
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,640
Look, it's so hot.

761
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,680
He volunteered to volunteer

762
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,080
and saved your son.

763
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,440
Look at this.

764
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,640
You didn't say thank you.

765
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:30,920
Why did you hit him?

766
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,160
You even asked for compensation.

767
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,320
You disappointed me, you know?

768
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,840
If this kind of social style

769
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:37,800
If you grow up,

770
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,480
no one dares to do good deeds in the future.

771
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,560
to do good deeds in the future?

772
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,920
Enough. Apologize to him.

773
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,280
Go to see your kids.

774
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:45,480
Sorry.

775
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,720
Let's go and look at the kids.

776
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,560
What kind of attitude is that?

777
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,440
Thank you, officer.

778
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,040
Thank you, doctors.

779
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,320
Without you,

780
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,640
I wouldn't be able to explain

781
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,720
I can't explain.

782
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,080
We should thank you.

783
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,600
If you hadn't saved him in time,

784
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,720
that person would have died.

785
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,680
All right, go back to work.

786
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:04,280
Okay.

787
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,040
Okay, go ahead.

788
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:07,680
Okay, thank you.

789
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:08,280
Let's go.

790
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,080
Master.

791
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,800
I heard from this radio that

792
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,280
Someone's making trouble again. Are you okay?

793
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,200
The police came to teach us a lesson.

794
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:27,720
It's done.

795
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:28,560
That's good.

796
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,520
Dr Xu, you didn't see

797
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,560
Dr Zhang was so handsome just now.

798
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:32,200
You know what?

799
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,920
The family is going to hit someone.

800
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,720
Dr Zhang is standing right in front.

801
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,160
According to the civil law,

802
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,720
according to the civil law.

803
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,760
That's enough.

804
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,960
Sure.

805
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,240
Dr. Zhang, you're amazing.

806
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,240
Stop talking. Hurry up.

807
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,480
Let's go. There's something else.

808
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:46,760
Zhang Chi, wait.

809
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,680
Sister, let me put that down.

810
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:49,480
Well,

811
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,040
if anything happens to my master,

812
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,520
if anything happens to my master.

813
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:53,960
Do you like her?

814
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,680
What does it have to do with you?

815
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,240
Why do you report it if you don't like me?

816
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:03,520
Shall we go?

817
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,400
Hurry up.

818
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,320
Stop chatting. Hurry up.

819
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,600
Don't forget, don't forget, hurry.

820
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:11,400
Nothing good happens when you come.

821
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:12,320
Hurry up.

822
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:21,120
Come on, try my cooking.

823
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,760
Especially this one.

824
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,679
It's just lettuce

825
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,960
Look at the sauce.

826
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,880
I learned it from the Internet. I just learned it.

827
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:28,679
Is it different?

828
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:29,600
It's different. Try it.

829
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:36,400
How is it?

830
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:38,760
Is it okay?

831
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,960
It's delicious. It's different from before.

832
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:41,480
Yes.

833
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,400
There are so many things to learn online.

834
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,320
Let me tell you.

835
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,040
There's something you need to cooperate with me.

836
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:48,960
What?

837
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,239
Look, I downloaded it online.

838
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,480
I found a couple for Qiqi.

839
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:54,880
Give me some advice.

840
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:58,880
I think

841
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,040
they won't like any of them.

842
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,760
We have to find a way.

843
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,680
She's not young anymore.

844
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,240
She just broke up with her boyfriend.

845
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,760
What if she can't jump out?

846
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,400
Young people

847
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,520
get along with each other.

848
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,320
If we don't get along, we'll break up.

849
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,840
Isn't that normal?

850
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:20,840
Look.

851
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:26,120
In terms of age, appearance, occupation,

852
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,480
physical condition,

853
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,520
[Family background]

854
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:29,600
hobbies and hobbies.

855
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,520
I've set 14 standards.

856
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,560
I've listed

857
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:39,560
the best young man

858
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,320
in all blind dates.

859
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,320
Score according to the audition.

860
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,560
One by one.

861
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,440
They are really outstanding.

862
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,120
I'm not lying.

863
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,520
Daughter slave.

864
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,440
I can't do anything about you.

865
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,960
Don't you know what happened to your daughter?

866
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,040
Which one do you think she will like?

867
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,720
What do you think of Qu?

868
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,760
The one who runs a media company.

869
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,520
Don't get involved.

870
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,680
Just let them get in touch.

871
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,240
Right?

872
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,840
It doesn't have to be a result.

873
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:14,800
right?

874
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,360
Whatever

875
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,240
Okay.

876
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,320
Come on, let’s eat.

877
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,200
Mr. Qu, are you done?

878
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:28,520
Qi.

879
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,640
Well, pay the bill for last month.

880
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,600
What's the hurry?

881
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,040
Come on.

882
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,400
Sit down and have some tea.

883
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:39,920
Qu.

884
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:41,760
Look.

885
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,480
How is Qi Qi?

886
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,520
Qi Qi is good

887
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,360
Personality, personality, no doubt

888
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:54,840
What if you get along with each other

889
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,960
and let me be your son-in-law?

890
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,800
Fine. It's not appropriate.

891
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:00,960
Are you

892
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,640
look down on Qi?

893
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,800
No, not really

894
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,240
I'm not good enough for Qi Tuo

895
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,640
That's it

896
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:08,920
In a few days,

897
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,080
you can invite her

898
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,400
to dinner.

899
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,360
Let me know if you need help.

900
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:14,760
Remember.

901
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,240
The relationship

902
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,200
little by little.

903
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,120
Well,

904
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:22,200
I have to treat Qi Tuo to a meal.

905
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,480
I've always wanted to make

906
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,520
a series of short videos about the emergency center.

907
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,120
We'll need Qi Tuo's help then.

908
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:28,840
Okay, I'll tell her.

909
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,760
I'll go home next time

910
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,520
I'll cook myself.

911
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,960
Let me show you my cooking.

912
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:34,640
Okay.

913
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,320
0106 Train Team.

914
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,080
Unit 2, Building 12, Xinhai Community.

915
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,320
An old man has a heart condition.

916
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,240
Please go there immediately.

917
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:05,920
Oh my god

918
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:07,080
Dr. Qi

919
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:08,640
Wait a moment.

920
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:09,640
The noodles will be ready soon.

921
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:10,520
No hurry

922
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,240
No hurry, Mr. Liang.

923
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:18,080
Dr. Zhang, this red blood is a medal.

924
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:18,960
Did I?

925
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:19,800
No.

926
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,920
Listen to me. I'm right.

927
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,160
Why are you still so enthusiastic?

928
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,120
I'm teaching her.

929
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,240
The buns are cooked. Hurry up.

930
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:28,920
Eat it while it's hot.

931
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,520
Aunt Mao, Uncle Liu.

932
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:33,920
You're early.

933
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:34,640
Morning.

934
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,680
You're early

935
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,640
Hello

936
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:39,800
So early.

937
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,120
What kind of stuffing is that?

938
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,200
Meat and vegetable. Do you want some?

939
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,840
I'd better eat noodles.

940
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,200
Noodles are more important.

941
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,800
Mr. Liu, what's wrong?

942
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:53,200
I've told you many times.

943
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,800
As long as I open this restaurant,

944
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,360
your buns will be free.

945
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,120
Thank you so much.

946
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:00,680
Thank you so much.

947
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,760
It's okay. Okay.

948
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:02,480
Bye, Aunt Mao.

949
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,080
Dr. Qi, we're leaving.

950

954
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,200

955
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:14,640
Coming

956
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,320

959
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,920
Mr. Liang is quite nice

960
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,120
It's been over two years

961
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:30,240
Two years ago, we left a car

962
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,520
at 4 or 5 a.m.

963
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,120
Looking for food everywhere

964
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,360
We are hungry.

965
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:36,800
We couldn't find anywhere.

966
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,400
Come here and see the light is on.

967
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,480
We rushed here.

968
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,480
The lights are on.

969
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,840
but they're not open yet.

970
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,080
We said we should eat something.

971
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,400
We're in the ER.

972
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,080
Sit down.

973
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,520
Use the fastest speed

974
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,000
to serve us a bowl of hot noodles.

975
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,360
This is for us.

976
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,480
Since then,

977
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,000
he took one hour

978
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,040
for an hour.

979
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,040
Open the door at four.

980
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,240
It means

981
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,360
he has to get up at two or three.

982
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,480
It's okay to get up early.

983
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,280
I happened to get stuck

984
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,480
The time is stuck.

985
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,480
They didn't have breakfast so early.

986
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,240
They came over

987
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,280
Mr Liang gave them buns for free

988
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,800
Mr. Liang

989
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,000
Really

990
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,040
This is so warm.

991
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:15,560
Right?

992
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,360
I think this is the transmission of love.

993
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:19,920
Mr. Liang

994
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:22,240
two or three hours to sleep every day

995
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,880
He passed his love to us.

996
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,920
to Aunt Mao and Uncle Liu.

997
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:27,600
But Uncle Liu

998
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,720
pass love to people who walk this street.

999
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
The streets are clean.

1000
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,040
Then we eat well.

1001
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:34,680
We pass this love to the patient again.

1002
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,600
You should be a secretary, Secretary Jang.

1003
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:39,120
Well said.

1004
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,360
Is that what I said?

1005
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,240
Yes.

1006
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,440
Who is it so early?

1007
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,000
You have a boyfriend?

1008
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,040
email.

1009
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,360
They sent me an email.

1010
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,280
What? You scared me.

1011
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,000
What email?

1012
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,120

1013
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,360
received my assignment.

1014
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,040
They're very interested.

1015
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,360
They asked me to send you the details.

1016
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,360
Really?

1017
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:01,800
