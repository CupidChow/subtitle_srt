Building 801, Jinyue Hai Community

4
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,280
An old man is suspected to have gas poisoning.

5
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,120
Please go there now.

6
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:46,720
Be careful. Be careful.

7
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:50,800
What's going on?

8
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:51,720
Who called 120?

9
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,720
It's her son.

10
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,720
It smells like gas.

11
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,640
Her son told me

12
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,920
when he called his mom,

13
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,560
he suddenly stopped.

14
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,800
Let me see.

15
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,280
We're neighbors.

16
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,920
I have his spare key.

17
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,000
When I opened the door,

18
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,199
I found a strong smell of gas.

19
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,200
So I opened the window quickly

20
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,480
and shut the gas valve.

21
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,280
Thank you.

22
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,560
You did a good job.

23
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,480
Are you living alone at home?

24
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,560
No.

25
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,200
Mom.

26
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,360
Mom!

27
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,480
Mom!

28
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:23,079
Mom, what's wrong?

29
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,360
Doctor, how is my mom?

30
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,360
She's suffering from hypoxia.

31
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,920
It's cerebral edema caused by hypoxia.

32
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,360
Build an artery.

33
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,480
Inject sweet dew.

34
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,280
Mom.

35
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:30,920
Put her down first.

36
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,160
Is there only an old man living here?

37
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,360
My wife.

38
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,280
Three kids.

39
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,800
Where are your wife and three kids?

40
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,720
My wife called and said she's going home today.

41
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,079
The kids went back with her.

42
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,840
Are you sure there's no one else at home?

43
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,360
I'm sure.

44
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,079
She called and told me herself.

45
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,920
Save my mom, mom.

46
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,079
Okay, don't worry.

47
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,800
We will do our best.

48
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,560
Mom, hang in there.

49
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,440
Fire!

50
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,360
Save my mom! Mom!

51
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,280
Help my mom!

52
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,040
Don't worry. We're dealing with it.

53
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,480
Well...

54
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,560
How about this?

55
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,000
check each room?

56
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,200
I'm sure.

57
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,800
My wife called me this morning.

58
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,920
Just in case.

59
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:20,960
Okay.

60
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,920
Come on stretcher

61
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,960
Slowly.

62
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:28,680
Sanbao.

63
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,720
Sanbao! Sanbao!

64
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,240
Son, why are you here?

65
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,120
Sanbao!

66
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,520
Doctor, please save my son.

67
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,400
Come on. Don't worry. Come on.

68
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,720
Don't worry. Let me see.

69
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:45,800
Zhang Chi.

70
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,640
Luckily you were careful today.

71
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,560
Otherwise, we wouldn't have found that kid.

72
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,800
the consequences would be unimaginable.

73
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:51,920
No.

74
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,800
Doctor! Doctor!

75
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,240
Doctor! Doctor!

76
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,480
Thank you. Thank you.

77
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,400
Hurry up.

78
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,840
You saved our family.

79
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,240
Get up.

80
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,240
Thank you

81
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:01,640
0062020.

82
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,640
The doctor said

83
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,400
both have gas poisoning.

84
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,960
Especially my son is too young.

85
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,720
If you hadn't found it in time,

86
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,800
maybe this time...

87
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,520
I can't save him.

88
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,480
Thank you. Thank you.

89
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,560
Thank you. Thank you.

90
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,720
Jiangdong EMSS emergency.

91
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,920
Zhang Chi is back.

92
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:38,920
You...

93
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,480
What are you doing?

94
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,880
No, I'm making some color.

95
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,040
And it's useful.

96
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,240
If we play on the sofa for a while,

97
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,440
Cover it and you won't catch a cold.

98
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,360
Well, in a man's house,

99
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,320
This is too garish.

100
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,680
Men and women?

101
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,000
Isn't that human?

102
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,560
You're like a vampire.

103
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,800
like a vampire.

104
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,480
I'll keep it if you don't like it.

105
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,240
I'll put it away.

106
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,360
Don't. I've already bought it.

107
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:06,640
Just put it here.

108
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,240
That's right. It's beautiful.

109
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,800
Get some flowers.

110
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:41,920
Mr. Cui.

111
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:42,920
Thank you.

112
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:43,800
See you tomorrow.

113
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,400
See you tomorrow.

114
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:44,960
Bye.

115
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,120
Hello, honey.

116
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,000
What?

117
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,760
OK. I’m coming.

118
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,760
Honey, what happened to Tony?

119
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,760
What happened? Tell me.

120
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,520
How dare you ask?

121
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,880
Choi Woo-myung.

122
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,800
How many times did I call you?

123
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,040
but you didn’t answer any of them.

124
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,280
If anything happens to Tony,

125
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,640
I’ll die.

126
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,800
What happened to Tony?

127
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,040
Tell me.

128
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:37,280
When the kid goes down the stairs at school,

129
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:37,480
The kid fell down the stairs

130
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,560
I fell down.

131
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,760
I was fine

132
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,280
but suddenly vomited in class.

133
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,240
When he was sent to the hospital,

134
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,760
He was still conscious at first.

135
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,720
After the CT scan, [Electronic CT scan]

136
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,880
His condition suddenly worsened.

137
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,280
The child passed out immediately.

138
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,520
It's confirmed.

139
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,400
It's the subarachnoid bleeding, 62020.

140
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,520
It's a subarachnoid hemorrhage.

141
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,280
The baby is still in the emergency room.

142
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,159
This is a critical notice.

143
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:57,320
We need his family's signature.

144
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,480
The attending doctor is in there to save the child.

145
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,400
I wanted to take my guardian to sign it.

146
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,200
But the mother refused to go.

147
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,240
If you don't come,

148
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,440
your treatment will be delayed.

149
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,680
I won't sign it.

150
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,040
Don't sign it for me.

151
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,440
Nurse.

152
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,320
Tony will be fine.

153
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,720
He can’t be in critical condition.

154
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,960
He'll get better. We can't sign it.

155
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,400
Honey, don't do this.

156
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,800
This is the hospital rule. You must sign it.

157
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,520
You can't sign it.

158
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,800
No.

159
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,960
Don't do this, honey.

160
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,240
Tony can't be in critical condition.

161
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,200
He is only ten years old.

162
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,480
He's only in third grade.

163
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,080
I usually take care of his family.

164
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,840
There are four old people and Tony.

165
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,320
I accompany him to school and after school,

166
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,920
I cooked for him and studied with him.

167
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,120
What did you do?

168
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,200
Marrying you is no different from being a single mother.

169
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,600
Take care of those people and save them.

170
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:57,720
Why don't you save your son?

171
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,760
Tell me.

172
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,680
I think everyone has heard.

173
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,680
What about Cui's child?

174
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,960
He needs brain surgery.

175
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,960
He's still in ICU. Observe?

176
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,240
So I gave him a few days off.

177
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,480
Thank you

178
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,200
for the time being.

179
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,320
Qiqi, you just came back.

180
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,320
Adjust your work state.

181
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,320
Okay, no problem.

182
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,240
Okay, let's start the meeting now.

183
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:32,840
Director.

184
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,919
Cui, I gave you a holiday.

185
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,480
I asked you to spend more time with your child.

186
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,440
No need.

187
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,120
My wife and parents

188
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,320
are with them in the hospital.

189
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,360
There are so many patients waiting for me every day.

190
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,720
I should go to work.

191
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,920
I have to stick to my position, right?

192
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,720
Let's continue the meeting.

193
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,960
Okay, let's continue the meeting.

194
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,240
We

195
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,240
need to be improved.

196
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,080
The first point of improvement is...

197
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:15,720
It's okay, Cui.

198
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,680
Improve everyone's legal awareness.

199
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,480
and provide medical safety education

200
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,160
and reduce medical errors.

201
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:31,840
Mr. Dai.

202
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:32,680
Sorry.

203
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,880
I came without saying goodbye.

204
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,080
I really need your help.

205
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,200
How big is it?

206
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,280
It's something urgent.

207
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,040
My colleague at 120

208
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,320
His son fell down

209
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,280
fell down the stairs of the school.

210
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,320
Now the diagnosis is

211
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,160
a traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage.

212
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,640
He needs surgery right away.

213
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,440
I know I shouldn't trouble you.

214
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,320
But when his son died,

215
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,800
when his son died.

216
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:54,840
We're all doctors.

217
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:55,840
This is a doctor's child.

218
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,560
doctors can't save their children.

219
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,440
So I want you

220
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,880
recommend me the most authoritative doctor in this field.

221
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,600
Please show me the way.

222
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,120
Let's take him to the hospital.

223
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,000
Chi, don't worry.

224
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,840
I understand how you feel.

225
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,360
I understand what you mean.

226
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,600
Let me ask Professor Wu.

227
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,120
He's in this field. He must know.

228
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,480
Thank you, Director. Thank you.

229
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,200
Don't worry.

230
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,640
I'll call him now.

231
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,360
Yuan Yuan

232
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,120
Remember to fill the oxygen bag.

233
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,240
Okay.

234
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,520
Cui, take Xu's place later.

235
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,120
Okay.

236
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,720
Xu, go to the north of the city.

237
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,000
Why should I go to the north?

238
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,720
The old man is dying.

239
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,720
The family called.

240
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,240
I'll make sure you come.

241
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,160
Sir.

242
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,600
He gave up on treatment.

243
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,520
from ICU

244
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,880
from ICU.

245
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,000
Why do you want to see me?

246
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,200
I don't know the details.

247
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,000
Since it's the old man's will,

248
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,160
you should go.

249
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,240
By the way, watch your attitude.

250
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,600
It's really not going to happen this time.

251
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:24,880
Cui.

252
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,840
The patient I saved yesterday.

253
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,200
Come in.

254
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,960
Hello, everyone.

255
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:15,080
I'm a doctor at 120 Emergency Center.

256
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:15,960
Xu Chengyuan.

257
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,880
My mom

258
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,840
wants you to come closer.

259
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,560
She has something to tell you.

260
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:28,840
Grandma.

261
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,160
Just say it.

262
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,560
I'm listening.

263
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,200
Kid,

264
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,800
I don't blame you for this.

265
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,960
I've educated them.

266
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,800
I know.

267
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,600
no matter what the result is,

268
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:01,000
your intention is to save people.

269
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:05,480
You can't blame the doctor

270
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,600
just because you can't save me.

271
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,200
If the doctor is punished,

272
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:18,680
how can we save more people?

273
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,400
A few years ago,

274
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:25,040
my wife was working in the lab.

275
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,400
and almost died.

276
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:35,520
Thanks to the rescue of 120,

277
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,720
we got him back from the Grim Reaper.

278
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:46,840
Although he left after that,

279
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,520
I...

280
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:54,800
I always want to thank you in person.

281
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,360
Doctor.

282
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,000
Thank you.

283
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,240
Thank you.

284
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,400
Hello.

285
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,080
Hello, Physician Xu. I'm Nurse Liu.

286
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,240
Mrs. Mu passed away.

287
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,200
Mr. Cui's son is getting surgery.

288
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,960
I hope it goes well.

289
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,960
Chi, why is he in a daze?

290
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,720
I've never seen Yuanzhi so thoughtful.

291
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,040
to come to worship him.

292
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,680
Do you remember the story

293
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,720
about my teaching teacher?

294
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,720
I think I've met

295
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,480
who can cure my whole life.

296
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,440
So I'm here to thank her.

297
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,120
Actually, everyone

298
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,800
as reckless and passionate as Zheng Bo

299
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:39,200
I was as reckless and passionate as Zheng Bo.

300
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,680
I’ve suffered a lot in the past three years.

301
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,480
I have accumulated

302
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,120
to avoid risks.

303
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,600
In the center,

304
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,720
I'm quite satisfied.

305
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,360
because I've been following the rules and regulations.

306
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,520
I never cross the line.

307
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,440
Because I want to protect myself.

308
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,800
But when I think about it,

309
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,720
if I held on a little longer,

310
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,040
will things get better?

311
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,920
Being an emergency doctor

312
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,760
is to steal people from God.

313
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:11,680
Yuan,

314
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,280
you've done a good job.

315
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,200
You have to protect yourself

316
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,720
to save others.

317
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,920
Grandma Mu and grandpa are great.

318
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,480
They are not only achievements,

319
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,040
but also contributions.

320
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,280
and the greatness of personality

321
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,440
and the generosity and expectation for juniors.

322
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:39,720
I've decided.

323
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,720
I can't just protect myself.

324
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,720
I want to cherish

325
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,720
I want to cherish their lives

326
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,200
and do more things

327
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,400
for them.

328
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,200
What Chengyuan said just now

329
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,440
reminds me of what I said

330
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,400
I saved with Qi Tuo.

331
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,280
She said doctors treat patients equally.

332
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,400
But I hope

333
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,920
care more about my dad.

334
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,280
For you,

335
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,280
my dad

336
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,119
is one of thousands of patients.

337
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,119
But to me,

338
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:20,800
he is the only one

339
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,440
As doctors,

340
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,440
we should be more patient

341
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,599
and be more patient.

342
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,200
It reminds me of my grandpa.

343
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,400
I chose to be an emergency doctor

344
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,920
because of grandpa's accident.

345
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,600
And I think

346
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,600
everyone we saved is meaningful.

347
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,520
It's so important to our country.

348
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,760
It means a lot to the family.

349
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,440
And when every patient

350
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,800
every patient,

351
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,280
we were with them.

352
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,720
I feel proud too.

353
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,200
Come on.

354
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,440
Let's bow to the two elders.

355
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:56,280
Come on.

356
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,400
Chi.

357
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,440
Dr Cui's son's surgery went well.

358
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,240
He was transferred from ICU

359
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,800
to a general ward.

360
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,480
Thank goodness.

361
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,520
Thank you so much.

362
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,160
This is 15. Yes, 15.

363
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,400
Sister-in-law.

364
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,680
Hello, Dr. Qi, Mrs. Lin.

365
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,320
Coming.

366
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,080
This is a little gift from our colleagues.

367
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:48,520
Thank you.

368
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,720
Dr Zhang, take a seat.

369
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,360
It's okay. I won't sit.

370
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,360
Tony, how are you?

371
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,360
Feeling better?

372
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:54,920
Aunt Qi Qi

373
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,640
Thank you for coming.

374
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:57,720
You're welcome.

375
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,400
How do you feel today, Tony?

376
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,880
It doesn't hurt at all.

377
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,360
I feel better now.

378
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,040
But my mom won't let me leave the hospital.

379
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,400
Tony, be good.

380
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,560
You’re seriously injured.

381
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,400
Wait for a few days.

382
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,160
Let's play a little longer.

383
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,520
Who is he?

384
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,480
Is he also my dad's colleague?

385
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,800
He's your dad's new colleague. Call him Uncle Zhang.

386
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,160
Hello, Uncle Zhang.

387
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,720
This kid is so polite.

388
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,760
Don't move your head.

389
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,000
Yes, don't move your head.

390
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:24,920
Let me tell you.

391
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,920
you owe it to Uncle Zhang.

392
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,440
Dr Zhang, thank you.

393
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,920
I heard them say

394
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,360
you were the one

395
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,920
and asked a reliable doctor in time.

396
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,280
and operated on Tony.

397
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,760
Our family

398
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,880
forever.

399
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,080
You're welcome.

400
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,320
This is what I should do.

401
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,880
The surgery was a success.

402
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,720
The kid has been doing tests these days.

403
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,720
They said there's no sequelae of surgery.

404
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,600
That's how I feel.

405
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,880
I'm glad the baby is okay.

406
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:51,920
Yes.

407
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,560
Mom, record the video.

408
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,440
You'll get penalty points if you're late.

409
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,120
Sorry.

410
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:58,840
It's okay.

411
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,400
Tony, look at me. Sit straight.

412
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:02,520
Three, two, one.

413
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,600
Three, two, one.

414
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,320
Choi Wook-dong from Class 5, Grade 3.

415
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,560
My dream

416
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,280
My dad is an emergency doctor.

417
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,880
He often told me

418
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,640
what patients he saved today.

419
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,880
Seeing him happy,

420
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,320
I think treating patients

421
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,240
to save people.

422
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,320
So my dream

423
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,960
to become an emergency doctor.

424
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,880
Mom, keep recording.

425
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,160
I haven't finished yet.

426
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,800
Here's the thing, Tony.

427
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,240
You have so many ideals to choose.

428
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,520
You can change another one.

429
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,800
What do you want to be?

430
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,960
I'll support you.

431
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,600
But it's not easy

432
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,720
to be an emergency doctor.

433
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,080
You'll know when you grow up.

434
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,480
Anyway,

435
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,600
change your dream.

436
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,040
Mom, are we still filming?

437
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,960
No.

438
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,160
Think about it.

439
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,200
what you're going to do when you grow up.

440
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,680
I didn't expect

441
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:10,240
your sister-in-law would be so against Mr. Cui.

442
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,600
But I can understand.

443
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,320
Look at my dad.

444
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:18,880
different?

445
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,160
You're always urging me to quit.

446
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,240
I'm speechless.

447
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,080
Why is the conflict between family and work

448
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:24,680
with work

449
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,960
It's so hard to adjust.

450
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,600
Some work

451
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,960
is dedication and sacrifice.

452
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,600
What kind of soldier are you?

453
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,960
Fireman, doctor, teacher

454
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,360
Everyone wants someone to do their job.

455
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,960
but they don't want their families

456
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,240
to bear the hardship.

457
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,160
This kind of contradiction can't be solved.

458
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:47,080
What we can do is to do our job

459
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,800
and save every patient.

460
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,600
Go to the supermarket.

461
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,040
It's called a convenience store.

462
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,360
Buy something delicious.

463
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,440
to celebrate your return on Monday.

464
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,800
Don't make such a fuss.

465
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,240
No, no, no.

466
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,720
You must cherish every senior doctor.

467
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,520
and cherish me.

468
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,160
I'll cherish you for the patient.

469
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,080
Biscuits. Want some biscuits?

470
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,080
It's not fresh.

471
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,240
You have to eat that cake without cream.

472
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,960
A cookie without cream.

473
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:21,880
You can't eat this

474
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,320
Buy this and do activities.

475
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,080
Look at three packs.

476
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,640
Look at the fried food written on it.

477
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,040
Why eat it?

478
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,920
No, this is delicious.

479
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,640
Delicious.

480
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,040
You just recovered.

481
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,720
Can you eat something nutritious?

482
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:35,440
Let's go.

483
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:41,960
It's ice cream

484
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,040
Let's go.

485
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,360
This one.

486
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,160
Buy a crispy fried chicken.

487
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,920
You can eat it once it's over oil. Hurry.

488
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,360
You want fried chicken?

489
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,520
Then after a week,

490
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,040
when you can eat fried food,

491
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,360
I'll buy you some fresh chicken.

492
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,480
No, I can wait.

493
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,360
I don't think it can wait.

494
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,360
It's in my hands now.

495
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,720
Hurry, pack it up. Hurry.

496
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,760
It's in my hands again.

497
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,640
Look, it's back.

498
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,920
You're so boring.

499
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,160
You promised to celebrate for me.

500
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,640
I won't buy anything I want.

501
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,040
No.

502
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,040
Why do you keep staring at these junk food?

503
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:15,880
You're a doctor.

504
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,240
You don't eat like a doctor at all.

505
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,800
This avocado is good.

506
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,440
Look at this coconut

507
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,720
I don't think so

508
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,160
Let's go there and buy that

509
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,160
Try the long one.

510
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,760
Is it all here?

511
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,360
Qiqi, where is it?

512
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,360
Look, isn't that Qiqi?

513
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,320
There.

514
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,160
They're all here.

515
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,920
God has opened his eyes.

516
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,080
I miss my daughter all the time at home.

517
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,640
I can even meet you here.

518
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:41,640
Look.

519
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,320
Why is Zhang there too?

520
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,920
They're colleagues.

521
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,080
It's normal to come shopping together.

522
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:48,640
No.

523
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,880
I know my daughter.

524
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,200
Qi Qi won't

525
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,160
go shopping with boys.

526
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,520
Is there anything else

527
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,360
is there anything else you want to eat?

528
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,080
I want pizza.

529
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,480
Just like you can cook

530
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,240
Come with me.

531
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,640
Are you serious?

532
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,200
Let's go.

533
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:06,640
Let's go.

534
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:07,920
Let's go. Look.

535
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:10,600
Hurry up.

536
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,480
Let's go and see what's going on.

537
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:13,920
Go!

538
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,640
Put my bag down first. Let's go.

539
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,600
Look at you.

540
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,040
You really want to make pizza?

541
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,200
Do you know how to make it under the pizza?

542
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,480
Why not?

543
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,200
How long is the expiration date?

544
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,160
There must be additives.

545
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,920
Make a full set.

546
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,480
How much?

547
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,160
Fierce.

548
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,160
Let me do it. No need.

549
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,760
It's 368 yuan.

550
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,600
Okay. Thank you.

551
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,160
This.

552
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,480
Who left this here?

553
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:42,480
Done.

554
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:43,600
Thank you.

555
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,600
Hurry up.

556
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,040
Why did you go in without changing your shoes?

557
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,080
I'll change right away.

558
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,040
Put it down first.

559
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,240
Just this once.

560
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:22,760
Who is it?

561
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:39,960
Qi Tuo

562
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,360
Who is it?

563
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,640
Do you believe me now?

564
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,360
You've seen the room, right?

565
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,480
His room is his room.

566
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,080
My room is mine.

567
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,320
You've seen the share, right?

568
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,680
You guys came here on a whim, right?

569
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,400
I can't prepare this in advance.

570
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,800
Do you believe me now, Qi Xuejun?

571
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,920
Even if I believe you are renting,

572
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:09,960
We're sharing a house.

573
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,200
But we're already here

574
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,680
Go get ready.

575
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,800
Go home with us.

576
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,200
What do you mean?

577
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,760
I have to go with you when you come.

578
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,640
I'm a child.

579
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,520
I'm an adult. I need dignity.

580
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,480
I need dignity, dad.

581
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,200
Qiqi.

582
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,200
I have promised you

583
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,480
I won't force you to resign.

584
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,080
How about this?

585
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,800
I'll write you a guarantee, okay?

586
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,040
You're trying to trick me again.

587
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:32,920
Ask my mom.

588
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,640
How long have you been writing the guarantee?

589
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:35,880
How many times

590
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:36,640
How many times have you said that?

591
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,640
I can't remember.

592
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,800
I've been in the emergency center for ten years.

593
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,680
you have to get sick every year.

594
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,040
I have no choice.

595
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,120
I can't go with you today.

596
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,040
You two go back now.

597
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,120
Alright, stop arguing.

598
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,120
Dr. Zhang has been standing there.

599
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,240
Zhang, sit down.

600
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:00,800
How old are you?

601
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,160
Auntie, Qi Tuo and I are both big

602
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,480
Is this house yours or rented?

603
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,480
My grandpa left it to me.

604
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,600
My grandpa used to work in a library.

605
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,480
He's a painter.

606
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,920
Mom, stop asking.

607
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,440
Don't you want to make pizza?

608
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,160
Hurry up.

609
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,120
Okay.

610
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,280
Aunt, uncle,

611
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,160
Stay for dinner.

612
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,280
My grilled pizza today

613
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,800
Have some water Have some fruit

614
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,720
He knows how to cook.

615
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,600
Is there anyone like you

616
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,720
You're checking households, checking houses, and running away.

617
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,040
Is it appropriate? Do you have a warrant?

618
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,480
Do you think it's appropriate

619
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,800
Is it appropriate?

620
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,240
My daughter.

621
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,040
I came to see my daughter's place.

622
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,600
Why do you need a warrant? You're so funny.

623
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,440
Qi Qi.

624
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,160
If you rent with a girl,

625
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,600
I'll accept it.

626
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,800
But you're sharing a house with a boy.

627
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:00,720
It doesn't sound good if it's just a man and a woman.

628
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,040
This house belongs to someone else.

629
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,160
What do you mean?

630
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,920
We're clean. What are we afraid of?

631
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,840
Besides, this house belongs to Zhang Chi.

632
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:07,840
He is a man.

633
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,440
I can't turn him into a woman, right?

634
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,280
It's normal that the landlord is a man.

635
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,800
Besides, Zhang Chi is a good landlord.

636
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,800
He always asks me to cook.

637
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,120
Everything is fine.

638
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:17,920
If you make a scene,

639
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,360
how can I stay here?

640
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,040
I also think he's a good kid.

641
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:22,680
Right?

642
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:23,920
You're diligent.

643
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,800
This house is clean.

644
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:26,840
and can cook.

645
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:27,800
No.

646
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,560
What are you thinking?

647
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,160
I don't allow all of you to find your peers.

648
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,680
Who? Who's looking for a colleague?

649
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,560
You sound like we're together.

650
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,600
I said it's rented.

651
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:39,720
Go back now.

652
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,240
How about this? I'll write you a guarantee.

653
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,800
I won't be with Zhang Chi.

654
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,000
I'll write it now. I can write it now.

655
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:45,480
Do I need to write it?

656
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,360
Enough.

657
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,160
You two don't have to promise.

658
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,240
Let nature take its course, okay?

659
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,000
Think about your dad.

660
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:34,840
Yesterday,

661
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,480
You said it was the last time I promised you.

662
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,680
What if I have a daughter in the future?

663
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,240
What if you have a son?

664
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,600
Who do you have a son with?

665
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,920
You think too early.

666
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,680
What if you have a monkey?

667
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,840
Is it possible that

668
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,600
you have a peach?

669
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,680
How can I have a fruit?

670
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,560
Didn't you say

671
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,000
It's different from

672
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,920
and that one.

673
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,360
It's been six days.

674
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,920
It's been six days since I saw it together.

675
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:06,480
Six days.

676
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,360
Let's go to work together.

677
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,800
What a coincidence.

678
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,240
What a coincidence. There's something more coincidental.

679
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,600
We live together.

680
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,240
Shut up.

681
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,840
My dad put too much pressure on me.

682
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:24,680
I moved out.

683
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,480
This is my landlord.

684
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,680
I happen to have an empty room.

685
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,680
to make some pocket money.

686
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,440
Zhang Chi.

687
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,960
My master

688
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,280
live with you.

689
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,160
Why didn't you tell me such a big thing?

690
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,240
You've been living together for six days.

691
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,160
Don't you have any sparks?

692
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,800
Why is your mouth still open?

693
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,800
It's too hard for our center to pair up.

694
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:54,600
Yes.

695
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,160
Her father put pressure on her.

696
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,040
too much pressure.

697
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,680
But I'm relieved that she's staying with you now.

698
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,160
Do you have any spare rooms?

699
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,360
Can you rent me one?

700
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,920
I only have one guest room.

701
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:10,280
Okay.

702
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:11,680
How about this?

703
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,800
I'll go to your house for dinner more often.

704
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:14,840
It's settled then.

705
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,720
Master, let's have dinner at your house tonight.

706
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,360
The landlord has the final say.

707
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,280
It's not up to me.

708
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,800
He's not the boss. You're the boss. You've paid.

709
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:26,920
I said no.

710
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:27,600
I'll buy some vegetables.

711
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,600
Qiu, ten adrenaline.

712
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,240
Okay, got it.

713
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,000
Dr Zhang.

714
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:40,240
You're the father of the twins, right?

715
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,480
Thanks to you and Dr. Choi last time.

716
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,560
It's our duty.

717
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,600
What brings you here?

718
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,000
Is Dr. Choi here?

719
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,560
Wait, Mr. Choi.

720
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:49,680
Mr. Choi.

721
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:55,560
Dr. Choi.

722
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,240
It's you.

723
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,040
Dr. Choi.

724
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:58,680
What is it?

725
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,600
Thank you so much for last time.

726
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:02,480
I heard

727
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,320
your son had an accident at school.

728
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,120
He seems to be very sick.

729
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,560
So I came to see you.

730
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,800
How is the baby?

731
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,280
Is he feeling better?

732
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,480
Thank you.

733
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,360
My son has overcome the crisis.

734
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,240
Much better.

735
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,240
He's just a kid.

736
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,800
He's very healthy.

737
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,080
Dr. Choi, here.

738
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,160
It's a thank you letter from my son.

739
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,680
and a small gift he made for your son.

740
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,760
My family is not rich.

741
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,520
My mom was hospitalized with a stroke.

742
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,200
The treatment fee is not enough.

743
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,720
Fortunately, we have a heart donor.

744
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:38,040
There's a lot left besides my mom.

745
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,280
I donated them to the center.

746
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,840
Your son hurt his head.

747
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,520
The follow-up treatment

748
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,800
for the follow-up treatment.

749
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,360
That's why I'm being selfish.

750
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,200
I hope the money can be approved in the end.

751
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,120
No, no, no.

752
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,120
Money should help those who need it more.

753
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,520
The milk tea is here. And the puff from the boss.

754
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,280
Come in

755
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,120
Thank you.

756
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,680
Hua Zi, how is Mr. Cheng's recovery?

757
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,640
Do you need our help?

758
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:04,800
No, no.

759
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,160
Thank you so much.

760
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,160
Thank you.

761
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,520
Mr. Cheng has recovered.

762
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,520
He’s fine.

763
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,000
Really?

764
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,840
It's true.

765
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,520
Since I applied to the company

766
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,400
to take Mr. Cheng to work every week.

767
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,520
My colleagues will know about Mr. Cheng.

768
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,080
He donated money to Mr. Cheng and bought an electric wheelchair.

769
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,640
and rehabilitation fees.

770
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:29,520
The district office

771
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,760
helped us reduce a lot of money.

772
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,080
So, there were only some donations left.

773
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,280
Mr. Cheng read the news

774
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,840
He said there was a triplets family.

775
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,400
They don't have a rich family.

776
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,200
The elderly got a cold.

777
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,720
This family can’t bear it.

778
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,320
Mr. Cheng and I

779
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,840
I donated the money to that family.

780
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:48,880
Okay.

781
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,280
His family's problem was solved.

782
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,080
Thanks to Hua Zi and Mr. Cheng.

783
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,480
So the triplets father sent his love.

784
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:56,840
I understand.

785
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,080
The relay stick of love

786
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,120
is in your hands, Cui.

787
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,040
Hello, your drink.

788
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:31,880
Enjoy.

789
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,159
Qi

790
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,159
Here

791
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:46,800
Here.

792
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:48,639
Come on.

793
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:49,199
I said

794
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:52,159
you can sit in my tea room.

795
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,199
Why are we here?

796
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,560
Teahouse. Don't always stay in the teahouse.

797
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:57,160
Look how nice the environment is, right?

798
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,280
Come visit us more often.

799
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,040
You drank half a bottle of wine?

800
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,160
Yes.

801
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,280
Why did you drink so much?

802
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,560
You usually drink so much.

803
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:08,880
What's wrong?

804
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,920
Talk to me if you have something on your mind.

805
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,400
I don't drink.

806
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:13,920
What would you like to drink?

807
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,280
A glass of lemon water.

808
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,000
Waiter.

809
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:18,800
Lemon water.

810
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:19,280
Okay.

811
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,680
What happened?

812
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,040
The conflict with Qi Tuo hasn't been resolved yet

813
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,200
As father and daughter

814
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,520
Why can't we talk?

815
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,120
Well, Qi Qi

816
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,200
I did everything

817
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,400
for her own good.

818
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,920
But she doesn't understand.

819
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,640
She doesn't understand.

820
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,320
I'm so frustrated

821
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,280
Qi, I’m not blaming you.

822
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,120
Qi Qi is a grown-up.

823
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:47,160
can tell right from wrong, right?

824
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,920
Including her finding a boyfriend.

825
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,760
You have to trust her choice.

826
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,040
Children are blessed.

827
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,800
If you don't mention this boyfriend,

828
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:55,880
if you don't mention him.

829
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,160
Recently,

830
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,640
a male doctor named Zhang Chi

831
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,440
a male doctor named Zhang Chi came.

832
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:05,200
We can rent their house.

833
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,680
Both of them

834
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,160
work and work together every day.

835
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:09,560
This...

836
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,280
They live together.

837
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,320
They live together.

838
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,000
It's not like what you think.

839
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,000
Aunt Zeng and I have checked it.

840
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:25,680
They were clearly separated.

841
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,280
A little bit of this.

842
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,760
There's no place to cross the line.

843
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:30,920
It's the same as men and women's dormitory.

844
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,800
It's a good thing.

845
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,400
How can we communicate

846
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,680
how can we communicate?

847
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,680
Otherwise, how can we make love sparks?

848
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,280
Do you think

849
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,400
they have a chance?

850
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,400
I've seen Dr Zhang before.

851
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,920
He's gentle and nice.

852
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:49,520
But

853
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,320
I still think you are better.

854
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,400
But you two are not meant to be.

855
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,160
Your lemon water is ready.

856
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,200
Okay, thank you.

857
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:10,200
But I've seen Zhang Chi before.

858
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,160
This young man

859
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,760
He's not bad.

860
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,920
and has a good personality.

861
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,280
I also do the chores.

862
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,160
Let's find out more.

863
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,160
That's right Qi

864
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,440
You have to have this attitude

865
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,680
You have to trust Qi Tuo, right?

866
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,800
We should celebrate this

867
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,040
Celebrate? Why?

868
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,000
Think about it. What if Zhang Chi

869
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,520
is your son-in-law?

870
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:41,560
Right?

871
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,040
You're right.

872
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:52,920
Come on.

873
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,280
How about

874
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:01,560
have some?

875
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:03,520
Have some.

876
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,200
Just a little today.

877
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:06,520
Here.

878
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,560
Come on

879
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:15,680
Come on Qi

880
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Let me propose a toast.

881
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,920
Wish Qi a happy birthday

882
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:35,800
Okay, it tastes good.

883
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,520
I'll propose another cup. The second one.

884
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,040
The second cup. Why?

885
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,520
May Qi fulfill his wish

886
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:45,160
and have a great grandson soon.

887
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:47,400
Come on.

888
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,280
Cheers.

889
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:50,760
Come on.

890
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,440
Step by step. Don't get hurt.

891
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,920
I'm practicing as you say.

892
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,280
It's good.

893
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,920
I think you look better when you work hard.

894
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,280
I learned it from Xu Chengyuan.

895
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,680
You're being glib-tongued.

896
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,120
No, I'm telling the truth.

897
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,440
Okay, I like the truth.

898
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,200
Well, I'll take you to practice for another half an hour.

899
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,000
No. It's been half an hour.

900
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:37,920
Let's go.

901
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,280
Look what I'm practicing.

902
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,160
I'm tired.

903
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:46,040
Please take the money.

904
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:49,280
This is the donation from the director.

905
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,760
I know.

906
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,440
Mr. Cui is busy with work every day.

907
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,920
so he neglected taking care of you and the baby.

908
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,160
But isn't this just what you said?

909
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,560
Love comes back.

910
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,640
This is a reward of love.

911
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,320
So no matter what,

912
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,920
please take the money.

913
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,040
Tell me.

914
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:12,960
All these years,

915
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,560
I really regret marrying Cui.

916
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,160
What did he contribute to this family?

917
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,520
I'm the one taking care of the old and young ones in the family.

918
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,440
He left early in the morning.

919
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,200
He only came back after the baby slept.

920
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,560
But now I understand.

921
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,040
It's not easy for Cui.

922
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:32,680
It's not easy for both of you.

923
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,160
Listen, Dr Zhang.

924
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,320
Take the money.

925
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:37,640
We can't take it.

926
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:40,320
I can afford Dongdong's medical expenses.

927
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,440
Give this money

928
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,960
to more difficult families.

929
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:43,920
No no sister-in-law

930
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,400
We can't take it. We can't take it.

931
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:45,920
Take it back.

932
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,800
Son, the braised pork trotters you like.

933
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,440
Zhang Chi is here.

934
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,160
Mr. Cui.

935
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,480
Is this the donation from the center?

936
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:54,720
Take it back.

937
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,800
I won't take the money.

938
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,320
Your sister-in-law won't accept it either.

939
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:08,320
Cui.

940
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,760
What's wrong with you today, honey?

941
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:13,440
You...

942
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,320
Nothing, I just want to hug you.

943
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,760
We've been married for so long.

944
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,640
How can you be so romantic?

945
