1
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:31,925
CHIEF, I CAN'T GO TO THE STATION TODAY.
I'LL CONTACT YOU LATER

2
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:29,440
EPISODE 3
THE MAN WITH THE UMBRELLA

3
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:54,340
Begin.

4
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:56,467
Player inspection.

5
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:48,686
WORK EXPERIENCE: DRAGON MOTORS 16 YEARS,
GAYEONG CHICKEN 2 YEARS, CHAUFFEUR 5 YEARS

6
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,271
WORK EXPERIENCE: HAEIL MOVERS 5 YEARS,
RAINBOW MOVER 7 YEARS, BANGI LABOR 5 YEARS

7
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:07,682
HWANG JUN-HO
NATIONAL POLICE AGENCY

8
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,651
You there!

9
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:28,453
It's justâ€¦

10
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,580
I felt seasick.

11
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:35,168
Did you forget the rule?

12
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,421
You do not speak
without your supervisor's approval.

13
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:43,176
Go wait in the cabin.

14
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:22,150
Sir.

15
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:27,655
Sir.

16
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,285
Sir!

17
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:36,956
Are you all right?

18
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,040
It's you.

19
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:44,005
Player 456.

20
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:45,298
Yes.

21
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:48,134
I thought you were gone for good.

22
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:52,972
I'm not going to die that easily.

23
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:54,807
Of course, you won't.

24
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:57,727
I left thanks to you,
and now I'm back thanks to you.

25
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,479
You can't die first.

26
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:10,531
A lot of people came back.

27
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:14,118
You're right.

28
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:16,996
I guess everyone had a tough time.

29
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:18,915
Jeez.

30
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:22,877
Whoa. Even that woman
who didn't name her baby is back.

31
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,961
You're right.

32
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:26,923
I wonder if she managed
to give her baby a name.

33
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:28,674
Goodness.

34
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,092
Gi-hun.

35
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,594
Hey, Sang-woo.

36
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,515
You're here.

37
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:36,849
I didn't think you'd come.

38
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:40,770
Me neither.

39
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,481
What about you?

40
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:46,192
Did you see your mom?

41
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:49,529
Good sirs!

42
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:52,657
My savior!

43
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,159
I'm glad to see you again, sir.

44
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:58,871
Thank you so much
for the bus fare that day.

45
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:00,540
You gave him money for the bus?

46
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:03,376
He said he'd walk from Yeouido to Ansan.

47
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:05,336
That's heart-warming.

48
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:08,297
Comrades from boot camp, is that it?

49
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:10,341
What's a boot camp?

50
00:09:11,175 --> 00:09:14,387
You know the military? Where you
shoot guns and go through training.

51
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:17,056
Oh, where soldiers live together?

52
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:18,015
That's right.

53
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:19,809
Wait.

54
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:22,645
Now that we're on the subject,

55
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:25,940
why don't we team up
like we're in the military?

56
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:29,068
You're right. We don't even know
what we'll have to play.

57
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:32,530
It's better to form a group
and be prepared for everything.

58
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:35,575
Listen. Why don't you join us?

59
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:38,744
He's amazingly strong.

60
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,079
You saw it, right?

61
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:43,040
He lifted me up with one hand.

62
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:47,461
Can I really join you two?

63
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:51,257
Yes, sure.
You're the private, a new lackey.

64
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:54,051
He's the competent corporal,
and I'm the sergeant on my way out.

65
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:55,720
Thank you, sir.

66
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:58,764
- You can drop the "Sir."
- Hey.

67
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:04,729
If it's all right with you,
can you let me join too?

68
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:05,980
Of course.

69
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:11,485
You can be the sergeant major
who gave his life to the military.

70
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:13,904
Thank you.

71
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:18,826
My goodness,
our team checks off all the boxes.

72
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:23,831
I'll let go of the past and take you in.

73
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:25,207
So join under me.

74
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:29,545
We made a pretty good team before,
didn't we?

75
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:30,921
You're still bluffing?

76
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:34,675
I know there's an entire gang out there
trying to hunt you down.

77
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,135
Don't mess with me.

78
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:38,512
No matter how tough you are,

79
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:41,349
you don't stand a fucking chance
going solo.

80
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:44,018
Don't you see this?

81
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:48,481
Everyone who died,
the masked bastards took their beds.

82
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:51,484
One slip-up and your bed will be out too.

83
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,904
Worry about your own bed.

84
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:58,741
Gentlemen.

85
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:01,369
Don't get mixed up with this asshole.

86
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:08,084
Outside, he took from his lackeys
to fatten his wallet.

87
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:12,171
Then he developed the balls
to steal from his boss' pocket,

88
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:14,340
got caught, and ended up like this.

89
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:17,843
You know what they call guys like him
in my hometown?

90
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:22,848
A revolutionary asshole.

91
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,185
You commie bitch.

92
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:28,979
Girls and boys.

93
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:32,483
Sorry to break in on the conversation.

94
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:33,776
What do you want?

95
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:34,693
Oh, my.

96
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:37,071
You're pretty cute.

97
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:42,451
Hey, let me join.

98
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:43,411
Join what?

99
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:45,704
Your team.

100
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:50,084
What are you good at?

101
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:52,211
Everything except for the things I'm not.

102
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:57,383
I bet I'm way more useful
than this bony girl.

103
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:00,428
You're that good?

104
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:05,766
Should we get it on?

105
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,017
The beds seem available.

106
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:13,524
Your mealtime begins now.

107
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:15,025
All players, please line up in the center.

108
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:16,986
After we eat.

109
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:21,907
Let me repeat. Your mealtime begins now.

110
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:25,870
All players, please line up in the center.

111
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:33,169
Those thugs.

112
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:37,715
Gosh.

113
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:53,314
Out of 201 players,
187 players have returned.

114
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:55,649
The re-entrance rate is 93%.

115
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:01,280
Continue to monitor
those who didn't return,

116
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:03,115
and keep me posted.

117
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:04,325
Yes, sir.

118
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,303
- Jeez.
-Gosh.

119
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:27,139
This brings back old memories.

120
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:29,391
You used to have lunch boxes
like this too?

121
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,726
Of course.

122
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:34,647
My wife was always busy every morning,

123
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:38,651
packing lunch boxes
for me and my children.

124
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:42,780
The rice is cold. Jeez.

125
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:47,868
We could've warmed it up
if we had a stove in the middle.

126
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:50,162
Do you remember?

127
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:53,749
We had a coal stove
in our elementary school classroom.

128
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:55,793
We'd put our lunch boxes on top,

129
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:57,836
it'd get burning hot,

130
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,422
and the rice would get crispy too.

131
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:03,926
-Gi-hun.
-What?

132
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:05,844
If you have time to reminisce,

133
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:08,556
try to figure out
what the next game will be.

134
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:11,725
Hey,

135
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:14,103
that's not something you can just guess.

136
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,105
We'll find out when it begins.

137
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:20,526
Well, if I think about what we did so far,

138
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:25,990
it's probably a children's game
from back in the day.

139
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:27,825
Yes, I think so too.

140
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,828
But there are too many games.

141
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:34,623
There are Ddakji Game, Dabanggu,
Hopscotch, Biseokchigi, Tag,

142
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,292
Don Katsu, Freeze Tag.

143
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:41,005
And for girls, Gonggi, Elastics,
and Cat's Cradle.

144
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:43,799
What else is there?

145
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:46,510
I don't know how to play any of those.

146
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:49,597
Don't kids in your country
play these games?

147
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:52,349
Don't worry.

148
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:56,437
Children's games have simple rules.
We'll help if you don't know.

149
00:14:58,564 --> 00:14:59,815
Thank you.

150
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:10,492
The day's work has been completed.

151
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:15,039
All workers,
please return to your quarters.

152
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,876
Let me repeat.

153
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,921
The day's work has been completed.

154
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:26,342
All workers,
please return to your quarters.

155
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:03,587
1. ALWAYS WEAR YOUR MASK
OUTSIDE THE ROOM

156
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:04,797
2. DO NOT CONVERSE
WITHOUT PERMISSION

157
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,131
3. DO NOT LEAVE THE ROOM
WITHOUT PERMISSION

158
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:13,889
Hey, open the door, you jerks!

159
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,976
I really need to take a piss right now!

160
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:18,769
Don't you jerks ever take a leak?

161
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:21,271
Let me use the restroom!

162
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:25,901
I just need to use the restroom
for one second. Is that so hard?

163
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:29,196
This room is packed with men.
You expect me to piss on the floor?

164
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:33,325
Damn it, you scumbags!

165
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:36,745
At least treat us like human beings
if you brought us here!

166
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:39,623
Hey, Triangle.

167
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:41,875
I don't need you. Get me your supervisor.

168
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:45,254
Get that Square over here, you asshole!

169
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:51,135
You may not leave the premises
after the permitted time.

170
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:55,764
Shit. You think nature calls
only when you allow it?

171
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,309
What theâ€¦

172
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:01,478
You fucking bastards!

173
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:04,440
You don't think I'll do it
right here right now?

174
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:05,482
Damn it.

175
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:08,736
Hey, I'm going.

176
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:11,405
Man, it's a pretty crazy waterfall here.

177
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:17,786
Follow me.

178
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:21,874
Damn people never listen
until you scream into their ears.

179
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:23,083
Damn it.

180
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:26,378
I have to go too.

181
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:28,714
What are you doing?

182
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:34,011
I work my ass off to wipe the toilet
and you just sit right on top?

183
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:35,971
Hey.

184
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:39,391
You're the really annoying type.
You know that?

185
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:44,438
That rude brat.

186
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:45,481
Hey.

187
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:22,578
So damn sweet.

188
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:25,706
You startled me!

189
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,374
What?

190
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:34,464
Do you want a drag?

191
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:36,842
Stay there and keep smoking.

192
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:40,721
What are you doing?

193
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:50,564
Are youâ€¦

194
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:52,482
going to go in there?

195
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:54,234
I want a look around.

196
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:58,530
Buy me some time.
I'll tell you if I find anything.

197
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:01,992
Deal.

198
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:03,452
Step on me.

199
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:52,584
Gosh.

200
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:55,420
My constipation is killing me!

201
00:20:57,422 --> 00:21:00,676
I'd rather give birth to a baby!

202
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:03,178
I'm dying here!

203
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:12,646
I'm dying. Why won't it come out?

204
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:30,038
It's time to head back.

205
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:32,666
Just give me a moment.

206
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:35,294
It's almost out.

207
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:37,379
Come on, hurry up and come out.

208
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:40,716
Hurry up and come out. I've got to hurry!

209
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,342
Come out now.

210
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:43,844
If you don't, I'm going in.

211
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:47,014
Wait! No! Wait a second!

212
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:50,142
There's no toilet paper here!

213
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:51,435
Damn it.

214
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,730
I'm washing myself with water.

215
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:57,357
Don't you come in.

216
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:59,609
Stay right there.

217
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:01,445
I'm washing myself.

218
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:04,364
I'm half-naked.

219
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:06,074
Shit.

220
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:09,453
Now I'm getting clean.

221
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:26,470
What are you doing?

222
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:28,138
Keep stirring.

223
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:38,023
Come out now.

224
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:40,233
Damn it, there's no toilet paper!

225
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:42,861
-If you don't, I'll drag you out.
-I have to wipe myself!

226
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:46,656
Hey, isn't it rule number one
to check each stall for toilet paper?

227
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,158
Get that Square guy here!

228
00:22:48,241 --> 00:22:49,868
I need to file a complaint.

229
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:53,622
What the hell are you looking at, bastard?

230
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:56,166
I can't believe this.

231
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:00,754
You fucking asshole.

232
00:23:01,254 --> 00:23:02,547
Hey, jerk.

233
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:05,008
Didn't I tell you to not come in?

234
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:07,135
This is sexual harassment!

235
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:13,725
Hey, once I get out of here,
I'm going to sue you, bastard.

236
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:16,061
Damn!

237
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:28,073
Now it's time to go to sleep.
Good work today.

238
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:52,389
Deserted island, abductions,
surveillance, and masks.

239
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:15,912
Hey, what did you see?

240
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:18,665
What did you see?

241
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:21,293
I'll tell you tomorrow.

242
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:24,129
Why tomorrow? Just tell me now.

243
00:24:24,212 --> 00:24:25,505
Hey.

244
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:30,093
What did you see up there?
You were there long enough!

245
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:44,065
The morning sun has risen.
Please wake up, everyone.

246
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:47,527
We will do a roll call in ten minutes.

247
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:55,118
It is now breakfast time.

248
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:58,455
All players, please line up in the center.

249
00:24:58,538 --> 00:24:59,372
Hey.

250
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:01,708
What did you see?

251
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:03,710
Tell me now.

252
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,047
You said you'd tell me in the morning.

253
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:08,798
I know you had time to see something.

254
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:12,135
The guys in masks were
melting something in large pots.

255
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:13,053
Melting what?

256
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:15,764
I'm not sure.

257
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:17,432
Damn it.

258
00:25:17,515 --> 00:25:20,393
I put on that huge show to save your life,

259
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:21,811
and you're not sure?

260
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:26,233
I smelled something.

261
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:27,442
What smell?

262
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:29,653
Sugar.

263
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:31,363
You smelled sugar?

264
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:33,657
So they were melting sugar?

265
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:34,908
I think so.

266
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:36,618
That's all you saw?

267
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:43,333
Listen,

268
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:47,295
if I find you're holding back,
I'll burn your eyes out with a cig.

269
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:54,594
I guess I'm hungry.

270
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:56,179
I'm craving something sweet.

271
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:58,765
God damn it.

272
00:25:58,848 --> 00:26:01,268
Maybe they're giving us
candied sweet potatoes today.

273
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:25,375
Starting roll call.

274
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:28,503
Please wait in front of your door.

275
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:35,176
Roll call complete.

276
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,095
All staff, proceed.

277
00:26:58,408 --> 00:26:59,576
Excuse me,

278
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:03,830
do you have any chocolate milk?
I can't drink regular milk.

279
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:07,000
I could never digest it
even when I was a kid,

280
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:09,627
so I never signed up for milk
back in school.

281
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:18,887
Damn it.

282
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:24,142
I bet your father spanked you a lot
when you were young.

283
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:26,311
How did you know?

284
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:28,646
My son was just like you.

285
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:41,326
Sir.

286
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:44,079
Why aren't you eating that?

287
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:48,666
You can have it.

288
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:51,336
Really?

289
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,588
I usually don't eat breakfast.

290
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:57,175
Thank you, sir.

291
00:27:57,258 --> 00:27:59,552
The smart ones never eat much, you know.

292
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:07,394
Have this too.

293
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:11,147
Thank you, sir.

294
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:23,159
The second game will begin shortly.

295
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:27,872
Please follow
the instructions from our staff.

296
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:30,375
Let me repeat.

297
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:33,795
The second game will begin shortly.

298
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:38,591
Please follow
the instructions from our staff.

299
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:35,899
You saw something, didn't you?

300
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:40,403
I heard you talking last night.

301
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:41,988
Tell me what you saw.

302
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:45,116
Why should I?

303
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,410
You're a North Korean defector.

304
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:52,415
All the games they made us play,
I played them as a kid.

305
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:55,502
It's likely the next one's
something similar.

306
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:56,920
Tell me what you saw,

307
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:59,422
and I can guess what it is.

308
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:56,938
Why is this playground so big?

309
00:30:58,189 --> 00:30:59,774
What are they going to make us play?

310
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:03,111
Welcome to your second game.

311
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:05,697
Hey, what do you think this is?

312
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:07,907
Holding out on a roundabout?

313
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:11,953
Pushing people off of the jungle gym?

314
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:14,747
Before the second game begins,

315
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:21,337
choose from one of the four shapes
and stand in front of it.

316
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:22,839
What is that?

317
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:25,425
Circle, triangle,

318
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:28,261
star, umbrella.

319
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:32,557
They seem very familiar.

320
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:36,811
Tell me what you saw
and I can guess what it is.

321
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:39,522
They were melting sugar.

322
00:32:01,836 --> 00:32:02,837
Sang-woo.

323
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:03,922
What?

324
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:04,964
What should we do?

325
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:07,926
I'm not sure.

326
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:13,723
Choose a shape
and stand in front of it immediately.

327
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:18,937
Choose a shape
and stand in front of it immediately.

328
00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:31,032
Should we move as a team?

329
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:35,703
That might be dangerous.

330
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:37,956
We don't even know what the game is.

331
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:40,458
If we all pick the same shape,
we might get in trouble.

332
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:41,709
You think?

333
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:43,336
There's this saying in investments:

334
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:45,505
"Don't put all your eggs in one basket."

335
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,675
Sir,

336
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:51,511
he got into Seoul University
as the top of his class.

337
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:54,263
He was a famous prodigy
in our neighborhood.

338
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:56,641
Really? Goodness.

339
00:32:56,724 --> 00:32:58,768
Must be a great man.

340
00:32:58,851 --> 00:33:00,144
Of course, he is.

341
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:05,483
Then let's split up as Sang-woo said,
and see how things go.

342
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:07,610
Who should go where?

343
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:14,450
I'll take the triangle.

344
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:16,077
What about you?

345
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:19,622
Dayira.

346
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:22,917
-Dayira.
-You mean, circle?

347
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:24,210
Yes.

348
00:33:24,293 --> 00:33:26,713
It looks like the moon from my hometown.

349
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:30,717
Then we have the star
and the umbrella left.

350
00:33:33,928 --> 00:33:35,722
You can choose first.

351
00:33:36,305 --> 00:33:37,598
-Should I?
-Yes.

352
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:45,064
Then I'll take the umbrella.

353
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:46,482
Umbrella?

354
00:33:47,483 --> 00:33:48,943
Why?

355
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:52,488
My mom used to scold me
for losing my umbrella all the time.

356
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:55,241
In the end, she only gave me broken ones.

357
00:33:55,324 --> 00:33:59,370
I always wanted a decent umbrella
like the other kids.

358
00:34:01,664 --> 00:34:03,958
You don't want the star?
Do you want to switch?

359
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:07,045
No, the star sounds great.

360
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:13,551
We rarely ever get to see stars
in this day and age.

361
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:15,595
All right, let's get moving.

362
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:19,599
Once we know what we're playing,
we can come up with a plan together.

363
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:25,063
Gi-hun.

364
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:26,856
Yes?

365
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:33,071
Never mind.

366
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:57,845
Decision time is over.

367
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:00,932
We will now reveal the game.

368
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:12,693
All players, please each take
one of the cases in front of you.

369
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:18,825
All players, please each take
one of the cases in front of you.

370
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:46,602
Please open the case
and check the contents.

371
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:49,230
DALGONA

372
00:36:04,745 --> 00:36:06,455
Circle?

373
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:14,755
The second game is Dalgona.

374
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:18,885
The shape you have chosen
is the shape you must extract.

375
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:23,556
I'm fucked.

376
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:29,437
The time limit is ten minutes.

377
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:34,734
Cleanly extract the shape
in ten minutes, and you pass.

378
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:37,153
Let the game begin.

379
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:44,196
Waitâ€¦

380
00:38:45,114 --> 00:38:46,073
Give me oneâ€¦

381
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:48,075
Please. Just one more--

382
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:11,807
No, I'm sorry.

383
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:13,017
Please spare my life.

384
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,352
Please--

385
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:49,071
Player 111, pass.

386
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:54,577
Player 67, pass.

387
00:41:08,757 --> 00:41:10,676
I did it. The circle.

388
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:14,221
Circle.

389
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:17,600
Player 199, pass.

390
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:23,022
Player 210, pass.

391
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:29,653
Player 224, pass.

392
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:33,949
Player 246, pass.

393
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:40,831
Player 73, pass.

394
00:41:44,418 --> 00:41:45,586
Number 29.

395
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:47,254
Player 72, pass.

396
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:49,215
-Yes, sir.
-What's your duty today?

397
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:51,759
-Player 34, pass.
-My duty isâ€¦

398
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:53,761
Number 29, your duty
is to carry out eliminated players.

399
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:55,137
Why are you here already?

400
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:57,681
-Apologies.
-Player 44, pass.

401
00:41:57,765 --> 00:41:59,058
I got confused.

402
00:41:59,141 --> 00:42:01,227
Wait here until the game ends.

403
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:04,522
I'll have a word with you
about that confusion.

404
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:08,442
Player 32, pass.

405
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:18,536
Left.

406
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:27,294
Player 122, pass.

407
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:29,505
Player 29, pass.

408
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:37,179
Player 218, pass.

409
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,737
Player 357, pass.

410
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:57,449
Player 83, pass.

411
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:33,068
It's melting.

412
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:54,632
This is it. I can melt it from the back.

413
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:57,593
The lines are thinner,
so it will melt first.

414
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:26,664
Player 212, pass.

415
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:32,628
Player 196, pass.

416
00:44:34,254 --> 00:44:36,382
Player 244, pass.

417
00:44:40,636 --> 00:44:42,054
Player 69, pass.

418
00:44:42,137 --> 00:44:43,764
Player 70, pass.

419
00:46:42,007 --> 00:46:45,010
Player 456, pass.

420
00:46:53,810 --> 00:46:56,396
The second game is now over.

421
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:00,275
All successful players,
please leave the playground immediately.

422
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:01,568
Move your hands.

423
00:47:20,587 --> 00:47:21,672
Shit.

424
00:47:26,301 --> 00:47:27,678
You assholes!

425
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:29,638
Fuck this.

426
00:47:29,721 --> 00:47:31,390
What kind of a sick game is this?

427
00:47:31,473 --> 00:47:35,727
Why do some get an easy shape
when others are stuck with difficult ones?

428
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:38,105
Don't come any closer, you assholes!

429
00:47:38,897 --> 00:47:41,567
I'll kill this bastard.

430
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:43,819
I'll really kill him.

431
00:48:13,515 --> 00:48:15,100
Take your mask off.

432
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:17,936
Mask off, now!

433
00:48:36,204 --> 00:48:37,664
Turn around.

434
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:46,298
You're so youngâ€¦

435
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:48,967
How did you end up like this?

436
00:49:10,238 --> 00:49:11,239
Remember.

437
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:14,743
Once they find out who you are,
you're dead.

438
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:32,844
Number 29.

439
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:35,222
Wait here until the game ends.

440
00:49:36,181 --> 00:49:38,350
I'll have a word with you
about that confusion.

441
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:44,244
