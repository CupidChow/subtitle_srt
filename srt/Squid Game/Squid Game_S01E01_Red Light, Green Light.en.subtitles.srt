1
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:23,898
My town called that game "the Squid Game".

2
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:29,237
We called it that
because the grid looked like a squid.

3
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:32,240
The rules are simple.

4
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:37,996
Children are divided into two groups,
the offense and the defense.

5
00:00:39,956 --> 00:00:43,585
Once the game starts, the defense within
the grid can move around with both feet,

6
00:00:43,668 --> 00:00:48,006
and the offense outside the grid
has to hop on one foot.

7
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:52,469
Your mom!

8
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:57,891
But if the attacker takes their chance
and cuts through the squid's waist,

9
00:00:57,974 --> 00:01:02,979
they win the right to freely move around
with both feet.

10
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:09,069
The secret inspector.

11
00:01:09,944 --> 00:01:14,949
No one knows why, but we called
that person the secret inspector.

12
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:19,788
Once everyone's ready
for the final battle,

13
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:24,042
the attackers gather
at the entrance of the squid.

14
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:27,504
Go.

15
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:30,924
In order to win,

16
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:36,012
"the attackers must tap the space
in the squid's head with their foot."

17
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:42,310
"If the defense shoves you
and you step on or out of the grid,"

18
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:43,603
you die.

19
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:47,607
That's right. You die.

20
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:05,625
Hooray!

21
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:08,211
"Hooray."

22
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:12,006
Once you take the winning tap,
you yell out, "Hooray."

23
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:16,845
And, in that moment,
I felt as if I owned the entire world,

24
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:18,513
I felt exhilarated.

25
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:40,493
EPISODE 1
RED LIGHT, GREEN LIGHT

26
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:49,002
What's this? Is it for me?

27
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:54,424
You know it's
Ga-yeong's birthday today, right?

28
00:02:57,468 --> 00:02:58,636
Yes, I do.

29
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,766
Don't forget and at least get her dinner.

30
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:07,020
Prices are crazy these days.
This isn't enough for anything.

31
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:10,565
Ga-yeong loves fried chicken, you know.

32
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:13,234
Go buy her some fried chicken.

33
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:15,612
Just fried chicken?

34
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,572
I should at least get her a birthday gift.

35
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:19,198
Give me a bit more.

36
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:20,950
I don't have any money.

37
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:23,202
What are you talking about?

38
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:25,622
I gave you everything I made
from chauffeuring.

39
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:28,041
Goodness, that petty change?

40
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:31,920
Hey, that doesn't even
cover your monthly loan interest.

41
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:35,298
We'll never pay that off living like this.

42
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:36,925
So let's just spend when we have to!

43
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:39,886
Goodness.

44
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:48,770
And you need to stop doing that!

45
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:51,522
Make sure you put the dishes in the water.

46
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:56,945
You always say your back hurts.
You hardly make anything with that!

47
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:06,537
Let's see…

48
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:25,306
DAEHAN BANK

49
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,517
ENTER YOUR PIN

50
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:30,853
INCORRECT PIN

51
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,146
It should be my birthday.

52
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:34,524
She changed the PIN.

53
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:37,110
Your mom finally cut you off.

54
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:39,737
Damn it.

55
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:42,782
INCORRECT PIN

56
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:45,660
Damn it.
What did that old woman change it to?

57
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:47,161
Try her birthday or something.

58
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:48,663
Her birthday?

59
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:50,415
Mom's birthday…

60
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:53,334
Of course you don't know
your mom's birthday.

61
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:54,460
You ungrateful bastard!

62
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:57,088
Fuck off, asshole! I know!

63
00:04:57,171 --> 00:05:00,675
She follows the lunar calendar
so her birthday changes every year.

64
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:02,218
Dumbass, you know nothing…

65
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,511
Try the lunar date then.

66
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:05,930
Damn it.

67
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,434
God damn it!

68
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:12,145
Shit.

69
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,605
Hey. Watch it.

70
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:17,066
One more miss and you'll get blocked.

71
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,860
Think hard. Got anything else?

72
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:33,624
Checking-- Please select the amount
you would like to withdraw.

73
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,210
What was it? What did you use?

74
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:37,670
Today. My daughter's birthday.

75
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:41,424
Man, that old woman cares more
about her granddaughter than me.

76
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:42,675
Jeez.

77
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:46,721
No. 9 Triple Line is in second.
No. 6 Dry Thunder is in third.

78
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:48,556
No. 3 Jack Prince is coming in fourth…

79
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,391
widening the gap with the lead.

80
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:52,852
Passing through the straight course,
into that turn,

81
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:55,521
-Yes, that's it. Number nine!
-Whip it! Whip!

82
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:57,857
-No. 3 Jack Prince is accelerating
-Whip! Whip!

83
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,693
-and catching up to No. 9 Triple Line.
-Let's go! Come on!

84
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:04,238
-No. 4 Hwarang is not giving up his place.
-Whip it! Run!

85
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:07,116
-No. 4 Hwarang crosses the finish line.
-No, no!

86
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,743
Damn it!

87
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:11,871
You said number nine
was a surefire winner!

88
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,083
That dumbass.

89
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:19,128
How could you lose
with such a great horse?

90
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:30,807
Bets for the tenth race are
about to close.

91
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:33,643
-I repeat.
-Hurry up, will you?

92
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:36,604
Bets for the tenth race are
about to close.

93
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:38,523
Hey.

94
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:43,444
-What are you--
-Will you just leave me the heck alone?

95
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:45,154
I'm trying to think!

96
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:56,916
All right.

97
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:03,089
No. 9 Baekil Legend
is placed right in the middle.

98
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:04,715
No. 6 Thunderflash is quickly catching up
to the frontrunners.

99
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,175
Good, keep going.

100
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:07,969
-But the gap is still wide.
-Run!

101
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:11,013
-They're heading into the curve again.
-Okay. Turn.

102
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,141
-No. 7 Golden Bullet and No. 8 Mad Dash.
-Yes, turn.

103
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:16,018
-They're going full speed.
-Stick to them! Outside!

104
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:18,479
But, wait! Wrapping around the outside…

105
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:20,606
-It's No. 6 Thunderflash!
-Yes!

106
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,483
-And he continues to gain ground.
-Six and eight, go!

107
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:24,485
-The gap is closing!
-Whip! Whip it!

108
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:27,321
-No. 6 has now taken second place.
-Go! Go!

109
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:28,948
-And he's not stopping there.
-Go! Go!

110
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:32,034
-He's taken the lead!
-Go! Go!

111
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,912
-No. 6 Thunderflash brings it home!
-Yes!

112
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:39,876
Come to me! Six and eight!

113
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,127
I got it!

114
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:43,504
-Where did six come from?
-Man, seriously!

115
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:46,591
What did I say?
I told you it's my daughter's birthday!

116
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:48,551
June 8. So, 6 and 8!

117
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,723
Here's 4,560,000 won.

118
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:54,807
Thank you.

119
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:58,186
Here.

120
00:07:58,269 --> 00:07:59,770
Buy yourself a cup of coffee.

121
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:00,771
What about me?

122
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,191
-My mom's money pulled through!
-Wait for me, buddy!

123
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:04,108
Where's the ATM?

124
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:06,527
OFF-TRACK BETTING

125
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:12,950
Daddy will go pick you up at the academy.

126
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:18,581
What? Fried chicken?

127
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:21,250
Hey, you can totally choose
something more expensive.

128
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,503
Write down everything you want to eat.

129
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,213
No.

130
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,049
Focus on your teachers during class.

131
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:29,634
Write it down during recess, okay?

132
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:32,637
All right. Seven o'clock.

133
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,598
Guess what I'm getting you
for your birthday.

134
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:37,391
You can look forward to it.

135
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:38,768
You'll be surprised…

136
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:42,104
Hey, Gi-hun!

137
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:43,147
Hey!

138
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:45,483
Long time no see!

139
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:49,111
Okay, Ga-yeong, love you too.

140
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:51,697
-What?
-Hey, get him!

141
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:56,452
Excuse me. Coming through!

142
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:05,002
I'm sorry. You okay, kid?

143
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:06,671
Goodness.

144
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:10,716
-I'm sorry.
-Grab him!

145
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,969
Hey! Stop right there!

146
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:18,349
Wait. One second. Let me just get up.

147
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:21,727
I have money. I really do.

148
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:23,229
You do?

149
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,023
Then why did you run?

150
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:27,275
That's because…

151
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:32,238
I wanted to pay you all at once
to save you the trouble.

152
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:36,284
Goodness, what a trooper.

153
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:38,244
So? How much do you have?

154
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:39,620
Four million.

155
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:43,791
Please take this for now,
and I'll pay the rest next month…

156
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:52,300
You okay, kid?

157
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:56,679
Let me see.

158
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,514
Come on, let me see.

159
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,433
Goodness.

160
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,898
That's sweet.

161
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:11,027
You must have spent my money
on some good food.

162
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,862
I had money on me.

163
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:14,280
Just now, six and eight…

164
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:17,158
Six and eight were winners,
so I had money.

165
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:18,200
Hey.

166
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:28,085
Do you know why
it's so easy to get nosebleeds?

167
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:32,423
Because there are
a lot of capillary vessels in there.

168
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:35,009
No, please. Please don't kill me.

169
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:36,052
Your blood tasted nice.

170
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:39,597
Maybe I'll fill up a bowl
and cook up some blood soup tonight.

171
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,098
I'll pay you back.

172
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:45,353
I really mean it. I'll pay up.

173
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:47,438
Man, you punk.

174
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:49,940
Don't cry. You're making me feel bad.

175
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:52,109
You just had to know I'm a softie.

176
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:55,404
Hey.

177
00:10:58,282 --> 00:10:59,784
Now, wipe off your tears

178
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:02,161
and stamp your fingerprint.

179
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:07,291
If you don't pay up by next month,
I'm taking one of your kidneys here

180
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:10,086
and one of these eyes here instead.

181
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,214
You don't like it?

182
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:16,342
That's not it. Yes, I understand.

183
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,178
-Here.
-Okay.

184
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:21,013
Well, I need an ink pad.

185
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,103
There it is. All-natural ink.

186
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:28,562
Sorry?

187
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,481
Right, yes.

188
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:33,651
Yes, right there. Good.

189
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:35,820
WAIVER OF PHYSICAL RIGHTS

190
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:38,531
Great job.

191
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:42,201
You have a month. Take care of yourself.

192
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,829
Wait, sir.

193
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:48,874
Well, I'm sorry but…

194
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:52,711
can you lend me 10,000 won?

195
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:57,800
Seriously, you little…

196
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,053
WINDOW CLOSED

197
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:04,557
Excuse me.

198
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:07,309
I'm sorry,

199
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:12,064
could I have that 10,000 won back?

200
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:17,403
THE FUN DOESN'T END, CRANE GAME

201
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:26,120
Darn it.

202
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:27,371
Come on!

203
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:41,635
Okay. That's it.

204
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:43,679
Damn!

205
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:50,144
Fuck!

206
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:51,687
Mister,

207
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:54,565
poking around at random
won't get you anything.

208
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:56,775
Are you any good?

209
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:12,958
That's it. Good.

210
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:14,960
Yes, that's it.

211
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:26,347
Great job! Great work!

212
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:37,316
This?

213
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:41,445
I got bitten by a huge mosquito.

214
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:45,282
Mosquitoes are really mean these days.

215
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:51,330
Dad, you can get into fights all you want,

216
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:53,457
but just don't get beaten up.

217
00:13:57,628 --> 00:14:00,089
I'm sorry, sweetie.

218
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:04,426
I wanted to buy you
something more delicious.

219
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,427
It's okay.

220
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:09,473
I went to a steakhouse
with Mom and my stepdad.

221
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:13,811
You had steak?

222
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:17,481
I see.

223
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:22,653
But I think tteokbokki is way better.

224
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:29,243
Mom thinks this is junk food
and doesn't let me have it.

225
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:33,038
Eat up.

226
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:35,040
Right!

227
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:39,670
Ga-yeong, I got you a birthday present.

228
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:56,687
You know, a lot of women
join the military too these days.

229
00:14:57,313 --> 00:15:01,901
Your future is a world
where men and women are equal.

230
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:04,194
You need to get used to these things.

231
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:12,369
It even has a light.

232
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:17,082
Hey, it looks super real, doesn't it?

233
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:23,839
I think you'll get in trouble again
when Mom sees this.

234
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,090
You think?

235
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,053
I guess I'll have to keep it
until you get older.

236
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:30,846
Don't use it to smoke though.

237
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,264
I quit smoking.

238
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,065
All right.

239
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:44,026
I'll be sure to quit smoking.

240
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:47,655
And on your next birthday,
I'll get you a really awesome present.

241
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:49,865
I promise, Ga-yeong.

242
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:52,201
Next year?

243
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:53,994
Think of your birthday last year.

244
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:55,496
It came around quickly, right?

245
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:57,581
The next one will come around
in a flash too.

246
00:15:58,374 --> 00:15:59,458
Dad.

247
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:02,211
Yes? What is it?

248
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:06,715
Never mind.

249
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:12,262
All right. Have some more tteokbokki.

250
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,474
Excuse me,
we'll get another 1,000 won's worth.

251
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:17,559
Mix in a lot of fish cake.

252
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:36,370
Why did you bring her back so late?
She's not wearing enough layers.

253
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:39,206
She got sleepy, so I had to carry her.

254
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:41,917
We're only ten minutes late.

255
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,752
I said I'd drive to pick her up.

256
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,046
That's enough. It's her birthday.

257
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:48,215
Mom.

258
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:50,342
-There, there.
-Ga-yeong, come down.

259
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:53,095
I'll carry her to the elevator.

260
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:54,513
It'll become a bad habit. Get off.

261
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:55,597
Mom…

262
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:58,183
-Ga-yeong, come down.
-Jeez. Seriously.

263
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:00,561
Wake up. Let's go.

264
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:09,111
Bye, Dad.

265
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:10,738
Go on in.

266
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,460
Hold up! Wait a sec…

267
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:56,158
Sir.

268
00:17:57,534 --> 00:17:58,911
Do you have a minute?

269
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,082
I don't believe in Jesus.

270
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:05,709
It's not that.

271
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:09,046
I'd like to offer you
a great opportunity--

272
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:19,848
I come from a Buddhist household,
so stop bothering me and get lost.

273
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:23,644
Sir.

274
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,688
Would you like to play a game with me?

275
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:30,234
What are you?

276
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:32,861
Here to sell me something?

277
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,115
You people have all sorts
of sales tricks these days.

278
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:39,868
I can see how unfortunate
your situation is,

279
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,120
but I have no time to…

280
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:48,460
Sir, you've played ddakji before,
haven't you?

281
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:53,048
Play ddakji with me.

282
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,925
Each time you win,
I will give you 100,000 won.

283
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:04,852
Wait, so if I flip your ddakji over,

284
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:07,646
you'll give me 100,000 won?

285
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:11,316
However, each time I win,
you must give me 100,000 won.

286
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,532
I'll let you go first.

287
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:26,582
I'm in a really foul mood today.

288
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:31,420
If this is some kind of scam,
I'm going to kill you today.

289
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:34,840
I'm really going to go first.

290
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:39,178
Which color do you want?

291
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,337
Do you not have any money?

292
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:15,255
Money…

293
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:19,134
Then you can pay with your body.

294
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:20,844
My body?

295
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:24,097
What the hell?

296
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:26,350
I'll shave off 100,000 won per slap.

297
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:32,773
One more round.

298
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:34,191
The doors are opening.

299
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:38,028
Another round!

300
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:46,513
I won! See that?

301
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:48,932
Did you see that? I won!

302
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:52,019
Come here. Get your face over here.

303
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,063
Let go of this, you jerk.

304
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:58,108
Here's your 100,000 won.

305
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:02,779
Congratulations.

306
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:09,578
Right.

307
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:11,997
I get 100,000 won.

308
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:22,215
Sir.

309
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:24,885
You can make big money
playing games like this for a few days.

310
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:27,971
Would you like to give it a try?

311
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:30,307
Hey, man.

312
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:32,851
This is some
new sort of pyramid scheme, right?

313
00:22:34,394 --> 00:22:35,979
But you got the wrong man.

314
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:38,023
I'm not that naive.

315
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:45,197
Mr. Seong Gi-hun.

316
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:49,910
You signed a waiver
giving up your physical rights today, yes?

317
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,456
Name, Seong Gi-hun. 47 years old.

318
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:56,708
Highest level of education,
Daehan Technical High School.

319
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:59,252
Former employee of Dragon Motors,
Assembly Team One.

320
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:01,379
Resigned ten years ago
during restructuring.

321
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:04,007
Opened a chicken restaurant
and a snack bar, both failed.

322
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:05,425
Currently working as a chauffeur.

323
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:08,804
Has a ten-year-old girl with an ex-wife,
divorced three years ago.

324
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:12,516
As of now,
you owe 160 million won to loan sharks

325
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:15,185
and 255 million won to the bank.

326
00:23:19,397 --> 00:23:20,315
Who are you?

327
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:23,944
How dare you run a background check on me?

328
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:31,076
We don't have many spots left.

329
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:36,164
Give me a call.

330
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,989
All right. Whatever.

331
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:15,120
Thirsty in the middle of the night
I open the fridge

332
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:16,538
Did you have a drink today?

333
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:18,373
No.

334
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:21,710
I haven't had a single drink,
but I feel tipsy.

335
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:25,630
I made money today. That's why!

336
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:30,218
Gi-hun, do you still gamble?

337
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:32,179
I didn't gamble.

338
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:34,931
I earned this money fair and square.

339
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:36,516
Then what's with your face?

340
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,436
-You're getting into fights now?
-Come on. Forget it.

341
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:43,064
What's Sang-woo up to these days?
His job going okay?

342
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:44,566
He's always busy.

343
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,152
He's abroad right now on a business trip.

344
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:49,529
That ungrateful punk.

345
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:52,115
Tell him to call me when he comes home.

346
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:53,867
You remember, right?

347
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:56,244
He got into Seoul National University
all thanks to me.

348
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:58,788
I used to take him to school
when we were kids.

349
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:02,083
He got into college and got a job
because of me,

350
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:04,169
but he's never bought me a drink.

351
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:07,380
Stop talking nonsense.
Take this and go home.

352
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:09,132
Don't go to a bar. Go straight home.

353
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:11,551
Here. Keep the change.

354
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:19,476
Thirsty in the middle of the night
I open the fridge

355
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:21,519
That's worth 12,000 won, you rascal.

356
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:29,152
A salted mackerel
In the corner of the room

357
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:42,374
Are you hungry? Are you?

358
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:44,668
Here.

359
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:46,836
Have this.

360
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:49,923
Don't leave any leftovers, okay?

361
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:52,717
I got slapped to earn the money for that.

362
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:03,520
I am quite the fool

363
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:07,857
Just looking at my mom pleases me

364
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:14,281
Here, some money for you.

365
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:17,534
Take it.

366
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:18,451
Goodness.

367
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:21,538
Did you gamble again?

368
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:23,915
I didn't.

369
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:27,460
Then, what happened to your face?

370
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:30,505
Why aren't you answering?

371
00:26:30,588 --> 00:26:32,299
It's nothing like that!

372
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:37,178
Wait, did you steal this from someone?

373
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:40,890
I didn't gamble or steal.

374
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:46,229
I worked my hands, face, and body off
to earn this money.

375
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:48,064
Jeez.

376
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:58,992
Did you buy fried chicken for Ga-yeong?

377
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:02,078
I bought her dinner

378
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:05,290
and a birthday present before I came home.

379
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:08,168
Did she tell you anything?

380
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:10,920
Tell me what?

381
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:16,176
Ga-yeong, her mother, and her stepdad

382
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:20,347
are all moving to the US next year.

383
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:26,436
And on your next birthday,
I'll get you a really awesome present.

384
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:28,396
I promise, Ga-yeong.

385
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:31,066
Next year?

386
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:33,568
The US?

387
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:35,028
Yes.

388
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:39,032
Her stepdad got a new job in the US,

389
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:42,994
so the entire family is moving there.

390
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,458
I see.

391
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:53,505
How can you shove anything
down your throat right now?

392
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:56,674
You need to get your daughter back.

393
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:00,261
How am I supposed to do that?

394
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:05,183
That was settled
when we signed the divorce papers.

395
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:14,275
There's a young man upstairs
who studied law or something.

396
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:20,907
He says if the father can
financially support the child,

397
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:24,285
he can take the child back.

398
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:29,582
Once she moves to the US,

399
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:31,376
she'll forget all her Korean,

400
00:28:31,459 --> 00:28:34,254
and you two
will never understand each other.

401
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:38,091
You'll become a complete stranger to her.

402
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:41,761
Are you sure

403
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:46,391
you can live without seeing her?

404
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:40,153
Hello.

405
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:42,197
I'm…

406
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:45,450
the guy who got
your business card this afternoon.

407
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:47,786
Do you wish to participate in the game?

408
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:51,915
If you wish to participate,
please state your name and birthdate.

409
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:08,306
Gosh.

410
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,029
Mr. Seong Gi-hun?

411
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:26,699
Yes.

412
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:27,742
The password?

413
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:34,374
Red light, green light.

414
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,850
I guess everyone is…

415
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:53,977
tired.

416
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:57,689
How long will it take

417
00:30:58,648 --> 00:31:00,275
to get to the gaming place?

418
00:31:30,763 --> 00:31:31,681
What?

419
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:43,836
Fifty, fifty-two…

420
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:47,006
fifty-five, fifty-six…

421
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:48,007
Sir.

422
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:50,385
What are you doing?

423
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:52,929
Don't talk to me. You're distracting me.

424
00:32:54,013 --> 00:32:55,223
Fifty… what was it?

425
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:01,020
You're counting how many people are here?

426
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:03,940
Yes, so stop talking to me.

427
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:06,526
And then… What?

428
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:08,653
Wait.

429
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:10,863
Where was I?

430
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:15,451
Sir, look over there.
There are 456 people here.

431
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:19,247
Wait, you were the first to get here.

432
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:21,290
And I'm… What?

433
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:23,626
I'm last.

434
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:27,505
I know that too.

435
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:30,216
I'm just counting the numbers.

436
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:33,052
My doctor said counting numbers

437
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:35,638
is good for preventing dementia.

438
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:38,474
What were you thinking coming here when
you're old enough to worry about dementia?

439
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:41,769
You should be eating meals
your daughter-in-law makes for you,

440
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:44,981
and lying down on the warm floor
enjoying your cute grandchildren.

441
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:47,692
What about your parents?

442
00:33:47,775 --> 00:33:51,362
Are they enjoying freshly-cooked meals
from their daughter-in-law?

443
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:58,536
You see, my days are numbered.

444
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:00,038
Sorry?

445
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:02,373
My doctor said

446
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:06,377
there's a lump in my head.

447
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:08,963
A lump?

448
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,173
A brain tumor.

449
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:15,094
You bitch!

450
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:20,475
Hey!

451
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:21,934
Geez.

452
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:24,020
Didn't think I'd run into you here.

453
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:27,315
Look at those eyes.
Your temper hasn't changed.

454
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:29,067
Then again,

455
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:33,571
you're not the type to wuss out
just from a couple blows.

456
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:37,366
I fed you, put a roof over your head,
even taught you my skills,

457
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:39,368
and you stab me in the back?

458
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:42,163
You already took more than what I owe you.

459
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:45,416
If you're so confident,
why did you run away?

460
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:48,586
I didn't run away.
I just went independent.

461
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,091
What?

462
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:14,737
Independent?
You think you're Yu Gwan-sun or something?

463
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:16,864
Go out and wave the national flag, then.

464
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:17,907
Oh, right.

465
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:21,744
You're from the North,
so wave the North Korean flag.

466
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:26,415
Come here.

467
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:28,084
That scar on your neck.

468
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:29,669
Yes, it's you, the pickpocket!

469
00:35:29,752 --> 00:35:32,213
Give me my money back. Where's my money?

470
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:33,548
Give it back!

471
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,968
What the hell?

472
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:39,512
Who are you?

473
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:42,181
Who the hell are you?

474
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,600
Me? Well…

475
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:47,979
I'm Seong Gi-hun from Ssangmun-dong.

476
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:49,105
Hey, Mr. Ssangmun-dong.

477
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:50,273
Yes?

478
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:52,525
I wasn't done with this bitch.

479
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:56,154
I'm sorry, but I also have
some urgent business

480
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:57,530
with this lady over here.

481
00:35:58,114 --> 00:35:59,157
You bastard.

482
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,576
How do you know this bitch?

483
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:03,077
My god.

484
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,204
Then how do you know her?

485
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:09,208
You're obviously a thug preying
on girls like her. Your face says it all.

486
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:11,460
Did you tell her to steal my money?

487
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:13,504
-You son of a bitch!
-Wait!

488
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:15,214
This thug is trying to kill me!

489
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,426
Someone get over here! We need help!

490
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:20,094
There they are.

491
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,221
Over here! We got a thug and a pickpocket.

492
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:24,056
A thug and a pickpocket.

493
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:53,211
I would like to extend
a hearty welcome to all of you.

494
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:57,590
Everyone here will participate
in six different games over six days.

495
00:36:57,673 --> 00:37:02,553
Those who win all six games
will receive a handsome cash prize.

496
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:05,014
How are we supposed to believe you?

497
00:37:05,097 --> 00:37:08,184
You suddenly put us to sleep,
took away our phones and wallets,

498
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:10,144
then dragged us here
to this mysterious place.

499
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:13,481
Now you show up and say you'll
pay us handsomely for a few games?

500
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,399
Do you expect us to believe that?

501
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:17,652
We had to enforce those procedures

502
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:21,322
to ensure the utmost security
in bringing you here.

503
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:24,242
We'll return everything
once the games are over.

504
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:28,329
How come you are wearing those masks?

505
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:30,414
We do not disclose the faces

506
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:33,501
or personal information of our staff
to the participants.

507
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:37,713
It's for the sake of fairness and secrecy.

508
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:40,758
-Please understand.
-I don't trust a word you just said.

509
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:43,803
Enticement, abduction, confinement.

510
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:47,014
After all that illegal activity,
you give us these excuses

511
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:48,557
without even revealing who you are.

512
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:52,603
Give us one good reason
why we should trust you.

513
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:54,855
Player 218, Cho Sang-woo.

514
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:58,150
Age, 46.

515
00:37:58,234 --> 00:38:00,903
Former supervisor
of Team Two at Joy Investments.

516
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:02,780
Embezzled money from his clients,

517
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:06,325
invested it in derivatives and futures
and failed.

518
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:09,036
Current loss, 650 million won.

519
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,247
Player 107, Kim Mi-ok,
540 million won in debt.

520
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:13,416
Player 118, Oh Yeong-uk,
1.02 billion won in debt.

521
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:16,252
Player 322, Jung Min-tae,
880 million won in debt.

522
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:18,754
Player 119, No Sang-hun,
1.39 billion won in debt.

523
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:21,674
Player 369, Park Ju-un,
900 million won in debt.

524
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:24,927
All of you in this room

525
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:30,057
have crippling debts
and are now on a cliff-edge.

526
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:35,021
When we first went to you,
you did not trust us either.

527
00:38:35,604 --> 00:38:38,190
But as you know, we played a game

528
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:40,818
and gave you money as promised.

529
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:42,903
And so you trusted us

530
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:48,284
and volunteered to participate
according to your own free will.

531
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:51,996
You have one last chance to decide.

532
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:59,211
Do you want to go back and live out your
pathetic lives running from creditors?

533
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:04,133
Or will you seize the last opportunity
we are offering?

534
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:10,973
What kind of games are we playing?

535
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:12,933
For the sake of fairness,

536
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:15,561
we cannot disclose any information
prior to the games.

537
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:17,229
Excuse me.

538
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:20,483
Just how much is the prize money?

539
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:33,913
The prize money will accumulate
in that piggy bank after each game.

540
00:39:36,582 --> 00:39:41,420
The amount will be revealed to everyone
after the first game.

541
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:46,175
Those who do not wish to participate,
please speak up now.

542
00:40:17,164 --> 00:40:18,874
PLAYER CONSENT FORM

UPON A MAJORITY VOTE.

546
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:28,509
Is this all?

547
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:51,490
SIGNATURE, SEONG GI-HUN

548
00:40:54,201 --> 00:40:57,288
The game is about to begin.

549
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:02,710
All players, follow the staff's
instructions and proceed to the game hall.

550
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:09,675
Hey, look over there.

551
00:41:11,051 --> 00:41:12,970
Damn, this place is freaking huge.

552
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:16,557
Please look into the camera.

553
00:41:23,522 --> 00:41:25,274
Please look into the camera.

554
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:29,945
Damn it.

555
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:32,156
Move, dumbass.

556
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:39,246
Please look into the camera.

557
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:57,700
Verified.

558
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:14,466
Hey, Sang-woo!

559
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:18,637
It is you, Sang-woo.

560
00:43:19,471 --> 00:43:21,765
What happened? Why are you here?

561
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:24,602
I went to your mom's store recently,

562
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:26,895
and she said you were abroad
on a business trip.

563
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:29,857
And what was that about earlier?

564
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:31,650
You're in debt?

565
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:34,278
Cho Sang-woo, SNU alum,
the pride of Ssangmun-dong?

566
00:43:34,361 --> 00:43:36,614
Welcome to the first game.

567
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:37,573
Let's talk later.

568
00:43:37,656 --> 00:43:42,578
All players,
please wait a moment on the field.

569
00:43:42,661 --> 00:43:44,538
Let me repeat.

570
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:49,084
All players,
please wait a moment on the field.

571
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:47,434
-Hey.
-What?

572
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:49,812
Look over there. What is that?

573
00:44:49,895 --> 00:44:51,146
It looks really freaky.

574
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:53,315
Damn, the head's freaking huge.

575
00:44:54,274 --> 00:44:59,154
The first game is Red Light, Green Light.

576
00:45:01,615 --> 00:45:07,621
You can move forward while the tagger
shouts, "Green light, red light."

577
00:45:07,704 --> 00:45:11,750
If your movement is detected afterward,
you will be eliminated.

578
00:45:12,584 --> 00:45:13,836
Red Light, Green Light?

579
00:45:15,421 --> 00:45:17,339
The game we played as kids?

580
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:19,758
-Let me repeat.
-I think so.

581
00:45:20,342 --> 00:45:23,178
-Is this a fucking joke?
-You can move forward…

582
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:24,805
This is what they want us to do?

583
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:26,890
Want to bet who finishes first?

584
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:29,935
If your movement is detected afterward,
you will be eliminated.

585
00:45:30,018 --> 00:45:30,894
A million won.

586
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:32,563
Deal?

587
00:45:32,646 --> 00:45:34,690
Man, fuck me.

588
00:45:34,773 --> 00:45:35,607
Deal.

589
00:45:36,191 --> 00:45:40,779
Those who cross the finish line
without getting caught in five minutes

590
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:42,322
pass this round.

591
00:45:42,948 --> 00:45:44,658
Then let the game begin.

592
00:45:46,618 --> 00:45:52,166
Green light, red light.

593
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:58,714
Player 324. Eliminated.

594
00:45:59,673 --> 00:46:00,883
Dumbass got caught.

595
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:06,930
What…

596
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:09,308
was that sound?

597
00:46:16,648 --> 00:46:21,987
Green light, red light.

598
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:27,618
You're eliminated, dumbass.

599
00:46:28,702 --> 00:46:30,370
Quit the show and get up.

600
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:51,326
Let me repeat.

601
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:57,457
You can move forward while the tagger
shouts, "Green light, red light."

602
00:47:57,541 --> 00:48:03,547
If your movement is detected afterward,
you will be eliminated.

603
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:09,803
Let me repeat.

604
00:48:10,596 --> 00:48:15,559
You can move forward while the tagger
shouts, "Green light, red light."

605
00:48:16,852 --> 00:48:20,689
If your movement is detected afterward,
you will be eliminated.

606
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:23,942
Let the game begin.

607
00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:29,781
Green light, red light.

608
00:48:37,956 --> 00:48:43,086
Green light, red light.

609
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:51,219
Green light, red light.

610
00:48:56,224 --> 00:48:59,102
Green light, red light.

611
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:06,193
Gi-hun, don't turn your head. Just listen.

612
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:08,904
You'll die if you stay like that.

613
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:11,531
I think that doll is a motion sensor.

614
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:15,243
You won't get caught
if you hide behind someone.

615
00:49:17,204 --> 00:49:21,041
Green light, red light.

616
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:30,550
There's no time.

617
00:49:36,181 --> 00:49:39,726
Green light, red light.

618
00:49:50,028 --> 00:49:52,906
Green light, red light.

619
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:03,458
Green light, red light.

620
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:08,296
Who is it? Behind me all along.

621
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:10,799
The one who stabbed you in the back.

622
00:50:12,384 --> 00:50:13,552
You bitch.

623
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:17,264
Want another stab in the back? Right now?

624
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:18,432
No, don't.

625
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:20,100
Please.

626
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:21,852
Stop trembling, dumbass.

627
00:50:21,935 --> 00:50:23,353
You'll die if you get caught.

628
00:50:23,437 --> 00:50:25,605
Green light, red light.

629
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:37,242
Green light, red light.

630
00:50:37,909 --> 00:50:41,663
Please, help me. Please?

631
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:42,998
Let me go!

632
00:50:43,081 --> 00:50:46,293
Please…

633
00:50:48,754 --> 00:50:51,590
Green light, red light.

634
00:50:58,054 --> 00:51:00,891
Green light, red light.

635
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:12,489
