EPISODE 2
HELL

2
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:27,921
Sang-woo.

3
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:31,758
Thanks.

4
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:38,598
Thank you.

5
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:42,352
You two saved my life.

6
00:01:44,103 --> 00:01:46,272
I'm glad you're alive.

7
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:04,999
Congratulations for making it
through the first game.

8
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:08,378
Here are the results of the first game.

9
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,392
Out of 456 players,
255 players have been eliminated.

10
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:25,812
201 players have completed the first game.

11
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,193
Sir!

12
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:35,488
Forgive me.

13
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:37,240
I'll pay off my debts no matter what.

14
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:39,826
I'll pay back at all costs.

15
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:41,953
Please, sir.

16
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:43,663
I have…

17
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:46,624
a child.

18
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:52,463
I haven't even named my baby yet,
so I couldn't register the baby's birth.

19
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:56,593
Please let me leave.

20
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:59,220
Sir, please forgive me.

21
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:01,514
Please. Please spare my life.

22
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,600
I'll find a way to pay my debts off.

23
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:04,893
-Please spare me.
-Me too.

24
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:06,477
I want to stop here. Please let me go.

25
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:08,146
Please spare my life.

26
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:10,523
Please let me go home.

27
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,108
Please spare me!

28
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:14,235
There seems to be a misunderstanding.

29
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,614
We are not here to harm you
or collect your debts.

30
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:21,868
Let me remind you.
We are presenting you with an opportunity.

31
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:22,785
An opportunity?

32
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,871
You call this an opportunity?

33
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:28,249
You make us play a children's game
and then kill us.

34
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,418
How is this an opportunity?

35
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:31,711
We may be in debt,

36
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,714
but that doesn't mean we deserve to die.

37
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:36,674
This is just a game.

38
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:38,343
You killed all those people.

39
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:40,470
And yet you call this a game?

40
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:43,598
They were simply eliminated
for breaking the rules of the game.

41
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:45,808
As long as you follow the rules,

42
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:49,479
you will safely exit this place
with the promised prize money.

43
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:51,898
Prize money or no prize money,
I don't care.

44
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:55,902
Just please let me out.

45
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:00,949
Clause one of the consent form:

46
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:03,451
A player is not allowed
to voluntarily quit the games.

47
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:06,788
You really think
you can get away with all of this?

48
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:12,418
The police will barge in any minute,
looking for the people reported missing.

49
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:14,170
He's right.

50
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:16,881
If you don't let us go,

51
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:20,301
they'll locate us by tracking our phones
and come find us!

52
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,971
- Then that will be it for you!
- You'll be done for!

53
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,480
Clause two of the consent form:

54
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:36,526
A player who refuses to play
will be eliminated.

55
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:38,486
Clause three of the consent form:

56
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:42,156
The games may be terminated…

57
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:44,534
upon a majority vote.

58
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:46,911
Is that correct?

59
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:52,417
That is correct.

60
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:55,962
Then let us take a vote.

61
00:04:57,046 --> 00:04:59,674
If the majority wishes to quit,

62
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:01,509
you will have to let us go.

63
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:09,517
As you wish, we will take a vote
on whether or not to terminate the games.

64
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,273
But before we vote,

65
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:19,277
we will reveal the prize amount
from the first game.

66
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:09,494
The number of players eliminated
in the first game, 255.

67
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:12,371
Allocated prize money for each player,
100 million won.

68
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:14,957
Therefore,
a current total of 25.5 billion won

69
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,627
has been accumulated into the piggy bank.

70
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:21,297
If you quit the games now,

71
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,925
the 25.5 billion won will be sent
to the families of the eliminated players,

72
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:25,426
100 million won each.

73
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:29,013
However, all of you will
return home empty-handed.

74
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:31,849
Excuse me.

75
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:36,938
If we make it through all six games,

76
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:39,524
how much do we get?

77
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:45,113
There are 456 players.
So the total is 45.6 billion won.

78
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:48,991
We will begin the vote.

79
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:53,746
You can see two buttons in front of you.

80
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:57,542
If you wish to continue,
press the green button with an O.

81
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:02,088
If you wish to cease,
press the red button with an X.

82
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:06,676
Once you finish voting,
move to the other side of the white line.

83
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:10,972
The vote will be held
in reverse of the number on your chests.

84
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:13,558
Player 456, please cast your vote.

85
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:46,299
Player 453, please cast your vote.

86
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,151
Player 218.

87
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:15,846
Have you all gone insane?

88
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:19,308
You want this madness to continue?

89
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,518
So what happens if we leave?

90
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,646
Is anything different out there?

91
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:28,025
It's hell out there anyway, fuck.

92
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:30,361
She's right!

93
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:34,282
If we stop now,
we're only doing the dead ones a favor.

94
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:37,285
They're going to get 100 million won.

95
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:40,288
We're the ones who won!
That makes no sense.

96
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:43,332
Please. Please don't do this.

97
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,543
We should go home.

98
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,004
I don't have a home to go back to anyway.

99
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:51,465
At least here, I have hope. But out there?

100
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,176
I got nothing out there.

101
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,388
Let's stay and stick it out to the end!

102
00:09:57,471 --> 00:10:00,933
I'd rather stay here and die trying
than die out there like a dog.

103
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:04,312
Son of a bitch! Go die by yourself
if that's what you want.

104
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:06,314
Don't drag us all into this, you fucker.

105
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:07,732
What the fuck's wrong with you?

106
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:17,325
We will no longer condone any acts
that impede this democratic process.

107
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,495
Now, let us resume the voting.

108
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:59,617
Now, this is the last voter.

109
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,743
Player 1.

110
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:31,816
My doctor said

111
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:34,985
there's a lump in my head.

112
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:36,779
A brain tumor.

113
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:49,250
If you wish to continue, press O.

114
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:53,546
If you wish to cease, press X.

115
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:30,207
The majority has voted
to terminate the games.

116
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,793
And so, the games are now terminated.

117
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:35,129
No. Let out the ones who want to leave,

118
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:37,923
and let the remaining players continue.

119
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:39,967
Half of us are already dead!

120
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,343
You can't just stop here!

121
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:44,722
He's right! At least let us continue!

122
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:46,265
Yes! Let us continue!

123
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:50,352
We also find it a pity
to say goodbye so soon.

124
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:55,191
But we will not completely
shut this door of opportunity.

125
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,818
If the majority of you wish
to participate again,

126
00:12:57,902 --> 00:13:00,988
we will resume the games.

127
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:04,241
Goodbye, then.

128
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:18,672
Help! There's a person here!

129
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:20,758
Is anybody there? Over here!

130
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:21,800
Will you shut up?

131
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:23,052
What?

132
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:31,352
Who are you?

133
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:36,482
Pickpocket? Is that you, pickpocket?

134
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:38,692
Unless you want to lie here all night,
try to untie me.

135
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:40,027
What?

136
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,954
Damn it. Where are we?

137
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:54,208
Hey. Can you untie me now?

138
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:57,336
Hey, I… Right.

139
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:59,421
You can get dressed first.
It's cold, isn't it?

140
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,382
I'm freezing too.

141
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:04,260
Man. Jeez. Yes, hurry up.

142
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:07,304
Man, my legs hurt. Hey.

143
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:12,560
Hey, you need to untie me now.
Come on. Hey.

144
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:16,021
Wait! What are you doing?
You need to untie me before you go.

145
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:19,066
Why should I?

146
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:21,193
Because I untied you!

147
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:24,321
At your age, are you stupid or just naive?

148
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,156
If I untie you,

149
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,367
you'll just hassle me about your money.

150
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,244
That's a separate thing.

151
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:31,954
Okay, fine.

152
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:34,832
I'll forget about the money.
Just untie me, will you?

153
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:38,711
Do you mean that?

154
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:42,298
Yes, I really won't say anything
about the money.

155
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:43,632
How can I trust you?

156
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:46,969
I swear on my mom's life.

157
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:49,513
Untie me now. It's fucking freezing!

158
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,765
God damn it. That hurts.

159
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:53,142
Darn it.

160
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,942
Damn it. Come here.

161
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:04,528
My money… Give me my money back.

162
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:06,530
Give me… Damn it.

163
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:08,949
Give me my money back! Give it back! Man.

164
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:12,244
Fuck, give me my money.

165
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:14,955
I feel really bad for your mother.

166
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:19,251
You little… Hey, stop right there. Hey!

167
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:22,546
Hey! Stop right there!

168
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:24,590
Damn it!

169
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:36,101
Sir, where are we?

170
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:42,107
Yeouido.

171
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:46,737
Where exactly is Yeouido?

172
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:52,993
In the center of Seoul.

173
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:00,834
Sir, do you have a phone?

174
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:03,754
I want to make one call.

175
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:06,090
Just one call.

176
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:16,266
That'll be 2,000 won.

177
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:27,695
CYBER POLICE: SUBPOENA HAS BEEN SENT.
SANG-WOO, CALL US NOW AND WE WON'T SUE.

178
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:29,989
MR. CHO SANG-WOO, YOUR LOANS ARE…
SEOUL POLICE: YOU ARE TO ATTEND AT ONCE.

179
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:49,258
Thank you.

180
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:57,975
Hi.

181
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:00,602
Yes, I had some work.

182
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:03,105
I'm sorry.

183
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:11,071
Thank you, sir.

184
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:15,868
Goodbye.

185
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:18,287
Wait.

186
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:21,832
-Do you have money for the bus?
-Sorry?

187
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:23,208
You said you live in Ansan.

188
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:26,837
You couldn't even pay for the ramyeon.
Do you have money for a ride?

189
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:29,506
-Money.
-I don't have any money.

190
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:30,883
I walk.

191
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,428
You're going to walk
all the way to Ansan from here?

192
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:49,068
Wait a bit, then take the bus.

193
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:51,570
I can't.

194
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,323
I have no money. I can't pay you back.

195
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:57,826
I won't ask you to. Just take it.

196
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,214
Thank you.

197
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:11,590
Thank you, sir.

198
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:16,011
I'm not your sir,
so please stop calling me that.

199
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:17,387
I'm sorry.

200
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:19,890
Thank you.

201
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:24,645
Thank you.

202
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:32,069
Officer, I don't think you realize
the seriousness of this matter.

203
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:33,445
Okay, mister.

204
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:36,365
So you're saying that a bunch of weird men

205
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:39,827
gathered hundreds of strangers
in a playing field,

206
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,829
made them play a game,
and just shot them to death? Yes?

207
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:43,247
Yes!

208
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:45,124
It wasn't just one or two people.

209
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,918
They mercilessly gunned down
more than 200 people.

210
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:49,002
And what was the game?

211
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:50,546
Red Light, Green Light.

212
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,674
Red Light, Green Light,
the children's game?

213
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:54,633
Yes.

214
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:56,135
They made grown-ups play that?

215
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:57,302
That's what I'm saying!

216
00:18:57,386 --> 00:19:00,681
-And they shot everyone who got caught?
-How many times do I have to tell you?

217
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:04,101
Mister. So where is this place?
The place where they were killed.

218
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:07,980
I said I don't know. They put me to sleep
before dragging me there.

219
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:09,481
What about the killers then?

220
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,567
They were all wearing masks…

221
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,485
Then how did you get out?

222
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:17,364
Well, the players took a vote.

223
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:19,366
The majority wanted to leave, so…

224
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:22,578
Wait, so the victims said
they wanted to leave,

225
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:25,080
and the murderers said,
"Be my guest, you may leave"?

226
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:27,040
Yes.

227
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:29,918
Why did you go there in the first place?

228
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:33,547
Well…

229
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:37,759
They said they'd give me money
if I play some games.

230
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:38,886
Money?

231
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:43,473
Yes, they said
they'd give us tens of billions of won.

232
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:48,896
Okay. So let me sum up
everything you've just said.

233
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:52,733
Someone suddenly offered you a ton
of money to play some games, so you went.

234
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:54,776
They made you play Red Light, Green Light,

235
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,695
and they shot everyone who got caught.

236
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:59,448
But when you said you wanted to leave,
they let you go,

237
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:02,701
and you don't know what they look like
or where this all took place.

238
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:04,036
Am I correct?

239
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,331
Yes.

240
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:08,999
What's your name?

241
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:11,668
I'm Seong Gi-hun,
and I live in Ssangmun-dong.

242
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:14,463
Mr. Seong Gi-hun, do you have a guardian?

243
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:19,176
If you need help, we can contact
a medical institution for you.

244
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:22,888
I'm a tax-paying Ssangmun-dong citizen!
What do you take me for?

245
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:28,060
This is the business card they gave me.
You can just call them and find out!

246
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,506
Hello?

247
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:02,052
Hello, I apologize for calling so early.

248
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:04,638
May I ask you a question?

249
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:06,431
-Who is this?
-Well, I…

250
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,435
Right. I'm sorry to bother you,

251
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:14,564
but can I play some sort of game?

252
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:16,775
Game?

253
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:20,445
Yes, I'm pretty good at playing games.

254
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:22,322
Give me whatever game
and I'll do my best--

255
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:23,991
Hey.

256
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:29,246
Who the hell are you
to call me this early with this bullshit?

257
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:34,793
If you want to play games, go
to an internet cafe, you freaking pervert!

258
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:44,803
You dialed the wrong number!

259
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:47,347
-Officer, don't do this. Let go!
-Sorry, mister. Go home.

260
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:50,684
Are you sure you dialed the right number?
Are you really sure?

261
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:51,935
Just you wait.

262
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:53,812
I'll call and put you on the phone.

263
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:56,565
The number I dialed last time is
still here on my phone.

264
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:57,566
Damn it.

265
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:07,951
The number you have dialed does not exist.

266
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:11,038
Please call again
after checking the number.

267
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,837
Who was that? A drunk?

268
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,672
Just some crazy guy.

269
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:22,758
Things are awfully hectic today.

270
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:24,926
Get a grip! You want to keep coming back?

271
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:31,058
I'll get going. Have a good day.

272
00:22:33,351 --> 00:22:34,936
Keep up the good work.

273
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:41,818
Mom.

274
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:45,822
I'm home.

275
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:50,494
What the…

276
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:54,247
Mom!

277
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:01,421
Where is she?

278
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:08,261
The phone is turned off.
You will be forwarded to voicemail…

279
00:23:09,596 --> 00:23:12,724
Where did this old lady go?
She even left the door open.

280
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:23,860
Sang-woo.

281
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:27,823
What are you doing here?

282
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:41,044
Is it because of your debt?

283
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:48,718
Hey, you're the pride of Ssangmun-dong,
the genius born and raised here,

284
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:52,556
accepted to SNU Business school
as valedictorian. What's to worry about?

285
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:54,182
You can just earn the money back.

286
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,852
Go tell your mom everything
and just start fresh.

287
00:23:59,062 --> 00:24:00,147
Earn it back?

288
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:02,607
Six billion won?

289
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:04,776
Six billion?

290
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:08,238
Wait, I thought it was 600 million.

291
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:11,074
There are things they don't know.

292
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:15,704
You worked at a securities firm.
But you played with stocks?

293
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,039
Stocks weren't much.

294
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:22,294
I dealt in futures.

295
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:23,420
Futures?

296
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:26,590
You bet that much on your future?

297
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:29,676
What kind of future was it
for you to risk that much money?

298
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:33,930
- Was there a girl involved?
- It's not that kind of "future."

299
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:37,767
Never mind.

300
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:39,769
Jeez.

301
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:47,402
Can't you just file
for personal bankruptcy or whatever?

302
00:24:47,485 --> 00:24:50,238
I heard you don't have to
pay off your debts if you do that.

303
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:52,908
It's not just my money.
Everything my mom has is collateral.

304
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:55,035
Including her house,

305
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:57,412
her shop, everything.

306
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:08,965
Hello?

307
00:25:12,802 --> 00:25:13,887
Yes, speaking.

308
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:18,516
What?

309
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,518
24-HOUR EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

310
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:23,813
It's diabetes.

311
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:29,444
It was left untreated for too long.
She has complications now.

312
00:25:29,527 --> 00:25:31,613
She must've been in a lot of pain.

313
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:33,615
Did you have no idea?

314
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:36,076
She can be treated, right?

315
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:40,372
Worst-case scenario,
we may have to amputate her feet.

316
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:44,000
Let's admit her first
and watch how the treatment goes.

317
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:52,968
Mom!

318
00:25:57,806 --> 00:25:58,765
Mom!

319
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:04,312
Mom, where are you going?
He said you need to be hospitalized.

320
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:05,480
I'm fine.

321
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:07,816
What do you mean fine?

322
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:10,151
You can't even walk properly.

323
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:11,569
Forget it.

324
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:15,115
You haven't come home for days,
going off and doing whatever.

325
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:18,618
Now you suddenly show up
and try to play the good son?

326
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:20,537
Mom, don't be such a fool.

327
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,539
It will get worse if you don't treat it!

328
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:28,962
Then what? If I'm in the hospital,
who's going to pay our rent?

329
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:35,051
Also, do you have any idea
how much it costs to stay in the hospital,

330
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:36,845
let alone the treatment?

331
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,596
You have your insurance!

332
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,141
What did you say? Insurance?

333
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:43,393
Don't you remember?

334
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:48,398
You canceled everything
and used up all the money.

335
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:50,859
Please. Get a grip.

336
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:52,444
Goodness.

337
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:56,031
Gi-hun.

338
00:26:57,657 --> 00:26:59,284
I'm too tired.

339
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:04,956
I'm too tired to go on.

340
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:07,042
Let's stop this here.

341
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:15,550
Damn it. I'll bring the money!

342
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:17,969
I'll bring the money, okay?

343
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:24,642
Yes, Mom.

344
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:28,646
I'm on my way to his dorm.

345
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:33,568
I'm sure he's fine.

346
00:27:33,651 --> 00:27:36,112
You know how he dodges calls
from time to time.

347
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:42,660
I'll call everyone
who might know where he is.

348
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:45,121
If I still can't reach him,

349
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:48,291
I'll report him missing tomorrow.

350
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:53,171
I'm a police officer, remember?

351
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:55,924
I'll find him.

352
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:58,593
Yes, Mom. Don't worry too much.

353
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:01,429
CYBER DORMITORY

354
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:03,515
How long has it been
since he last came in?

355
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:07,227
Well, I don't check on everyone here
every day.

356
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:10,021
But he was supposed to pay his rent
a week ago.

357
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:12,565
I've stopped by every day since then,

358
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:15,860
but he hasn't come in
or picked up his phone.

359
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:18,822
But…

360
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:21,991
By the way, about his rent…

361
00:28:23,326 --> 00:28:27,163
Otherwise, you'll have to
move his stuff out right away.

362
00:28:29,582 --> 00:28:31,668
I'll take a look,
then give you his rent later.

363
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:36,423
Take your time, then.

364
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:52,564
THEORY OF DESIRE, JACQUES LACAN

365
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:22,135
A drunk?

366
00:29:22,218 --> 00:29:23,595
Just some crazy guy.

367
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:25,263
Things are awfully hectic today.

368
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:32,979
Kids, come and have some ice cream.

369
00:29:33,688 --> 00:29:35,815
Yes! Ice cream!

370
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:43,948
What's wrong?
I thought you wanted ice cream.

371
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:52,248
What happened to your face?

372
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:55,043
Did you fight with your friends?

373
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:02,425
If you keep silent like that,
I'm going to leave.

374
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:09,849
I don't want to stay here.

375
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:13,770
You said you'd bring Mom soon.

376
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:17,148
You said we'd all live together

377
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:19,651
if I just wait a month.

378
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:24,572
Cheol.

379
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:28,618
-It's…
-All the kids say you lied.

380
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,870
They said I'd never leave this place.

381
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:34,290
They said you abandoned me here.

382
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:39,712
No.

383
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:43,216
Mom and Dad are going to come.

384
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,303
I'll make sure they do.

385
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:54,477
We'll all get to live
under the same roof next year.

386
00:30:58,356 --> 00:30:59,357
You know me, right?

387
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,694
You know I always keep my promises.

388
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:15,832
Yes, that guy. Red Light, Green Light.

389
00:31:15,915 --> 00:31:19,127
Why do you need that lunatic's name,
Detective Hwang?

390
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:22,213
Well, I caught a glimpse of him yesterday,

391
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:24,424
and I think he might be
an old acquaintance.

392
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:25,425
Really?

393
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:27,093
What was his name?

394
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:30,263
Seong something
who lives in Ssangmun-dong.

395
00:31:30,346 --> 00:31:31,306
Seong Gi-hun.

396
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:32,765
Seong Gi-hun of Ssangmun-dong.

397
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:34,517
You're right. Seong Gi-hun.

398
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:35,768
Do you know him?

399
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:38,187
Yes, I think so.

400
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:42,108
Could you get me his address?

401
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,573
Hey, Ali! Long time no see!

402
00:31:56,956 --> 00:31:58,124
Hey, Ali.

403
00:31:58,207 --> 00:32:00,668
-Why are you dodging my calls?
-You called?

404
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:01,836
I had no idea.

405
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,713
Why? Is something wrong?

406
00:32:03,796 --> 00:32:06,299
Sir, pay me all the money you owe me.

407
00:32:08,843 --> 00:32:11,638
Hey, how many times do I have to tell you?

408
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:14,098
I don't have any money right now.
Our business isn't doing well, so--

409
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:18,311
I couldn't get my finger treated.
You didn't give me the hospital fee.

410
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,772
I'm going back home now.

411
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:22,148
Please, give me my money.

412
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:25,193
Damn it.
Go ask the other guys if they got paid.

413
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:27,320
I can't pay you until I collect my bills!

414
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:31,115
Hey, I have all sorts of aches too.

415
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:33,576
But I can't go see a doctor
because I have no money.

416
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,787
You said you'd pay me.

417
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:39,666
Please pay me. It's been over six months.

418
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:41,918
Damn it, what's with you?

419
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:46,130
Hey, we'll talk later.
I'm a little busy right now.

420
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:53,346
Sir, give me my money.

421
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:55,765
Sir, please give me my money.

422
00:32:55,848 --> 00:32:58,184
How dare you touch me, you son of a bitch!

423
00:32:58,267 --> 00:32:59,769
Don't swear at me!

424
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:02,689
You fucking son of a bitch!

425
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:03,940
You got money here!

426
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:05,733
-You son of a bitch!
-My money!

427
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:08,653
Let me go, you fucker.

428
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:11,114
Give me my money!

429
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:22,333
Hey, you can't just leave!

430
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:26,129
SOUTHERN MEN, NORTHERN WOMEN

431
00:33:27,755 --> 00:33:31,342
I understand very well
what your situation is like.

432
00:33:32,468 --> 00:33:33,553
But you know,

433
00:33:34,303 --> 00:33:37,557
it's impossible to find brokers
once they've fled with the money.

434
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,934
You aren't the only victim.

435
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:44,313
Some of the victims went all the way
to Dandong to catch them,

436
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:46,315
but they were caught by the Chinese police

437
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:49,235
and almost dragged back to the North.

438
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:51,988
Then is there no other way?

439
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:56,576
You'll need to hire another broker.

440
00:33:57,618 --> 00:34:02,540
But as you probably know,
you'll have to start all over again…

441
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:05,043
How much?

442
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:09,881
First, they'll have to
locate your parents again.

443
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:13,926
And border security's gotten
pretty strict,

444
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:16,471
so it costs a lot more
to help them cross the river.

445
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:17,722
So how much?

446
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:22,643
At the least…

447
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:26,147
you'll need 40 million won.

448
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:29,275
40 million.

449
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:32,070
That's just the price
for taking them to China.

450
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:34,113
If you want to bring them to the South--

451
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:35,531
It's hot!

452
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:37,200
That's freaking hot! Damn it!

453
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:42,789
I trusted what you said last time
and sent the money.

454
00:34:44,707 --> 00:34:46,959
The money I risked my life to get.

455
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:49,212
Hey,

456
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:51,714
I really had no idea, okay?

457
00:34:52,381 --> 00:34:55,676
I didn't know
they'd run off with your money.

458
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:57,678
I swear.

459
00:35:00,973 --> 00:35:02,058
I will…

460
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:04,519
bring the money.

461
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:08,106
But deceive me again,

462
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:11,317
and I'll cut your throat open first.

463
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:13,903
Got it?

464
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:15,822
Okay.

465
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:25,123
Hot.

466
00:35:35,758 --> 00:35:37,093
SANG-WOO'S FISH STORE

467
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:40,138
Have you been eating all right?

468
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:43,599
Yes, I've been eating well,
so don't worry.

469
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:48,020
I doubt American food is to your taste.
What have you been eating?

470
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:51,315
It's okay, Mom.
There are lots of Korean restaurants here.

471
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:54,193
Really? That's a relief.

472
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:56,320
When are you coming back?

473
00:35:57,905 --> 00:36:00,366
It's taking longer than expected,
so I'm not sure.

474
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:03,494
-It might take a while.
-I see.

475
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:05,580
It must be really tough for you.

476
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:06,956
Mom.

477
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:08,583
Yes? What is it?

478
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:13,796
Excuse me.

479
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,674
I'll take three squids for blanching.

480
00:36:16,757 --> 00:36:18,259
Okay, one second.

481
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:19,760
Sang-woo, I have a customer.

482
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:22,889
Don't get me anything on your way back.

483
00:36:22,972 --> 00:36:25,433
I don't need anything, okay?

484
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:26,350
Okay.

485
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:31,022
All right.
Don't skip meals and dress warmly.

486
00:36:31,105 --> 00:36:35,067
Talk to you again. I love you, son.

487
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:37,111
Did you say squid?

488
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:56,339
Goodness, he always gets me
a little something

489
00:36:56,422 --> 00:36:59,634
whenever he goes abroad
on a business trip.

490
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:02,511
You must have a wonderful son.

491
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:05,306
He graduated from Seoul University.

492
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:07,516
Business Administration.

493
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,353
Goodness, Business Administration at SNU?

494
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:14,523
Not only is he smart,
but he's also handsome.

495
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:15,608
Is he married?

496
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:17,318
Not yet.

497
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:18,611
How old is he?

498
00:37:18,694 --> 00:37:20,154
Shall I set him up with someone?

499
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:23,115
But my son has high standards.

500
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:26,327
Excuse me.

501
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:30,456
Are you Mr. Cho Sang-woo's mother?

502
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:33,334
Yes, Cho Sang-woo is my son.

503
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:35,253
Where is he right now?

504
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:37,421
He's in the US on a business trip.

505
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:40,132
-Why are you looking for him?
-We're the police.

506
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:44,387
An arrest warrant has been issued
for Mr. Cho Sang-woo

507
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:47,515
citing acts of embezzlement, forgery
of private documents,

508
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:49,225
and other financial crimes.

509
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:50,935
What?

510
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:54,397
Arrest who?

511
00:37:57,108 --> 00:38:00,987
Goodness, detectives.
There must be a misunderstanding.

512
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:04,490
My son would never do
anything wrong like that.

513
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:10,121
If you reach your son,
tell him to turn himself into the police.

514
00:38:10,204 --> 00:38:12,290
If he keeps fleeing like this,

515
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:14,667
it'll work to his disadvantage later
during a trial.

516
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:33,204
Who is it?

517
00:39:57,436 --> 00:40:01,190
TIME: MIDNIGHT, JUNE 23
PLACE: SAME AS PREVIOUS

518
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:16,288
Where did you get this money?

519
00:40:17,456 --> 00:40:19,500
Ali, where did you get this money?

520
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:23,254
Listen carefully.

521
00:40:23,337 --> 00:40:26,757
Buy tickets for the earliest flight
for you and our kid, and go home first.

522
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:28,050
What about you?

523
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:29,927
You two should go first.

524
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:32,430
I'll be there
as soon as my job here is done.

525
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:36,934
Something is going on with you, right?

526
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:38,811
Don't ask anything for now.

527
00:40:38,894 --> 00:40:42,440
You need to pack up and leave right away.

528
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:45,734
Please understand what I have to do.

529
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:49,822
I love you. You and our child.

530
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:55,035
I got no money.

531
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,287
HEALING PUB

532
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:58,497
Just lend me three million.

533
00:40:58,581 --> 00:41:00,791
I'll pay you back in two months.

534
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:03,002
You shouldn't talk money between friends.

535
00:41:03,085 --> 00:41:05,004
And you know my situation.

536
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:07,298
Of course, I do.

537
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:10,384
I wouldn't be asking you
if it weren't so bad.

538
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:13,679
If I have to,
I'll work here as a deliveryman.

539
00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:16,140
What do you mean, a deliveryman?

540
00:41:16,223 --> 00:41:18,601
Look at my pub.
I can barely afford the rent.

541
00:41:21,353 --> 00:41:23,189
Then I'll pay you back in a month.

542
00:41:24,523 --> 00:41:27,526
I can if I work two jobs
as a chauffeur and a deliveryman.

543
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:29,653
Come on.

544
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:33,574
The doctor says
she needs surgery right away, but--

545
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:34,742
Honey.

546
00:41:35,409 --> 00:41:36,911
Shouldn't you get back inside?

547
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:38,454
I will soon.

548
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:41,540
Get inside right now!
And put your cigarette out!

549
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:53,135
Hello.

550
00:41:54,261 --> 00:41:55,971
-Gi-hun.
-Yes?

551
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:59,099
You shouldn't smoke
in front of someone else's store.

552
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:02,520
Right.

553
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:35,761
You…

554
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:44,812
Sir.

555
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:46,814
It's you, right?

556
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:49,733
Player 456.

557
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:50,776
Yes, sir.

558
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:53,070
That's me.

559
00:42:53,153 --> 00:42:56,615
What are you doing in this neighborhood?

560
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:58,450
I live around here.

561
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:00,411
I see.

562
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:04,957
Do you live in this neighborhood too?

563
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,208
No.

564
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:10,462
I have a friend who lives nearby.

565
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:15,301
I have no place to go at the moment,

566
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:18,762
so I'm staying there for a while.

567
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:21,682
Gosh.

568
00:43:22,308 --> 00:43:23,642
Would you like to sit?

569
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:24,643
Sure.

570
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:29,398
I can't believe I ran into you here.

571
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:31,358
What are the chances?

572
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:32,943
I guess…

573
00:43:34,153 --> 00:43:36,071
we were meant to meet.

574
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:39,074
Gosh.

575
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:41,076
Well, would you like some?

576
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,202
Sure.

577
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:44,622
Right.

578
00:43:45,497 --> 00:43:47,750
Is your head okay?
Are you allowed to drink?

579
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:49,043
It's all right.

580
00:43:57,384 --> 00:43:58,552
Gosh.

581
00:43:59,595 --> 00:44:01,430
I'm sorry I don't have any food.

582
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:04,224
It's okay.

583
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:11,148
RAMYEON

584
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:20,824
Wait.

585
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:25,079
Sir, are you sure this is okay?
Aren't you drinking a bit too much?

586
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:26,205
I'm fine.

587
00:44:33,587 --> 00:44:34,505
I…

588
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:38,676
decided to go back there.

589
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:40,552
Go back where?

590
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:49,311
There?

591
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:53,357
You know,

592
00:44:54,566 --> 00:44:56,402
I don't have long left to live anyway.

593
00:44:56,485 --> 00:45:01,990
I don't want to just sit around
waiting for my death.

594
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:05,202
You never know.

595
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:09,790
I might end up winning in there.

596
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:13,085
When we played Red Light, Green Light,

597
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:16,964
I came in before you did.

598
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:18,674
But still, that place is…

599
00:45:20,342 --> 00:45:22,136
Now that I'm back out,

600
00:45:23,178 --> 00:45:27,641
I realize everything they said is true.

601
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:32,479
It's a worse hell out here.

602
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:48,579
Boss!

603
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:51,707
Why are you so late?

604
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:55,919
I was about to leave,
but the drunks at my bar got into a fight.

605
00:45:56,795 --> 00:45:58,130
You know what it's like.

606
00:45:58,213 --> 00:46:01,717
All kinds of losers swarm in
on Friday nights to party.

607
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:02,718
Where's the money?

608
00:46:06,346 --> 00:46:08,182
This is all I could get on short notice.

609
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:10,309
I can collect more for you
after the weekend.

610
00:46:11,226 --> 00:46:14,646
Anyway, I heard our big boss

611
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:17,316
sent all the boys out to Incheon and Ilsan
to look for you.

612
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:20,110
Where have you been hiding?

613
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:21,862
I can't discuss that here.

614
00:46:22,362 --> 00:46:23,322
Did you drive here?

615
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:25,616
Yes, this way.

616
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:36,168
So this is the invitation to
that "Red Light, Green Light" thing?

617
00:46:36,251 --> 00:46:37,544
That's right.

618
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:39,838
They sent it to me yesterday.

619
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:42,591
It looks like they're about to go again.

620
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:47,930
So gather as many boys as you can
by Tuesday.

621
00:46:48,847 --> 00:46:50,265
And get a few guns too.

622
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:53,602
-Guns?
-They carry guns.

623
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:56,313
But only one guy comes for the pick-up.

624
00:46:57,731 --> 00:46:59,525
We'll beat up that masked guy

625
00:46:59,608 --> 00:47:01,777
and break into their safe.

626
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:05,489
I mean, even if
everything you said is true--

627
00:47:05,572 --> 00:47:08,867
You little shit.
What do you mean, even if? It is true.

628
00:47:10,827 --> 00:47:11,662
Sorry, boss.

629
00:47:13,121 --> 00:47:17,501
Those bastards keep tens of billions
of won in a huge piggy bank.

630
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:19,753
If we manage to get them good,

631
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:25,175
we won't have to deal with drunks
at bars to make a living anymore.

632
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:27,261
But, boss…

633
00:47:28,387 --> 00:47:33,058
all the boys think you went AWOL
because of money issues with the big boss.

634
00:47:33,141 --> 00:47:35,894
The rumor's all over Incheon.

635
00:47:37,771 --> 00:47:40,357
I can't really convince anyone right now.

636
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:44,403
Look, you son of a bitch. I'm gonna
rob them good and pay that all back.

637
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:47,155
Boss.

638
00:47:48,448 --> 00:47:51,243
So how much did you lose
at the casino in the Philippines?

639
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:54,788
How did you know that?

640
00:47:54,871 --> 00:47:57,708
Boss, you should've known when to stop.

641
00:47:57,791 --> 00:47:59,334
Have you gone nuts, you bastard?

642
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:06,258
Hey, Deok-su.

643
00:48:06,341 --> 00:48:07,259
"Deok-su"?

644
00:48:07,342 --> 00:48:08,260
Idiot.

645
00:48:10,262 --> 00:48:14,391
Those casino operators
from the Philippines came all the way here

646
00:48:14,474 --> 00:48:19,521
to take your liver, kidney,
and eyes for the money you owe.

647
00:48:20,939 --> 00:48:23,191
You're fucked, you dumbass.

648
00:48:53,847 --> 00:48:55,349
Come at me, you fucking bastards.

649
00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:07,319
Money?

650
00:49:07,402 --> 00:49:08,403
Yes.

651
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:11,323
How much?

652
00:49:13,992 --> 00:49:15,160
About…

653
00:49:16,328 --> 00:49:17,788
two million won.

654
00:49:18,705 --> 00:49:19,790
Two million won?

655
00:49:23,543 --> 00:49:24,503
Yes.

656
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:31,802
Don't you think
you've overstepped the mark?

657
00:49:31,885 --> 00:49:36,306
You've never even paid me any alimony
or child support.

658
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:38,600
How could you come
and beg me for money again?

659
00:49:42,521 --> 00:49:43,397
I'm sorry.

660
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:46,108
It's for my mom's hospital bills.

661
00:49:51,029 --> 00:49:52,114
What's wrong with her?

662
00:49:54,116 --> 00:49:55,534
She has severe diabetes.

663
00:49:57,536 --> 00:49:58,995
She needs surgery.

664
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:09,506
I don't have any money.

665
00:50:10,298 --> 00:50:11,675
We can barely make ends meet.

666
00:50:16,638 --> 00:50:17,639
Please.

667
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:21,560
My mom was really good to you.

668
00:50:21,643 --> 00:50:23,645
Imagine how desperate I am
to be asking you.

669
00:50:24,813 --> 00:50:26,481
I'll make sure to pay you back.

670
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:28,900
I don't have money for you.

671
00:50:29,484 --> 00:50:31,486
My kids' dad gives me the living expenses.

672
00:50:32,904 --> 00:50:35,115
Then could you ask him--

673
00:50:35,198 --> 00:50:36,199
Are you nuts?

674
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,077
Hey.

675
00:50:40,328 --> 00:50:43,123
What should I tell him it's for?

676
00:50:47,502 --> 00:50:49,129
Go. Leave now.

677
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:52,674
-Hey.
-The kids' dad will be home soon.

678
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:55,802
Why do you keep calling him the kids' dad?

679
00:50:56,762 --> 00:50:58,096
I'm Ga-yeong's dad!

680
00:50:58,180 --> 00:50:59,264
What? Dad?

681
00:51:00,098 --> 00:51:03,059
What did you ever do for her?
You think you deserve to be her dad?

682
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:05,395
You weren't even there when she was born!

683
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:08,356
That was…

684
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:12,319
You know the story already! I couldn't go!

685
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:13,570
My coworker collapsed--

686
00:51:13,653 --> 00:51:15,322
I collapsed too!

687
00:51:16,281 --> 00:51:18,158
I practically crawled to the hospital!

688
00:51:18,241 --> 00:51:20,619
Had I been a little late,
I would've lost her!

689
00:51:20,702 --> 00:51:23,789
My coworker died that day,
right before my eyes!

690
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:26,833
He couldn't even go to the hospital!

691
00:51:31,546 --> 00:51:33,548
Honey, we're home.

692
00:51:36,551 --> 00:51:37,761
You came back early.

693
00:51:39,471 --> 00:51:40,388
Dad.

694
00:51:45,852 --> 00:51:47,062
Mom!

695
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:53,193
He was in the neighborhood
and stopped by to see Ga-yeong.

696
00:51:55,237 --> 00:51:57,572
Now that I saw her, I'll get going.

697
00:52:01,034 --> 00:52:03,578
-Are you leaving?
-Yes, I have an important meeting.

698
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:05,580
Ga-yeong, goodbye now.

699
00:52:06,248 --> 00:52:07,624
-I'll come and see you again.
-Okay.

700
00:52:10,043 --> 00:52:11,294
Like this…

701
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:20,887
Why did he come this time?

702
00:52:21,888 --> 00:52:24,224
-Why did you let him in the house?
-Sorry.

703
00:52:25,267 --> 00:52:29,187
I came back from getting groceries,
and he was waiting at the front door.

704
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:39,447
Wait.

705
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:49,749
What is this?

706
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:51,167
I heard you needed money.

707
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:04,556
Thank you.

708
00:53:05,932 --> 00:53:08,393
I'll pay you back.

709
00:53:08,476 --> 00:53:09,728
You don't have to.

710
00:53:10,812 --> 00:53:11,688
Instead,

711
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,441
I need you to stop coming
to see my family.

712
00:53:16,902 --> 00:53:18,653
Ga-yeong is having a tough time.

713
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:22,449
We're moving to the US soon,
but if you keep showing up like this--

714
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:25,368
You bastard!

715
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:28,204
Do you think money solves everything?

716
00:53:32,208 --> 00:53:33,251
Dad.

717
00:54:07,869 --> 00:54:08,745
Mr. Seong Gi-hun?

718
00:54:11,122 --> 00:54:11,957
Yes?

719
00:54:14,709 --> 00:54:16,086
Hwang Jun-ho, Dobong Police.

720
00:54:17,837 --> 00:54:20,173
You recently filed a report
at the station.

721
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:25,220
That they abducted people
to make them play games.

722
00:54:25,303 --> 00:54:26,596
And that…

723
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:28,974
people were killed there.

724
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:31,935
That? I just made it up.

725
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:34,771
I was drunk and bored,
so I made up that story.

726
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:37,649
That business card you had,

727
00:54:38,858 --> 00:54:40,276
my brother had the same one.

728
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:44,322
And he's currently missing.

729
00:54:46,992 --> 00:54:50,954
I just picked it up from the street
and kept it in my pocket.

730
00:54:51,037 --> 00:54:51,871
Mr. Seong.

731
00:54:53,498 --> 00:54:54,582
Please help me.

732
00:54:56,668 --> 00:54:58,003
I need to find my brother.

733
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:03,925
I'm sorry.

734
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:09,097
I'm not in a position
to help anyone at the moment.

735
00:55:53,099 --> 00:55:55,977
