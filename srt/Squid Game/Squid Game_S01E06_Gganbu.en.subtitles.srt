1
00:00:28,778 --> 00:00:29,988
What are you looking at?

2
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:49,299
What should we do about the game?

3
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:51,676
Proceed.

4
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:58,850
Sir.

5
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:21,331
Thank you.

6
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:24,167
Looks good on you.

7
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:32,383
The fourth game will begin momentarily.

8
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:36,763
All players, follow staff's instructions
and proceed to the game hall.

9
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:40,433
Let me repeat.

10
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:43,061
The fourth game will begin.

11
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:48,066
All players, follow instructions
from staff and proceed to the game hall.

12
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:15,885
You are witnessing the fates

13
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:22,016
of those who broke the rules of this world
for their own benefit

14
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:25,895
and furthermore
tainted the pure ideology of this world.

15
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:29,774
Here you are all equal, with
equal opportunity and no discrimination.

16
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:33,194
We promise to prevent
such misfortunes from happening again.

17
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:38,449
We truly apologize for this tragedy.

18
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:10,356
EPISODE 6
GGANBU

19
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:13,109
LIST OF WINNERS

20
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:17,488
NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT

21
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:38,111
Your face looks awful.

22
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:41,698
Why? Is your connection gone?

23
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:47,078
That fucking…

24
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:52,250
Welcome to your fourth game.

25
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:56,045
This game will be played in teams of two.

26
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:59,507
Find someone
you wish to play the game with.

27
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:04,470
With mutual consent, shake hands
and you will become partners.

28
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,556
Let me repeat.

29
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:11,019
This game will be played in teams of two.

30
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:14,397
Find someone
you wish to play the game with.

31
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:19,444
With mutual consent, shake hands
and you will become partners.

32
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:23,948
Please form teams of two
within ten minutes.

33
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:01,152
Hey, babe.

34
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:03,654
Team up with me.

35
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:06,532
I'm better than you'd expect.

36
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,409
And I'm stronger than most men.

37
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:13,790
I even have five fraud convictions
under my belt.

38
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:17,126
I never bothered to study,
but I'm insanely savvy.

39
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:23,257
If you play with me,

40
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:25,510
I'll do anything you tell me.

41
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:30,848
You'll be shocked to find out
what I can do for you.

42
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:33,226
Please?

43
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:41,818
I know you all want to team up with me.
You're just hesitating.

44
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:43,611
Why? Can't decide?

45
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:45,488
Should I decide for you all?

46
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:46,823
Stop embarrassing yourself.

47
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:49,283
That won't get anyone to play with you.

48
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,411
Just be honest.

49
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:56,624
You don't want to team up
with a woman or an old man.

50
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:58,668
Of course not. Our lives are at stake.

51
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,254
We almost died playing Tug-of-War.

52
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:02,296
You're right.

53
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:06,968
There's a reason why
God created Eve from Adam's rib.

54
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:10,429
God has given men and women…

55
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:13,349
different roles and uses.

56
00:07:13,432 --> 00:07:15,059
You idiots.

57
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:17,353
This isn't the Garden of Eden.

58
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,606
Hey, where are you going?

59
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:27,989
Why? You want to team up with me?

60
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:42,003
Dumbasses.

61
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:47,758
You're making a big mistake letting me go.

62
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:55,475
-Sang-woo, play with--
-Ali, play with me.

63
00:07:56,893 --> 00:08:00,605
The games here
either require strength or brains.

64
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,024
If we team up,

65
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:05,818
we can win against most teams.

66
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,869
No, don't mind me.

67
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:16,454
It's okay. Really. It's okay.

68
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:18,289
You two will make a great team.

69
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:20,500
I'll find someone else.

70
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:32,303
Let's make this work.

71
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:52,865
Well…

72
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:55,076
Sir.

73
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:57,620
I'm sorry, but…

74
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:00,831
You need to put this on.

75
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:06,170
People will look down on you

76
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:11,342
if you aren't wearing your jacket.

77
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:34,782
Let's do this.

78
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:36,158
At your service, boss.

79
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:43,291
Hey.

80
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:47,253
Team up with me.

81
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:51,841
Why should I?

82
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:55,303
You'd rather
hang onto those boomers over there?

83
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:56,679
How embarrassing.

84
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:59,640
I don't care if it's embarrassing.
I have to win no matter what.

85
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:00,891
Then team up with me.

86
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:02,685
I'll make sure you win.

87
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:03,811
How will you do that?

88
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:05,313
Whatever it takes.

89
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:09,483
Why do you want to team up with me?

90
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:11,485
Why did you ask me to join you?

91
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:16,574
You were the only one
I thought would come along.

92
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:19,493
I feel the same way now.

93
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:32,632
There's no one left better than me.

94
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,759
I was a math teacher outside.

95
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:37,011
And I was in the local soccer team
so I'm fit.

96
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:42,224
I turned down a bunch of offers
to do it with you.

97
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,143
I feel like we'll make a great team.

98
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:47,897
The thing is…

99
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:50,775
we don't know what we're going to play.

100
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:53,277
Stop shopping around
and just team up with me.

101
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:58,282
At this rate, you'll fail to team up
with anyone and get left behind.

102
00:10:58,366 --> 00:10:59,241
You know,

103
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:02,870
the cheater was executed,
so there are only 39 left.

104
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:06,165
Once everyone teams up in pairs,
one will be left behind.

105
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,918
Then what will happen?

106
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:10,127
What do you think?

107
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:12,088
They'll be eliminated, obviously.

108
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:14,674
I'm guessing it'll be that old man.

109
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:25,226
Stop stalling.

110
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:27,436
Join me.

111
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:44,537
Sir.

112
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,289
Will you team up with me?

113
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,128
Time for team selection is over.

114
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:55,548
-All players, proceed to the game hall.
-You're all making a big mistake.

115
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:58,342
You think you can win without me?

116
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:01,512
I'm Han Mi-nyeo!

117
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:06,517
I totally owned everyone
from Dongducheon to Gangnam!

118
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,685
Damn it.

119
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:13,065
What if you have to play
Gonggi or Elastics?

120
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:14,316
I'm an expert in those.

121
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:18,529
So, babe, please play with me.
Boys aren't very good at those.

122
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:19,864
Babe!

123
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:23,409
Hey, you can be my partner.

124
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:25,953
Tell everyone with a dick to fuck off.

125
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:27,621
-What's wrong with you?
-We girls should stick together!

126
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:29,415
-My gosh!
-I'm good with women too!

127
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:31,333
I'll be really good!

128
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:32,460
Stop it!

129
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:37,339
-Hey, don't trust this asshole.
-Okay, sure.

130
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:40,634
He's a scumbag.
He'll abandon you in no time.

131
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:43,137
He was in league
with that dead doctor out there.

132
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,055
-All right.
-Did you know that?

133
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:49,018
He hid it from all of you
to save his own ass.

134
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:50,686
Tell me if I'm wrong, you son of a bitch!

135
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:52,188
He was in it with them!

136
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:53,606
-Hey.
-He deserves to die too!

137
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:55,024
Get the fuck off!

138
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:19,465
Where is everyone?

139
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:22,134
Why is everyone gone?

140
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:24,678
I don't have a partner yet.

141
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:26,347
Where's my partner?

142
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,432
Who took my partner away?

143
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:31,310
Where's my partner, you jerks?

144
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:33,479
Where's my partner?

145
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:37,358
Bring my partner here! You fuckers!

146
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:42,071
What a dreadful bitch.

147
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:45,491
I won't have to see
her worthless face anymore.

148
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:47,618
By the way,

149
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,120
what was she saying earlier?

150
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,289
About you with that doctor…

151
00:13:52,831 --> 00:13:54,250
Forget about it.

152
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:58,420
That bitch was desperate
and said whatever came to mind.

153
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:04,218
All players, follow the instructions
from staff and go to your positions.

154
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:21,819
Ali, don't be nervous.

155
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:23,862
The two of us together will win for sure.

156
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:28,534
Now that I'm with you, I think we can win.

157
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,161
Yes, let's win and get out of here.

158
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:34,915
We'll take the money
and go back to our families.

159
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:36,876
Okay, Sang-woo.

160
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:42,631
I used to live…

161
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:46,510
in a neighborhood just like this one.

162
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:48,095
Me too.

163
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:51,348
I lived in an alley
just like this as a kid.

164
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:59,690
Please take one pouch each.

165
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:09,074
There are ten marbles in each pouch.

166
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:10,868
Please check how many there are.

167
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:17,917
Sir, I think we're playing Marbles.

168
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:20,753
You've played this before, right?

169
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:23,380
Of course, I have.

170
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:29,011
I used to play Marbles very often
when I was little.

171
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:32,222
I was pretty good.

172
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:34,892
I'm not so bad myself.

173
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:36,685
What a relief.

174
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:39,104
-I was worried it might require strength.
-Good.

175
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:42,107
In that case, we need to make a pact.

176
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:45,194
And become gganbu.

177
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,154
Gganbu?

178
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:50,991
You said you played Marbles a lot.
How could you not know about gganbu?

179
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:54,328
The neighborhood friend you share marbles,
ddakji, and everything with.

180
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:58,082
Mine, yours, doesn't matter.

181
00:15:58,165 --> 00:16:00,459
Yes, that gganbu. I remember now.

182
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:02,127
I had one in my town too.

183
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:06,507
-He was my best friend.
-Yes, that gganbu.

184
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:13,389
Was this how you make a pact?

185
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:16,308
You're right. This is it.

186
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:20,813
-Sir. No, my gganbu.
-Yes?

187
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:23,190
Let's sweep all the marbles
in this neighborhood.

188
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:34,827
In this game, use your ten marbles
to compete with the partner next to you.

189
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:39,707
The player who takes all ten marbles
from their partner wins.

190
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,584
Let me repeat.

191
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:48,007
Use your ten marbles
to compete with the partner next to you.

192
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:52,594
The player who takes all ten marbles
from their partner wins.

193
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:53,554
Honey.

194
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:57,433
Damn it.

195
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:06,442
Sang-woo.

196
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,323
How pretty.

197
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:15,409
Sir.

198
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:21,290
You have 30 minutes.

199
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:23,208
Let the games begin.

200
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:25,294
Sir.

201
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:51,820
Let's do this.

202
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:55,074
That means one of us will die.

203
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:58,494
Then you want to just stand around
and die together?

204
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,790
Or you'll die on my behalf?

205
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,045
You've never played this, right?

206
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:16,512
This is the biggest tragedy
since the Korean War.

207
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:18,597
Right?

208
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:21,892
What should we play?

209
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:23,519
You're so cold.

210
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:25,479
As cold as ice.

211
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:30,692
Are you really a spy from the North?

212
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,528
Cut the crap.

213
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:35,739
Tell me what game to play.

214
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:40,744
I have no idea either.

215
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:44,706
This is what those boomers
used to play as kids.

216
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,044
They said we're free
to create our own rules.

217
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,172
I'll give it some thought.

218
00:18:55,300 --> 00:19:00,347
It was definitely somewhere around here.

219
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:06,061
Sir, we have to play this game right now.

220
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,063
This is weird.

221
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:12,776
It's definitely this alley.

222
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,904
Where did my house go?

223
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,322
Sir.

224
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:27,875
You just have to guess if the number
of marbles in my fist is odd or even.

225
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:29,710
Odd or even?

226
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,212
What's that?

227
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:37,593
Odd numbers like one, three, and five.

228
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:41,930
Even numbers are two, four, and six.

229
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:44,308
Do you get it?

230
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:51,481
Give it some thought
and bet your marbles on either one.

231
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:54,776
Odd.

232
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:05,787
How many did you bet?

233
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,255
Damn it.

234
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:17,174
I should've bet one more.

235
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:22,888
Stop giggling, asshole.

236
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:27,100
Damn it, why are you swearing at me?

237
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:31,063
You really thought I was your lackey
because I called you boss?

238
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:32,689
You want me to kill you, son of a bitch?

239
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:35,609
Kill me? And how are you going to do that?

240
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:40,405
You can't resort to violence,
you fucking dumbass.

241
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:48,705
Sir, we really have to play now.

242
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:50,582
What?

243
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,502
Marbles!

244
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:55,671
Marbles?

245
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:58,799
See? Everyone else is doing it.

246
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:03,136
We have to do this too.

247
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:04,930
No.

248
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:08,850
I'm not some child!

249
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:12,521
Wait. Sir!

250
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:16,942
Let's…

251
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,903
end the game with a single round.

252
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:26,159
Let's bet everything
and just play one round.

253
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:32,708
Is that what you want to be doing
until the clock runs out?

254
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:37,921
Yes! Nice.

255
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:38,880
Damn it.

256
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:41,300
Two, three, four.

257
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:42,342
My turn.

258
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:45,095
Fine. What are we playing?

259
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:46,930
Why are you in such a hurry?

260
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:49,599
Are you dying to kill me?

261
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:56,189
We're playing just one round.

262
00:21:57,899 --> 00:21:59,192
We have some time left.

263
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:01,862
Let's do it last minute.

264
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:04,364
Then what are we going to do until then?

265
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:06,408
Let's talk.

266
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:08,452
Talk about what?

267
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:12,414
Things we couldn't tell other people.

268
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,336
One of us is going to die here anyway.

269
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:21,298
No matter what we tell each other,

270
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:23,884
there's no chance of an awkward encounter.

271
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:25,552
Don't you think?

272
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:29,222
Even.

273
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:41,443
How many did you bet?

274
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:45,655
Two.

275
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:05,092
Your turn.

276
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:09,262
I don't want to do this with you.

277
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:10,764
Sir.

278
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:13,058
I want to play with someone else.

279
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:15,435
Stop talking nonsense
and take the marbles.

280
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:18,146
That old man has dementia.

281
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,148
He's not in his right mind.

282
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:22,317
Isn't he basically withdrawing
from the match?

283
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,152
He can't play the game. No?

284
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:26,905
Damn it.

285
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:32,869
Let's just play once. This is really…

286
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:34,663
It's a lot of fun.

287
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:37,290
I want to go home.

288
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:43,630
I know my house is
somewhere in this alley.

289
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:46,716
Damn it!

290
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,970
Will you please pull yourself together?

291
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:53,390
If we stay like this, we'll both die!

292
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:56,893
You might not care
since you have that tumor in your head,

293
00:23:56,977 --> 00:23:59,229
but I have to make it out alive!

294
00:23:59,312 --> 00:24:02,357
I have to survive
and leave this damn place!

295
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:04,776
Stop yelling at me.

296
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:08,738
I'll play with you.

297
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:19,332
And 12, 13, 14, 15. All right!

298
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,378
Shit, change the game.

299
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:26,381
Why should I? I'm on a roll.

300
00:24:27,757 --> 00:24:30,051
We played it your way until now,

301
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:32,929
so now we're playing what I want.

302
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:35,891
I don't want to.

303
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:40,228
Fuck.

304
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:43,690
Let us change the game. That's only fair.

305
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:47,068
You people said everyone is equal here,
didn't you?

306
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:49,988
Request accepted.

307
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:59,206
What do you want to play?

308
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:02,417
Even.

309
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:10,508
What are you doing? Open your hand.

310
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:42,082
You bastard.

311
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:46,795
You're cheating, aren't you?

312
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:49,714
Sang-woo, what are you talking about?

313
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:51,299
How come you keep winning?

314
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,094
You only have a 50-50 chance of winning.

315
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:57,430
This doesn't make any fucking sense!

316
00:25:57,514 --> 00:25:59,766
No, I didn't do anything.

317
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:03,395
You jerk. You played innocent
all this time, tricking me!

318
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:05,355
You said you've never done this before!

319
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:07,816
What did you do? Tell me!

320
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:17,909
Why did you come here from the North?

321
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,328
I thought it'd be better here.

322
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:25,625
So?

323
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:28,128
Is it better?

324
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:36,970
What about your family?
Did they come with you?

325
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:41,808
Just my younger brother.

326
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:44,019
What about your parents?

327
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:51,985
My dad was shot while crossing the river.
He drifted away.

328
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:53,361
My mom…

329
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:58,742
was caught by the public security officers
in China, then sent back.

330
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:04,039
Where's your brother?

331
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:09,544
At a children's home.

332
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:15,008
Even.

333
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:27,896
Odd. Even. Odd. Even.

334
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:30,023
Did I win?

335
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:33,276
How many did you bet?

336
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:40,825
Damn.

337
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:54,839
We take turns throwing a marble
until one lands in that hole.

338
00:27:55,882 --> 00:27:56,716
If I make it?

339
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,803
Then you get to take
all the marbles on the ground.

340
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:05,433
So you're going for a hail Mary pass.

341
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:07,936
What's wrong? Are you scared?

342
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:10,605
Shit. I'm not scared.

343
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:15,777
I'm not so bad when it comes
to putting things into holes.

344
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:17,821
Are you okay with that?

345
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:26,996
If you leave here with that money,
what will you do with it?

346
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:32,710
I'll get a house for me and my brother,
and bring my mom from the North.

347
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:37,382
Hey, you can do that and much more
with 40 billion won.

348
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:39,426
Anything else?

349
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:41,636
Is there anywhere you want to go?

350
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:45,473
Jeju Island.

351
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:46,808
Jeju Island?

352
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:50,770
I saw it on TV.

353
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:53,231
It looked exotic and nothing like Korea.

354
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:58,194
Hey, you should dream bigger than that.

355
00:28:58,278 --> 00:29:02,115
You should go to Hawaii,
no, the Maldives at least.

356
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:04,159
And have a mojito too.

357
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:07,120
Mojito?

358
00:29:07,203 --> 00:29:08,830
Haven't you seen that movie?

359
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:10,373
The one with Lee Byung-hun.

360
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:13,501
"Go to mojito
and have a glass of Maldives."

361
00:29:14,377 --> 00:29:15,503
Don't you know?

362
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:19,507
Man, you're worse than I thought.

363
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:20,717
Once we get out of here,

364
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:24,095
I need to teach you how people splurge
in the South.

365
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:35,523
Right. We can't both leave.

366
00:29:48,828 --> 00:29:50,163
I'm sorry, Ali.

367
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,166
I mistook you.

368
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:56,127
But I can't die like this.

369
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:58,797
If I die here…

370
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:02,634
my entire family will die too.

371
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:05,637
I'm sorry, Sang-woo.

372
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:08,181
I'm so sorry,

373
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:10,934
but I have a family too.

374
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:12,852
Hey, Ali.

375
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:16,898
If you help me, there's a way
both of us can make it out alive.

376
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:20,109
You got this far all thanks to me.

377
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,655
I gave you the bus fare,

378
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:25,907
my strategy helped you survive Tug-of-War,

379
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:28,117
we kept watch at night together,

380
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:31,704
and just before the game, we promised
to leave here together, didn't we?

381
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:35,208
So, please.

382
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:38,294
Please trust me this once and help me.

383
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:40,046
Please?

384
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,300
What's your plan?

385
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:47,887
Could it be odd?

386
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:53,142
It might be even.

387
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:57,647
-It must be even.
-Hurry up and say it.

388
00:30:58,773 --> 00:30:59,899
Odd.

389
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:15,415
I won again.

390
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:17,458
How many did you bet?

391
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:26,050
Damn it.

392
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:44,569
I have one left.

393
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:46,237
I still have one left.

394
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:22,065
Fuck.

395
00:32:22,815 --> 00:32:24,192
My guess is that

396
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:27,362
some of the teams won't be able
to decide the winner in time.

397
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:29,322
Why not?

398
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:31,449
Do you remember the rule?

399
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:35,161
The person who takes their partner's
marbles in 30 minutes wins.

400
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:38,081
But think about it.

401
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:40,833
Neither player might win all the marbles
in 30 minutes.

402
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:42,669
They win, lose, go back and forth.

403
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:45,254
I'm sure there will be
teams without any winners.

404
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:48,216
What will they do then?
Eliminate all those people?

405
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:50,677
That makes no sense.
They must decide the winner. Right?

406
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:52,804
Yes.

407
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:57,058
Then, I'm sure
they'll make us compete in teams.

408
00:32:58,184 --> 00:33:00,395
Each team will add up their marbles,

409
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:02,480
and play against another team
with 20 marbles.

410
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:06,484
We'll get to play as a team

411
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:09,862
as we'd originally planned.

412
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:13,491
We can leave this place together.

413
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:22,709
Player 414, eliminated.

414
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:25,962
Do you want…

415
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:28,673
to do that to me?

416
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:33,803
Player 2, eliminated.

417
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:36,764
Had you ever seen a dead body
before coming here?

418
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:41,436
A plague broke out in my town
when I was a kid.

419
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:47,066
People died day after day.

420
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:52,155
Soldiers piled up the bodies
and burned them.

421
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:56,617
That's when my grandma, grandpa,
and older brother

422
00:33:57,785 --> 00:33:59,454
all burned up.

423
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:03,583
I got to say,
your stories are way too dark.

424
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:06,377
You?

425
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,463
What about you?

426
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:15,303
Player 130, eliminated.

427
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:17,680
The first one I saw

428
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:19,557
was my mom.

429
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:22,977
One day I came home after school,

430
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:26,481
and found her dead on the floor.

431
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:29,817
Next to her

432
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,780
was my so-called dad
with a knife in his hand.

433
00:34:35,823 --> 00:34:37,575
The next person I saw dead…

434
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:41,704
was my dad.

435
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:48,127
And the one standing
next to him with a knife was me.

436
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:52,715
He was a pastor.

437
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,929
Whenever he beat my mom

438
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:03,184
and did the unthinkable to me,
he always prayed…

439
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:06,521
for our sins to be forgiven.

440
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:10,316
But he didn't pray
the day he killed my mom.

441
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:15,780
Maybe he knew he couldn't be forgiven.

442
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:30,211
Player 40, eliminated.

443
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:39,387
Even.

444
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:42,348
No, wait.

445
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:44,016
One second.

446
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:46,394
Wait, hold on.

447
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:49,355
Odd.

448
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:51,858
Odd.

449
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:08,249
What did you just say?

450
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,715
What?

451
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:18,676
What…

452
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:22,180
did you just say?

453
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:27,810
Even…

454
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:32,356
I said even.

455
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:38,112
That means

456
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:40,823
I lost.

457
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:07,683
Are you sure we can both win?

458
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:11,437
Really?

459
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,607
Hear me out first and turn me down
if you don't like the plan.

460
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:17,235
If you do that,

461
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:20,363
I'll just give you my last marble.

462
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:24,617
So you won't feel guilty about killing me.

463
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:26,953
What's…

464
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,288
your plan?

465
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:32,458
Player 68, eliminated.

466
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:34,543
It depends on who we'll be up against.

467
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:36,921
We have to find out
which teams will remain.

468
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:42,093
We don't have much time, so let's split up
and see how other teams are doing.

469
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:47,181
From teams that are still playing, find
ones that are very young and very old.

470
00:37:48,182 --> 00:37:49,225
Their age?

471
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:51,143
Yes, that's what's important.

472
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:56,941
Find out if they're young like you
or if they're over 50.

473
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:02,113
You take the alley across the street.
I'll go the other way.

474
00:38:02,196 --> 00:38:03,197
Okay, Sang-woo.

475
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,621
Ali.

476
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:13,749
Your pouch.

477
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:17,503
It's dangerous carrying it like that.

478
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:21,340
Everyone will go crazy at the last minute.
Who knows what'll happen?

479
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:25,052
We're doomed if you lose this.
You know that, right?

480
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:29,140
I'll make it safe for you to carry.

481
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:51,746
What will you do
if you leave here with the money?

482
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:54,248
I haven't thought about it.

483
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:58,336
Someone was waiting for me

484
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,921
when I was released from prison.

485
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:04,717
I thought he was a creditor
who came to collect my dad's debt.

486
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,552
But he gave me a business card.

487
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:08,763
That weird card.

488
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:13,225
I just came
because I had nowhere else to go.

489
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:18,939
So I haven't thought about
what I'd do if I get out.

490
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:23,903
Should we go to Jeju together?

491
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:31,077
Sorry.

492
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:32,787
My mistake, again.

493
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:36,040
Player 229, eliminated.

494
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:41,462
Damn it.

495
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:46,842
Shit.

496
00:40:18,707 --> 00:40:20,709
I thought it'd go in. Damn it.

497
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:24,839
You have nothing left now?

498
00:40:27,633 --> 00:40:28,759
I still have…

499
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:32,263
one left.

500
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:39,228
Deok-su.

501
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:42,523
It was fun while it lasted.

502
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:15,931
It went in. That's mine! My blue marble!

503
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:19,310
It was fun while it lasted, asshole.

504
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:33,115
Shit!

505
00:41:39,246 --> 00:41:40,748
You bastards!

506
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:47,463
Player 278, eliminated.

507
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:56,430
Here.

508
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:59,892
What do you think?
Doesn't it seem much safer?

509
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:03,938
Yes.

510
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:07,191
Then we'll meet here again
when the timer hits three minutes.

511
00:42:07,274 --> 00:42:08,526
I'll tell you my plan then.

512
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:14,031
Odd.

513
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,456
One, two, three.

514
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:25,960
One, two, three.

515
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:30,381
We both have three marbles.

516
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:35,594
Yes, but what did you just say?

517
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:38,180
What?

518
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:44,270
What did I say?

519
00:42:46,188 --> 00:42:47,940
You said it's even.

520
00:42:48,857 --> 00:42:50,025
Did I…

521
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:52,027
say that?

522
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:56,490
Yes.

523
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:02,413
That means…

524
00:43:03,622 --> 00:43:05,040
I lost again.

525
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:16,385
Player 43, eliminated.

526
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:21,348
A team of older people.

527
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,935
Player 85, eliminated.

528
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:26,562
Just throw it already.

529
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:29,315
Three youngsters.

530
00:43:29,398 --> 00:43:31,066
I can't believe I missed it!

531
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:33,152
Two old people.

532
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:44,371
Player 276, eliminated.

533
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:08,103
It's your turn.

534
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:09,146
What?

535
00:44:11,523 --> 00:44:12,358
Right.

536
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:14,318
Here.

537
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:27,706
Odd.

538
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:34,129
What's the date today?

539
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:41,845
The 24th of this month
is my son's birthday.

540
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:46,308
I was supposed to buy him a toy robot
for his birthday.

541
00:44:46,892 --> 00:44:51,438
But I completely forgot
and didn't get him anything last year.

542
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:55,526
I have to get him something this time.

543
00:45:03,283 --> 00:45:04,410
Right.

544
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:09,206
What did you say?

545
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:13,419
Odd.

546
00:45:35,941 --> 00:45:37,234
I have 20 marbles.

547
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:41,196
The rule is that,
no matter what the game is,

548
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:45,492
I have to obtain all my partner's marbles
without using any violence.

549
00:45:47,327 --> 00:45:49,413
I didn't use any form of violence.

550
00:45:51,123 --> 00:45:52,624
How many? Two left?

551
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:54,001
Damn it.

552
00:45:56,462 --> 00:46:01,258
You have three minutes until the game
is over. You have three minutes.

553
00:46:17,065 --> 00:46:19,568
Player 158, eliminated.

554
00:46:22,696 --> 00:46:23,780
Let's do it.

555
00:46:36,251 --> 00:46:40,380
Whoever throws a marble
closest to that wall wins.

556
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:42,966
What do you think?

557
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:50,682
It's Sae-byeok.

558
00:46:51,558 --> 00:46:52,392
What is?

559
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,061
My name.

560
00:46:55,395 --> 00:46:56,980
Kang Sae-byeok.

561
00:46:58,398 --> 00:46:59,483
Sae-byeok.

562
00:47:00,776 --> 00:47:01,652
Nice name.

563
00:47:03,695 --> 00:47:04,530
What about you?

564
00:47:04,613 --> 00:47:05,614
Ji-yeong.

565
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:08,033
Family name?

566
00:47:10,869 --> 00:47:12,496
I don't have one.

567
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:19,294
Who should go first?

568
00:47:19,378 --> 00:47:20,462
You can go first.

569
00:47:21,463 --> 00:47:23,257
Your number is before mine too.

570
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:33,475
All of my marbles are gone.

571
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:40,148
What should I do?

572
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:43,610
I'd love to play more.

573
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:52,619
Can you lend me just one marble?

574
00:47:56,915 --> 00:47:58,041
I'm sorry.

575
00:48:00,919 --> 00:48:03,255
Player 70, eliminated.

576
00:48:04,798 --> 00:48:05,966
Look at this.

577
00:48:07,175 --> 00:48:09,261
I have one marble left.

578
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:16,143
There was one left.

579
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:25,152
Two, four, six, eight,

580
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:28,030
two, four, six, eight. Nineteen.

581
00:48:28,113 --> 00:48:29,364
Nineteen.

582
00:48:30,824 --> 00:48:33,619
No. Sir, wait.

583
00:48:34,202 --> 00:48:35,162
Sir!

584
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:16,620
What are you doing?

585
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:21,500
I lost.

586
00:49:21,583 --> 00:49:23,710
What do you think you're doing?

587
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:26,963
That marble just slipped.

588
00:49:28,757 --> 00:49:33,220
Is that what you meant by
you making sure I win?

589
00:49:35,847 --> 00:49:38,266
You thought I'd be grateful?

590
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:39,601
Throw it again.

591
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:42,187
Even if I did,
I wouldn't be able to win anyway.

592
00:49:42,979 --> 00:49:44,481
Just let me lose in style.

593
00:49:44,564 --> 00:49:48,110
Stop acting cool and just throw it again!

594
00:49:51,279 --> 00:49:52,447
I don't have anything.

595
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:54,074
What?

596
00:49:55,450 --> 00:49:57,536
You have a reason to leave this place.

597
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:01,123
But I don't.

598
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:07,337
Since you asked me…

599
00:50:09,297 --> 00:50:12,092
I've been thinking about what I'd do
once I get out.

600
00:50:14,219 --> 00:50:17,389
But no matter how much I think,
I can't think of one.

601
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:23,603
Someone with a good reason
should be the one to leave.

602
00:50:24,813 --> 00:50:25,856
That's the right thing.

603
00:50:31,653 --> 00:50:34,406
Make sure you leave this place alive.

604
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:36,241
And…

605
00:50:38,243 --> 00:50:39,703
meet your mom.

606
00:50:41,413 --> 00:50:42,789
Get your brother back.

607
00:50:44,666 --> 00:50:46,835
And go to Jeju Island too.

608
00:50:51,506 --> 00:50:52,507
Sang-woo.

609
00:50:53,508 --> 00:50:56,344
Sang-woo, where are you?

610
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:59,222
Sang-woo. Sang-woo!

611
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:01,683
I checked everyone.

612
00:51:02,934 --> 00:51:04,144
Sang-woo!

613
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:07,773
Sang-woo!

614
00:51:49,147 --> 00:51:51,358
Player 199, eliminated.

615
00:52:00,867 --> 00:52:02,118
Kang Sae-byeok!

616
00:52:10,043 --> 00:52:11,044
Thanks…

617
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:14,923
for playing with me.

618
00:52:19,427 --> 00:52:21,930
Player 240, eliminated.

619
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:38,029
Sir, let's play just one more time.

620
00:52:38,738 --> 00:52:40,198
Please, one more round.

621
00:52:42,617 --> 00:52:43,910
Damn it.

622
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:45,120
It's this house.

623
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:52,252
I used to live in this house

624
00:52:53,253 --> 00:52:56,214
with my wife and son.

625
00:52:57,507 --> 00:53:03,138
I had a small pond in the front yard too.

626
00:53:03,221 --> 00:53:05,724
Sir, you have one marble left.

627
00:53:05,807 --> 00:53:07,809
You have to play that game with me.

628
00:53:09,102 --> 00:53:12,188
When I'd come home from work,

629
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:17,694
my son would be having so much fun
with his friends.

630
00:53:17,777 --> 00:53:19,362
He didn't even realize I'd come home.

631
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:21,531
Pull yourself together!

632
00:53:21,615 --> 00:53:23,992
Pull yourself together and listen to me!

633
00:53:24,075 --> 00:53:27,871
I'd hide behind that telephone pole

634
00:53:27,954 --> 00:53:31,124
and take a peek at him playing.

635
00:53:31,791 --> 00:53:34,461
They were having so much fun.

636
00:53:34,544 --> 00:53:35,837
Please.

637
00:53:37,255 --> 00:53:39,090
Please pull yourself together.

638
00:53:42,302 --> 00:53:44,930
I beg you, please.

639
00:53:49,601 --> 00:53:55,357
Why don't we play one more round
betting everything we have?

640
00:53:58,735 --> 00:53:59,611
What?

641
00:54:00,195 --> 00:54:02,489
I'll bet everything I have.

642
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:05,700
You bet everything you have too.

643
00:54:08,244 --> 00:54:09,871
What do you mean?

644
00:54:10,664 --> 00:54:16,962
We're going to bet everything you have
and everything I have.

645
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:20,924
That's only fair.

646
00:54:21,508 --> 00:54:24,636
Are you telling me to bet everything
to get that one marble?

647
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:28,473
What kind of nonsense is this?

648
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:31,267
That makes no sense!

649
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:34,104
Then…

650
00:54:35,563 --> 00:54:37,941
does fooling me…

651
00:54:39,275 --> 00:54:43,530
and taking my marbles make sense?

652
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:16,563
Take it.

653
00:55:19,441 --> 00:55:20,400
It's yours.

654
00:55:23,611 --> 00:55:24,946
We're…

655
00:55:26,281 --> 00:55:27,741
gganbu, aren't we?

656
00:55:28,908 --> 00:55:30,493
Don't you remember?

657
00:55:31,077 --> 00:55:35,040
We made a pinky promise
to be each other's gganbu.

658
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:41,546
With gganbus,
mine or yours doesn't matter.

659
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:51,514
Thank you.

660
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:55,393
For everything.

661
00:55:57,604 --> 00:55:58,855
Thanks to you…

662
00:56:00,899 --> 00:56:02,817
I had a good time.

663
00:56:04,235 --> 00:56:05,070
Here.

664
00:56:11,284 --> 00:56:12,243
It's all right.

665
00:56:13,578 --> 00:56:14,579
Everything…

666
00:56:15,747 --> 00:56:17,290
will be all right.

667
00:56:37,936 --> 00:56:41,773
I remember my name now.

668
00:56:42,273 --> 00:56:45,610
My name is Il-nam.

669
00:56:45,693 --> 00:56:47,987
Oh Il-nam.

670
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:07,006
Player 1, eliminated.
