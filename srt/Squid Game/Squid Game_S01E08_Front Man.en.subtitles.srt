EPISODE 8
FRONT MAN

2
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:09,212
Why did you do it?

3
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:13,049
What are you trying to say?

4
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,843
Why did you push him?

5
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:18,638
You chose the last number out of luck.

6
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:21,099
That makes you feel generous, huh?

7
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:25,854
What if that man ended up
holding out like that thug?

8
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:27,981
What would you have done?

9
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:29,399
It was the last tile.

10
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:32,610
He was clearly going to move.

11
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:33,903
How could you be so sure?

12
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:37,907
He knew how to tell which was
the tempered glass,

13
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,910
but just watched people fall and die.

14
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:44,747
In the end, both you and I
crossed that bridge alive thanks to him.

15
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,040
Fucking bullshit.

16
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:49,460
I don't know about you,
but I'm not alive because of him.

17
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:54,799
I'm alive because
I worked my fucking ass off to stay alive.

18
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:56,843
No matter what excuse you have,

19
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,429
you just killed an innocent man.

20
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:00,763
Get a grip!

21
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:07,186
We have to kill everyone else anyway
to leave with that money.

22
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:11,816
Shouldn't you be grateful
that I did the dirty work for you?

23
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:15,945
If it were me,
would you have still pushed?

24
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:18,656
Damn it.

25
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:20,700
Gi-hun!

26
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:25,872
Do you know why your life is so pathetic?

27
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:30,501
Because you ask the dumbest questions
even in this situation,

28
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:34,464
constantly minding other people's business
with that pea brain of yours

29
00:03:35,214 --> 00:03:38,801
not knowing your ass from your elbow.

30
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:42,388
Sure.

31
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,226
It's all my fault I ended up like this.

32
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:51,189
I'm slow and incompetent.

33
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:56,361
I'm a nosy dimwit
who lives off the back of his old mother.

34
00:03:58,863 --> 00:03:59,906
But

35
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:04,619
why is the pride of Ssangmun-dong,
the genius Cho Sang-woo of SNU, here?

36
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:09,290
Floundering around in this shithole
with a dimwit like me.

37
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:12,710
Is that also my fault?

38
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:29,727
We sincerely congratulate and commend you

39
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:33,064
for successfully making it
through the five games.

40
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:38,736
You've now become the finalists,

41
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,823
and we've prepared a special gift for you.

42
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,158
Before we reveal the gift,

43
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:47,745
please change into the outfit
we've prepared.

44
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:31,349
Bring him alive.

45
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:47,907
JUNE 29, MONDAY

46
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:51,410
CHIEF

47
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,249
-Jun-ho!
-Chief.

48
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:58,167
-Where the hell are you?
-Chief, can you hear me?

49
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:01,170
-I haven't seen or heard from you in days!
-I'll explain everything later.

50
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,463
Who the hell do you think you are?

51
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:03,798
I'm on an island somewhere
in the southwestern sea.

52
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:04,715
What?

53
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,676
Trace the location of this phone
and send backup right away.

54
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:08,010
What? Backup?

55
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:11,556
I need backup. I need the coast guard
and a police squad at least.

56
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:12,890
What? I can't hear you!

57
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:14,684
I'll send you the photos and videos.

58
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:16,352
-You can check those.
-Hey.

59
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,146
-I'll call you again.
-Slow down. What--

60
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:54,450
We have prepared this feast

61
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:59,622
as a token of gratitude for the sacrifice
and effort you finalists have made.

62
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:05,253
We're certain you'll give us
a splendid performance in the final game.

63
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:08,089
Please enjoy the feast
without any concerns.

64
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:47,753
RE-SEND

65
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:56,846
He's over there.

66
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:13,923
Police! Drop your weapons and surrender!

67
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:18,719
I already alerted the police
about everything you did.

68
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:20,846
The coast guard will arrive shortly.

69
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,433
I don't know.

70
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,894
When has the Korean police
ever shown such enthusiasm?

71
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:31,482
Besides, you barely
have reception in this area.

72
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:33,901
I don't know what you sent,

73
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:36,320
but I doubt it was sent.

74
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:39,740
Turn yourself in now
and we'll take that into consideration.

75
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:43,536
If you drop the gun
and hand over the phone,

76
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:45,663
I might let you live.

77
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:47,164
Stop right there!

78
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,252
That gun holds five bullets.

79
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:55,131
But, according to police regulations,

80
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:59,218
you have to keep one chamber empty
and fill one with a blank shell.

81
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,387
That's three live rounds.

82
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:04,765
You already used one shot to kill a guy.

83
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,643
And another to break the lock.

84
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:13,899
That means you only have one bullet left.

85
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:15,651
One bullet is enough to kill you.

86
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:50,663
Give up.

87
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,293
I warned you. If you take another step…

88
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,013
It's over.

89
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:10,808
Come with me.

90
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:17,398
Do as I say.

91
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:20,192
That way, you live.

92
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:31,996
Who…

93
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:33,747
are you?

94
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:54,810
In-ho.

95
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:57,855
Let's go.

96
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:02,860
Come with me.

97
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:26,675
In-ho…

98
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:29,803
In-ho, why…

99
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:08,569
Sae-byeok.

100
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:13,490
Don't worry.

101
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,410
I'm not here to kill you.

102
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:20,956
You've been dozing off. I would've
killed you already if I wanted to.

103
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:29,590
I only brought this because of him.

104
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:33,510
For protection.

105
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,914
You don't look too well.

106
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:06,126
No. I'm fine.

107
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:09,254
Then why did you leave so much food?

108
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:13,133
It just didn't taste good.

109
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:19,264
Stop lying.

110
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:22,643
If I'm hurt?

111
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,563
Will you treat me?

112
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:31,944
Don't mind me.

113
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,322
Worry about yourself.

114
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,952
Hey, Sae-byeok.

115
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:43,664
Let's stick together…

116
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:45,916
for the next game.

117
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,043
No matter what it is,

118
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:51,130
we'll help each other as a team.

119
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:59,555
Then we can win against him.

120
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:10,065
We'll take half each and leave this place.

121
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:23,662
What will you do
once you get out of here with that money?

122
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:26,248
I'll pay off my debt first.

123
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:32,796
Then open up a business for my mom
at the marketplace.

124
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:40,220
She always wanted to run a proper store
instead of a street stall.

125
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:42,723
And…

126
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:48,979
I want to be a proper dad…

127
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:54,860
to my daughter for once.

128
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:57,321
How old is she?

129
00:19:58,155 --> 00:19:59,156
Ten.

130
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:03,160
She's the same age as my brother.

131
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:09,583
Where's your brother right now?

132
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:11,585
At a children's home.

133
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:18,300
I promised to go get him
once I make money.

134
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:22,262
And bring my mom too.

135
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:30,395
I promised to do that once I make
enough money to buy a house for us.

136
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:35,192
Half of that prize will be
more than enough for that.

137
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,031
Mister.

138
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:47,663
I just want one promise.

139
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,128
What promise?

140
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:01,134
If either one of us…

141
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:05,430
makes it out of here alive,

142
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:09,434
we'll look after each other's family.

143
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:15,232
Don't say that.

144
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:21,488
We'll beat him and get out together.

145
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:28,787
Still. Promise me.

146
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:37,879
Promise me you'll look after my brother.

147
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:41,800
Shush.

148
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:21,715
Don't do it.

149
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:28,555
You're not that kind of person.

150
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:49,743
Hey.

151
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,995
Hey, what's wrong?

152
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,538
Hey, you're…

153
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:55,665
You're…

154
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:57,834
When did this happen?

155
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:00,170
When did you get hurt?

156
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:01,546
Damn it.

157
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:04,466
Mister.

158
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:05,467
Yes?

159
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:08,678
I want to go home.

160
00:23:11,014 --> 00:23:13,809
Hey, Sae-byeok. Stay with me.

161
00:23:14,684 --> 00:23:17,312
Don't let yourself go. Stay right here.

162
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:19,189
I'll go get a doctor.

163
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:27,280
Excuse me! Help!

164
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:28,907
She's lost a lot of blood!

165
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:30,075
Please help!

166
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:31,910
Someone is dying in here!

167
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:34,037
Is anybody out there?

168
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:37,541
You fucking assholes!

169
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:39,793
Someone is dying here!

170
00:23:40,418 --> 00:23:43,547
You need to keep her alive
if you want her to play the damn game!

171
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:46,383
Please, answer me!

172
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:57,435
Hey, please get a doctor over here.

173
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:00,021
She lost a lot of blood. Hurry! Please.

174
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:01,857
She's…

175
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:35,056
Sae-byeok.

176
00:24:40,478 --> 00:24:41,771
Sae-byeok.

177
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:43,899
Sae-byeok.

178
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:45,734
Hey.

179
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:48,069
No. No, Sae-byeok.

180
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:51,072
No, Sae-byeok.

181
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:04,622
In-ho, why…

182
00:30:55,270 --> 00:31:00,275
