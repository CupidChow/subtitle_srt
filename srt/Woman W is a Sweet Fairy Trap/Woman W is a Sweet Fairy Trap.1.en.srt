00:01:03,152 --> 00:01:05,152
Ah

7
00:01:12,161 --> 00:01:16,161
OK? Shall we call an ambulance?

8
00:01:22,171 --> 00:01:24,171
(Haruna) It's okay

9
00:01:35,184 --> 00:01:47,196
・～

10
00:01:47,196 --> 00:01:50,199
Um... sorry

11
00:01:50,199 --> 00:01:53,202
I'll put my change of clothes and towel here

12
00:01:53,202 --> 00:01:55,202
· thank you

20
00:02:40,183 --> 00:02:44,187
Oh, that's right, you should disinfect your wounds, yes

21
00:02:44,187 --> 00:02:47,187
here you are

22
00:03:02,138 --> 00:03:06,142
Name... what do you mean?

23
00:03:06,142 --> 00:03:09,145
Ah, this is Toda

24
00:03:09,145 --> 00:03:14,150
Huh? Ah, a cat?

25
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:19,155
This cat was abandoned cat so she doesn't have a name yet

26
00:03:19,155 --> 00:03:21,157
Um... I'm

27
00:03:21,157 --> 00:03:24,160
Something like that, when you see a cat like this, you can't leave it alone

28
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:28,160
I had 27 of them at my parents' house.

29
00:03:33,169 --> 00:03:40,169
Let me hold that cat a little yes yes

30
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:46,180
cute

31
00:03:48,184 --> 00:03:50,184
Woohoo

32
00:03:53,189 --> 00:03:57,193
What happened...? Huh?

33
00:03:57,193 --> 00:04:02,131
No, it was dropped from the car

34
00:04:02,131 --> 00:04:08,137
Uuuuuu, the same as this kid

35
00:04:08,137 --> 00:04:11,137
I was also dumped

36
00:04:14,143 --> 00:04:18,143
Maybe your luck with men is bad

37
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:26,155
That's right! Do you have milk or something? Yeah?

38
00:04:26,155 --> 00:04:30,159
I wonder if this child is hungry

39
00:04:30,159 --> 00:04:35,164
Ah, I see, maybe there's a bit

40
00:04:35,164 --> 00:04:39,168
Um, milk...

41
00:04:39,168 --> 00:04:45,174
Ah... I'm going to buy you a little bit after all, but what about you?

42
00:04:45,174 --> 00:04:49,178
Huh? Something like food

43
00:04:49,178 --> 00:04:52,181
Does I seem okay?

44
00:04:52,181 --> 00:04:55,181
Well, I'll go for a little while, yeah

(sneeze)

49
00:06:07,123 --> 00:06:09,125
(Executive) Hmm, Toda-san

50
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:11,127
Did you have a place in the development department of Kohoku Manufacturing?

51
00:06:11,127 --> 00:06:14,130
Yes (Executive) Why retire?

52
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:18,134
Ah...it's just for personal reasons

53
00:06:18,134 --> 00:06:24,140
(Executives) They've made great stratagems and are improving their performance.

54
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:26,142
Even after graduating from a top university

55
00:06:26,142 --> 00:06:28,144
You won't be able to get restructured

56
00:06:28,144 --> 00:06:31,147
Haa...

57
00:06:31,147 --> 00:06:35,151
Can you communicate well with people?

58
00:06:35,151 --> 00:06:37,153
That's what you mean?

59
00:06:37,153 --> 00:06:40,156
No, this time the recruitment is not from the technical department, but from the sales department.

60
00:06:40,156 --> 00:06:44,156
Communication skills are important

61
00:06:46,162 --> 00:06:48,164
(Vibrator)

62
00:06:48,164 --> 00:06:53,169
Yes Yes Ah

63
00:06:53,169 --> 00:06:57,173
Ah, is that so yes

64
00:06:57,173 --> 00:07:02,173
I understand, yes, sorry

65
00:07:04,113 --> 00:07:06,113

69
00:07:48,157 --> 00:07:51,160
(Natsumi) I know, it hurts

70
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,160
(Natsumi) Are you okay (Nurse) Sorry, sorry

71
00:08:01,103 --> 00:08:05,107
(Todoroki) Hey, the manhole has fallen?

72
00:08:05,107 --> 00:08:08,110
Yes (Todoroki) So I did my neck and legs

73
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:11,113
Well... ah yes

74
00:08:11,113 --> 00:08:15,117
You're fine with your hands and legs, but you should be careful about your neck and hips.

75
00:08:15,117 --> 00:08:17,119
Because there are still aftereffects

76
00:08:17,119 --> 00:08:19,121
See, what about me?

77
00:08:19,121 --> 00:08:23,125
I got the aftereffects three years after being discharged from the hospital

78
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:27,125
That...it's tough

79
00:08:29,131 --> 00:08:33,135

"I administered the medicine."

81

(Natsumi) "Toda Daisaku will be hospitalized in Room 307 at 4:35pm."

82
00:08:40,142 --> 00:08:46,148
"32 years old, contusion in the twitch, broken left leg..."

Huh?

87
00:08:56,158 --> 00:08:58,158
You're the other day...

He was a nurse

89
00:09:02,098 --> 00:09:05,101
Hi, hello...

90
00:09:05,101 --> 00:09:09,105
How are you, cat? cat?

91
00:09:09,105 --> 00:09:16,112
ah! That's right, I wonder if I can go home tomorrow

92
00:09:16,112 --> 00:09:23,119
Yes... I don't think it's possible for the time being if this injury occurs.

93
00:09:23,119 --> 00:09:29,125
Ah, I see. I want to feed my weak cat

94
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:31,127
What should I do...

95
00:09:31,127 --> 00:09:37,127
Um... if you like, I'll go?

96
00:09:39,135 --> 00:09:45,141
I'm done in the morning, so yeah, but I wonder if it's okay

97
00:09:45,141 --> 00:09:50,146
I'll also be grateful for the other day, and I'll need a change of clothes too.

98
00:09:50,146 --> 00:09:56,152
Yes... is it okay? Yes, can you lend me the key?

99
00:09:56,152 --> 00:09:59,155
Ah, the key, ah, ah, ah

100
00:09:59,155 --> 00:10:03,155
Um... there, there, here's the drawer? yes

101
00:10:05,161 --> 00:10:08,161
Well, I'll borrow it, yes

102
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:13,166
Please take care

103
00:10:18,174 --> 00:10:20,174
Ha

104
00:10:23,179 --> 00:10:26,182
Are you an ex-girlfriend?

105
00:10:26,182 --> 00:10:30,186
No, that's not it, it's fine, because

106
00:10:30,186 --> 00:10:33,189
It's not normal to have a room key

107
00:10:33,189 --> 00:10:37,193
I'm just an acquaintance

108
00:10:37,193 --> 00:10:42,198
Yes, the most popular inpatient patient Harunacchi

109
00:10:42,198 --> 00:10:44,200
Harunacchi? Yeah

110
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:48,204
Her nickname and real name is Kawakami Haruna

111
00:10:48,204 --> 00:10:52,208
Big breasts almost sticking out of that white coat

112
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:57,208
It's amazing, hey?

113
00:11:15,164 --> 00:11:18,164
Cat is food

114
00:11:22,171 --> 00:11:24,171
Cat-chan

115
00:11:29,178 --> 00:11:32,178
Cat?

116
00:11:37,186 --> 00:11:40,189
Cat-chan

117
00:11:40,189 --> 00:11:50,199
・～

118

119
00:11:54,203 --> 00:12:07,149
・～

120
00:12:07,149 --> 00:12:09,151
I saw it

121
00:12:09,151 --> 00:12:20,162
・～

122
00:12:20,162 --> 00:12:23,162
(Kozono) Yes, then try moving it

123
00:12:26,168 --> 00:12:29,171
Yes it looks ok

124
00:12:29,171 --> 00:12:32,174
(Kozono) Are you feeling any pain? Yeah

125
00:12:32,174 --> 00:12:35,177
Um... when will the doctor be able to be discharged from the hospital?

126
00:12:35,177 --> 00:12:38,180
I won't know until I look at the postoperative progress.

127
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:40,182
For about a week...

128
00:12:40,182 --> 00:12:43,185
Whiplash may appear later

129
00:12:43,185 --> 00:12:49,191
・～

130
00:12:49,191 --> 00:12:52,194
Ah hello

131
00:12:52,194 --> 00:12:58,200
That cat will be kept by me until she is discharged from the hospital, right?

132
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:02,137
I took me home yesterday

133
00:13:02,137 --> 00:13:04,139
I think that would be more convenient

134
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:08,143
Ah... But isn't it a nuisance? home!

135
00:13:08,143 --> 00:13:12,147
What's the name? Your cat hasn't worn it yet

136
00:13:12,147 --> 00:13:16,151
Poor, I'll put it on

137
00:13:16,151 --> 00:13:19,154
Ah, it's not... but

138
00:13:19,154 --> 00:13:22,157
Is it true? Yeah

139
00:13:22,157 --> 00:13:24,159
So let's think about it (Uemura) Good morning

140
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:28,163
Yes! So, excuse me

141
00:13:28,163 --> 00:13:30,165
(Uemura) Good morning

142
00:13:30,165 --> 00:13:32,167
(Uemura) Good morning, please sign me

143
00:13:32,167 --> 00:13:34,167
yes!

144
00:13:38,173 --> 00:13:40,175
yes! (Uemura) Harunacchisa

145
00:13:40,175 --> 00:13:45,180
Is tomorrow early? Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu

146
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:47,182
(Uemura) Let's go out tonight

147
00:13:47,182 --> 00:13:49,184
Hmm... (Uemura) That's good, that's good

148
00:13:49,184 --> 00:13:54,189
It's out! Harunacchi, the sex-in-one dealer, is in danger too

149
00:13:54,189 --> 00:13:56,191
A slut? A slut

150
00:13:56,191 --> 00:13:58,193
(Uemura) Later, is that okay today? ah…

151
00:13:58,193 --> 00:14:00,193
(Uemura) That's it

152
00:14:02,131 --> 00:14:06,135
I really like Harunacchi

153
00:14:06,135 --> 00:14:11,140
After all, Uemura-san is dating Furukawa-san, right?

154
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:15,144
(Uemura) Natsumi has seduced me, but it's not related

155
00:14:15,144 --> 00:14:19,148
Is it true? Of course, I like Natsumi

156
00:14:19,148 --> 00:14:24,153
But, my favorite is Harunacchi

157
00:14:24,153 --> 00:14:28,157
What do you think?

158
00:14:28,157 --> 00:14:31,160
What about Harunacchi? Huh?

159
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:35,164
Do you have a boyfriend? Of course

160
00:14:35,164 --> 00:14:39,168
Not here again

161
00:14:39,168 --> 00:14:43,172
It's true, I guess they broke up

162
00:14:43,172 --> 00:14:45,174
I shook it

163
00:14:45,174 --> 00:14:51,174
Uhhh, seriously, you got dumped?

164
00:14:54,183 --> 00:14:58,187
I have no eye on that guy

165
00:14:58,187 --> 00:15:05,127
Maybe I don't have any luck with men

166
00:15:05,127 --> 00:15:07,129
Could you lend me some help?

167
00:15:07,129 --> 00:15:11,133
I'll look at my palm lines, I'm pretty knowledgeable.

168
00:15:11,133 --> 00:15:13,135
What do you think? Wow

169
00:15:13,135 --> 00:15:17,139
I don't have any brain lines... What?

170
00:15:17,139 --> 00:15:22,144
Is that bad? Hehehehehe, I'm kidding

171
00:15:22,144 --> 00:15:25,147
This is the lifeline

172
00:15:25,147 --> 00:15:27,149
This is a fate line, but yes

173
00:15:27,149 --> 00:15:33,155
Because the line of fate extends straight to the wrist.

174
00:15:33,155 --> 00:15:39,155
Do you have a strong tendency to fail when you're swayed by affection?

175
00:15:41,163 --> 00:15:44,166
ah…

176
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:46,168
(The sound of the door opening)

177
00:15:46,168 --> 00:16:06,121
・～

178
00:16:06,121 --> 00:16:10,125
Wait... I want to shower

179
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:14,125
(Uemura) That's good, that's good

180
00:16:16,131 --> 00:16:20,135
Ah, I don't like it...

181
00:16:20,135 --> 00:16:40,155
・～

182
00:16:40,155 --> 00:16:56,171
・～

Yes yes

395
00:42:12,152 --> 00:42:16,156
But don't push yourself too hard like Todoroki-san.

396
00:42:16,156 --> 00:42:18,156

397
00:42:22,162 --> 00:42:24,162

400
00:42:45,185 --> 00:42:48,188
My head is too

401
00:42:48,188 --> 00:42:51,191
The handsome guy has risen, right?

402
00:42:51,191 --> 00:42:53,193

403
00:42:53,193 --> 00:42:55,195

00:43:04,138 --> 00:43:09,143
So I'll leave it here so thank you for your hard work

408
00:43:09,143 --> 00:43:12,146
(Todoroki) Hanshin Hanshin Baseball after all...

409
00:43:12,146 --> 00:43:14,148
(Male) Is it okay? (Todoroki) I can go, of course

410
00:43:14,148 --> 00:43:16,150
(Male) He's super weak this year

411
00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:20,150
That's already every year (male) It's not good every year.

412
00:43:22,156 --> 00:43:25,159
(Todoroki) That Toda-chan got a corset

413
00:43:25,159 --> 00:43:27,161
(Todoroki) cast is also yes

414
00:43:27,161 --> 00:43:29,163
(Todoroki) Of course it was good

415
00:43:29,163 --> 00:43:34,168
Ah, this is a gift (Todoroki) Thank you

416
00:43:34,168 --> 00:43:39,173
Thank you for the gift (men)

417
00:43:39,173 --> 00:43:43,177
Um... I have a little something I want to ask

418
00:43:43,177 --> 00:43:45,177
(Boom)Why?

419
00:43:47,181 --> 00:43:49,183
Kawakami-san

420
00:43:49,183 --> 00:43:52,186
Are there any people you're dating?

421
00:43:52,186 --> 00:43:55,189
If it's about Harunachi, Toda-chan doesn't know much more about it.

422
00:43:55,189 --> 00:44:00,127
No... I don't know anything about giving away the room key?

423
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:03,130
I'm listening seriously...

424
00:44:03,130 --> 00:44:07,134
Huh? Did Toda-chan really fall in love with you?

425
00:44:07,134 --> 00:44:09,136
It would be nice if they wouldn't answer you anymore

426
00:44:09,136 --> 00:44:13,140
No, if you're coming, it's hard to say

427
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:15,142
That's not it

428
00:44:15,142 --> 00:44:18,145
Really? yes

429
00:44:18,145 --> 00:44:23,150
Harunacchi seems to be dating a lot of different people

430
00:44:23,150 --> 00:44:27,154
A variety of people? Yes, doctors, patients...

431
00:44:27,154 --> 00:44:33,160
Well, what's it? Are you the type who can't say he hates when invited?

432
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:37,164
It's a rumour! Isn't that a rumor just?

433
00:44:37,164 --> 00:44:39,166
(Male)Yes (Male)Rumor Rumor

434
00:44:39,166 --> 00:44:43,166
(Men) Rumors Rumors...

435
00:44:45,172 --> 00:44:47,172
(The sound of a roar)

436
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:01,119
Hmm...

437
00:45:12,132 --> 00:45:16,136
Yoshihara-san, how are you doing? (Yoshihara) It's okay but...

438
00:45:16,136 --> 00:45:32,152
・～

439
00:45:32,152 --> 00:45:36,156
Kawakami-san, there's a step over there, it's fine

440
00:45:36,156 --> 00:45:40,160
(Sorry) It hurts, it hurts... Are you okay?

441
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:50,170
・～

442
00:45:50,170 --> 00:45:54,174
Takeda-san, I'll replace the IV drip.

444
00:46:09,122 --> 00:46:12,125

447
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:31,140
Hmm... haa...

448
00:46:35,148 --> 00:46:41,154
"4:32pm, Gowda Kiyoshi, 26 years old, in Room 301."

449
00:46:41,154 --> 00:46:45,158
"I was hospitalized due to injury to the ligaments at both ankles."

450
00:46:45,158 --> 00:46:49,162
"Kunii Hiroto, 14 years old, 5:40pm."

451
00:46:49,162 --> 00:46:54,162
"I developed 5th lumbar separatosis due to stress fracture..."

452
00:47:07,114 --> 00:47:10,117
Ah

453
00:47:10,117 --> 00:47:14,121
What's wrong? At this time

454
00:47:14,121 --> 00:47:19,121
Maybe you were waiting for me?

455
00:47:22,129 --> 00:47:25,132
Kawakami-san

456
00:47:25,132 --> 00:47:27,132
I love it!

457
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:53,160

Ha ha ha ha

468
00:51:15,161 --> 00:51:17,161
Let's go!

469
00:51:19,165 --> 00:51:24,170
After the interview is over, why don't you go out drinking tonight to celebrate beforehand?

470
00:51:24,170 --> 00:51:28,174
Isn't it a bit early? yes?

471
00:51:28,174 --> 00:51:32,178
(Interviewer) Did you come to the development department of Kouhoku Seisakusho?

472
00:51:32,178 --> 00:51:35,181
Yes (interviewer) Why retire?

473
00:51:35,181 --> 00:51:38,184
Um... Actually, I was laid off...

474
00:51:38,184 --> 00:51:43,189
Thanks to this, I am glad that I have had many different experiences.

475
00:51:43,189 --> 00:51:47,193
I hope I get a job

476
00:51:47,193 --> 00:51:51,197
Um... the outcome will be next week, but I'm confident this time.

477
00:51:51,197 --> 00:51:53,199
TRUE? Yeah

478
00:51:53,199 --> 00:51:57,203
So be confident! thank you

479
00:51:57,203 --> 00:51:59,139
Looks tasty, looks tasty

480
00:51:59,139 --> 00:52:01,141
It's got a little messy

481
00:52:01,141 --> 00:52:04,144
It's good, it's good, it's sorry

482
00:52:04,144 --> 00:52:08,144
(Nakamura) Haruna It's been a while

483
00:52:10,150 --> 00:52:16,150
I've created another new guy, how many people are you?

484
00:52:18,158 --> 00:52:23,163
It doesn't matter, so let's go home

485
00:52:23,163 --> 00:52:25,165
(Nakamura) You probably wouldn't be like that.

486
00:52:25,165 --> 00:52:27,167
Because we're not completely strangers

487
00:52:27,167 --> 00:52:29,169
It hurts a bit, let go (Nakamura) What's that

488
00:52:29,169 --> 00:52:31,171
Please stop, you don't like it, right

489
00:52:31,171 --> 00:52:35,175
It's definitely a joke, I'm kidding, I'm kidding...

490
00:52:35,175 --> 00:52:39,175
Hey, let go for a moment Hey, let go!

491
00:52:41,181 --> 00:52:44,184
I don't need a woman like this either, this slut

492
00:52:44,184 --> 00:52:47,187
Hey, hey! Go outside (Nakamura) What is it?

493
00:52:47,187 --> 00:52:49,189
Come over here (Nakamura) What?

494
00:52:49,189 --> 00:52:52,192
Hey hey! (Men) That's bad!

495
00:52:52,192 --> 00:52:55,192
(Female) Don't worry, don't you let me go!

496
00:52:59,132 --> 00:53:01,132
Are you okay?

497
00:53:08,141 --> 00:53:11,141
Doesn't your neck hurt?

498
00:53:18,151 --> 00:53:22,155
That person... I know

499
00:53:22,155 --> 00:53:27,160
I'm sure he's the guy who thrusts you out of the car...

500
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:30,163
Why did you date such a man?

501
00:53:30,163 --> 00:53:32,165
With such violent man

502
00:53:32,165 --> 00:53:37,170
He was kind at first, so if he's kind, then anyone is fine

503
00:53:37,170 --> 00:53:44,177
It's not just him, how many men did he have?

504
00:53:44,177 --> 00:53:48,177
What does it mean? It was rumored in the hospital

505
00:53:50,183 --> 00:53:56,183
I'm one of them, either! You're different from other guys

506
00:54:00,126 --> 00:54:03,126
Don't you believe me?

507
00:54:20,146 --> 00:54:23,146
(Sigh)

508
00:54:26,152 --> 00:54:29,155
Wait a minute, hey!

509
00:54:29,155 --> 00:54:32,158
If you can wait, leave it alone!

510
00:54:32,158 --> 00:54:34,160
a little bit! Hey, listen!

511
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:38,164
I love you too so I can't stand it

512
00:54:38,164 --> 00:54:40,166
You know?

513
00:54:40,166 --> 00:54:44,170
Toda-san is also with everyone

514
00:54:44,170 --> 00:54:47,173
Did you think she was an easy woman?

515
00:54:47,173 --> 00:54:50,176
You can do it right away if you're kind

516
00:54:50,176 --> 00:54:54,180
Stop saying yourself like that

517
00:54:54,180 --> 00:54:58,184
Everyone's rumors are true

518
00:54:58,184 --> 00:55:02,121
If you're kind to me, I'll fall in love

519
00:55:02,121 --> 00:55:07,126
And I was immediately rejected and I was lonely again

520
00:55:07,126 --> 00:55:11,130
I'm such a woman and I'm not a sloppy

521
00:55:11,130 --> 00:55:14,133
Is that okay?

522
00:55:14,133 --> 00:55:20,133

523
00:55:34,153 --> 00:55:36,153

Ah...

535
00:57:27,133 --> 00:57:31,137
Hey, why don't you date me tonight?

536
00:57:31,137 --> 00:57:36,142
Haha, that's good, isn't it?

537
00:57:36,142 --> 00:57:38,142
I don't like it

538
00:57:40,146 --> 00:57:43,149
(Nurse) Thank you for your hard work, sorry

539
00:57:43,149 --> 00:57:46,152
(Nurse) Senpai What are you going to eat today?

540
00:57:46,152 --> 00:57:49,155

541
00:57:49,155 --> 00:57:51,157
(Nurse) That's right, That's right (Nurse)

542
00:57:51,157 --> 00:57:55,161
Should you just seduce a doctor (nurse) Why?

543
00:57:55,161 --> 00:57:57,163
Miki!

544
00:57:57,163 --> 00:58:02,163
Um... I have something I want to talk to

545

548
00:58:31,130 --> 00:58:35,134
Ah, hello yes

549
00:58:35,134 --> 00:58:40,139
Ah, I see, thank you very much

550
00:58:40,139 --> 00:58:44,143
Yes, I understand, thank you very much

551
00:58:44,143 --> 00:58:46,143
Excuse me

552
00:58:49,148 --> 00:58:54,153
Alright! It's decided!

553
00:58:54,153 --> 00:59:01,094
Okay, okay, okay, it's decided, it's decided

554
00:59:01,094 --> 00:59:04,094
Haa... I'm going to pass

555
00:59:19,112 --> 00:59:23,116
(Transmission tone)

556
00:59:23,116 --> 00:59:26,119
(Anauncing) The number you received is

557
00:59:26,119 --> 00:59:30,123
Check the number that is not currently in use...

558
00:59:30,123 --> 00:59:32,123
Huh?

559
00:59:34,127 --> 00:59:36,129
(Transmission tone)

560
00:59:36,129 --> 00:59:39,132
(Announce) The number you received is currently...

561
00:59:39,132 --> 00:59:41,134
ah…

562
00:59:41,134 --> 00:59:45,138
You quit. Has Kawakami quit?

563
00:59:45,138 --> 00:59:50,143
Last week I suddenly started talking about it and said it was family affairs...

564
00:59:50,143 --> 00:59:54,143
Ah, I'm sorry

565
00:59:59,152 --> 01:00:02,155
Toda-san

566
01:00:02,155 --> 01:00:05,158
Kawakami's father and doctor

567
01:00:05,158 --> 01:00:10,163
I've worked with you too, and I'm a very strict person.

568
01:00:10,163 --> 01:00:15,163
He was a great person, but not a warm person.

569
01:00:17,170 --> 01:00:21,174
Kawakami-san went to nursing school.

570
01:00:21,174 --> 01:00:27,180
Is it my wish? What does it mean?

571
01:00:27,180 --> 01:00:31,184
Maybe my father would like him to do something.

572
01:00:31,184 --> 01:00:34,187
I think I chose it

573
01:00:34,187 --> 01:00:40,187
Maybe he wanted to be praised, or rather wanted kindness

574
01:00:42,195 --> 01:00:48,201
My father passed away while I was in nursing school

575
01:00:48,201 --> 01:00:50,201
Then...

576
01:00:52,205 --> 01:00:56,205
I have a strong desire to be kind

577
01:00:58,211 --> 01:01:01,147
Ah, sorry

578
01:01:01,147 --> 01:01:03,149
He's not a psychiatrist, but he says something arrogant

579
01:01:03,149 --> 01:01:06,152
no!

580
01:01:06,152 --> 01:01:10,156
I felt that Toda-san was different from other men.

581
01:01:10,156 --> 01:01:12,156
ah…

582
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:17,163
Kawakami-san, I loved cooking.

583
01:01:17,163 --> 01:01:20,163
It seems like I'm working in that place

584
01:01:28,174 --> 01:01:31,174
thank you!

585
01:01:35,181 --> 01:01:38,181
(Shop clerk) Yes, I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

586
01:01:40,186 --> 01:01:43,186
The iron plate is hot, so be careful

587
01:01:47,193 --> 01:01:50,196
(Sound of the sliding door open) Welcome!

588
01:01:50,196 --> 01:01:53,199
(Sound of sliding door closing)

589
01:01:53,199 --> 01:01:55,199
Ah!

590
01:01:58,204 --> 01:02:03,204
Are you alone? Follow me, please

591
01:02:09,148 --> 01:02:13,152
What about your order? Oh, then live

592
01:02:13,152 --> 01:02:17,152
One live! (Shop clerk) Yes, I've arrived

593
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:23,162
Did you hear about this from the head nurse?

594
01:02:23,162 --> 01:02:25,164
Yeah

595
01:02:25,164 --> 01:02:28,167
I told you not to tell anyone...

596
01:02:28,167 --> 01:02:32,167
Ah... but I think it's just me

597
01:02:34,173 --> 01:02:38,177
Ah, that's right! I've got a job

598
01:02:38,177 --> 01:02:40,179
Is it true? Yeah

599
01:02:40,179 --> 01:02:43,179
congratulations! thank you

600
01:02:45,184 --> 01:02:49,184
Um, what time will the shop be over?

601
01:02:57,196 --> 01:03:04,196
(Toilet washing sound)

602
01:03:10,142 --> 01:03:15,147
What did you hide? Huh? It's nothing

603
01:03:15,147 --> 01:03:17,147
yes? Yeah

604
01:03:21,153 --> 01:03:26,158
what happened? No, it's thanks to you

605
01:03:26,158 --> 01:03:31,163
I wasn't really motivated until I met you

606
01:03:31,163 --> 01:03:33,165
That's not the case

607
01:03:33,165 --> 01:03:36,168
Toda-san's ability was the one who decided to get a job.

608
01:03:36,168 --> 01:03:40,168
Yes! Thanks to you

609
01:03:51,183 --> 01:03:53,183
marry me

610
01:03:56,188 --> 01:04:00,188
Please take this ring

611
01:04:08,134 --> 01:04:10,134
sorry

612
01:04:14,140 --> 01:04:19,145
I really love you

613
01:04:19,145 --> 01:04:23,149
But I can't do it

614
01:04:23,149 --> 01:04:27,153
I can't receive this ring

615
01:04:27,153 --> 01:04:33,159
No, you have to be you, I'll definitely make you happy

616
01:04:33,159 --> 01:04:39,159
It's impossible... I got engaged

617
01:04:42,168 --> 01:04:44,170
engagement?

618
01:04:44,170 --> 01:04:49,175
My mother has been telling me to marry him.

619
01:04:49,175 --> 01:04:56,182
I went to a matchmaking session the other day and decided

620
01:04:56,182 --> 01:05:01,120
Ah... what kind of person is your opponent?

621
01:05:01,120 --> 01:05:05,124
Kind, kind person? Are you kind?

622
01:05:05,124 --> 01:05:09,128
what? That's all I decided

623
01:05:09,128 --> 01:05:14,133
I'm good at falling in love with people

624
01:05:14,133 --> 01:05:16,135
Wait a minute

625
01:05:16,135 --> 01:05:21,140
How long are you going to cheat on yourself?

626
01:05:21,140 --> 01:05:27,140
Hey, stop lying to yourself

627
01:05:29,148 --> 01:05:32,148
What if you say something?

628
01:05:48,167 --> 01:05:54,173
(Door opening and closing sound)

629
01:05:54,173 --> 01:06:01,173
・(Sound of going down the stairs)

630
01:06:03,115 --> 01:06:21,133
・～

631
01:06:21,133 --> 01:06:24,133
Wow, it hurts...

632
01:06:28,140 --> 01:06:30,140
Huh?

633
01:06:34,146 --> 01:06:39,151
Huh? Huh?

634
01:06:39,151 --> 01:06:48,160
・～

635
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:52,164
(Step) Neck Isn't it painful? it's okay

636
01:06:52,164 --> 01:06:54,164
(Staff) It suits you well

637
01:06:56,168 --> 01:06:59,104
(Fiancé) Thank you so much

638
01:06:59,104 --> 01:07:02,104
We're really getting married

639
01:07:08,113 --> 01:07:11,116
If so, it's 1 o'clock

640
01:07:11,116 --> 01:07:15,120
Yes, please, sorry

641
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:18,123
So Takase-san's customer is here

642
01:07:18,123 --> 01:07:20,123
(Okase) Please

643
01:08:00,099 --> 01:08:02,099
(Sigh)

644
01:08:47,146 --> 01:08:50,149
(Sigh)

645
01:08:50,149 --> 01:09:10,102
・～

646
01:09:10,102 --> 01:09:30,122
・～

647
01:09:30,122 --> 01:09:50,142
・～

648
01:09:50,142 --> 01:09:59,151
・～

649
01:09:59,151 --> 01:10:06,151
Haa haa... Haa haa...

650
01:10:11,163 --> 01:10:15,167
I've run away

651
01:10:15,167 --> 01:10:17,167
What should I do...

652
01:10:23,175 --> 01:10:26,178
This is Haruna's place

653
01:10:26,178 --> 01:10:34,178
・～

654
01:10:49,201 --> 01:10:51,201
(The sound of a roar)

655
01:10:53,205 --> 01:10:58,210
Groo? What, where is it?

656
01:10:58,210 --> 01:11:00,145
(The sound of a roar)

657
01:11:00,145 --> 01:11:04,149
Maybe it's lower?

658
01:11:04,149 --> 01:11:06,149
Over here? Yeah

659
01:11:09,154 --> 01:11:11,156
Ahh

660
01:11:11,156 --> 01:11:13,158
Goro! Wow...

661
01:11:13,158 --> 01:11:16,161
Where were you going? Huh? Come on

662
01:11:16,161 --> 01:11:19,164
Yeah? Good

663
01:11:19,164 --> 01:11:22,167
Where were you going?

664
01:11:22,167 --> 01:11:26,167
Huh? Ah?

665
01:11:33,178 --> 01:11:36,181
(laughter)

666
01:11:36,181 --> 01:11:56,201
・～

667
01:11:56,201 --> 01:12:16,154
・～

668
01:12:16,154 --> 01:12:36,174
・～

669
01:12:36,174 --> 01:12:56,194
・～

670
01:12:56,194 --> 01:13:16,148
・～

671
01:13:16,148 --> 01:13:28,160
・～

672
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:40,160
・～
