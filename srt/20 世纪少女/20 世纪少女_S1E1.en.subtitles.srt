MOVING SUPPORT CENTER

3
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:39,539
Oh, it's snowing.

4
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:51,342
-Hey.
-Gosh.

5
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:54,179
You're already up and working
so early in the morning.

6
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:55,096
Good morning.

7
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:58,725
Isn't this for your daughter in Seoul?

8
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:00,477
You mean my Bo-ra?

9
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:04,647
-Take care.
-Yeah. Be careful on the road.

10
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:27,587
I feel you with the breeze.

11
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:29,839
Goddess of the Wind.

12
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:33,218
Okay. Good work, Ms. Na. Let's go eat.

13
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:34,511
Good work, everyone.

14
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:36,805
-Good work. Let's go eat.
-Great work.

15
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,476
Yeah, Dad.

16
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:43,520
Who's Joseph?

17
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,688
Huh? Who?

18
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:48,108
Are you dating some foreigner?

19
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:50,193
What are you talking about?

20
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:54,447
"A forbidden love of everyone's dreams"?

21
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,991
Are you still watching porn?

22
00:01:57,075 --> 00:02:00,161
What are you talking about?
When did I ever watch porn?

23
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:04,624
Fine, then. There's no need
to yell at your father.

24
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:08,128
I got all excited for nothing.
I thought you were seeing someone.

25
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:11,172
Hey. Are you coming down here
when we move or not?

26
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:14,342
-Oh, uh--
-It's okay if you're too busy to come.

27
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:17,887
It's fine. We can just sprain our backs
carrying all this heavy stuff.

28
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:20,390
-No, I--
-What can I do? Our kids are too busy.

29
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:21,724
Do whatever you want!

30
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:23,226
Okay.

31
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:31,609
THE LOVE AFFAIR

32
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:37,782
A FORBIDDEN LOVE OF EVERYONE'S DREAMS

33
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,631
Hey, Kim Yeon-doo, are you crazy?

34
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:56,301
Huh?

35
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:59,345
1999, CHEONGJU

36
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,355
Why are you suddenly not going to America?

37
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:12,150
Don't you need the heart surgery?

38
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:15,737
What use is surgery
when I don't have a heart?

39
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,449
What on Earth are you saying?

40
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:23,036
My heart was stolen.

41
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:26,748
Welcome.

42
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:34,839
Oh, my mother is not here right now.

43
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:37,717
Excuse me!

44
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,929
I can measure sizes too.

45
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:43,097
Just hold on.

46
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:47,602
Huh?

47
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:53,733
Ouch.

48
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,504
BAEK HYUN-JIN

49
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,006
Has your heart ever fluttered

50
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,300
in a life-threatening way?

51
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:23,346
Isn't that due to your heart condition?

52
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:26,474
No. It was definitely different.

53
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:28,309
Have you ever seen me act like this?

54
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:30,853
Lee Jae-ung,
the fifth-grade class president.

55
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,855
Choi Yeong-su, middle school track team.

56
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,774
The assistant art teacher
in middle school.

57
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:36,943
Let's see, who else? Oh, yeah!

58
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:43,241
Hey, didn't you say that Jung-jae
would be your last love?

59
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:44,951
So did I do all that for nothing?

60
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,539
This time, it's really, truly real.

61
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:52,458
I can't fall asleep at night
since that day.

62
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:54,919
I'm scared I won't see him again,

63
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:57,130
and just listening to music makes me cry.

64
00:04:57,922 --> 00:04:59,465
It's serious for me.

65
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:03,886
You still can't do this!
Hurry, start packing!

66
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:07,640
Hey, you think I'm being like this
for no reason?

67
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:12,312
He got the uniform for Wooam High,
the same school as ours.

68
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:14,355
So how am I supposed to just leave?

69
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:26,451
WOULD YOU LIKE TO CREATE AN EMAIL ACCOUNT?

70
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:29,871
ID BORA1999

71
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:30,997
ID YEONDOO1999

72
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,250
The password is "friends forever."

73
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,419
What am I supposed to do with this?

74
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:41,716
From now on, you'll know everything
that he does.

75
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:43,551
As if you're going to school with him.

76
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:44,469
Bo-ra…

77
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:50,350
So go get your surgery
and come back healthy, okay?

78
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:51,267
Okay!

79
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,940
HYUN-JIN OBSERVATION NOTES

80
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:01,527
Dear Bo-ra, I'm writing this
as soon as I got to my aunt's.

81
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:03,696
It's a whole new world here.

82
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,616
America is huge,
and the buildings are super tall too.

83
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:07,950
BORA VIDEO

84
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:10,787
And there are people who look
like movie stars everywhere, seriously.

85
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:14,916
It sucks to be hospitalized,
missing out on such great things.

86
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:17,543
I wish you were here with me
to just have fun.

87
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:21,506
So, today's finally
your first day of school.

88
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:22,799
Wake your sister up!

89
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:26,427
You didn't oversleep again, did you?

90
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:29,430
Na Bo-ra's awake, Mom.

91
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:32,517
Wow, really?
Maybe pigs will start flying soon.

92
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,310
Go tell her to eat breakfast.

93
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:37,939
Huh? Did she already leave?

94
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:38,856
BORA VIDEO

95
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,608
Today's the big day!
You're going to see that boy.

96
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:42,985
-Wait, what…
-Just thinking about it excites me!

97
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,154
Huh? Did she leave already?

98
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:48,574
That day, I saw him walking
toward the apartment complex.

99
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:50,410
Instead of our neighborhood bus stop,

100
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:53,413
run to Lucky Apartments
and catch the bus there.

101
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:56,040
Then you might meet him sooner.

102
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:59,669
Mister, wait for me! Mister!

103
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:04,799
Thank you, sir.

104
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:06,134
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

105
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:09,429
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

106
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:14,851
I'm sorry!

107
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:23,609
Mister, slow down!

108
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:25,027
Sit here.

109
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,029
Don't trip again.

110
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:29,031
Thank you.

111
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:34,328
Remember, his name is Baek Hyun-jin.

112
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:35,413
BAEK HYUN-JIN

113
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:39,083
Let's go to the school shop later.

114
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:40,001
Sure.

115
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,545
-You're buying this time.
-Why?

116
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:44,380
There you are. Baek Hyun-jin.

117
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:46,382
WELCOME, 1999 SCHOOL YEAR

118
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,301
Hello, freshmen.

119
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:50,470
Boys over here, girls over there.

120
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:54,557
You punk, what the heck is this outfit?

121
00:07:57,935 --> 00:07:59,437
-Where are you going?
-Sorry?

122
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,356
Girls go this way, and boys go that way.
Come on, go inside!

123
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:05,443
Huh? Darn It?

124
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:10,281
Ugh, darn it.

125
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:13,284
I was excited to come to a co-ed school,

126
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:15,328
but it's the same as an all-girls school.

127
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:18,498
That doesn't mean all hope is lost.

128
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:21,375
-Madam?
-Madam?

129
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:29,091
Once the bell rings,
all the famished boys and girls

130
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:31,260
will mix and mingle in one place.

131
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:42,438
Gosh! Slow down.

132
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:43,731
Line up! Slowly!

133
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,324
Bo-ra.

134
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:55,993
I need you to do something now.

135
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:58,120
I'm counting on you.

136
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:11,759
EVERYTHING YEON-DOO WANTS TO KNOW
ABOUT "THAT BOY"

137
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:13,636
He's 181 centimeters tall.

138
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,847
He likes orange-flavored Demisoda.

139
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:18,057
And his shoe size?

140
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,267
280.

141
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,018
He likes basketball.

142
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,480
If he's good at basketball,
he must be super popular.

143
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:28,568
Kind of. But not enough
for you to be worried.

144
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,444
-How are his friends?
-Basketball later?

145
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:32,280
What if he has a girlfriend?

146
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:36,867
I don't think so.
But he's always with his best friend.

147
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:38,536
Poong Woon-ho, a guy in his class.

148
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:40,788
He lives in building 304
at Lucky Apartments.

149
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:42,373
They commute to school together.

150
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:45,501
Do you think there's a way
to get closer to him?

151
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,004
-So, there's a sense of community.
-Clubs?

152
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:53,843
What are the principles
a democratic citizen must uphold?

153
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:57,888
First, respect discussions and debates.

154
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:00,516
-Woon-ho!
-Hey, this way…

155
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,518
-Am I right or not?
-You're right.

156
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,604
Two, give way to…

157
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:08,441
What?

158
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:11,402
Sorry?

159
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:13,904
Oh…

160
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:18,659
Ow!

161
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:21,621
Hey, my stomach hurts.

162
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:25,416
Sir, my stomach hurts so much.

163
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,377
I think I need to go to the nurse.

164
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,171
-Does it hurt?
-No, it doesn't.

165
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:32,340
Stop it.

166
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,175
Huh? Oh.

167
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:38,137
-Next.
-Why aren't you going?

168
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,598
I'm guessing you don't need to see me?

169
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:42,391
Huh? Oh, yes, sir.

170
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,522
Sir, I have really bad period cramps.

171
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:50,524
Oh, you have cramps?

172
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:53,486
Here.

173
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:56,697
Your hands.

174
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:00,910
Take this and rest here for a bit.

175
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:02,495
-Thank you, sir.
-Sure.

176
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:05,081
-Hope you feel better.
-Yes, sir.

177
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:06,040
Next.

178
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:07,792
Hyeon-beom tackled you too hard.

179
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,585
Let him be. It just means I'm good.

180
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:12,004
Hey, did you pick a club to join?

181
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:14,840
I don't know. You?

182
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:18,469
-The broadcasting club.
-Then I'll join them too.

183
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,305
Do you even know what they do?

184
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:24,016
I don't know. What do they do?

185
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,435
Hey, they even have auditions.

186
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:28,229
Wait.

187
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:35,736
What is it?

188
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:40,658
-Nothing.
-What?

189
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:47,289
-What do they look for in the audition?
-Passionate voices? Something like that.

190
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:48,916
An enthusiastic voice?

191
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:50,876
How do you show people that?

192
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:53,713
Come on, hurry.

193
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:55,923
Thank you.

194
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:59,093
All right, number three, Na Bo-ra.

195
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:24,994
-I think she'll get in.
-Is she Na Bo-ra?

196
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,203
Thank you.

197
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:29,123
Next, number four, Baek Hyun-jin.

198
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,382
I'm sorry, sir.

199
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:39,967
-What?
-What's he saying?

200
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:43,304
To make room for talented kids like her,

201
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:47,516
I'll be withdrawing from this audition.

202
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:52,062
You can all see
the yearly plan up front, right?

203
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:53,355
-I got in.
-Yes, sir.

204
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:54,732
For the details--

205
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:56,609
But Baek Hyun-jin isn't here.

206
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:58,944
You guys are the future
of our broadcasting club.

207
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:01,781
Let's do our best for the next year.

208
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:02,698
Yes, sir!

209
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:03,908
-I'll do my best!
-Okay.

210
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:05,367
Don't worry, though.

211
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:06,952
You'll work in pairs.

212
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,245
I have a great plan.

213
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:10,122
-Be nice to your partner.
-Yes, sir.

214
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:13,584
Hey, Woon-ho!

215
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:18,631
We're partners. I look forward
to working with you.

216
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:21,050
Okay.

217
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:24,303
Hey, wait…

218
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:28,098
"Okay"?

219
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:36,273
Huh? A pager?

220
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:59,463
Zero one two…

221
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:05,302
Six…

222
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:10,766
Zero…

223
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,644
Let's go to the school shop after this.

224
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:15,396
Hold on. I'm checking this.

225
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:17,857
Okay, hurry up.

226
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:19,900
Dang it.

227
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:21,485
PHONE BOOK

228
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:24,613
BAEK GWANG-DEOK, BAEK GI-YONG, BAEK…

229
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:33,706
Hello?

230
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:36,208
May I speak with Baek Hyun-jin?

231
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:37,960
Who? I don't know him.

232
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:38,878
Oh, uh--

233
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:46,719
May I speak with Baek Hyun-jin?

234
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:48,220
-Wrong number.
-Yes, sir.

235
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:18,918
Please.

236
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:24,048
Hello.

237
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:27,301
May I speak with Baek Hyun-jin?

238
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:34,725
Who is this?

239
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:42,274
This is the research institute, Yes or No.

240
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:45,694
What is your favorite pop song?

241
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:48,572
Please state your response after the beep.

242
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:50,824
Beep.

243
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:56,747
"Time Like a Lie" by Toy.

244
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:02,461
Thank you for responding to our survey.

245
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:05,047
We will be sending you a small gift.

246
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:08,926
Once you hear the beep,
please state your pager number.

247
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:12,972
Beep.

248
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:18,060
Na Bo-ra?

249
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:24,400
Crap.

250
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:40,082
That was you yesterday, right?

251
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:43,460
Of course not.

252
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:49,550
I mean…

253
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,135
What do you mean?

254
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:56,932
Do you want Hyun-jin's pager number?

255
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,267
Huh? Baek Hyun-jin's?

256
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:03,480
Why on earth would I want
to know his pager number?

257
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:04,398
So it was you.

258
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:06,608
Yes or No.

259
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:12,906
What's the deal with you? Hey, you!

260
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:18,412
Why'd you pretend to be Hyun-jin
when you're not and answer his calls?

261
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:21,331
I never said I was Hyun-jin.

262
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:23,250
Whatever!

263
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:29,965
So, are you going to tell me?

264
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,387
Ugh, forget it!

265
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,431
You weren't going to tell me anyway.

266
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:42,811
There's a movie I want to watch.

267
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,772
I'll think about it if you lend it to me.

268
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:46,940
Your family has
a video rental shop, right?

269
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,109
Which movie?

270
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,112
MINORS MAY NOT RENT THIS MOVIE

271
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:01,663
You brat…

272
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:06,126
-I'll go out, sir.
-Get out.

273
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,294
Wait, I need that.

274
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:08,629
Next.

275
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:10,839
Come on.

276
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:13,759
-Open your backpack!
-Yes, sir.

277
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:16,303
Open it!

278
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:29,316
How could you?

279
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:52,172
-What?
-Put your arms up high.

280
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:54,508
You told me to bring it.

281
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,802
Who would bring the whole thing?

282
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:58,720
You're one to talk.

283
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:01,390
Shut up, you're so annoying.

284
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:25,706
I'm going to destroy him.

285
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:33,505
Oh, welcome--

286
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:45,851
He's my friend.

287
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,437
Members get discounts here, right?

288
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:51,565
Yes, wait.

289
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:53,066
Yeah.

290
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:57,946
Here, put your name down
and your birthday and…

291
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:03,660
Right, you get a free video
if you give them your pager number.

292
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:05,621
Oh really?

293
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:21,678
Hello, this is Baek Hyun-jin.

294
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:25,682
Please let me hear your voice
after the beep.

295
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,819
I'm WBC's Na Bo-ra,
your host for Infinite Melodies.

296
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:38,987
Hello, everyone.

297
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:43,116
The Mushimcheon Cherry Blossom Festival
is said to start today.

298
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,911
How about a trip after school

299
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:49,331
to see the flowers at Musimcheon Stream?

300
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:14,898
Did you eat yet?

301
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:17,150
Let's eat together!

302
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:22,197
Have a girlfriend?

303
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:25,284
-No.
-How about an ideal type?

304
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:26,702
I don't know…

305
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:29,496
Shim Eun-ha?

306
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,710
So, the pure, innocent type?

307
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:36,545
That's perfect.

308
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:38,714
Favorite movie?

309
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:41,133
Armageddon.

310
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:44,803
Huh? That's my favorite too. Armageddon.

311
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:47,389
Desired college major?

312
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:52,644
-Theater and Film or Mass Communication.
-Theater and Film…

313
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:56,815
Planning to be a celebrity
with those good looks, huh?

314
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:01,236
No, it's because
I like working with cameras.

315
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:05,032
Likes to work with…

316
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:13,332
Hey! I wasn't asking about you!

317
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:15,625
I'm asking about Baek Hyun-jin!

318
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:18,128
Ugh, I need to start over.

319
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:21,965
Hey. Don't be lazy.
You should take some shots too.

320
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:23,967
Why should I?

321
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:27,512
You're in our club too.
You should know how to do this stuff.

322
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:32,100
Well, how do you do it?

323
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:34,936
Here.

324
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:37,731
Put your eye right here.

325
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:41,443
Your hand here.

326
00:22:44,988 --> 00:22:46,281
Use this to zoom in,

327
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:48,784
this to zoom out.

328
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:52,079
Oh, don't press too hard.

329
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:55,707
You see it?

330
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:02,547
Okay. I got it. You can go.

331
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:07,135
Don't break it.

332
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:47,050
-Wow.
-She's so fast!

333
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:48,760
She's so good.

334
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:56,351
Guys! There's a fight!
It's with the Paradise gang!

335
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:58,186
-Really?
-Let's go watch!

336
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:02,566
Hey, there's a fight. Let's go and watch.

337
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:04,526
Did you hit on my girl?

338
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:06,361
Come on, stop it!

339
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:08,572
You can stay out of this, Bok-soon.

340
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:12,951
You wouldn't have done that
if you knew who I am.

341
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:15,829
I'm Min Hong-gi,
the Fire Fist of Cheongju.

342
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:17,622
How dare you covet my girl.

343
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:19,332
You're dead meat today.

344
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:20,709
Damn it, seriously!

345
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:24,921
I'm the one who had a crush on him!
He rejected me and it's mortifying enough.

346
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:29,009
Bok-soon, I'm sorry.

347
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:30,594
But…

348
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:33,930
You shouldn't date this guy.

349
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:36,808
Date a better man.

350
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:38,435
Okay.

351
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:39,853
What did you just say?

352
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:42,439
Huh? That asshole…

353
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:43,482
Hey.

354
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:51,865
Who the hell was it?

355
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:53,617
-Get that bastard!
-Huh?

356
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:01,124
Run!

357
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:05,170
Get out of my way! Get them!

358
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:13,011
-Quick! Get them!
-Come here!

359
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,230
-Damn it.
-Come here!

360
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:25,315
-What? Why?
-The cops are there.

361
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:26,733
Sir, please get in the car.

362
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:29,152
All right, then. See you later.

363
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:31,321
Look, he's smiling.

364
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:35,242
Just ask that person over there.

365
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:37,035
-It wasn't me!
-My goodness.

366
00:25:37,118 --> 00:25:38,745
I did nothing wrong.

367
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:41,206
What did I do, huh?

368
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:46,878
Are you insane?

369
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:49,047
That guy is in Paradise.

370
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:51,633
Be careful.
You'll get killed at this rate!

371
00:25:53,593 --> 00:25:54,678
Are you all right?

372
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:22,998
Are you okay?

373
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:26,876
I had you learn taekwondo
so you could protect yourself.

374
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,713
But here you are,
getting into fights with guys.

375
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:31,881
Who'd fall for you like that?

376
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:34,676
There are lots of guys
who want to date me.

377
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:36,428
Whatever.

378
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:39,472
Anyway, when you get home,
don't say you got hurt fighting.

379
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:41,182
Your mother will worry.

380
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:42,934
You know she gets scared easily.

381
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:45,895
I wish all guys were like you, Dad.

382
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:51,568
I guess you have
a good eye for men. Goodness.

383
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:55,363
It was really humid yesterday.

384
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:58,074
Hey! You know
the new internet cafe nearby?

385
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:01,411
I heard the guy who works there
is super hot. Let's go see him!

386
00:27:01,494 --> 00:27:03,705
Leave me out.
I'm going to the broadcasting club.

387
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:05,290
-Huh?
-Just go with us.

388
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:07,584
No, go without me.
I only waited to say bye.

389
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:08,835
-Bye.
-Just take a look.

390
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:24,142
Na Bo-ra, hop on.

391
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:29,064
-Wow! Go!
-Hey, he wants you to get on.

392
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:30,815
-Go, come on.
-Why me?

393
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:37,197
Hey, where are you going?
You need to turn right.

394
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,199
I don't know how to turn right.

395
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:40,116
What?

396
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:44,871
You-- Where are we going? Make a U-turn!

397
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:48,041
-I don't know how to do that, either.
-What?

398
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:49,459
Hey!

399
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:52,253
How can you drive like that?

400
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:55,799
Sorry, I'm still learning.

401
00:27:57,509 --> 00:28:00,929
I borrowed it from a guy I know,
just so I could give you a ride.

402
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:05,058
Me? Why?

403
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:10,605
You got hurt because of me.

404
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:18,697
Why'd you do that?

405
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:20,782
Uh…

406
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:25,161
Because if you got hurt,
someone would be really sad.

407
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:26,663
Were you worried about me?

408
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:35,338
It looked like you'd get beaten to death.
Was I supposed to just let it happen?

409
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:40,885
Also, you shouldn't smile and be nice
to just anybody.

410
00:28:41,594 --> 00:28:43,388
Your friends will be annoyed.

411
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:48,476
-Are you asking me out?
-Huh?

412
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:53,690
What? Me? Asking out? Who?

413
00:28:56,860 --> 00:29:00,780
Cut the nonsense and take me back.
I need to go to the broadcasting room.

414
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:06,578
Fine.

415
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:08,413
Get on.

416
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:13,918
Huh?

417
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:19,674
It's not starting.

418
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:21,468
What?

419
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:25,138
-Hey!
-Wait, hey.

420
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:28,016
I can do it.

421
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:30,018
This isn't that hard.

422
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:43,072
Let's just go eat.

423
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:59,464
When did you get here, Poong Woon-ho?

424
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:00,590
A moment ago.

425
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:05,762
I'll wash my hands. Take a seat.

426
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:14,229
Did you wait for me?

427
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:16,022
Sorry.

428
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:35,375
Let's date.

429
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:40,213
Huh?

430
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:44,092
I like you.

431
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:51,683
Here, drink this.

432
00:30:57,814 --> 00:30:58,731
You like

433
00:30:59,732 --> 00:31:00,567
me?

434
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:01,651
Yeah.

435
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:02,652
Why?

436
00:31:02,735 --> 00:31:05,154
You can't like me! This isn't right.

437
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:10,368
Hey, I can eat two whole pizzas.
Can you handle that?

438
00:31:10,451 --> 00:31:12,996
Even now, I really want
to steal your food.

439
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:15,665
Just look at this. I can eat so much food.

440
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:22,630
That's good.

441
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:28,094
There's a pizza shop across the street
that my father owns too.

442
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:31,514
Really?

443
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:32,807
Yeah.

444
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:34,225
I rarely take showers.

445
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:36,936
See this? See how oily it is?

446
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:40,064
I haven't washed my hair in two days.
I also have tons of dandruff.

447
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:43,234
I'm a terrible student,
mark the third answer on math tests,

448
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:44,652
and have a nasty temper too.

449
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:47,113
My dad says he feels bad
for my future boyfriend.

450
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:48,823
And I…

451
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:53,077
I can even fart to children's songs!

452
00:31:58,833 --> 00:31:59,667
Sorry.

453
00:32:00,793 --> 00:32:02,045
I need to go.

454
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:42,835
What is this?

455
00:32:43,836 --> 00:32:44,921
It's about to blow!

456
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:34,679
I thought you had a crush on Hyun-jin.

457
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:37,515
I don't.

458
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:41,227
I'm just interested in him.

459
00:33:42,895 --> 00:33:44,439
Isn't that the same thing?

460
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:46,524
It's totally different.

461
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:48,568
Interest is just interest.

462
00:33:50,236 --> 00:33:51,571
And liking someone is…

463
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:58,161
Liking someone is?

464
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:06,377
It's done.

465
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:08,629
Try standing up.

466
00:34:17,346 --> 00:34:20,224
If you sprain your ankle once,
it's easy to sprain it again.

467
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:21,893
Next time, use your fists.

468
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:25,229
Bye.

469
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:34,280
Yeon-doo.

470
00:34:35,698 --> 00:34:38,367
I think my heart is acting
a bit weird too.

471
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:42,330
YEON-DOO, A LOT HAPPENED
OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS.

472
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:44,332
ACTUALLY… I THINK HYUN-JIN LIKES M--

473
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:47,043
BAEK HYUN-JIN IS A PLAYBOY.

474
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:52,548
ABOUT THAT GUY, POONG WOON-HO…

475
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:56,886
Never mind. I can take care of it.

476
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:01,599
Is it good now?

477
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,142
One, two…

478
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:08,773
Guys, don't crumple your faces like that.

479
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:10,108
All right, smile.

480
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:12,735
You with the messy hair!
Your hair's blocking the others.

481
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:15,863
Look at the people next to you.
Bend down a bit more, okay.

482
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:18,241
One, two, three…

483
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:20,034
means I'll take the picture.

484
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:26,374
This is mulberry extract.
It's what Gyeongju is known for.

485
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:29,585
It's great for chronic fatigue,
hypertension, cancer, dementia,

486
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:31,379
and even your heart.

487
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:33,631
It's the best gift for your parents.

488
00:35:33,714 --> 00:35:35,299
Hey, wait here. Okay?

489
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:39,679
-How much for one of these, sir?
-30,000 won.

490
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:41,722
Here's 20,000 won.

491
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:45,893
Please take this, sir. Just a second.

492
00:35:46,727 --> 00:35:48,688
-Do you have 3,000--
-Here you go, sir.

493
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:53,442
What?

494
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:58,322
You really are something else.

495
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:03,161
By the way, when we start dating,
will you let me hear you fart to songs?

496
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,706
Follow me!

497
00:36:07,206 --> 00:36:08,040
Hey…

498
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:13,462
Are you insane? How could you say that
in front of all those people?

499
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:18,050
1010235.

500
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:19,051
What?

501
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:21,345
You said you love me passionately.

502
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:23,598
Only my family and Woon-ho
know my pager number.

503
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:25,683
And you. Bora Video.

504
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:31,230
Ugh! I love you passionately?

505
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:35,735
I don't know what you're talking about,
so stop messing with me and just go.

506
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:36,777
Give me that!

507
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:41,741
You want me to just leave?
You're not going to date me?

508
00:36:44,243 --> 00:36:45,578
He's driving me nuts.

509
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,955
Hey, is something in your ears?

510
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:52,793
I would never date you
even if my life depended on it! Got it?

511
00:36:54,086 --> 00:36:55,254
I mean…

512
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:59,217
There's no need to be so intense.
You're scaring me.

513
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,010
You and I are…

514
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:04,513
You know, the same school…
What's it called?

515
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:09,185
Right, we're classmates. We can be
nothing more, nothing less, okay?

516
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:11,979
Fine, let's be classmates.

517
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,942
-Give me that.
-No.

518
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:17,735
Hey! That's mine.

519
00:37:17,818 --> 00:37:18,945
It's mine now.

520
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:21,530
Don't mess with me.
I have a huge dog at home!

521
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:25,201
-Dang it!
-You really have a huge dog?

522
00:37:25,284 --> 00:37:26,661
Yeah! It's me! So what?

523
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:30,331
Hey, classmate! Wait up!

524
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:34,168
I can hear all of you who are awake.

525
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:36,295
Okay?

526
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:44,178
Hey.

527
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:47,890
My goodness.

528
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:52,812
Couldn't they organize their shoes
before sleeping?

529
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:54,605
So messy. My goodness.

530
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:07,451
-Hey, he left.
-He's gone.

531
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:17,420
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

532
00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:22,800
-Ugh, it's bitter.
-It tastes awful.

533
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:26,345
Huh? Hey, should we try mixing that in?

534
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:28,514
-Sure!
-Hey, no!

535
00:38:28,597 --> 00:38:30,516
It's for Yeon-doo. For her heart health.

536
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:32,184
-Give it here.
-It's mulberry!

537
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:34,937
Okay, darn it. She'll never notice. Geez.

538
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:37,732
-We can add some water to it.
-But it's good for the heart…

539
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:49,994
It's good.

540
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:53,372
It tastes really good!

541
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:55,791
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

542
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:58,085
-Back smash!
-Back smash!

543
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:14,727
Ah, darn it.

544
00:39:15,394 --> 00:39:17,271
Stop it.

545
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:20,399
You've been sighing all night.

546
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:22,443
Do you guys even understand love?

547
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:25,112
Geez.

548
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:36,082
Are those punks out of their minds?

549
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:38,084
Hey, hold on.

550
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:40,419
Thanks for the drinks.

551
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:41,837
How dare they?

552
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:43,923
Hey, just wait.

553
00:39:44,423 --> 00:39:45,841
I'll take care of it.

554
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:49,678
Wait right there!

555
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:53,974
Open the door.

556
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:55,393
It's the room next door!

557
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:58,396
Dang it, go away. I said I got this.

558
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:02,441
Open up!

559
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:05,319
I got you!

560
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:13,327
Hey, the dean's coming!

561
00:40:17,456 --> 00:40:19,708
Who's up and making all this noise?

562
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:20,793
You brats!

563
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:24,672
Who's being so loud this late at night?

564
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:27,675
I can hear all of you who are awake!

565
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:29,093
I was very clear.

566
00:40:29,718 --> 00:40:31,512
I want you to go to bed early.

567
00:40:32,346 --> 00:40:33,556
Aren't you tired?

568
00:40:34,348 --> 00:40:36,350
We've been walking around all day.

569
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:41,105
Reflect calmly on what you did today
and go to sleep.

570
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:13,637
Are you

571
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:15,389
drunk?

572
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:37,077
What?

573
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:39,914
Would you like some honey water?

574
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:41,457
My goodness.

575
00:41:42,082 --> 00:41:44,126
Wake up and gather in the lobby!

576
00:41:48,797 --> 00:41:51,467
Oh dear.

577
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:54,637
Look at you.
You're some real model students, huh?

578
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,890
You stayed up all night
drinking on a school trip?

579
00:41:57,973 --> 00:42:02,102
I want all of you to pick up trash
and fill up your bags. Go!

580
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:04,396
There's some trash right there.

581
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:49,108
Hey, classmate.

582
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,778
So that's what it was?

583
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:54,697
What?

584
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,283
What do you mean?

585
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:02,705
Hey! Let's take pictures together!

586
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:07,251
A bit to the left.

587
00:43:09,878 --> 00:43:11,463
Get away from me.

588
00:43:12,047 --> 00:43:12,923
I don't want to.

589
00:43:14,174 --> 00:43:15,134
-What?
-Ugh!

590
00:43:15,634 --> 00:43:17,886
-Hey, smile.
-Don't tell me what to do.

591
00:43:18,887 --> 00:43:19,847
Look over there.

592
00:43:21,557 --> 00:43:23,392
One, two, three.

593
00:43:32,901 --> 00:43:36,113
I'm sending this so you can see it
right when you get out of surgery.

594
00:43:37,114 --> 00:43:41,035
And I have something to tell you
when you get back.

595
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:49,168
Summer vacation starts tomorrow.

596
00:43:49,668 --> 00:43:53,505
Have a great break.
I'll see you again in the second semester.

597
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:51,855
I start working there tomorrow.

598
00:44:55,818 --> 00:44:56,819
See you tomorrow.

599
00:45:12,751 --> 00:45:13,585
Enjoy.

600
00:45:25,431 --> 00:45:26,432
Oh, here you go.

601
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:28,726
Enjoy.

602
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,366
Hey, get your head in the game
if you want to eat ice cream.

603
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:47,411
Quickly, hurry, quickly.
Hey, are you leaving now?

604
00:45:47,911 --> 00:45:49,580
Yeah. Is this your brother?

605
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:53,167
Yeah. I've been playing
badminton with this kid lately.

606
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:54,585
Say hi. This is Ba-da.

607
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:56,462
Hello.

608
00:45:57,004 --> 00:45:58,464
-Hi.
-Come on.

609
00:46:02,342 --> 00:46:05,387
What are you doing there?
Aren't you coming inside?

610
00:46:06,054 --> 00:46:08,348
We're exercising.

611
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:11,685
You never exercise.
What's gotten into you? Come inside.

612
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:12,603
What's wrong?

613
00:46:12,686 --> 00:46:15,105
The kids are doing that
instead of coming inside.

614
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:16,565
You need to go to bed.

615
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:18,776
Hello, sir.

616
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:21,904
Oh, hi there. Are you Bo-ra's friend?

617
00:46:21,987 --> 00:46:23,197
Sure, go and play.

618
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,823
What do you mean, go and play?

619
00:46:24,907 --> 00:46:27,034
-Come inside. It's time for bed.
-Look at me.

620
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:28,160
Want a cucumber facial?

621
00:46:28,243 --> 00:46:30,287
-Come inside!
-I'll give you a real nice one.

622
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:32,873
-We don't have cucumbers!
-I bought some. Come on.

623
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:35,000
What cucumbers, all of a sudden!
Seriously.

624
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:45,302
Here, you can have mine.

625
00:46:45,385 --> 00:46:46,720
-Really?
-Yeah.

626
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:48,055
Yay!

627
00:46:49,389 --> 00:46:51,725
Visit me at the shop if you want more.

628
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:57,564
Hey.

629
00:46:58,398 --> 00:46:59,942
Stop eating and go inside.

630
00:47:09,284 --> 00:47:11,537
Thank you for the ice cream.

631
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:16,542
I'll get you more later.

632
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:20,337
Geez.

633
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:22,840
You should've let him eat more.

634
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:26,426
You don't have a younger sibling, do you?

635
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:28,387
You have no idea how annoying he is.

636
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:31,515
I do have one. A younger brother.

637
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:33,809
-Really?
-Yeah.

638
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:37,312
-How old is he?
-He's five now.

639
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:41,024
-He's just a baby, then.
-Yeah.

640
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:43,277
I'm curious. I want to see him.

641
00:47:44,736 --> 00:47:45,696
Me too.

642
00:47:50,576 --> 00:47:51,410
Do you

643
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:53,745
like plums?

644
00:47:58,667 --> 00:48:00,586
By the way, what is this place?

645
00:48:02,796 --> 00:48:04,381
I lived here when I was young.

646
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:05,883
Really?

647
00:48:06,383 --> 00:48:07,217
When?

648
00:48:08,927 --> 00:48:11,722
From when I was born
until I went to New Zealand.

649
00:48:12,764 --> 00:48:14,433
You've been to New Zealand?

650
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:15,809
Yeah.

651
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:21,189
When my parents got a divorce,
I came to Korea with my father.

652
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:24,776
My brother's still there with my mom.

653
00:48:26,361 --> 00:48:27,321
I see.

654
00:48:28,697 --> 00:48:29,781
You must miss him.

655
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:38,123
Wow.

656
00:48:40,375 --> 00:48:41,752
There really are plums.

657
00:48:41,835 --> 00:48:44,129
Hey, there are so many!

658
00:48:44,212 --> 00:48:46,632
I planted it with my dad when I was young.

659
00:48:46,715 --> 00:48:48,508
It flowers in the spring.

660
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:51,094
Flowers aren't tasty. Plums are the best.

661
00:49:02,147 --> 00:49:04,107
Hey, this is so good.

662
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:05,943
Try one.

663
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:16,453
Oh, I'm so full.

664
00:49:18,163 --> 00:49:18,997
Geez.

665
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:29,174
Well, you sure are lucky.

666
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:32,010
You're good at so many things,

667
00:49:32,094 --> 00:49:34,262
and you know exactly what you want to do.

668
00:49:36,098 --> 00:49:37,599
I don't have any of that.

669
00:49:39,601 --> 00:49:41,603
You're good at that one thing.

670
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:47,484
"Yes or No, beep."

671
00:49:47,567 --> 00:49:50,070
Hey! Stop teasing me again, seriously.

672
00:49:54,908 --> 00:49:56,493
Your voice is pretty.

673
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:18,140
What?

674
00:50:18,724 --> 00:50:20,892
It's just really nice.

675
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:35,699
Are you okay?

676
00:50:35,782 --> 00:50:37,617
That was you, wasn't it?

677
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:40,162
-I didn't do it.
-I know it was you!

678
00:50:42,956 --> 00:50:43,957
You all right?

679
00:50:59,514 --> 00:51:00,348
Here.

680
00:51:01,433 --> 00:51:02,267
Yeah.

681
00:51:08,148 --> 00:51:08,982
Um…

682
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:12,944
Do you want to see a movie
with me this weekend?

683
00:51:20,619 --> 00:51:24,247
If you don't want to, then whatever. Bye.

684
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:27,084
Bo-ra.

685
00:51:36,343 --> 00:51:37,677
See you this weekend.

686
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:39,596
Bye.

687
00:51:57,197 --> 00:51:59,950
Yeon-doo, remember what you said
a while ago?

688
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:03,703
That if you like someone,
then you can't sleep at night…

689
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:04,704
THIS IS A SECRET

690
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:08,500
…the food you eat becomes tasteless,
and listening to music makes you cry.

691
00:52:09,084 --> 00:52:11,378
Actually, I sleep fine at night,

692
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:14,214
and my food tastes even better than usual,

693
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:17,134
and I feel like dancing
when I listen to music.

694
00:52:17,217 --> 00:52:22,597
It's strange, though. When I think of him,
my heart hurts a bit.

695
00:52:23,557 --> 00:52:25,225
If this is love,

696
00:52:25,851 --> 00:52:28,687
then I think I'm in love.

697
00:52:29,646 --> 00:52:32,566
The person I like is…

698
00:52:50,208 --> 00:52:51,585
What's wrong with her?

699
00:53:04,806 --> 00:53:08,059
Mom! What's wrong with all my clothes?

700
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:10,478
You picked those out yourself.

701
00:53:11,771 --> 00:53:14,191
-Gosh, why is she…
-When did I do that?

702
00:53:14,274 --> 00:53:17,569
Why is she complaining about her clothes
all of a sudden? Gosh.

703
00:53:18,153 --> 00:53:19,154
Hey, classmate!

704
00:53:23,325 --> 00:53:26,453
Looks like you went shopping.
Going on a date or something?

705
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:30,290
Wow, are you really?

706
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,085
-What is it? Let me see.
-No, it's mine.

707
00:53:34,169 --> 00:53:35,629
-Come on, show me.
-I said no!

708
00:53:35,712 --> 00:53:36,546
Hello.

709
00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:39,257
-Let's go get some ice cream.
-Hey!

710
00:53:39,758 --> 00:53:41,343
Uh… Ice…

711
00:53:50,435 --> 00:53:51,478
Hey.

712
00:54:36,439 --> 00:54:37,649
Kim Yeon-doo?

713
00:54:37,732 --> 00:54:40,443
There you are, Bo-ra!

714
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:42,696
-Yeon-doo!
-Bo-ra!

715
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:43,613
Hey!

716
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:46,825
Yeon-doo.

717
00:54:49,452 --> 00:54:51,288
I missed you so much.

718
00:55:00,422 --> 00:55:03,591
This is my best friend,

719
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:06,553
Kim Yeon-doo.

720
00:55:07,178 --> 00:55:08,305
Say hi.

721
00:55:14,185 --> 00:55:15,020
Hi.

722
00:55:19,274 --> 00:55:21,776
Hey, it's so loud now!

723
00:55:22,736 --> 00:55:25,196
Right? I feel like I've been born again.

724
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:26,448
You did so well.

725
00:55:26,531 --> 00:55:28,575
Yeah. I missed you.

726
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:31,911
-By the way.
-Yeah.

727
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:34,831
I thought I might have a heart attack.

728
00:55:34,914 --> 00:55:37,709
I had no idea
I'd run into Hyun-jin so soon.

729
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:41,755
Jeez, how can an ice cream shop uniform
look so cool?

730
00:55:42,922 --> 00:55:44,090
-Uniform?
-Yeah.

731
00:55:45,133 --> 00:55:48,094
How long has he been working there?
Why didn't you tell me?

732
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:51,765
That was Poong Woon-ho.
Baek Hyun-jin was in a gray shirt.

733
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:54,225
No, he wasn't.
Hyun-jin was in the uniform.

734
00:55:54,893 --> 00:55:56,353
-What?
-Huh?

735
00:55:59,564 --> 00:56:00,398
Hold on.

736
00:56:03,276 --> 00:56:04,110
Look.

737
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:08,907
HYUN-JIN

738
00:56:34,432 --> 00:56:37,185
Everything is wrong.

739
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:41,731
Wait, then have you been researching
the wrong guy all this time?

740
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:45,985
Geez, hold on.

741
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:48,488
Woon-ho, Hyun-jin.

742
00:56:48,571 --> 00:56:50,323
Baek Hyun-jin, Poong Woon-ho.

743
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:51,241
HYUN-JIN

744
00:57:07,882 --> 00:57:09,843
I was just about to go to your house.

745
00:57:10,593 --> 00:57:15,265
It's going to take them a couple of days
to get my internet connection back up.

746
00:57:15,348 --> 00:57:19,060
By the way, the more I think about it,
the funnier it gets.

747
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:22,981
What have we been doing all this time?

748
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:27,402
I'm so glad Baek Hyun-jin
is Woon-ho's best friend. If he wasn't…

749
00:57:27,485 --> 00:57:28,528
Yeon-doo.

750
00:57:31,739 --> 00:57:33,199
I have something to tell you.

751
00:57:33,783 --> 00:57:34,784
Something to tell me?

752
00:57:37,162 --> 00:57:37,996
What is it?

753
00:57:57,515 --> 00:57:59,267
HYUN-JIN OBSERVATION NOTES

754
00:57:59,350 --> 00:58:00,685
THIS IS A SECRET - UNREAD

755
00:58:08,401 --> 00:58:10,570
THIS IS A SECRET

756
00:58:10,653 --> 00:58:12,322
DELETE

757
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:17,535
DELETE

758
00:58:32,592 --> 00:58:33,426
Woon-ho!

759
00:58:41,059 --> 00:58:42,393
You must be surprised.

760
00:58:42,477 --> 00:58:46,731
Bo-ra had something urgent but no way
to reach you. So I'm here instead.

761
00:58:48,024 --> 00:58:49,400
What happened?

762
00:58:49,943 --> 00:58:55,573
I think Madam's father got injured,
so she asked Bo-ra to help on the farm.

763
00:58:56,699 --> 00:58:58,910
You know Bo-ra's a really loyal friend.

764
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:01,371
Uh…

765
00:59:01,996 --> 00:59:04,374
Thanks for what you did that time.

766
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:07,085
I thought I would never see you again,

767
00:59:09,629 --> 00:59:11,965
but it's so good to see you again.

768
00:59:17,053 --> 00:59:19,305
Is this "something fun," you fraud?

769
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:21,224
Shut up and pick the grapes.

770
00:59:21,307 --> 00:59:24,102
If you don't, I'll tell everyone
I rejected you.

771
00:59:32,026 --> 00:59:32,860
Hey.

772
00:59:37,699 --> 00:59:39,826
I had feelings for you,

773
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:42,078
but it doesn't mean
you can treat me like crap.

774
00:59:42,161 --> 00:59:44,956
You have no idea
what a noble family I'm from--

775
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:50,587
Hey, you didn't even wash these grapes!

776
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:14,861
You're hiding something from me,
aren't you?

777
01:00:18,156 --> 01:00:18,990
Hiding what?

778
01:00:19,782 --> 01:00:23,995
What's going on with you
and Baek Hyun-jin? It's suspicious.

779
01:00:25,204 --> 01:00:28,291
What if we end up going on
double dates later?

780
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:31,169
It's not like that.

781
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:36,883
By the way, is Woon-ho usually that sweet?

782
01:00:38,176 --> 01:00:40,011
He paid attention when I spoke,

783
01:00:40,762 --> 01:00:41,929
paid for our meal,

784
01:00:43,389 --> 01:00:45,141
and smiled at me too!

785
01:00:49,771 --> 01:00:51,105
I hope I'm not dreaming.

786
01:00:53,107 --> 01:00:54,817
-He did that?
-Yeah.

787
01:00:57,070 --> 01:00:59,697
Hey, what's Woon-ho like?

788
01:01:05,995 --> 01:01:09,082
I don't know. Not really…

789
01:01:09,165 --> 01:01:12,669
Hey, that's cold.
Aren't you both in the broadcasting club?

790
01:01:12,752 --> 01:01:15,505
You should pay more attention
to your friend.

791
01:01:15,588 --> 01:01:17,882
You promised to help me
get with him. Come on.

792
01:01:17,965 --> 01:01:19,467
Try to remember.

793
01:01:20,551 --> 01:01:21,636
What does he like?

794
01:01:23,262 --> 01:01:24,681
I don't know…

795
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:28,518
Hold on.

796
01:01:42,573 --> 01:01:45,702
You have one message. Press one to play.

797
01:01:49,247 --> 01:01:51,582
It's me, Poong Woon-ho. Give me a call.

798
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:54,544
Who is it?

799
01:01:57,839 --> 01:01:59,841
I think they got the wrong number.

800
01:02:01,134 --> 01:02:02,468
Okay. Come back in.

801
01:02:28,327 --> 01:02:29,454
Hello.

802
01:02:33,624 --> 01:02:34,959
It's me, Bo-ra.

803
01:02:37,712 --> 01:02:39,172
What took you so long?

804
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:41,799
I've been paging you for a while.

805
01:02:43,634 --> 01:02:45,470
Oh, well…

806
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:50,016
What phone number is this, by the way?

807
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:55,563
Are you on a pay phone right now?

808
01:02:57,940 --> 01:02:58,775
Huh?

809
01:02:59,984 --> 01:03:01,402
In front of your house?

810
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:03,404
Yeah.

811
01:03:04,864 --> 01:03:05,698
Why?

812
01:03:06,991 --> 01:03:08,618
Start counting to ten now.

813
01:03:09,744 --> 01:03:11,621
-To ten?
-Yeah.

814
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:14,665
All of a sudden?

815
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:16,334
Come on.

816
01:03:18,044 --> 01:03:20,755
One, two, three, four.

817
01:03:20,838 --> 01:03:22,632
That's too fast. Slow down.

818
01:03:26,677 --> 01:03:27,553
Five.

819
01:03:29,597 --> 01:03:30,431
Six.

820
01:03:33,142 --> 01:03:34,268
Seven.

821
01:03:36,312 --> 01:03:37,146
Eight.

822
01:03:39,398 --> 01:03:40,233
Nine.

823
01:03:53,412 --> 01:03:54,247
Ten.

824
01:04:11,430 --> 01:04:13,015
Call that number from now on.

825
01:04:13,641 --> 01:04:16,060
Don't make your friend
do all the hard work.

826
01:04:16,561 --> 01:04:18,020
She's your best friend.

827
01:04:25,027 --> 01:04:29,949
Hey, I heard you've been beating up boys
with your kicks ever since you were a kid.

828
01:04:30,575 --> 01:04:32,994
Have you preferred kicking over punching
since then?

829
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:37,081
I guess it's a good thing
I got to know you later on, then.

830
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:39,709
Woon-ho.

831
01:04:42,753 --> 01:04:44,797
I didn't show up today on purpose.

832
01:04:49,552 --> 01:04:50,386
Huh?

833
01:04:53,514 --> 01:04:54,348
I'm sorry.

834
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:58,227
I think I've made a mistake.

835
01:05:00,813 --> 01:05:03,107
I never thought of you like that.

836
01:05:04,775 --> 01:05:06,694
I'm sorry if you misunderstood.

837
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:19,081
Na Bo-ra.

838
01:05:21,459 --> 01:05:22,919
I'm leaving now.

839
01:05:56,202 --> 01:05:57,036
TO. NA BO-RA

840
01:05:57,119 --> 01:05:58,120
It's me, Woon-ho.

841
01:05:58,704 --> 01:06:01,707
I don't think I can tell you face-to-face,
so I'm writing instead.

842
01:06:04,251 --> 01:06:06,420
I saw you for the first time this winter.

843
01:06:07,296 --> 01:06:09,715
I met you as soon as
I arrived in Cheongju.

844
01:06:10,841 --> 01:06:13,052
You probably don't remember, though.

845
01:06:38,786 --> 01:06:41,205
THE LOVE AFFAIR

846
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:45,835
Thank you!

847
01:06:49,130 --> 01:06:50,840
Bo-ra. What's wrong? You…

848
01:06:50,923 --> 01:06:52,800
-It's nothing!
-What happened?

849
01:06:52,883 --> 01:06:56,429
You ran away so quickly.
It made me curious about the movie.

850
01:06:58,389 --> 01:06:59,640
When I first came to Korea…

851
01:06:59,724 --> 01:07:00,975
I'M ON A BUSINESS TRIP

852
01:07:01,058 --> 01:07:03,561
…I rarely had any reason to smile.

853
01:07:03,644 --> 01:07:04,687
Hey, it fits perfectly.

854
01:07:04,770 --> 01:07:05,604
BAEK HYUN-JIN

855
01:07:05,688 --> 01:07:08,065
Just wear mine
until we graduate middle school.

856
01:07:08,566 --> 01:07:11,402
-Hey. Try this on.
-Thanks.

857
01:07:15,531 --> 01:07:18,576
Mister, I need to get on!

858
01:07:18,659 --> 01:07:21,203
Then I met you again.

859
01:07:22,371 --> 01:07:24,832
Mister, there's a girl
who needs to get on!

860
01:07:28,961 --> 01:07:30,838
-Your unpredictable behavior…
-Why?

861
01:07:31,338 --> 01:07:33,257
…suddenly kept catching my attention.

862
01:07:34,550 --> 01:07:38,179
Here's our tae kwon do girl.
Were you smashing boards until now?

863
01:07:38,262 --> 01:07:40,848
You're so good at tae kwon do.
Which belt do you have?

864
01:07:40,931 --> 01:07:41,766
-Me?
-Yeah.

865
01:07:41,849 --> 01:07:43,559
I don't have a belt today.

866
01:07:43,642 --> 01:07:44,727
Not that.

867
01:07:44,810 --> 01:07:46,771
-And I realized…
-It's understandable.

868
01:07:46,854 --> 01:07:49,440
…I was smiling whenever I looked at you.

869
01:07:49,523 --> 01:07:51,609
"Time Like a Lie" by Toy.

870
01:07:51,692 --> 01:07:54,195
Thank you for responding to our survey.

871
01:07:54,278 --> 01:07:57,823
Once you hear the beep,
please state your pager number.

872
01:07:57,907 --> 01:07:58,991
Beep.

873
01:07:59,075 --> 01:08:00,076
Na Bo-ra?

874
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:04,955
Who is it?

875
01:08:06,332 --> 01:08:07,416
Nobody.

876
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:11,545
But you were always interested
in Hyun-jin only.

877
01:08:13,255 --> 01:08:14,381
So I was jealous,

878
01:08:16,425 --> 01:08:18,094
and I sometimes felt hurt.

879
01:08:21,639 --> 01:08:24,892
I have no idea
if you knew about how I felt.

880
01:08:25,476 --> 01:08:27,686
Your eyes are pretty,

881
01:08:29,188 --> 01:08:30,773
your nose is pretty,

882
01:08:31,899 --> 01:08:33,692
and your lips are pretty too.

883
01:08:38,489 --> 01:08:39,698
This is bad.

884
01:08:41,909 --> 01:08:43,202
I think I like you.

885
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:56,590
You said something so major,

886
01:08:58,801 --> 01:09:00,469
but you forgot all about it

887
01:09:01,887 --> 01:09:03,347
like it never happened.

888
01:09:05,641 --> 01:09:07,184
Were you talking to me?

889
01:09:07,726 --> 01:09:10,354
-What?
-Or did you mistake me for Hyun-jin?

890
01:09:11,355 --> 01:09:13,566
I wanted to ask you so many times…

891
01:09:13,649 --> 01:09:16,485
-Hey, Poong Woon-ho!
-…but I couldn't bring myself to do it.

892
01:09:16,569 --> 01:09:17,403
What?

893
01:09:18,863 --> 01:09:21,198
-What are you doing?
-I didn't want to get hurt.

894
01:09:22,241 --> 01:09:23,284
Try one.

895
01:09:23,868 --> 01:09:25,786
Now, I finally know how you feel.

896
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:30,457
But I have to go back to New Zealand soon.

897
01:09:31,292 --> 01:09:32,877
TO NA BO-RA

898
01:09:34,211 --> 01:09:35,963
I promise to return, though.

899
01:09:38,299 --> 01:09:40,593
I like you, Na Bo-ra.

900
01:10:10,497 --> 01:10:11,540
Woon-ho!

901
01:10:18,672 --> 01:10:20,674
-How have you been?
-Good.

902
01:10:21,258 --> 01:10:24,595
-What did you do over break?
-I worked and stuff.

903
01:10:24,678 --> 01:10:25,679
Hey, classmate.

904
01:10:25,763 --> 01:10:27,806
-Let's go to the school shop later.
-Sure.

905
01:10:29,391 --> 01:10:30,309
LETTER TO THE 21ST CENTURY

906
01:10:30,392 --> 01:10:31,894
Each pair should focus on their videos.

907
01:10:31,977 --> 01:10:33,479
Good job today.

908
01:10:33,562 --> 01:10:35,898
-Dismissed.
-Thank you, sir.

909
01:10:43,322 --> 01:10:45,866
If you're uncomfortable,
I'll ask for another partner.

910
01:10:47,201 --> 01:10:48,661
Don't worry about it.

911
01:10:55,668 --> 01:10:59,797
It's a shame, but the world
might end in the 21st century.

912
01:11:01,131 --> 01:11:03,801
Nostradamus's prophecies
have never been wrong.

913
01:11:03,884 --> 01:11:06,428
What? So I can't go
to those blind dates in college?

914
01:11:06,512 --> 01:11:08,681
Hey! Are you going to college
for blind dates?

915
01:11:08,764 --> 01:11:09,848
Yeah!

916
01:11:09,932 --> 01:11:11,183
-"Yeah"?
-Yeah.

917
01:11:11,267 --> 01:11:12,351
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

918
01:11:12,434 --> 01:11:13,269
Hey.

919
01:11:15,729 --> 01:11:17,648
Can't you just do the interview?

920
01:11:28,117 --> 01:11:29,118
Good job.

921
01:11:34,832 --> 01:11:36,292
Are you guys done now?

922
01:11:37,293 --> 01:11:39,586
-Yeah. We just need to edit it.
-Oh.

923
01:11:40,087 --> 01:11:44,300
But our school's editing machine
is really old, so I'm a bit worried.

924
01:11:46,260 --> 01:11:49,430
Oh, I know someone
at the Seoul Broadcasting Station.

925
01:11:50,139 --> 01:11:50,973
Should I ask?

926
01:11:54,476 --> 01:11:55,352
Go ahead, sir.

927
01:11:56,186 --> 01:11:57,021
Go ahead.

928
01:12:00,274 --> 01:12:01,734
Oh, hey.

929
01:12:03,819 --> 01:12:05,654
What are you doing here?

930
01:12:05,738 --> 01:12:08,032
I know Seoul like the back of my hand.

931
01:12:16,665 --> 01:12:20,544
So, you can change those two cuts
with the button.

932
01:12:20,627 --> 01:12:24,798
And to dissolve it, you lower this bar
really gently like that.

933
01:12:26,717 --> 01:12:27,593
Wow.

934
01:12:27,676 --> 01:12:32,306
Dissolving overlaps the shots,
so a gentler touch is more effective.

935
01:12:36,393 --> 01:12:38,187
I'm going to ask Woon-ho out today.

936
01:12:39,355 --> 01:12:40,481
-Today?
-Yeah.

937
01:12:42,024 --> 01:12:45,110
Ta-da! My uncle gave me these.
Tickets to Seoul Land.

938
01:12:45,694 --> 01:12:48,113
When we're there,
help me be alone with Woon-ho.

939
01:12:50,741 --> 01:12:52,534
-Sure. Drink this.
-Yeah.

940
01:12:57,998 --> 01:12:58,874
Come here.

941
01:12:58,957 --> 01:13:00,292
-Why?
-Just come here.

942
01:13:00,376 --> 01:13:02,127
Stand closer to each other. One, two…

943
01:13:10,177 --> 01:13:12,012
Hey, let's ride something else.

944
01:13:12,096 --> 01:13:14,848
-Why? I want to ride this one.
-Come on, quickly.

945
01:13:14,932 --> 01:13:16,934
-Hey!
-Come on. Let's go, Yeon-doo.

946
01:13:17,017 --> 01:13:19,728
-What's the matter?
-That one's no fun.

947
01:13:19,812 --> 01:13:21,271
It'll be fun!

948
01:13:22,356 --> 01:13:23,357
This is so fun!

949
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:24,483
Isn't it fun?

950
01:13:25,150 --> 01:13:25,984
Look.

951
01:13:28,195 --> 01:13:29,822
Have you ever ridden this, Woon-ho?

952
01:13:29,905 --> 01:13:31,073
It's my first time too.

953
01:13:32,366 --> 01:13:33,367
It's so fun.

954
01:13:35,911 --> 01:13:37,788
Wow! Giddy-up!

955
01:13:38,664 --> 01:13:39,998
Hey, stop it!

956
01:13:40,082 --> 01:13:40,916
Why?

957
01:13:41,917 --> 01:13:43,752
Yeon-doo. One, two.

958
01:13:50,384 --> 01:13:51,427
FAINT-HEARTED, BEWARE

959
01:13:54,721 --> 01:13:56,807
Yeon-doo, let's go on another ride.

960
01:13:57,307 --> 01:13:58,225
Hey, come here.

961
01:13:58,934 --> 01:13:59,768
I'm coming.

962
01:14:01,603 --> 01:14:04,440
-Which one should we ride?
-Sorry. I'm such an inconvenience.

963
01:14:04,523 --> 01:14:06,984
No, it's okay. Why is it because of you?

964
01:14:07,067 --> 01:14:10,070
Guys, ride the ones you want.
I'll just watch.

965
01:14:10,154 --> 01:14:13,615
Should we do that, then?
Who wants to go on a roller coaster?

966
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:15,534
-Hey!
-What?

967
01:14:16,577 --> 01:14:18,078
Don't you have any tact?

968
01:14:18,787 --> 01:14:23,876
Bo-ra, go with him. You really wanted
to ride a roller coaster, right?

969
01:14:23,959 --> 01:14:25,252
I'll wait here.

970
01:14:29,047 --> 01:14:30,757
Oh, should we do that, then?

971
01:14:32,050 --> 01:14:34,303
Hey, let's go ride a roller coaster.

972
01:14:35,012 --> 01:14:37,973
You two can sit here and rest, then.
Let's go.

973
01:14:38,557 --> 01:14:40,893
What's wrong with you?
You keep changing your mind.

974
01:14:40,976 --> 01:14:43,103
-So you don't want to go?
-Yay!

975
01:14:45,522 --> 01:14:46,732
Should we sit here?

976
01:14:47,566 --> 01:14:48,400
Sure.

977
01:14:56,867 --> 01:15:00,496
Should we go look around there?

978
01:15:01,205 --> 01:15:02,289
Yeon-doo.

979
01:15:03,499 --> 01:15:04,333
I'm sorry,

980
01:15:05,918 --> 01:15:07,836
but I want to ride the roller coaster too.

981
01:15:10,464 --> 01:15:12,424
That looks so fun. Doesn't it?

982
01:15:12,925 --> 01:15:13,759
Yeah.

983
01:15:22,059 --> 01:15:23,227
Let me ride this.

984
01:15:27,814 --> 01:15:28,815
Passing through.

985
01:15:32,486 --> 01:15:33,529
Why are you back?

986
01:15:33,612 --> 01:15:36,198
Woon-ho said he wanted to talk with Bo-ra.

987
01:15:39,660 --> 01:15:41,036
But will he be okay?

988
01:15:41,828 --> 01:15:42,955
What do you mean?

989
01:15:43,038 --> 01:15:46,166
Woon-ho has a fear of heights.

990
01:15:47,209 --> 01:15:48,043
What?

991
01:15:50,837 --> 01:15:52,798
Then why…

992
01:15:54,341 --> 01:15:56,969
Well, those two like each other.

993
01:16:14,861 --> 01:16:16,196
What's wrong?

994
01:16:19,950 --> 01:16:20,784
I…

995
01:16:22,077 --> 01:16:23,412
I'm afraid of heights.

996
01:16:24,454 --> 01:16:25,289
What?

997
01:16:30,877 --> 01:16:32,337
Then why did you get on?

998
01:16:34,673 --> 01:16:37,301
I wanted to be with you.

999
01:16:50,772 --> 01:16:53,859
Na Bo-ra! I like you!

1000
01:17:28,435 --> 01:17:31,188
I'll go get some water or something.

1001
01:17:35,442 --> 01:17:36,276
Na Bo-ra.

1002
01:17:45,744 --> 01:17:47,704
I wanted to tell you before I left.

1003
01:17:48,538 --> 01:17:49,665
You're leaving?

1004
01:17:50,248 --> 01:17:52,918
I'm going back to New Zealand soon.

1005
01:17:59,424 --> 01:18:00,425
That's great.

1006
01:18:10,644 --> 01:18:11,478
Do you…

1007
01:18:17,943 --> 01:18:19,069
really think so?

1008
01:18:22,531 --> 01:18:25,617
You said you miss your brother.

1009
01:18:29,955 --> 01:18:31,081
Since I'm leaving…

1010
01:18:35,502 --> 01:18:38,255
I thought you'd be sad.
Well, that's a relief.

1011
01:18:42,676 --> 01:18:44,010
Thanks for everything…

1012
01:18:46,638 --> 01:18:47,472
Na Bo-ra.

1013
01:19:07,242 --> 01:19:10,412
You must be tired after today.
Aren't you hungry?

1014
01:19:11,413 --> 01:19:13,999
When we get home, should we…

1015
01:19:17,335 --> 01:19:19,671
What's wrong? Does it hurt somewhere?

1016
01:19:22,758 --> 01:19:25,093
-Don't you have anything to say to me?
-What?

1017
01:19:26,803 --> 01:19:28,472
You like Poong Woon-ho, don't you?

1018
01:19:32,017 --> 01:19:33,059
Don't you?

1019
01:19:36,730 --> 01:19:38,190
Why didn't you tell me?

1020
01:19:39,357 --> 01:19:41,109
It was before you came back.

1021
01:19:42,235 --> 01:19:43,069
Just…

1022
01:19:44,237 --> 01:19:45,071
a little bit…

1023
01:19:47,032 --> 01:19:48,742
I don't like him anymore, Yeon-doo.

1024
01:19:51,203 --> 01:19:52,913
How do I know you're not lying?

1025
01:19:55,332 --> 01:19:57,209
You've been lying to me all this time!

1026
01:19:58,794 --> 01:20:00,504
Why would you say that?

1027
01:20:01,213 --> 01:20:03,298
I didn't do it on purpose.

1028
01:20:04,633 --> 01:20:06,384
-It was all for you--
-For me?

1029
01:20:12,098 --> 01:20:14,142
You're really shameless, Na Bo-ra.

1030
01:20:16,895 --> 01:20:19,648
You made me look so stupid,
and you're saying it was for me?

1031
01:20:20,148 --> 01:20:22,609
You weren't just doing it
to make yourself feel better?

1032
01:20:24,319 --> 01:20:25,153
Yeon-doo.

1033
01:20:27,656 --> 01:20:29,783
What else was I supposed to do?

1034
01:20:30,283 --> 01:20:33,578
I know how hard it was for you
when you went to America.

1035
01:20:33,662 --> 01:20:35,288
I know how you felt.

1036
01:20:35,956 --> 01:20:40,293
I know how much you liked him
and how much you wanted to see him.

1037
01:20:40,377 --> 01:20:43,088
So how could I tell you
something like that?

1038
01:20:43,171 --> 01:20:45,590
I didn't want my stupid feelings,

1039
01:20:45,674 --> 01:20:47,884
and some guy, to ruin our friendship--

1040
01:20:47,968 --> 01:20:49,594
You're the one…

1041
01:20:51,888 --> 01:20:54,182
who caused all this because of some guy.

1042
01:21:00,730 --> 01:21:01,565
Seriously…

1043
01:21:07,070 --> 01:21:08,989
I really like Poong Woon-ho.

1044
01:21:09,698 --> 01:21:12,200
But if he gets in the way
of our friendship,

1045
01:21:12,993 --> 01:21:15,579
I can let go of him
a hundred or even a thousand times.

1046
01:21:17,497 --> 01:21:19,499
I care the most about you, too.

1047
01:21:22,544 --> 01:21:25,839
I know you always try
to look after me because I'm ill.

1048
01:21:26,339 --> 01:21:30,677
But I'm your friend, not some patient
that you need to take care of.

1049
01:22:01,791 --> 01:22:02,667
Yes, Dad.

1050
01:22:03,668 --> 01:22:06,546
I'm going to be late again.

1051
01:22:09,758 --> 01:22:11,968
Have you finished packing?

1052
01:22:16,181 --> 01:22:17,015
Not yet.

1053
01:22:18,183 --> 01:22:19,684
You're leaving next week,

1054
01:22:20,727 --> 01:22:22,312
so you should pack in advance.

1055
01:22:24,230 --> 01:22:25,065
Dad.

1056
01:22:26,816 --> 01:22:28,443
Are you sure you won't regret it?

1057
01:22:30,236 --> 01:22:33,365
Listen to your mother
when you're in New Zealand,

1058
01:22:34,366 --> 01:22:35,867
and take care of your brother.

1059
01:22:36,868 --> 01:22:37,702
I'm sorry.

1060
01:22:43,041 --> 01:22:44,209
I'm sorry, Bo-ra.

1061
01:22:44,292 --> 01:22:48,088
I think Yeon-doo's a bit tired.
She doesn't want to pick up the phone.

1062
01:22:48,713 --> 01:22:50,924
Did you guys have an argument?

1063
01:22:51,007 --> 01:22:54,344
Oh, it's not that. I'll call back later.

1064
01:22:55,095 --> 01:22:55,929
Sure.

1065
01:23:10,819 --> 01:23:12,445
HYUN-JIN OBSERVATION NOTES

1066
01:23:20,829 --> 01:23:22,163
TRASH (1)

1067
01:23:22,247 --> 01:23:24,582
THIS IS A SECRET

1068
01:23:28,420 --> 01:23:31,923
The guy I like is…

1069
01:23:33,508 --> 01:23:34,718
Poong Woon-ho.

1070
01:23:36,511 --> 01:23:40,974
P.S. I'm glad you're the first person
I'm talking to about my feelings.

1071
01:23:41,850 --> 01:23:45,186
Maybe friendship and love
aren't so different after all.

1072
01:23:47,022 --> 01:23:52,068
Never forget that you're always number one
in my heart, Yeon-doo.

1073
01:24:01,995 --> 01:24:02,829
Woon-ho.

1074
01:24:14,340 --> 01:24:16,342
I really liked you.

1075
01:24:17,761 --> 01:24:18,636
Yeon-doo.

1076
01:24:21,431 --> 01:24:23,391
And it isn't really fitting
to say this now,

1077
01:24:25,643 --> 01:24:28,354
but Bo-ra really likes you too.

1078
01:24:29,898 --> 01:24:31,941
What do you mean?

1079
01:24:32,025 --> 01:24:35,403
Bo-ra lied about everything because of me.

1080
01:24:37,238 --> 01:24:38,615
That's how she is.

1081
01:24:40,325 --> 01:24:42,410
She can eat two whole pizzas
all by herself,

1082
01:24:42,494 --> 01:24:44,746
but she only has two slices
when she's with me.

1083
01:24:46,081 --> 01:24:48,666
If I tell her to eat more,
she says she's full.

1084
01:24:48,750 --> 01:24:50,877
But her eyes are still glued to the pizza.

1085
01:24:52,504 --> 01:24:54,089
And she actually likes Fin.K.L.

1086
01:24:55,465 --> 01:24:58,176
but pretends to be an S.E.S fan
in front of me.

1087
01:25:00,845 --> 01:25:03,640
She couldn't tell me
since I'm a huge S.E.S fan.

1088
01:25:04,390 --> 01:25:05,433
Oh, there's more.

1089
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:13,108
I fainted at a picnic
because a frog startled me,

1090
01:25:16,027 --> 01:25:19,697
and Bo-ra ran all the way down
Wooam Mountain with me on her back.

1091
01:25:25,578 --> 01:25:27,330
She was only 12 back then.

1092
01:25:30,250 --> 01:25:33,670
Even if she was strong,
I'm sure I was also really heavy.

1093
01:25:37,590 --> 01:25:39,134
But she said she was fine.

1094
01:25:42,887 --> 01:25:44,556
There's no way she was fine.

1095
01:25:49,227 --> 01:25:50,687
Isn't she such an idiot?

1096
01:26:25,471 --> 01:26:27,932
-Ba-da!
-One, two.

1097
01:26:28,683 --> 01:26:30,143
Ba-da, no!

1098
01:26:31,352 --> 01:26:32,187
Mom.

1099
01:26:33,438 --> 01:26:34,814
Slowly.

1100
01:26:37,066 --> 01:26:39,068
-Honey, my Ba-da!
-Don't rush, okay?

1101
01:26:39,861 --> 01:26:41,487
-Mom, come here.
-Watch the door.

1102
01:26:52,457 --> 01:26:53,333
Ba-da.

1103
01:27:05,595 --> 01:27:06,429
Na Bo-ra!

1104
01:27:10,016 --> 01:27:11,017
It's me, Woon-ho.

1105
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:13,645
I leave tomorrow.

1106
01:27:15,230 --> 01:27:16,731
I have something for you.

1107
01:27:19,984 --> 01:27:21,694
I'll wait in front of your house.

1108
01:27:21,778 --> 01:27:25,865
It isn't too serious. He can be discharged
after being monitored for a day.

1109
01:27:25,949 --> 01:27:28,576
-Really? So is everything okay, sir?
-My goodness.

1110
01:27:28,660 --> 01:27:30,411
Yes, everything is fine.

1111
01:27:30,495 --> 01:27:31,996
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1112
01:27:51,808 --> 01:27:55,019
You should go home and get some sleep.
Mom and I can stay here.

1113
01:27:56,020 --> 01:28:00,108
No. What if he feels hurt
because I'm not there when he wakes up?

1114
01:28:00,608 --> 01:28:03,319
Geez, you two fight tooth and nail
all the time.

1115
01:28:04,279 --> 01:28:06,155
You're his older sister after all.

1116
01:28:44,444 --> 01:28:46,070
-Hey, hurry up.
-I'm so sleepy.

1117
01:28:46,154 --> 01:28:47,196
Come on!

1118
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:48,948
Let's go.

1119
01:28:50,742 --> 01:28:51,617
Na Bo-ra.

1120
01:28:52,785 --> 01:28:54,287
-Hey,
-Is Ba-da okay?

1121
01:28:54,871 --> 01:28:56,456
-Did you eat?
-You think?

1122
01:28:56,539 --> 01:28:58,499
We bought some snacks.
Let's give her those.

1123
01:28:58,583 --> 01:28:59,625
Yeah, okay.

1124
01:29:13,514 --> 01:29:14,724
-What was that?
-Oh no!

1125
01:29:14,807 --> 01:29:16,434
-Oh dear.
-Yeon-doo!

1126
01:29:17,018 --> 01:29:18,728
Yeon-doo!

1127
01:29:18,811 --> 01:29:20,980
Yeon-doo! Here, hold her for me.

1128
01:29:21,689 --> 01:29:22,690
Hurry. You got her?

1129
01:29:24,817 --> 01:29:25,943
Yeon-doo.

1130
01:29:26,027 --> 01:29:28,571
Wake up, Yeon-doo!

1131
01:29:30,323 --> 01:29:31,991
Hang in there, Yeon-doo.

1132
01:29:35,286 --> 01:29:36,496
Na Bo-ra, you idiot.

1133
01:29:37,955 --> 01:29:39,540
Let me down. I'm fine.

1134
01:29:43,795 --> 01:29:45,755
Are you okay, Yeon-doo?

1135
01:29:45,838 --> 01:29:47,799
I nearly died trying to act.

1136
01:29:48,591 --> 01:29:50,426
Did you forget I had heart surgery?

1137
01:29:52,887 --> 01:29:56,015
What? Why did you do that?

1138
01:29:57,892 --> 01:29:59,477
Will you just let him go like this?

1139
01:30:05,358 --> 01:30:06,901
Hyun-jin is waiting outside.

1140
01:30:09,195 --> 01:30:10,947
I'm fine. Go already.

1141
01:30:27,088 --> 01:30:30,425
I really should be the main character,
but I'm just a driver, huh?

1142
01:30:31,259 --> 01:30:33,219
Consider this a huge honor.

1143
01:30:38,015 --> 01:30:38,850
Hop on.

1144
01:31:06,836 --> 01:31:07,753
Thanks.

1145
01:31:21,017 --> 01:31:22,268
Woon-ho!

1146
01:31:23,478 --> 01:31:26,522
The Mugunghwa-ho train to Seoul
will arrive soon.

1147
01:31:44,415 --> 01:31:47,585
Passengers boarding
the Mugunghwa-ho train to Seoul

1148
01:31:47,668 --> 01:31:50,004
may do so on platform four.

1149
01:31:53,090 --> 01:31:54,509
Poong Woon-ho!

1150
01:32:17,114 --> 01:32:18,282
I'm sorry.

1151
01:32:19,742 --> 01:32:20,826
For what?

1152
01:32:22,870 --> 01:32:28,084
I'm sorry for not showing up
when I asked you to see the movie.

1153
01:32:28,167 --> 01:32:31,045
I always did something else
while you were shooting,

1154
01:32:32,338 --> 01:32:35,216
and I ate too many plums. I'm sorry.

1155
01:32:36,884 --> 01:32:39,220
When you said you were leaving,

1156
01:32:40,179 --> 01:32:43,140
I was actually really sad.

1157
01:32:43,933 --> 01:32:47,520
But I pretended I was fine.
I'm sorry for that too, Woon-ho.

1158
01:32:50,356 --> 01:32:53,109
That wasn't how I really felt.

1159
01:32:53,901 --> 01:32:58,322
But I said I didn't like you,

1160
01:32:58,406 --> 01:33:00,324
which was also a lie.

1161
01:33:01,951 --> 01:33:03,411
I'm sorry.

1162
01:33:13,838 --> 01:33:15,464
Why are you laughing?

1163
01:33:16,257 --> 01:33:18,259
What's there to be so sorry about?

1164
01:33:19,343 --> 01:33:21,262
You can just say you like me.

1165
01:33:23,180 --> 01:33:27,268
How can I say something like that here?
That's embarrassing.

1166
01:33:27,351 --> 01:33:29,186
We're in a public place…

1167
01:33:30,980 --> 01:33:32,064
I was happy

1168
01:33:34,859 --> 01:33:36,944
every moment that I spent with you.

1169
01:33:39,238 --> 01:33:40,698
I like you, Na Bo-ra.

1170
01:33:44,577 --> 01:33:45,411
Me too.

1171
01:33:48,623 --> 01:33:49,457
What?

1172
01:33:50,416 --> 01:33:51,459
I can't hear you!

1173
01:33:54,712 --> 01:33:56,464
I like you!

1174
01:33:57,173 --> 01:33:58,799
I like you too!

1175
01:33:59,425 --> 01:34:01,344
I really like you!

1176
01:34:25,451 --> 01:34:28,871
Wait for me just a bit.
I'll come back soon. I promise.

1177
01:34:34,335 --> 01:34:36,796
Hey, I need to go.

1178
01:34:37,922 --> 01:34:38,923
Don't cry.

1179
01:34:40,299 --> 01:34:41,133
Okay?

1180
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:42,486
And just like that, we said goodbye.

1181
01:35:54,415 --> 01:35:55,958
LETTER TO THE 21ST CENTURY

1182
01:35:56,041 --> 01:35:58,753
Let us begin the 27th Wooam Festival!

1183
01:35:58,836 --> 01:36:00,796
LETTER TO THE 21ST CENTURY

1184
01:36:26,947 --> 01:36:27,948
It's me, Woon-ho.

1185
01:36:28,532 --> 01:36:30,868
Living here is pretty fun.

1186
01:36:31,744 --> 01:36:34,246
I usually spend a lot of time
with my brother.

1187
01:36:34,747 --> 01:36:38,125
If the world doesn't end
on New Year's Day in 2000,

1188
01:36:38,209 --> 01:36:40,377
then I'll write you an email first thing.

1189
01:36:40,461 --> 01:36:41,504
You buy it, classmate.

1190
01:36:41,587 --> 01:36:43,964
-P.S. How are Hyun-jin and Yeon-doo?
-No way.

1191
01:36:46,509 --> 01:36:47,927
-One Demisoda--
-One Demisoda--

1192
01:36:48,010 --> 01:36:48,844
What flavor?

1193
01:36:48,928 --> 01:36:50,054
-Orange--
-Orange--

1194
01:36:50,554 --> 01:36:53,474
Don't even get me started.
You should see these two.

1195
01:36:53,557 --> 01:36:55,267
-Do you hear the audience?
-Ten, nine…

1196
01:36:55,351 --> 01:36:57,311
-They're counting down.
-…eight.

1197
01:36:57,394 --> 01:37:00,272
-Seven, six, five.
-Seven, six, five.

1198
01:37:01,190 --> 01:37:04,777
-Four, three, two, one.
-Four, three, two, one.

1199
01:37:04,860 --> 01:37:09,323
It's the first day of the year 2000,
marking the start of a new millennium.

1200
01:37:09,406 --> 01:37:11,033
The world didn't end.

1201
01:37:11,534 --> 01:37:13,536
New Year's Day was four hours ago here.

1202
01:37:14,036 --> 01:37:15,538
Welcome to the year 2000.

1203
01:37:17,748 --> 01:37:20,459
Just like you said,
the plum tree is flowering.

1204
01:37:21,377 --> 01:37:23,587
Still, plums are better than flowers.

1205
01:37:24,088 --> 01:37:25,297
S.A.T. - D-169

1206
01:37:25,381 --> 01:37:26,298
MY GOAL IS SEOUL!

1207
01:37:26,382 --> 01:37:28,425
I'm applying to the Department
of Mass Communication in Seoul.

1208
01:37:28,509 --> 01:37:30,678
I hope we can go
to the same school next year.

1209
01:37:34,473 --> 01:37:35,516
CONGRATULATIONS ON PASSING…

1210
01:37:35,599 --> 01:37:37,101
Hey, you got in!

1211
01:37:38,269 --> 01:37:40,354
Bo-ra got in!

1212
01:37:40,437 --> 01:37:41,272
Really?

1213
01:37:42,898 --> 01:37:43,816
She really did!

1214
01:37:43,899 --> 01:37:45,860
-What is it?
-Honey, Bo-ra got in!

1215
01:37:45,943 --> 01:37:46,861
She did?

1216
01:37:48,028 --> 01:37:50,447
REFRESH

1217
01:37:50,531 --> 01:37:53,367
CHECK INBOX - UNREAD - PUNGWH2000

1218
01:37:54,910 --> 01:37:59,582
Nothing happened to you, right?
I'll be waiting for your response.

1219
01:38:14,179 --> 01:38:16,390
I can't answer the phone right now.

1220
01:38:16,473 --> 01:38:19,184
Please leave me a message
if you need anything.

1221
01:38:34,700 --> 01:38:36,118
I kept waiting,

1222
01:38:37,870 --> 01:38:40,539
but I never heard from Woon-ho again.

1223
01:38:42,207 --> 01:38:44,543
-Did you pack the first aid kit?
-I did!

1224
01:38:44,627 --> 01:38:45,669
And the digestive aids?

1225
01:38:45,753 --> 01:38:48,213
-Which bag did you put them in?
-I put them under here.

1226
01:38:48,297 --> 01:38:50,257
-Wait.
-You just saw me put them there.

1227
01:38:50,341 --> 01:38:52,885
-I'm leaving now!
-Okay, go.

1228
01:38:54,178 --> 01:38:55,846
-Go inside.
-Bye.

1229
01:38:55,930 --> 01:38:57,348
After I see you off.

1230
01:38:58,098 --> 01:38:59,934
-Just go.
-Go on, leave.

1231
01:39:00,017 --> 01:39:01,477
-Go.
-Ugh, seriously.

1232
01:39:02,019 --> 01:39:03,270
Go! Geez.

1233
01:39:06,440 --> 01:39:07,733
-Go.
-Go back inside.

1234
01:39:07,816 --> 01:39:10,069
-Call us when you're there.
-Okay.

1235
01:39:15,532 --> 01:39:16,700
-Bo-ra.
-Bo-ra.

1236
01:39:17,201 --> 01:39:18,410
Na Bo-ra!

1237
01:39:18,494 --> 01:39:19,536
Are you done?

1238
01:39:19,620 --> 01:39:21,205
-Yeah, we're done.
-Let's go.

1239
01:39:21,288 --> 01:39:23,165
-Did you wait a while?
-Are you hungry?

1240
01:39:23,248 --> 01:39:25,334
-What do you want?
-I'm craving Western food.

1241
01:39:25,417 --> 01:39:27,127
-Western?
-How about pasta, then?

1242
01:39:27,211 --> 01:39:28,170
-Pasta?
-Sure.

1243
01:39:28,253 --> 01:39:30,422
A really good pasta place
just opened nearby.

1244
01:39:30,506 --> 01:39:33,050
-When?
-The wait there is really long.

1245
01:39:33,133 --> 01:39:35,010
-Let's hurry.
-Yes.

1246
01:39:35,094 --> 01:39:38,764
First could you tell us
your grade and major, please?

1247
01:39:38,847 --> 01:39:43,727
Hello. I'm Bang U-ri. I'm a biology major,
and I'm a senior this year.

1248
01:39:43,811 --> 01:39:45,562
-Bo-ra.
-Please introduce your major…

1249
01:39:45,646 --> 01:39:47,064
Hurry, there isn't much time.

1250
01:39:47,147 --> 01:39:48,273
-…to the freshmen.
-Okay.

1251
01:39:48,357 --> 01:39:50,317
-What's one good thing about it?
-Let's go.

1252
01:39:50,401 --> 01:39:54,613
And I gradually stopped
thinking about Woon-ho in my daily life.

1253
01:39:55,781 --> 01:39:57,449
Take this one seriously.

1254
01:39:57,533 --> 01:40:00,369
Don't turn him down
if he wants to see you again. Okay?

1255
01:40:00,452 --> 01:40:02,538
Okay. I'll call you later.

1256
01:40:10,379 --> 01:40:11,422
Hello.

1257
01:40:11,505 --> 01:40:12,381
Hello.

1258
01:40:12,965 --> 01:40:15,592
-You're here for the blind date, right?
-Yes.

1259
01:40:16,135 --> 01:40:17,761
I'm sorry, I'm a bit late.

1260
01:40:18,554 --> 01:40:19,430
It's okay.

1261
01:40:24,059 --> 01:40:24,893
Oh…

1262
01:40:25,644 --> 01:40:28,480
I'm Na Bo-ra. I started college in 2002.

1263
01:40:29,857 --> 01:40:32,693
Bo-ra. That's a pretty name.

1264
01:40:34,862 --> 01:40:39,575
I'm Woon-ho. Jung Woon-ho.

1265
01:40:45,622 --> 01:40:46,457
Oh…

1266
01:40:47,541 --> 01:40:49,418
This is a bit awkward, right?

1267
01:40:50,085 --> 01:40:52,004
This is my first time on a blind date too.

1268
01:40:52,087 --> 01:40:56,008
My friend kept telling me to go,
so I did, but I didn't know such a pretty…

1269
01:41:01,972 --> 01:41:03,223
Ms. Na.

1270
01:41:18,238 --> 01:41:19,239
Ms. Na.

1271
01:41:25,329 --> 01:41:28,832
I'm sorry. I didn't do anything.

1272
01:41:28,916 --> 01:41:29,792
I'm sorry.

1273
01:41:32,127 --> 01:41:34,797
Ms. Na, please stop crying.

1274
01:41:35,339 --> 01:41:38,008
Water, have some water.

1275
01:41:58,654 --> 01:42:00,906
I'm really going to forget you now.

1276
01:42:01,949 --> 01:42:03,408
I'm not waiting anymore.

1277
01:42:03,951 --> 01:42:06,203
I'm just going to consider you dead.

1278
01:42:07,871 --> 01:42:10,499
Even if you come to me later
saying you missed me,

1279
01:42:10,582 --> 01:42:12,668
I'm never going to date you!

1280
01:42:13,335 --> 01:42:15,087
I don't miss you either!

1281
01:42:18,215 --> 01:42:21,051
Have a great life, you bastard!

1282
01:42:51,832 --> 01:42:52,791
Mom.

1283
01:42:55,627 --> 01:42:56,545
Dad?

1284
01:43:09,808 --> 01:43:13,061
AERIAL VIEW OF RECONSTRUCTION

1285
01:45:26,778 --> 01:45:30,699
THE ETERNAL SPRING
REMEMBERING POONG WOON-HO (1983-2001)

1286
01:45:42,461 --> 01:45:46,548
While moving, I found a package
that Woon-ho had hidden away.

1287
01:45:47,257 --> 01:45:50,177
It was more than 15 years after he died.

1288
01:45:53,805 --> 01:45:56,975
At first, I wondered why he had hidden
a videotape like that.

1289
01:45:57,559 --> 01:45:59,644
But it wasn't just any videotape.

1290
01:46:00,187 --> 01:46:02,272
I felt like I had to send it,

1291
01:46:03,315 --> 01:46:06,860
so I went ahead and contacted you,
and even arranged this exhibition.

1292
01:46:07,986 --> 01:46:11,865
I'm sorry if I made you uncomfortable.

1293
01:46:12,866 --> 01:46:15,535
Not at all. Thank you for inviting me.

1294
01:46:17,579 --> 01:46:18,997
If it weren't for you,

1295
01:46:21,041 --> 01:46:22,417
I might've resented him

1296
01:46:24,461 --> 01:46:26,046
for the rest of my life.

1297
01:46:28,757 --> 01:46:31,676
I actually really hated you, Noona.

1298
01:46:34,054 --> 01:46:37,766
I thought Woon-ho would go back to Korea
because of you.

1299
01:46:40,727 --> 01:46:44,689
But while preparing this exhibition,
I kept following his gaze.

1300
01:46:47,317 --> 01:46:48,819
And in the end,

1301
01:46:51,113 --> 01:46:52,447
I always found you.

1302
01:46:54,032 --> 01:46:56,118
I could feel his love for you

1303
01:46:57,411 --> 01:46:58,870
very vividly.

1304
01:47:00,122 --> 01:47:02,249
So I really wanted to relay…

1305
01:47:04,501 --> 01:47:06,461
my brother's feelings to you.

1306
01:47:09,923 --> 01:47:11,842
Actually, I learned through this

1307
01:47:12,926 --> 01:47:15,887
that the happiest moments
in Woon-ho's short life

1308
01:47:16,805 --> 01:47:18,598
were when he was with you.

1309
01:47:21,810 --> 01:47:22,811
Thank you

1310
01:47:24,604 --> 01:47:27,023
for giving him those happy memories

1311
01:47:27,607 --> 01:47:29,067
and for remembering him.

1312
01:47:31,695 --> 01:47:32,988
How could I ever…

1313
01:47:37,159 --> 01:47:38,535
forget Woon-ho?

1314
01:48:00,140 --> 01:48:00,974
My goodness.

1315
01:48:02,058 --> 01:48:03,894
What fate these guys have, huh?

1316
01:48:03,977 --> 01:48:06,730
Way back then,
everyone was so eager to watch them.

1317
01:48:07,814 --> 01:48:11,067
You used to sneak off with porn
in the past, remember?

1318
01:48:11,151 --> 01:48:12,486
Huh? When did I do that?

1319
01:48:12,569 --> 01:48:15,947
You think I didn't see you taking them
whenever your friends came?

1320
01:48:16,031 --> 01:48:18,033
-I just let it slide.
-What? That's not true.

1321
01:48:18,116 --> 01:48:19,826
Come on, I knew all about it.

1322
01:48:20,410 --> 01:48:23,121
Why does Mom like that new house so much?

1323
01:48:23,205 --> 01:48:24,623
Just let her be.

1324
01:48:25,290 --> 01:48:28,460
When we first came here,
I promised your mother

1325
01:48:28,543 --> 01:48:31,379
that I would make lots of money
and move to a nice house.

1326
01:48:34,633 --> 01:48:36,384
We lived here for such a long time.

1327
01:48:41,348 --> 01:48:42,682
Hey, just leave those.

1328
01:48:43,225 --> 01:48:44,059
Why?

1329
01:48:44,142 --> 01:48:46,645
Your mom and I watched those movies
when we were dating.

1330
01:48:47,145 --> 01:48:48,980
Those will be hard to come by later on.

1331
01:48:49,064 --> 01:48:51,149
Do you still love Mom that much?

1332
01:48:54,027 --> 01:48:57,405
I wish all the guys in the world
were just like you.

1333
01:48:58,198 --> 01:49:00,408
You really have a good eye for men.

1334
01:49:01,284 --> 01:49:02,118
Let's go.

1335
01:49:07,207 --> 01:49:08,542
-Dad.
-Yeah.

1336
01:49:10,085 --> 01:49:12,170
Do we have any VHS players left?

1337
01:49:24,933 --> 01:49:27,435
CAMCORDER SOURCES
JANUARY 1999, RECORDED BY WOON-HO

1338
01:49:30,105 --> 01:49:31,022
CAMCORDER SOURCES

1339
01:49:43,285 --> 01:49:49,499
Are you all right?
How are you doing these days?

1340
01:49:49,583 --> 01:49:52,127
Are you crying again

1341
01:49:52,210 --> 01:49:57,257
Because I'm not there?

1342
01:49:57,757 --> 01:50:01,386
You used to chat with me

1343
01:50:01,469 --> 01:50:03,263
But I don't see you anymore

1344
01:50:03,346 --> 01:50:04,681
-Ugh.
-Nowadays…

1345
01:50:06,891 --> 01:50:09,352
Come on, Woo-jung and I want to try too.

1346
01:50:30,081 --> 01:50:31,750
It's so pretty.

1347
01:50:44,804 --> 01:50:46,973
If you get the chance, just once…

1348
01:50:47,891 --> 01:50:48,975
Ugh.

1349
01:51:04,783 --> 01:51:05,784
Na Bo-ra!

1350
01:51:09,579 --> 01:51:10,664
Hey.

1351
01:51:12,916 --> 01:51:14,459
Come here, waves!

1352
01:51:15,835 --> 01:51:17,170
Stop that!

1353
01:51:18,088 --> 01:51:20,006
Hey! Are you teasing me again?

1354
01:51:21,549 --> 01:51:22,550
-Darn it.
-Oh.

1355
01:51:33,561 --> 01:51:36,106
I love you, students of Wooam High.

1356
01:51:36,690 --> 01:51:40,944
Let's all become people who do their best
in each of our respective places.

1357
01:51:41,027 --> 01:51:42,112
What's with this hair?

1358
01:51:42,195 --> 01:51:44,531
What? You always yell at me about my hair.

1359
01:51:45,240 --> 01:51:46,199
Go back to class!

1360
01:51:46,282 --> 01:51:49,661
Even if the world ends,
we don't all have to die.

1361
01:51:49,744 --> 01:51:52,455
Make sure you get a hot boyfriend.

1362
01:51:52,539 --> 01:51:54,290
You're still handsome, aren't you?

1363
01:51:55,500 --> 01:51:56,459
I knew it.

1364
01:51:56,960 --> 01:51:59,462
I wonder if I'm dating my first love.

1365
01:52:01,589 --> 01:52:05,343
I hope my parents are healthy,

1366
01:52:06,094 --> 01:52:08,221
and I hope Ba-da listens to me more.

1367
01:52:08,847 --> 01:52:09,764
And…

1368
01:52:11,391 --> 01:52:14,561
I hope Yeon-doo is healthier.

1369
01:52:15,353 --> 01:52:18,940
I hope Darn It and Madam
don't cuss and nag as much.

1370
01:52:20,233 --> 01:52:21,067
And…

1371
01:52:26,114 --> 01:52:27,782
In the 21st century,

1372
01:52:29,492 --> 01:52:32,203
I hope I'm a more honest person.

1373
01:52:39,252 --> 01:52:40,086
Joseph.

1374
01:52:42,839 --> 01:52:43,840
Hey, Joseph.

1375
01:52:46,134 --> 01:52:49,471
Come on, Poong Joon-ho.
Listen to your older brother.

1376
01:52:49,554 --> 01:52:51,639
Why are you messing around so much?

1377
01:52:52,932 --> 01:52:55,310
No, don't go.

1378
01:52:55,852 --> 01:52:57,562
Don't leave me for Na Bo-ra!

1379
01:52:58,188 --> 01:53:01,107
Bo-ra's older than you.
You should call her Noona.

1380
01:53:01,941 --> 01:53:04,486
You're going back to Korea.

1381
01:53:05,195 --> 01:53:07,280
I'll visit you often, okay?

1382
01:53:09,449 --> 01:53:11,451
I'll get you a Game Pak every time I come.

1383
01:53:11,534 --> 01:53:13,787
-Really?
-Yeah. You like that?

1384
01:53:16,289 --> 01:53:17,749
Okay.

1385
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:19,834
Now,

1386
01:53:21,377 --> 01:53:22,504
look at the camera.

1387
01:53:23,588 --> 01:53:26,466
Bo-ra Noona, hi.

1388
01:53:26,549 --> 01:53:28,218
"Hi"? It's New Year's Day.

1389
01:53:29,177 --> 01:53:30,929
"Happy new year."

1390
01:53:31,012 --> 01:53:32,305
Say it in Korean.

1391
01:53:32,889 --> 01:53:35,809
"Bo-ra Noona, have a happy new year."

1392
01:53:36,309 --> 01:53:38,269
-Got it?
-I got it.

1393
01:53:38,353 --> 01:53:39,229
Okay.

1394
01:53:39,312 --> 01:53:41,397
Okay, let's put that smile back on.

1395
01:53:41,898 --> 01:53:44,859
Have a happy new year, Bo-ra Noona.

1396
01:53:45,902 --> 01:53:47,237
Well done.

1397
01:53:47,320 --> 01:53:48,613
You know?

1398
01:53:48,696 --> 01:53:51,449
The girl who works with Woon-ho
is really pretty. But--

1399
01:53:51,533 --> 01:53:52,367
Hey.

1400
01:53:53,576 --> 01:53:54,744
I'm not wrong!

1401
01:53:56,621 --> 01:53:58,540
You don't need to mind that.

1402
01:54:06,965 --> 01:54:07,924
Hold on.

1403
01:54:09,133 --> 01:54:10,093
If I do this…

1404
01:54:16,975 --> 01:54:17,976
Do you see that?

1405
01:54:19,143 --> 01:54:21,145
It's the 21st century now.

1406
01:54:22,188 --> 01:54:24,482
I woke up at four in the morning
to show you this.

1407
01:54:26,442 --> 01:54:28,653
It's 2:00 in Korea right now.

1408
01:54:31,489 --> 01:54:33,157
So you're probably asleep.

1409
01:54:34,826 --> 01:54:37,537
Wait just a bit longer.
I'll go see you soon.

1410
01:54:44,085 --> 01:54:45,169
I want to see you,

1411
01:54:48,548 --> 01:54:50,216
