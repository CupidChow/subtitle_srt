1
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,330
Huatao said

2
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,130
becoming a police officer was
his childhood dream.

3
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:05,980
And your dream was

4
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,180
to be an astronaut.

5
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,050
May your dream come true.

6
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:09,020
[Episode 17]

7
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:15,380
There are multiple impact

8
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:17,170
injuries on the body's surface

9
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,610
and several rib fractures.

10
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,850
His femoral artery appears

11
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:22,980
to have been severed.

12
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:25,660
There are also multiple stab wounds

13
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,100
on the legs and abdomen.

14
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,980
The face and fingertips

15
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,370
are pale,

16
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,410
indicating he died from
excessive blood loss.

17
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:35,980
Additionally,

18
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:37,490
there's a small amount of

19
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:38,980
human tissue under his fingernails.

20
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:40,460
The specific cause

21
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:41,780
of death requires

22
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:42,900
further autopsy.

23
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,220
Mr. Han,

24
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,780
we found a memory card.

25
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:57,700
Mr. Qi, Mr. Han,

26
00:04:58,510 --> 00:04:59,900
our preliminary judgment on the cause of

27
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,540
death is a gunshot

28
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,810
wound from the back of the head,

29
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:02,850
which traversed the brain,

30
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,220
and caused instant death.

31
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:05,370
The victim's neck

32
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:06,340
shows dark red livor mortis.

33
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,730
Time of death is preliminarily

34
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:08,810
assessed at three hours ago.

35
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:12,100
Judging by the scene,

36
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:14,900
the likely scenario is that the
perpetrator stabbed Wan,

37
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,490
and Wan shot and killed him

38
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:17,980
just before he died.

39
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,020
When the femoral artery

40
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,290
is severed,

41
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:25,220
one loses a massive volume
of blood in a short time.

42
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,050
Also,

43
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,170
withdrawing the blade

44
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:29,100
can cause a spray pattern of blood.

45
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:30,930
But inside the car,

46
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,290
neither the driver's

47
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:33,290
nor passenger's seat

48
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,220
has such a volume of blood.

49
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:36,980
Normally,

50
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,020
when one loses too much
blood in a short time,

51
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,900
they'll lose lucidity.

52
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,810
That man

53
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:44,220
was nearly

54
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:45,730
ten meters away from Wan

55
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,490
and moving rapidly.

56
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,290
Under such circumstances,

57
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:50,290
the probability

58
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,930
of Wan achieving a precise headshot

59
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:53,220
is extremely low.

60
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,140
Ms. Zhu!

61
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,020
Why did you go up there?

62
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,100
If something happened to you,

63
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,050
how would I face Huatao?

64
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:44,700
Huatao specifically asked me

65
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,700
to take good care of you

66
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,660
when he passed away.

67
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:48,780
And now

68
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,610
you won't even listen

69
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:50,050
to me?

70
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,100
May your dream come true.

71
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,540
So that means,

72
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,490
apart from

73
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:21,730
the two victims,

74
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:24,900
we have practically no leads.

75
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:26,610
You've been a detective
for a while, right?

76
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,050
We detectives need to base our words

77
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,220
and actions on evidence.

78
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:30,610
Be more discreet with your words, okay?

79
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,980
Well, Ms. Zhu

80
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:32,490
insisted I

81
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:33,490
go on this mission with you.

82
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:34,850
Nothing to complain about.

83
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:41,490
Get to work.

84
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,610
Get to work!

85
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:46,340
Gao Yuan!

86
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:47,890
Ms. Zhu.

87
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:51,890
Samples taken?

88
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:52,490
Yes.

89
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:55,980
Why are you looking at me?

90
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,770
Get to work!

91
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:58,340
Get to work!

92
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,370
Zhu!

93
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:33,770
Zhu, I'll be right back.

94
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,130
I have a surprise for you.

95
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:49,820
Mr. Han,

96
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:50,850
Mr. Qi,

97
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,100
we found

98
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,300
a scalpel on Wan.

99
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:56,820
(Hello, Mr. Han.)

100
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:57,730
Xiaoxi,

101
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,770
check if Wan visited

102
00:09:58,790 --> 00:09:59,530
the First People's

103
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:00,530
Hospital a few hours ago.

104
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:01,460
(On it.)

105
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,250
Go check if the deceased was from

106
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:05,300
the First People's Hospital.

107
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:05,940
Got it.

108
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,340
Mr. Qi,

109
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:09,940
no suspicious bloodstains

110
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,700
in other locations.

111
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,010
That's strange.

112
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,010
An adult weighing

113
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:16,180
around 85 kg

114
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,490
should have a blood volume

115
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,060
of about 5 to 6 liters.

116
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,730
For someone of Wan's build,

117
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,460
it might be even higher.

118
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:23,850
But

119
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,460
judging by the body's blood loss,

120
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,770
the blood at the scene

121
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,460
is less than half that amount.

122
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:30,610
So this isn't

123
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,580
the primary crime scene?

124
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:34,770
Then where is the primary scene?

125
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:36,770
Logically,

126
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,980
after apprehending someone,

127
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,300
Wan should have informed us immediately

128
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:40,340
or headed straight back.

129
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:42,730
It only takes 20 minutes to drive from

130
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:44,010
the hospital to the station.

131
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:45,580
Why would he take a detour?

132
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,370
Unless something happened

133
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,530
that made Wan change his plans.

134
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:53,820
Xiaoxi.

135
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:54,980
(Mr. Han,)

136
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:56,700
I found Wan's car.

137
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:57,730
It was spotted at the

138
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,060
First People's Hospital four hours ago.

139
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:00,180
Trace

140
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,340
Wan's movements.

141
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:02,180
On it.

142
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:10,370
Mr. Han,

143
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:11,770
I've located a suspicious

144
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,010
spot where Wan stopped.

145
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:14,980
Found the possible

146
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,940
primary crime scene.

147
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,180
You stay and investigate.

148
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:18,100
Let's go.

149
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:49,940
This should be

150
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,890
the primary crime scene.

151
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,890
So Wan was transported

152
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:53,980
to the secondary scene

153
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,460
only after he had bled out here.

154
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:58,820
Mr. Han,

155
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,700
a tire found here!

156
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:07,370
Mr. Han,

157
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,250
over here.

158
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:34,700
Hello, Gao Yuan.

159
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:35,650
Mr. Qi,

160
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:36,980
through Luminol testing,

161
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:38,130
we discovered a large amount

162
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:39,370
of bloodstains in the back seat.

163
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,820
Okay, understood.

164
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:10,530
You can take a few days off

165
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:11,420
if you want.

166
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:13,420
Just leave

167
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,770
Wan's case to us.

168
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,220
The entire precinct's resources

169
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,220
are on it.

170
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,530
I'm fine.

171
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:25,060
I'll continue following Wan's case.

172
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,490
Everyone, let's focus.

173
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:00,610
Wan wouldn't want

174
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:01,340
to see us like this.

175
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:02,180
Let's discuss.

176
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,850
We found multiple stab wounds

177
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,420
and impact injuries

178
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:11,650
on Wan's body.

179
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,220
Also, his three ribs

180
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:14,890
were fractured.

181
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:17,490
His wounds

182
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:18,580
include abdominal stab wounds,

183
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:19,650
but these

184
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:20,460
weren't fatal.

185
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,100
The fatal injury was caused

186
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:23,340
by the severing of

187
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,220
the femoral artery;

188
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,340
then he bled out to death.

189
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:26,850
Wound comparison confirms

190
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,060
it was caused by the scalpel

191
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,250
found at the scene.

192
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:30,250
Furthermore,

193
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:31,580
we found gunshot residue

194
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,940
on Wan's hands

195
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:34,530
and some dander tissue

196
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,220
under his fingernails.

197
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,130
DNA results are

198
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:38,130
still being compared.

199
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:39,940
As for the other victim's

200
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,650
cause of death,

201
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,770
it was a gunshot to the back of

202
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:42,890
the head that traversed the brain.

203
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:44,300
Technical comparison confirms

204
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,340
the bullet was fired

205
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,250
from Wan's gun.

206
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:47,890
The deceased is named Cui Hao,

207
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,980
a doctor at the First People's Hospital

208
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,300
primarily responsible
for drug supervision

209
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,420
and inventory management.

210
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,650
While investigating Cui Hao,

211
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,340
we learned Wan was also looking

212
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,300
into the inventory

213
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,890
of drugs like ether and cedilanid

214
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:00,770
at that hospital.

215
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:02,580
He found Cui Hao was a key suspect,

216
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,300
so he brought him in for questioning.

217
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,370
Isn't cedilanid the drug

218
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:07,730
that caused Li Yiqi's death?

219
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,770
Do you remember

220
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:11,650
during Wang Chen's autopsy,

221
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,060
a lot of ether was

222
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:13,820
found in his system?

223
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,490
So, Cui Hao is connected to the suspect

224
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:17,130
from the hospital.

225
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:21,730
Look at this,

226
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,580
this drug bottle

227
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,850
was found at Cui Hao's home.

228
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:26,820
This drug's

229
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,180
composition is very similar

230
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,490
to the one that Li Shuting,

231
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:30,370
Xiao Lin, and Song had.

232
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:32,060
All contain antidepressant components.

233
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:34,010
That means Cui Hao had

234
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:35,370
some kind of transaction

235
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,460
with the hospital suspect.

236
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,700
What else?

237
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,130
The person who killed

238
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:41,300
Cui Hao might not be Wan.

239
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,580
There might have been

240
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,650
a third person at the scene.

241
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,770
A large amount of wiped blood

242
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:46,530
residue was found

243
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:48,060
in the vehicle at the secondary scene.

244
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:49,340
Also, a large amount

245
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,820
of blood was found at the primary scene.

246
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,010
All this blood

247
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,820
belongs solely to Wan.

248
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:54,940
Therefore,

249
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:56,180
Wan was likely already

250
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:58,220
unconscious or dead

251
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,490
from massive blood loss before

252
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,130
reaching the secondary scene.

253
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,370
He was then moved to the secondary scene

254
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:06,100
by the real killer and Cui Hao.

255
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,610
After positioning Wan,

256
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,580
the killer chose to kill Cui Hao

257
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,730
so that his identity
wouldn't be exposed.

258
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,700
After the murder,

259
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,340
he staged the scene to create

260
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,100
the illusion that Wan killed Cui Hao.

261
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,730
We found puncture marks

262
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:28,650
on a tire at

263
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,850
the secondary crime scene.

264
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,530
That explains why

265
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:32,610
Wan stopped midway.

266
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:34,940
Judging from the braking marks

267
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,610
and Wan's injuries,

268
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:37,700
it can be inferred that

269
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,850
an accident occurred on his way

270
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:40,940
back to the station

271
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:41,940
with Cui Hao.

272
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,340
At that moment,

273
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:46,100
a third person arrived at the scene.

274
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,290
Xiaoxi,

275
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,940
keep checking the hospital

276
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:20,290
footage for new leads.

277
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:21,460
- Okay.
- Ms. Zhu,

278
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,380
we're here for you.

279
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:55,250
Give me the gun!

280
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,530
Go!

281
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:01,420
Get out of here!

282
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:04,140
Go!

283
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:08,380
Come on in.

284
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:10,900
Everyone,

285
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:11,900
attention.

286
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,810
Let's all welcome

287
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:15,490
our new colleague,

288
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,660
Ms. Zhu Qingyue!

289
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:49,090
Zhu?

290
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,220
Tell Ms. Zhu

291
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,700
I'm going out for a bit.

292
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:16,900
Mr. Qi,

293
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:19,380
here's Chen Chuchuan's clinic

294
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,010
patient list.

295
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:21,900
Here are his prescribed drugs.

296
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:24,530
I'll test them now.

297
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:25,140
Okay.

298
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:36,770
Mr. Qi,

299
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:38,810
four of these are

300
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,980
related to the new drug.

301
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,490
(All were for depression.)

302
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:56,570
Ms. Zhu,

303
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,660
I found the suspect

304
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,730
with the tattoo on his neck.

305
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,140
He was at the hospital then,

306
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,140
constantly watching Wan and Cui Hao.

307
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:04,700
He's the one who tampered

308
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,460
with Wan's car.

309
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:11,980
Don't move!

310
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,490
Still say you did nothing,

311
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,090
huh?

312
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:31,620
Check the surveillance

313
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,220
and see where he went and

314
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,660
the routes he took.

315
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:36,380
Okay.

316
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,290
(If the tattooed man)

317
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:59,900
(killed Cui Hao and Wan)

318
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,380
(because Wan discovered)

319
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,730
(their drug dealing,)

320
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:07,010
(his target should have been Cui Hao.)

321
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,460
(Wan's death was likely an accident.)

322
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:15,770
What about him?

323
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,290
Yes,

324
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:18,420
that's the man.

325
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,980
You just said

326
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,570
they were arguing.

327
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,460
(The tattooed man and)

328
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,620
(Wang Chen were partners.)

329
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:26,380
(So what was his motive for)

330
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,140
(silencing Wang Chen?)

331
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:32,570
Where

332
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:34,250
did you get this medicine?

333
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,220
Wang Chen gave it to me.

334
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:38,010
Everyone in our group

335
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:38,980
has it.

336
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,860
(Wang Chen was the source for)

337
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,180
(new drug test samples.)

338
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,660
(But he was under police investigation)

339
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,940
(because of Zhai Xixi's death.)

340
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,490
(So the tattooed man killed Wang Chen)

341
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,220
(to)

342
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,460
(cut off the police
investigation leads.)

343
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:58,700
(Li Yiqi must have been)

344
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,010
(using the new drug at the time.)

345
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:02,810
(The tattooed man was afraid the police)

346
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:04,090
(would trace the drug's source,)

347
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:05,980
(so he silenced him)

348
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,010
(before he could)

349
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:08,420
(tell the truth.)

350
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:10,900
(These deaths)

351
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,220
(are all connected to the new drug.)

352
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,050
Four of these

353
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,220
are related to the new drug.

354
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,010
(All were for depression.)

355
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,860
(Chen Chuchuan used
his psychology clinic)

356
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,010
(to find test samples,)

357
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:25,810
(so he's likely also
one of the sources.)

358
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:28,570
(And now that Chen Chuchuan is)

359
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:29,980
(exposed to the police,)

360
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,220
(he is probably)

361
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:34,220
(the tattooed man's)

362
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:35,460
(next target.)

363
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:50,900
Hello?

364
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:53,330
Okay, got it.

365
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:54,290
Mr. Han,

366
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,380
we received a tip.

367
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:56,570
Chen Chuchuan's car seems to

368
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:57,220
be heading towards

369
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,250
the border town of Luowang.

370
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,330
Chen Chuchuan,

371
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,490
I did so much

372
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:45,180
for you fourteen years ago,

373
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,700
and now I can't even get

374
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,140
a painting from you?

375
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,770
I've told you a thousand

376
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,460
times now.

377
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,620
I can't paint it!

378
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,700
So you're forcing me to

379
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,490
tell the police the

380
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:54,770
truth about what you did, is that it?

381
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:55,770
I don't care!

382
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:56,860
Do you know how I've

383
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,980
spent these 14 years?

384
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,380
In constant pain

385
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,900
and regret!

386
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,940
I caused Jiangxue's death!

387
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:03,980
It was me!

388
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:05,180
Chen Chuchuan,

389
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,900
are you still only caring
about Fan Jiangxue

390
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:08,460
now?

391
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,010
You think what you know

392
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:12,220
is the whole truth?

393
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,180
I'll tell you.

394
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,330
I'll let you know

395
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:16,290
how Fan Jiangxue died!

396
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:19,860
I got the flowers

397
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,380
she was allergic to and put them there!

398
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:22,810
I wanted her dead!

399
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:26,250
Why?

400
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,010
Why did you do that!

401
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:29,180
Seeing you two

402
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,140
together back then

403
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:31,570
made me so jealous!

404
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:32,810
But why!

405
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:34,050
I wanted her dead!

406
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:35,140
Why did you kill her?

407
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,380
You killed her!

408
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,490
Why!

409
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:05,940
Help me...

410
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:06,730
I didn't mean to!

411
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:07,570
Hu Jie! Hu...

412
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:08,220
Hu Jie!

413
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,770
I didn't mean to, Hu Jie!

414
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:10,570
Hu Jie!

415
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:11,730
Hu Jie!

416
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:13,090
Hu Jie!

417
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,900
I'm sorry, Jiangxue.

418
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,050
It was all my fault.

419
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:18,770
It was all my fault.

420
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:08,330
Chuchuan?

421
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:10,290
Chen Chuchuan!

422
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:10,980
I can save her!

423
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:12,010
Fan Jiangxue is gone!

424
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:13,380
I can save her!

425
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:17,220
Wake up!

426
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:18,730
Chen Chuchuan, wake up!

427
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,220
Wake up!

428
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,770
She's already dead.

429
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:25,420
She can't be saved.

430
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:26,770
If the police find out,

431
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:28,490
your life is over.

432
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,420
You'll have no future,

433
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,010
you know?

434
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:31,810
I can save her.

435
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:33,420
You'll have no future!

436
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,180
I can save her.

437
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:35,980
Just trust me.

438
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,090
Trust me.

439
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,940
I'll handle this for you.

440
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:40,490
You need to leave.

441
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:41,980
Just go.

442
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:51,420
Mr. Bai,

443
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,620
a vehicle matching

444
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:54,730
the description of the one

445
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,420
that hit Ms. Zhu at the hospital

446
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,730
was found at a highway intersection

447
00:29:58,750 --> 00:29:59,700
five kilometers from Luowang.

448
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:00,940
It must be the suspect's.

449
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:02,620
Notify Han Feng

450
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,140
to arrest him immediately.

451
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:05,140
Yes, sir.

452
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:28,380
Chuan,

453
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:29,220
it's all set.

454
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:29,860
Let's go.

455
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:13,220
How much longer to the border?

456
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:14,700
Chuan,

457
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:15,660
take a nap.

458
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:17,010
We'll be there soon.

459
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:49,660
Where are we?

460
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:53,770
We arrived.

461
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:55,900
Where?

462
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:22,380
The trauma from mental illness

463
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,490
is far greater than the pain
from physical illness.

464
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:24,980
Promise me

465
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,130
you'll become an outstanding

466
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:27,020
forensic pathologist.

467
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,580
I never called him "brother".

468
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,660
Now that I want to, he
can't hear me anymore.

469
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:32,300
Wan would be more than
happy to hear that.

470
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:34,260
Provincial task force
is already en route.

471
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,650
We need to eradicate

472
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:36,650
this new drug with

473
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:37,570
the utmost speed.

474
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:39,740
Based on the extracted
fingerprints and tissue,

475
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,690
we can now confirm the
suspect's name is Wang Bo.

476
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:42,940
The Raw Diamond Case...

477
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:43,610
I misjudged it.

478
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,820
Then we'll investigate it

479
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,380
and find the real killer of Fei.

480
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:47,820
Freeze!
