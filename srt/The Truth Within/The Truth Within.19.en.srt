1
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,090
Just cooperate.

2
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:16,300
Don't get cute.

3
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:21,740
Can you hear me?

4
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:25,210
See clearly?

5
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:34,370
Yes.

6
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:40,540
Mr. Guan,

7
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:41,690
play it by ear.

8
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:43,580
If it goes south,

9
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:44,730
go to Plan B.

10
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:46,540
Don't worry, Movie Star.

11
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,260
We'll get everything in place.

12
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:50,580
You just put on a good show.

13
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:51,690
Get the job done.

14
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,860
Mr. Han worked cases

15
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,980
like this before?

16
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:06,740
Biao would

17
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:07,850
have my bag if he were here.

18
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,020
Wu Ya?

19
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:24,290
A She?

20
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:27,850
General's reputation

21
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:28,740
precedes him.

22
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:30,930
A pleasure.

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,050
Just the two of you?

24
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:36,260
Just the two of us.

25
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:37,980
For such a big deal,

26
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:39,660
too many people shows no sincerity.

27
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:41,260
And it'd

28
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,570
make you easier to expose.

29
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:43,380
Not safe.

30
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:47,770
An introduction.

31
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:48,660
He's...

32
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,330
Biao.

33
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,130
My best friend.

34
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,980
We will meet often.

35
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,540
Biao?

36
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:41,020
[Episode 19]

37
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,130
So itchy!

38
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,220
Do it properly.

39
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:10,220
Alright now?

40
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,380
Well,

41
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,260
this way.

42
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,660
The guests are here.

43
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:36,540
Let me introduce.

44
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,730
This is Mr. Meng.

45
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:39,930
These two

46
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,850
are the trusted aides

47
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:42,810
of General Nuo Sha.

48
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,220
Wu Ya. Biao.

49
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,050
Did you bring the deposit?

50
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:05,850
Sit.

51
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:13,370
Xiaoxi,

52
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,700
upload the images.

53
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,980
Run facial recognition.

54
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,370
Check the background

55
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,540
on Mr. Meng and A She.

56
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:19,460
Yes.

57
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,660
Biao, right?

58
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:00,410
This is for you.

59
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,850
I added a little something special.

60
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:08,780
Try it.

61
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,810
We have a rule.

62
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:12,610
We sell, we don't use.

63
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,490
I appreciate the offer.

64
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,540
Why so nervous?

65
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,730
For such a big deal,

66
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,340
peace is what matters, right?

67
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,410
I'm drinking this

68
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:28,850
for him.

69
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:46,810
Biao...

70
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,220
Biao...

71
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,020
It's good.

72
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:02,460
General sent us here

73
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,850
with a lot of sincerity.

74
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:07,410
I've never

75
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:09,250
heard him

76
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,930
speak well of anyone.

77
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:13,250
We're here

78
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,700
for a long-term partnership.

79
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,700
How much do you want?

80
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:20,490
How much do you have?

81
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:27,340
Mr. Guan, got it.

82
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,810
A She's name is She Nana.

83
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:30,140
From Puye, Hujian.

84
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:31,100
She got five years

85
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,370
for running a prostitution ring.

86
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,610
Currently unemployed.

87
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:34,610
Mr. Meng's name

88
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,490
is Qiu Kai.

89
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,730
From Luxi, Jiang City.

90
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,170
He got five years for assault

91
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:39,050
and running

92
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,660
an online loan shark operation.

93
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,140
Released three years ago.

94
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,580
Also currently unemployed.

95
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:46,780
So both have records.

96
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,780
I'll add another million.

97
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,170
Six million yuan in total.

98
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:05,290
I want three months of your supply.

99
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:18,540
Good!

100
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,220
Don't tell me you're just

101
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,010
counting cash without showing the goods?

102
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:40,940
That's not

103
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,340
how things are done.

104
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:45,420
No rush.

105
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,180
Chat a bit more.

106
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:49,370
Counting takes time.

107
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,060
Plenty of time to look later.

108
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:53,730
Rules are rules.

109
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:57,730
In business,

110
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,770
it's my way

111
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,370
or no way.

112
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:17,460
Truly General's man.

113
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:18,650
Got some style.

114
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:19,730
Come on.

115
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:20,700
Have your seat.

116
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:22,490
Sit.

117
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,340
All units, attention.

118
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,420
On my command.

119
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:33,490
Prepare to move.

120
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,490
Did you

121
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,300
find a good chemist for this?

122
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:08,820
Quality is what counts.

123
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,700
Does it matter who the chemist is?

124
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:12,220
Absolutely.

125
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:14,530
I need to know

126
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:15,650
if this chemist is in this

127
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:16,610
for the long haul.

128
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:17,890
If I blow

129
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:18,980
this deal,

130
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:20,610
I'll be eating a bullet

131
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:22,250
from General.

132
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,980
That six million is just the appetizer.

133
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:30,610
The volume we'll need

134
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,060
is massive.

135
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:34,420
If you wanna make a fortune,

136
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:36,530
let me meet the chemist.

137
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:44,250
Think.

138
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:50,300
Fine.

139
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:03,700
Hi,

140
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,580
a buyer wanna know

141
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,980
the new drug's development.

142
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:08,980
(I got my hands)

143
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,850
(on the formula of Raw Diamond)

144
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,130
(and studied it.)

145
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:13,730
(Then I used some substitutes)

146
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:14,820
(to develop the new drug.)

147
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,100
No.

148
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:19,370
He's not the chemist.

149
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:22,770
Han Feng,

150
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,130
(the new drug was developed)

151
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,980
(through targeted experiments.)

152
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:28,340
That's why

153
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,530
there are some variations.

154
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,730
It's not copying Raw Diamond,

155
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,220
but developing a new drug.

156
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:35,220
(It's not just about)

157
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,180
(swapping ingredients)

158
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:37,940
(and creating it.)

159
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:40,300
Why would an experimental drug

160
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,220
end up on the street?

161
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,250
Experimental drugs shouldn't

162
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:49,530
leak to the market.

163
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:51,370
It would

164
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:52,610
ruin Mr. Q's name.

165
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:55,530
Right.

166
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,060
Attention.

167
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:01,980
Abort mission.

168
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:02,850
Abort mission.

169
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,650
Why?

170
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,980
They won't let us see the chemist.

171
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,610
Han Feng

172
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,220
might be playing a long game.

173
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:36,490
Besides you two, did General

174
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:38,100
send anyone else?

175
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:39,530
Mr. Han,

176
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,250
you're a good driver.

177
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,250
Cut the crap.

178
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,420
We have a saying here.

179
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,730
Survival comes first.

180
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,340
I suggest you choose to live.

181
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:50,890
Four or five more.

182
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,100
How to reach them?

183
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,060
Police check.

184
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:04,980
ID, please.

185
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:06,420
Pop the trunk.

186
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:19,370
Go.

187
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:39,370
Get out.

188
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,370
Su!

189
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:47,530
Get him!

190
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:48,580
Come on!

191
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:50,490
Stop!

192
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:51,460
Go!

193
00:13:59,550 --> 00:13:59,980
Go!

194
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:07,370
Ms. Zhu!

195
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,650
Stop!

196
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:12,890
Don't run!

197
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:31,730
Go!

198
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:32,650
Don't run!

199
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:34,300
Halt!

200
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,370
Moving in.

201
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:10,490
Watch out!

202
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:22,770
Mr. Han,

203
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:24,650
I failed to protect her.

204
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:28,980
I failed to protect Ms. Zhu.

205
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,060
Sorry.

206
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:47,730
Su.

207
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,010
It's not on you.

208
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,940
Ms. Zhu will be fine.

209
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,250
Don't worry.

210
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:11,940
How's she?

211
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:14,180
The shrapnel from the bomb

212
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,010
has been removed

213
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,220
from the patient's body.

214
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,380
During the laparotomy,

215
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:20,050
we found the spleen

216
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,620
was the only injury.

217
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,570
Is she out of danger?

218
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:24,770
She's stable now.

219
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:25,860
But due to

220
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,090
concussion and blood loss,

221
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:28,810
she remains in a coma.

222
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:30,530
As for when she'll wake up,

223
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,770
that's uncertain.

224
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,090
It's fine.

225
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,940
Ms. Zhu will be okay.

226
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:51,330
She'll be fine.

227
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,530
Let's talk about

228
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:33,490
the people you killed.

229
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:36,860
After you killed Li Yiqi,

230
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,570
why did you go to
Fenglin Ducheng Community?

231
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:44,810
That night,

232
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:47,140
Wang Chen was at the scene
where Zhai Xixi

233
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:47,980
was found.

234
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,730
You went to give him the new drug, right?

235
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,140
After killing Song Weimin,

236
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,050
Wang Chen called you.

237
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:00,010
And when you met,

238
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,460
you killed him.

239
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,900
What took you so long?

240
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:06,330
I'm in trouble.

241
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,050
I'm a suspect now.

242
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:09,460
What do I do now?

243
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:11,140
Please... help me.

244
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:12,730
Where's the body?

245
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:13,730
Over here.

246
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:54,700
Then, Cui Hao.

247
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,420
The ether and cedilanid

248
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,460
you used to kill Li Yiqi

249
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,460
were gotten from him, right?

250
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:04,530
Oh,

251
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:05,570
the vegetable

252
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:06,900
you asked me to watch

253
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:08,290
is showing signs.

254
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,530
And Wan Guoxin.

255
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:24,940
When he was investigating the hospital,

256
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:25,940
he found Cui Hao.

257
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:52,250
So you killed Wan

258
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:54,810
and Cui Hao.

259
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,900
Finally, Chen Chuchuan.

260
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:33,940
Why did you kill them?

261
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,810
Do you really think

262
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:38,810
your silence can stop us?

263
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,570
Wang Bo, listen.

264
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:42,900
You're not

265
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:43,730
walking out of here.

266
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:45,490
About Raw Diamond,

267
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,700
what do you know?

268
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:48,330
You better

269
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:49,050
come clean.

270
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:07,730
Mr. Gao, Ms. Zhang.

271
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:08,900
Any leads?

272
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:11,460
She was killed

273
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:12,700
by a stab to the heart.

274
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:13,900
It's also

275
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,940
the only fatal wound.

276
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:17,420
Adhesive residue on the lips.

277
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:18,250
Her mouth

278
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:19,570
was taped shut.

279
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,140
Before death,

280
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,730
she might have been beaten.

281
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,180
And the time of death?

282
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,140
Over 12 hours.

283
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:28,980
Muscle groups

284
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,180
show signs of rigor mortis.

285
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,700
Maybe after midnight yesterday.

286
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,570
So she was killed

287
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:35,620
right after the deal.

288
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,330
Got it.

289
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,420
Mr. Guan,

290
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:44,010
we found She Nana's body.

291
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:49,530
Fatal wound to the heart.

292
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:50,900
Okay.

293
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:53,220
A tattoo

294
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,090
on the right neck.

295
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:03,730
Using distillation and crystallization,

296
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,420
I recovered the drug from the wine

297
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,660
Mr. Han brought from the deal.

298
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,980
I compared it with the drugs

299
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,250
from previous cases.

300
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,380
These are

301
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:11,380
crystals of the new drug

302
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,490
before division.

303
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,900
So A She

304
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,980
is connected

305
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:15,770
to this new drug.

306
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,530
During the autopsy,

307
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:18,900
we found

308
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:21,250
the victim had

309
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,290
severe lung damage

310
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:23,660
from hydrofluoric acid.

311
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:25,220
Severe bone demineralization

312
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,380
was also present.

313
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:27,330
This pathology

314
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:28,530
comes from

315
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:29,420
long-term exposure

316
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,180
to toxic chemicals.

317
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,420
Hydrofluoric acid.

318
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,050
Chronic fluorine poisoning.

319
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:35,530
What's hydrofluoric acid used for?

320
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:36,860
It's primarily used

321
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,980
for processing and manufacturing

322
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,180
in glass factories.

323
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:41,380
Glass factories?

324
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:43,810
So she worked

325
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:44,770
in a glass factory?

326
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:48,250
Mr. Han and I

327
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:49,010
once took down

328
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:50,180
a trafficking operation.

329
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,290
They dissolved

330
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:52,730
the drugs in alcohol.

331
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:54,570
The buyers extracted them

332
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:55,380
via distillation

333
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,810
and crystallization.

334
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:58,420
So the new drug lab

335
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,330
could be disguised

336
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:02,490
as a glass factory.

337
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,330
In the Raw Diamond case,

338
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:05,730
we assumed

339
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:06,770
the drug

340
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,010
was from overseas,

341
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,570
but it led to Li Ming.

342
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:11,980
Then it could also

343
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:13,700
be domestic this time.

344
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:15,250
Maybe in He City.

345
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:19,810
Hydrofluoric acid

346
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,730
is highly regulated.

347
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,700
Its purchase, transport, and storage

348
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,810
require strict authorization.

349
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:28,250
We can leverage this

350
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:29,380
to penetrate the case.

351
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:30,940
Su, Yuanyang.

352
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:32,570
Search two areas.

353
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:33,620
Distilleries near He City,

354
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,010
and places that bought

355
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:35,940
hydrofluoric acid.

356
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:36,940
Yes.

357
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:38,010
Han Feng,

358
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:39,770
this is

359
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:40,620
A She's tattoo.

360
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:42,570
This one is Wang Bo's.

361
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,140
Qiu Kai?

362
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,570
Served time for assault.

363
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:33,980
Now you're

364
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:35,330
selling drugs.

365
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:36,660
You can't

366
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:37,900
stay legal?

367
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:38,900
Come clean.

368
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,140
Who's your supplier?

369
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:41,490
Who's the chemist?

370
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:42,940
Sir... sir,

371
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,730
I... I was just a front.

372
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:48,250
Don't know anything?

373
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:49,730
Wait...

374
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:50,330
Enough.

375
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:51,940
Let's cut the act.

376
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:52,810
Start talking.

377
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:56,140
Actually... it was just...

378
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:58,180
A She asked me

379
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:00,180
to play a part.

380
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,010
If they want to meet the chemist,

381
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:04,380
use this phone to call.

382
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:10,010
Why you?

383
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,090
Handsome face?

384
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:14,180
I... I don't know.

385
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:15,620
I just...

386
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,250
She paid, I did the job.

387
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,180
How much?

388
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:21,940
How much?

389
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:25,730
A She said... said...

390
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,290
she'd give me

391
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:30,940
100,000 yuan each time.

392
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:35,140
100,000?

393
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,090
That much?

394
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:38,250
Just for a little acting?

395
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:39,860
Serious?

396
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,050
Sir, I... I'm not lying.

397
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:42,050
I'm telling the truth.

398
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:42,570
Really!

399
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:43,530
That's all I know!

400
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:45,220
I'm not lying!

401
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:46,770
I... I don't know anything else!

402
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,050
He really knows nothing.

403
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:48,570
Fine then.

404
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:50,570
Trafficking charge.

405
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,490
Caught in the act.

406
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:52,330
Report it.

407
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:54,330
Wait!

408
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:54,980
No!

409
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:55,620
Please!

410
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:56,220
Hold on!

411
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:57,460
I remember now!

412
00:27:58,960 --> 00:27:59,250
Say it.

413
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,050
A She told me...

414
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:03,250
there's...

415
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:05,220
a boss above her.

416
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:07,250
Her word isn't final.

417
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:08,420
But I don't know...

418
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:08,980
I don't know

419
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:09,980
if that's true.

420
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:11,220
Sir,

421
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:12,660
I've told you

422
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,620
everything I know.

423
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:15,770
You should...

424
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,290
well...

425
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:17,330
I'm cooperating so fully.

426
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:19,380
You should go easy on me.

427
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:20,380
Right?

428
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:21,700
I was just acting.

429
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,010
I'm a fake.

430
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:25,050
You already figured it out.

431
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,490
What more do you want?

432
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,220
You know A She, right?

433
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:38,660
Yeah.

434
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:42,180
Cobras.
[*"She" means "snake".]

435
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,220
And rattlesnakes.

436
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:48,770
I don't care what snakes you know!

437
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:50,330
A She died.

438
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:56,090
You're lying.

439
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:57,940
Stop bluffing.

440
00:28:58,790 --> 00:28:59,570
See for yourself.

441
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:02,730
Still think we're lying?

442
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,140
How could she be dead?

443
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,420
How did she die?

444
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:17,010
You tell me.

445
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:19,140
Let me out!

446
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:20,570
I need to avenge A She!

447
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:21,330
Let me out!

448
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,010
Do what you want when I get back!

449
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:23,770
Wang Bo!

450
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:24,940
You think

451
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,050
we're letting you go?

452
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:27,530
What you need to do

453
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:28,330
is tell us

454
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:28,940
what you know.

455
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,770
That's the only way

456
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:31,940
we'll find the killer soon.

457
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,530
If you really care about

458
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:34,290
A She.

459
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:36,570
We'll catch the killer

460
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,570
sooner or later.

461
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,330
But if you don't cooperate,

462
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,940
the killer

463
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:41,810
could use this time

464
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:43,090
to get away.

465
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:44,570
Then...

466
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:45,140
I'll say.

467
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:52,330
Feng Zhengxi.

468
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:54,220
Must be him.

469
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:57,010
Who's Feng Zhengxi?

470
00:29:58,750 --> 00:29:59,330
Are you sure

471
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:00,290
he killed A She?

472
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:04,730
After I finished Chen Chuchuan,

473
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:07,860
I found a memory card

474
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,180
on him.

475
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,570
That was the reason Feng Zhengxi wanted

476
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:17,180
to kill him.

477
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,180
What's on it?

478
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,570
It's

479
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,180
the contact information

480
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,050
for General Nuo Sha.

481
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:25,490
He promised

482
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:26,660
a million yuan

483
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,330
for it.

484
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,180
A million?

485
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,660
That old bastard Feng Zhengxi!

486
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,380
All that dirty work,

487
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:35,900
and only a million?

488
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:37,570
A million

489
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,050
will last us a while.

490
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:40,660
When it runs out,

491
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,180
I'll get you more.

492
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:46,420
Bo.

493
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,380
I have an idea.

494
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:49,420
I can

495
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:52,770
pose as the chemist

496
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:54,770
and make a deal with Nuo Sha.

497
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,490
We take the money

498
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:57,490
and disappear.

499
00:30:58,070 --> 00:30:58,660
Let's start

500
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,250
a quiet life somewhere, okay?

501
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:01,810
Feng Zhengxi must have

502
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:02,940
found this

503
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:04,730
and killed her.

504
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:08,900
It's my fault.

505
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:16,250
Tell us about Feng Zhengxi and Nuo Sha.

506
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,810
Feng Zhengxi owns a glass factory.

507
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,380
It's actually a drug lab.

508
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:25,490
Chen Chuchuan

509
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:26,330
got drugs from there.

510
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:32,490
Feng Zhengxi

511
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:34,010
produces drugs at Jingfeng Glass Factory.

512
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,570
He wanna expand his market,

513
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:36,730
so he's contacting Nuo Sha.

514
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,420
It's a perfect match

515
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,940
with the drug we extracted

516
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,250
from the wine.

517
00:31:58,110 --> 00:31:58,570
Look.

518
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:00,250
Same as the bottle

519
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:01,050
Mr. Han brought.

520
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:03,620
This is it.

521
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:05,380
Mr. Han. Mr. Guan.

522
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:06,460
They have

523
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,620
found the glass factory.

524
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,660
Outskirts of He City.

525
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:26,010
Using Wang Bo's lead,

526
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:26,770
we've located

527
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:28,050
Jingfeng Glass Factory

528
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:29,330
and scouted it.

529
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:31,900
It's confirmed

530
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,010
that this factory

531
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:33,980
is the drug lab

532
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:34,810
we've been after.

533
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,140
Feng Zhengxi,

534
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:40,940
formerly Feng Jun.

535
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:41,860
Born in 1975.

536
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,620
From He City.

537
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:43,810
Donghai University graduate.

538
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:44,810
Chemical Engineering.

539
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:45,530
Returned home

540
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:46,420
eight years ago

541
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,220
to start up.

542
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:47,900
He did

543
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:48,730
a year and a half

544
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:49,940
for running a gambling ring.

545
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:51,180
Three years ago,

546
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:51,940
he purchased

547
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:52,940
Jingfeng Glass Factory.

548
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:54,700
So he's been using the factory

549
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:56,220
for drug production

550
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:56,900
for three years.

551
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:06,730
Target confirmed.

552
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:07,530
Move.

553
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:08,140
Yes.

554
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:04,700
I'll take them on!

555
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:10,980
Run!

556
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:15,690
Cops! Run!

557
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,300
Stop them! Hurry!

558
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:21,820
Go!

559
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:41,780
Breach.

560
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:08,740
Hurry!

561
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:09,780
Down! Don't move!

562
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:11,780
Down! Stay down!

563
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:12,420
Down!

564
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,340
- Freeze! - Don't move!

565
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,260
Down!

566
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:17,570
Hands up!

567
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:18,380
Stay down!

568
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:19,570
Hands up!

569
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:19,980
Down!

570
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:20,900
Get down!

571
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,260
Look up.

572
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:32,010
Go.

573
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:02,940
Stay still.

574
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:04,420
Mr. Han,

575
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:06,300
no sign of Feng Zhengxi.

576
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,610
He might have run.

577
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:09,010
Guan.

578
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:10,780
Let's split up.

579
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:11,610
Fine.

580
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:12,420
Go!

581
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:28,610
(Han Feng,)

582
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,380
(when you worked the Raw Diamond case,)

583
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:31,210
(did you find)

584
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:32,530
(a link to Feng Zhengxi?)

585
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:34,940
No.

586
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,900
But I found something new.

587
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:41,380
Wei,

588
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,050
got a find.

589
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:57,570
Split up.

590
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:19,090
Mr. Han,

591
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:20,860
this must be

592
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:21,610
their lab.

593
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:22,900
Bag it all.

594
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:23,900
Yes.

595
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:25,210
Need backup.

596
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:51,300
The depression rate
stands at five percent.

597
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,380
My research shows

598
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,610
norepinephrine

599
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:55,380
is effective against depression.

600
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,780
Wu Yongchang left me this note

601
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:57,820
in college.

602
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:58,610
Wu Yongchang?

603
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,050
Your teacher

604
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:01,570
might be connected to this case.

605
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:03,690
The kidnapper could be Feng Zhengxi.

606
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,260
The substance from the factory

607
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,940
is the new drug we've been tracking.

608
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:09,420
They need this molecular formula

609
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,300
to produce the final drug.

610
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,260
How would I know?

611
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,090
Maybe Nuo Sha

612
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:14,170
connected with the drug ring.

613
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:14,780
Sizhe,

614
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,780
he's the man you're hunting.

615
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,690
Give me Mr. K's diary.

616
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,490
Otherwise,

617
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:21,170
I'll kill your teacher.
