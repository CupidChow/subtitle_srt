1
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:07,340
Zhu,

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:09,860
I still think

3
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:11,540
that tattooed man

4
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,250
killed Li Yiqi in this hospital,

5
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:14,700
and then you happened to

6
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:15,860
run into him here.

7
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:17,940
Why did he visit the hospital so often?

8
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:19,780
Do you think there

9
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:20,780
might be some connection?

10
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:24,810
Okay, I understand.

11
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:25,780
You take care too.

12
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:29,370
Sir.

13
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:31,260
Mr. Bai,

14
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:33,370
there's something I'd like to report.

15
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:35,300
Okay.

16
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:41,180
What is it?

17
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,050
It's now confirmed

18
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,900
that Chen Chuchuan
is suspected of murder.

19
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,330
Qi Sizhe is his close friend.

20
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:49,620
Normally, he should recuse himself,

21
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,580
but he knows him very well.

22
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,860
If he can join us,

23
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,540
it could aid our investigation.

24
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:56,730
What do you think?

25
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,100
You prepare a written report.

26
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:06,570
We'll discuss and decide.

27
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:08,660
But use

28
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,490
your discretion.

29
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,050
Yes, sir.

30
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:50,860
[Episode 16]

31
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,060
Why did Chen Chuchuan come to see you?

32
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,980
He wanted me to believe him.

33
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:05,820
What else did he tell you?

34
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,220
He only told me

35
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:09,890
he was innocent.

36
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,450
What about the new drug?

37
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:16,940
If he's innocent,

38
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:18,340
we'll find the evidence.

39
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,610
We have some

40
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:45,690
questions we'd like to ask.

41
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:46,610
Okay.

42
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,660
Do you know these two people?

43
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:57,290
Yes.

44
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,010
Do you know

45
00:03:59,030 --> 00:03:59,820
they're dead?

46
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:03,850
Hu Jie is dead too?

47
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,410
I didn't know.

48
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:11,570
But Jiangxue

49
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:12,690
was murdered over ten years ago.

50
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:13,850
I knew about that.

51
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:16,700
Tell us about it.

52
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:17,980
How did you know them?

53
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,020
I met Hu Jie at

54
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,170
an art competition.

55
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,220
She was from Lijia Town.

56
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:30,780
That summer,

57
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,610
she invited me

58
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:32,850
to her hometown to sketch.

59
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,900
That's when I met Jiangxue.

60
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:41,850
The first time I saw Jiangxue,

61
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:42,490
I fell in love

62
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:43,700
with her at first sight.

63
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,810
Later, Hu Jie got very angry

64
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,290
with me because of this.

65
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:52,580
Why was she angry with you?

66
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,610
She had feelings for me.

67
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,460
But I only ever saw her

68
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,540
as a friend.

69
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,900
Later, she told Jiangxue

70
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:06,100
to stop contacting me.

71
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,370
We were young then.

72
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:12,660
I was really afraid of losing Jiangxue,

73
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:16,250
so I texted her to meet

74
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:17,580
the next day

75
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,730
at the botanical garden

76
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:19,810
where we often sketched.

77
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,140
On my way there,

78
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,980
Hu Jie called out to me from behind.

79
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:26,900
Chuchuan!

80
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:29,250
Chuchuan!

81
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,250
What are you doing here?

82
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,020
Jiangxue...

83
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,170
She fell.

84
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,810
It looks bad.

85
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,540
Where's she?

86
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:35,730
Over there.

87
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:42,340
We searched for a long time.

88
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:44,610
Jiangxue!

89
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,730
Jiangxue!

90
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,460
We went everywhere

91
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,730
but couldn't find Jiangxue.

92
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:54,780
Later I found out

93
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,340
Jiangxue had been killed in that

94
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:58,980
botanical garden.

95
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:03,700
And that case...

96
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,700
still remains unsolved.

97
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,290
I've blamed

98
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:08,220
myself all these years.

99
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:11,250
If I hadn't invited her,

100
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,290
she wouldn't have showed up,

101
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:15,900
and things wouldn't have
ended up like this.

102
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,660
After Fan Jiangxue died,

103
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:20,050
did you stay in touch with Hu Jie?

104
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,290
She went abroad later.

105
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,410
So we lost contact.

106
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,810
But a month ago,

107
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:34,930
she suddenly came to me.

108
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:37,730
Chuchuan,

109
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:39,930
that painting...

110
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,490
Can you paint it for me again?

111
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,250
After Jiangxue died,

112
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:53,050
I stopped painting.

113
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:55,250
I'm sorry.

114
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:02,460
Fan Jiangxue.

115
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,610
Fan Jiangxue.

116
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,610
Chen Chuchuan,

117
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,660
it's been fourteen years.

118
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,100
Fan Jiangxue has been dead

119
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,340
for fourteen years.

120
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,370
Today, you will paint

121
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:18,850
the painting, whether

122
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,540
you want to or not!

123
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:26,290
Why should I?

124
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:32,490
You...

125
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,660
You really don't know

126
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:36,660
how Fan Jiangxue died, do you?

127
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:41,100
Tell you what,

128
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,020
Fan Jiangxue

129
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:46,020
had a severe pollen allergy.

130
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,810
I was trying to save her.

131
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,980
But she kept struggling.

132
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,660
In the end, the pen slipped.

133
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,050
Let me tell you, Chen Chuchuan,

134
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:02,850
Fan Jiangxue's death...

135
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,100
was your fault.

136
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:07,370
If you hadn't

137
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,780
asked her to meet there,

138
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,900
she wouldn't have gone.

139
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,850
If you hadn't brought
those flowers inside,

140
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,490
she wouldn't have died.

141
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,610
You believe what she said?

142
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,050
My gut says no.

143
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:27,140
But from my

144
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,340
professional perspective,

145
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:29,610
the way she

146
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:30,610
told me about these things,

147
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:31,610
either her eyes

148
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:32,940
or her body language,

149
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,300
seemed perfectly natural.

150
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,420
I have serious doubts too.

151
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:38,610
So I wanted to go back to that

152
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:39,460
botanical garden again.

153
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:41,700
But on my way,

154
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,730
I got a call from Maggie

155
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:43,610
saying you wanted to meet,

156
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,850
so I came straight here.

157
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:47,490
Why did you go to Qi Sizhe first

158
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:48,420
instead of coming here?

159
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:50,340
Because he's my friend,

160
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:52,650
and he's also a police officer.

161
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,460
I wanted to get some
information from him first.

162
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:57,180
Chuchuan, you know

163
00:08:58,270 --> 00:08:59,060
I can't

164
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,130
reveal anything to you.

165
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,460
Is it about Jiangxue's case?

166
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:08,490
Is this about Jiangxue?

167
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:09,650
Did you get any leads?

168
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,490
Chuchuan,

169
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:23,490
are you absolutely sure

170
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:25,060
you haven't hidden anything from me?

171
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,220
You came here because

172
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,100
you were certain that after Fan Jiangxue

173
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,250
and Hu Jie died, we couldn't

174
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:44,940
uncover the truth, right?

175
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:53,460
No, officers.

176
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,220
What do you mean?

177
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,370
Are you suspecting me?

178
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,060
Where were you between
9 and 11 PM on the night

179
00:09:59,080 --> 00:09:59,700
of October 13?

180
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:08,130
I was at the clinic.

181
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,770
Someone can vouch for me.

182
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,370
Who?

183
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:14,650
Qi Sizhe.

184
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,010
Have you seen this?

185
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:49,220
It's about Fei's case again?

186
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,250
On the night Hu Jie died,

187
00:10:58,790 --> 00:10:59,490
I was indeed

188
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:00,770
at Chen Chuchuan's clinic.

189
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,700
Why did you go

190
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,820
to see him that night?

191
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,130
I think someone's making

192
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:09,940
narcotics under the pretense

193
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:11,490
of making drugs.

194
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:18,980
And did you find anything

195
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,890
suspicious about him?

196
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,530
I was at the clinic

197
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,250
from around 9:30

198
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,250
to about 11 PM.

199
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:33,130
Based on Hu Jie's

200
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:34,730
estimated time of death,

201
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:36,820
Chen Chuchuan

202
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:39,250
could not possibly be the killer.

203
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:44,220
Judging from the current leads,

204
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,420
it's about

205
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,180
a 45-minute drive from

206
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,890
Hu Jie's place to
Chen Chuchuan's clinic.

207
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:50,850
If he really killed Hu Jie

208
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:51,770
at 9 PM,

209
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,610
then left and disposed of the body,

210
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:54,850
there's no way

211
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:55,890
he could have made it back

212
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,890
to the clinic to meet with

213
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,010
Mr. Qi within half an hour.

214
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:01,490
When we met

215
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:02,490
at the clinic,

216
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:03,340
I told you

217
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,940
Chen Chuchuan was the prime suspect.

218
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,370
Why didn't you

219
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:07,300
tell me immediately that

220
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:08,980
you were together at
the time of the crime?

221
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,100
How long do I have to wait?

222
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,850
I was only suspecting

223
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:32,420
that Chen Chuchuan may be

224
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,580
connected to the new drug.

225
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,180
I never thought

226
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,730
that the time of our meeting

227
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:37,980
would coincide with

228
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,530
Hu Jie's time of death.

229
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:41,610
So Mr. Qi,

230
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:42,610
you didn't know about

231
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,250
the relationship between
the two of them,

232
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:44,940
did you?

233
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:46,530
No, I didn't.

234
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,940
Let's set aside whether
Chen Chuchuan's statement

235
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,700
about Fan Jiangxue's case
is credible or not.

236
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,300
The scene has already

237
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,300
been processed.

238
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:54,420
Even with all the evidence,

239
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:55,770
we can't confirm

240
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:56,580
its authenticity.

241
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,820
And now you are Chen Chuchuan's

242
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,060
alibi witness.

243
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:01,460
He was counting on that,

244
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,460
which is why he came to you

245
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:03,730
before being questioned by us.

246
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:13,060
Mr. Han,

247
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,460
Xiaoxi says

248
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,370
the surveillance

249
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:16,250
near the clinic shows

250
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:17,980
that Mr. Qi and Chen Chuchuan's cars

251
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,530
left

252
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:19,820
at 10:50 PM

253
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,420
and 11:45 PM,

254
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:21,940
respectively.

255
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,100
No.

256
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:45,820
How did it go?

257
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:48,010
No drug residue was found

258
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:49,130
in Chen Chuchuan's system.

259
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,300
I also compared it with

260
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,180
other relevant samples

261
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:51,940
of the new drug.

262
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,130
None matched.

263
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:54,650
Chen Chuchuan knew

264
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:55,890
Fan Jiangxue and Hu Jie.

265
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:57,820
We just don't have evidence to

266
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,130
prove he's related to their deaths.

267
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,890
If we can't find evidence

268
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,580
in the next few hours, we'll

269
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:04,100
have to release him.

270
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,100
I need to check

271
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,130
Hu Jie's primary crime scene.

272
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,180
Based on bloodstain

273
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,340
pattern analysis,

274
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:33,420
the perpetrator

275
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,820
likely ambushed Hu Jie in her home.

276
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,060
She was attacked as soon as she entered.

277
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,130
Ruan Mingyu said he arrived here

278
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,010
a little after 11.

279
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,010
So, the killer

280
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:12,770
had to kill Hu Jie and clean

281
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,700
the scene before Ruan Mingyu arrived.

282
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,060
Piercing the carotid artery would

283
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:18,250
leave massive amounts

284
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:19,100
of blood at the scene.

285
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,010
To clean up

286
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:22,010
in such

287
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:22,980
a short time,

288
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:24,610
the killer would have

289
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:26,530
had to use bleach or cleaner.

290
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:27,700
When Ruan Mingyu

291
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,940
arrived,

292
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:30,100
he would have smelled

293
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,250
a strong odor of blood

294
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:33,650
or cleaner.

295
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:35,460
But during interrogation,

296
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,370
he didn't mention anything unusual.

297
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,340
You suspect Ruan Mingyu was lying?

298
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,010
Mr. Han, Mr. Qi,

299
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,370
the water was shut off here

300
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:45,370
the night Hu Jie died.

301
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,940
From 7 PM to 3 AM the next day.

302
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:50,010
If the water was off

303
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,580
during that time,

304
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:54,340
how could all that blood
have been cleaned up?

305
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,340
According to Hu Jie's

306
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,580
timeline of death,

307
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:59,530
the water was off then.

308
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,530
The killer had no means

309
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:02,770
to clean the blood here.

310
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,610
If the scene weren't cleaned,

311
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:06,820
Ruan Mingyu

312
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,850
would definitely have noticed

313
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,420
something was wrong when he arrived.

314
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,130
And if Ruan Mingyu

315
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:12,300
didn't notice anything,

316
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:14,130
the only explanation is

317
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:16,300
that this place wasn't

318
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:17,610
a crime scene yet when

319
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:18,300
Ruan Mingyu arrived.

320
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:23,650
Su,

321
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:24,340
go check the

322
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,250
water in the other rooms.

323
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:25,820
Okay.

324
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:31,180
The water is clear.

325
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:34,580
The water

326
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,610
from the other two faucets

327
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:36,300
is murky.

328
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:37,340
It's likely no one used

329
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,250
them since the shutoff.

330
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,700
We were misled from the very beginning.

331
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:49,980
I suspect

332
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:51,890
Hu Jie's body

333
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,010
was never here.

334
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:57,010
The killer murdered Hu Jie elsewhere

335
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,060
and staged this place
as the primary scene.

336
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:01,370
But the timing

337
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,770
wasn't before Ruan Mingyu arrived.

338
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:04,900
It was after he left,

339
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:06,940
to be precise,

340
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,770
after the water supply was restored.

341
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:10,620
That's why the water

342
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:11,900
from that faucet ran clear.

343
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:13,940
Why would the killer

344
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:14,980
dump Hu Jie's body

345
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,420
in a trash bin?

346
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:17,380
Wouldn't that

347
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,330
make it easily discovered?

348
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,900
The killer smashed Hu Jie's face

349
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:23,490
and destroyed her fingerprints,

350
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,010
but left the tattoo

351
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:26,660
that could prove her identity

352
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:27,900
untouched.

353
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:29,770
He wanted us to know

354
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,860
the deceased was Hu Jie,

355
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:32,860
thereby

356
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:33,980
leading us to this

357
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,290
staged primary scene.

358
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:37,290
Where is the real primary

359
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:37,810
scene then?

360
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:39,290
I want to interrogate

361
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:40,220
Chen Chuchuan.

362
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,940
That's against regulations.

363
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,700
You and Chen Chuchuan are friends,

364
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,700
and

365
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,380
you're also his alibi witness.

366
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,460
But if you have a reason

367
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,900
compelling enough to convince me,

368
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,180
I can seek approval from Mr. Bai.

369
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:53,620
I suspect

370
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,730
Chen Chuchuan's clinic

371
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:57,330
is the actual primary crime scene.

372
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:29,660
Having Qi Sizhe interrogate him alone

373
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:30,730
is against regulations.

374
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,250
If we don't get Chen Chuchuan

375
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:35,140
to let his guard down,

376
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:36,900
it'll be hard to get him to talk.

377
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:37,860
Qi Sizhe

378
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:38,980
is the only one who

379
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:39,810
can make him talk.

380
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:42,330
But you must keep an eye on them.

381
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,570
Let me know

382
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:44,490
if anything happens.

383
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,010
Yes, sir.

384
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:49,770
Are you here to see me

385
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:50,530
or to interrogate me?

386
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,220
Fourteen years ago,

387
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,940
Fan Jiangxue wasn't killed
by Hu Jie, was she?

388
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,660
Your colleagues have already

389
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,700
interrogated me.

390
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,290
I have my doubts too,

391
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,420
and I also need an answer

392
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,140
and the truth,

393
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:05,730
you know?

394
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,490
Fan Jiangxue's death

395
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:09,660
was an accident.

396
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:17,460
I'm sorry.

397
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:19,770
I'm sorry.

398
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:22,420
Have you found

399
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,700
any leads from that case?

400
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:25,220
I mean,

401
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:27,290
that wound...

402
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:29,220
was an accident.

403
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:32,220
Chuchuan,

404
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,330
do you remember

405
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,050
when we were at the bar years ago,

406
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:38,980
I saved someone's life?

407
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:42,730
Actually,

408
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,140
you had a better chance

409
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,010
to save him with a cricothyrotomy.

410
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:50,460
What's wrong?

411
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:52,050
Acute allergic reaction.

412
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:56,570
Chuchuan,

413
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:03,220
hold her.

414
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:03,980
I'll do it.

415
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:15,730
It's been too long. I don't recall.

416
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:18,700
Let me refresh your memory.

417
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,810
The fatal wounds on
Fan Jiangxue and Hu Jie

418
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:27,530
appear similar at first glance,

419
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:28,940
but the methods used

420
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:31,490
by the perpetrator
are completely different.

421
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:34,700
When the killer murdered Hu Jie,

422
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,290
there was no hesitation,

423
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,860
only huge hatred.

424
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,420
The carotid artery
was pierced precisely.

425
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,090
But Fan Jiangxue...

426
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,900
Her wound was

427
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,140
between the carotid
artery and the throat.

428
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,700
That location...

429
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,860
as you and I both know,

430
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,330
is the spot for

431
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:53,420
a cricothyrotomy.

432
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:54,860
Unfortunately,

433
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,620
due to a slip,

434
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,700
the carotid artery was pierced,

435
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,810
causing massive hemorrhage.

436
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:05,770
And then?

437
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,050
You're my alibi witness

438
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,010
for the night Hu Jie died,

439
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,050
remember?

440
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:23,140
I can only prove

441
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,620
you weren't at Hu Jie's home,

442
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,700
but I can't prove
you weren't the killer.

443
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:31,940
Hu Jie's body

444
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,010
was in your clinic

445
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,460
at the time, wasn't it?

446
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:40,860
I need to use the restroom.

447
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:44,250
The toilet inside is broken.

448
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,050
Use the one outside.

449
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:47,940
Okay.

450
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,730
Hu Jie's body was

451
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,140
right in that restroom, right?

452
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:25,570
You didn't expect me to come.

453
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:27,330
But at the same time,

454
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:28,900
my arrival

455
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,980
created a perfect alibi

456
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,460
for you as well.

457
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,250
You only needed to prove

458
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:42,770
Hu Jie wasn't killed

459
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:43,660
in your clinic,

460
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,490
and her death would

461
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:47,770
have nothing to do with you.

462
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,140
After I left,

463
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,700
you disposed of Hu Jie's body,

464
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:55,380
destroyed her face and fingerprints,

465
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:57,860
and dumped her in the trash bin.

466
00:22:59,030 --> 00:22:59,620
Then,

467
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,460
you went to Hu Jie's home

468
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:03,490
and staged the scene.

469
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:06,250
Am I right,

470
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:08,050
Chuchuan?

471
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:24,330
After all these years,

472
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:27,290
this is the first time

473
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:28,530
I've seen you work on cases.

474
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:30,900
Not bad.

475
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,660
Do you remember what Li Ming

476
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,860
said about us back in school?

477
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,380
He said I chose to be a psychologist,

478
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,490
taking half a year

479
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:42,810
or more to treat a patient,

480
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,900
with no guarantee of success.

481
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:48,810
And you chose to be
a forensic pathologist...

482
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:52,090
Can you really save people?

483
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:55,220
More often,

484
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,050
what you face are

485
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:57,220
cold corpses.

486
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:00,980
What are you saying?

487
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:04,940
Your deduction is very brilliant.

488
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,660
But investigations require evidence,

489
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,180
right?

490
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:32,250
Any findings?

491
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,330
No.

492
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:39,980
Ms. Zhu.

493
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:41,290
We conducted Luminol tests

494
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:42,180
on every corner

495
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,180
of the clinic.

496
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:44,700
No blood reactions whatsoever.

497
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,290
I'm afraid

498
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:47,140
this isn't the

499
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:47,900
primary crime scene.

500
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:50,940
Okay.

501
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,290
There's

502
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:02,980
23 minutes left.

503
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:06,980
The twelve-hour questioning period

504
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:07,700
is about to end.

505
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,050
What about Song Weimin?

506
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,530
Does Song Weimin also have

507
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:14,250
nothing to do with you?

508
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:18,090
If you're already

509
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:18,860
convinced

510
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,460
that I killed Hu Jie,

511
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:23,420
do you think anything I'm

512
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,940
telling you here today is the truth?

513
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,730
You just need to answer my question.

514
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,140
What exactly

515
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:32,330
happened with Song Weimin?

516
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,290
I remember we once talked

517
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:38,290
about mental illness.

518
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:40,220
It's different from

519
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,730
the surgical forensics you

520
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,140
specialize in.

521
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,460
These patients...

522
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:47,980
When they have an episode,

523
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:49,460
the lies they

524
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,940
fabricate to deceive their brains

525
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:53,050
are the most real

526
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:54,420
for them.

527
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,460
Song Weimin saw

528
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,660
visions of his daughter.

529
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,490
So in his heart,

530
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:01,010
he believed his daughter
was still alive.

531
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,860
That was his hope to keep living.

532
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:07,420
You're the same.

533
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,660
After Yu Fei died,

534
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,770
you kept believing there was another

535
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:15,290
person at the crash scene.

536
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:18,140
So you keep investigating,

537
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:19,980
believing

538
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,490
the Raw Diamond Case isn't over.

539
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:23,290
You cling

540
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:24,940
to that like a piece of driftwood

541
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:25,660
to survive.

542
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,140
Don't you think you and

543
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,770
Song Weimin are the same in that regard?

544
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:34,900
Don't you mention Fei to me.

545
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,090
If you hadn't,

546
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:40,330
in your imagination,

547
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:42,180
insisted on the existence
of another person

548
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:44,460
and believed

549
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,490
that was the truth,

550
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,770
how could you convince yourself

551
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:52,330
to survive through the painful

552
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:53,010
rehabilitation?

553
00:26:59,240 --> 00:26:59,810
Mr. Qi,

554
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,180
if this new drug

555
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,490
you mentioned

556
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:09,380
could help you see Yu Fei,

557
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:15,330
do you think you could resist

558
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:16,460
that temptation?

559
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:31,090
So...

560
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,420
you know the new drug

561
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,050
can cause hallucinations?

562
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:42,090
Just like you,

563
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:43,250
I'm just speculating.

564
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,420
Chen Chuchuan,

565
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,090
the medication Song Weimin had

566
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:53,770
was from you.

567
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:54,940
Do you have evidence?

568
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,220
Chen Chuchuan,

569
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:16,250
you can go now.

570
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,050
Mr. Wan,

571
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:33,250
this is my office.

572
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:33,900
Come in.

573
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:37,010
So you're saying

574
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,460
someone secretly took

575
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,490
ether and cedilanid

576
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,330
and altered

577
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:44,250
the computer records?

578
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:46,810
That's possible.

579
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,770
According to the duty roster,

580
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:56,050
you worked four night shifts this month

581
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:57,980
and entered the storeroom twice.

582
00:28:58,830 --> 00:28:59,180
Yes.

583
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:00,980
But I only took regular medications.

584
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,330
I never opened the cooling cabinet.

585
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,810
The footage can prove it.

586
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:08,050
Is everyone on

587
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:08,730
this list here?

588
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:10,180
Only Cui Hao is absent.

589
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,290
He's been on leave lately.

590
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:13,290
But he's on the night shift tonight.

591
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:14,180
I've asked him

592
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:14,860
to come in early.

593
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,010
Do you know

594
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:35,010
why I eat nuts?

595
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,730
I don't actually like them.

596
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:39,220
I hate all kinds of nuts.

597
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,090
Fei liked raisins.

598
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,570
As a kid, she got scolded

599
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:48,860
for opening a whole bag

600
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,010
just to eat the raisins.

601
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:51,860
So she got clever.

602
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,290
She'd have you eat the nuts

603
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:57,250
so she could eat the raisins.

604
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,570
I always thought I was helping her

605
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:03,810
eat the nuts she didn't like.

606
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,250
After she was gone,

607
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:05,940
I realized

608
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:07,860
she was helping me eat

609
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:09,980
the raisins I liked even less.

610
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:14,900
Things can be seen

611
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:15,770
from different angles.

612
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:18,220
Before you see the result,

613
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:20,220
you never know

614
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,380
what the truth is.

615
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,420
Chen Chuchuan said that

616
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,050
just to influence you.

617
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,290
He's a psychologist.

618
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:30,380
He's better than all of us

619
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:31,900
at psychological warfare.

620
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:34,620
Officer,

621
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:35,570
I didn't do anything.

622
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:36,380
Please check it again.

623
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,090
Really.

624
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,090
I did nothing!

625
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:40,290
You've wronged me.

626
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,330
I really didn't do anything!

627
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,050
You did nothing?

628
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,380
Several medications on

629
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:48,530
the list that don't match up

630
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:49,700
are used in multiple homicides.

631
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:50,770
Whatever you did,

632
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:51,570
you're coming with me.

633
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:53,900
I...

634
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:02,730
How dare you run!

635
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:06,220
Still say you did nothing, huh?

636
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,810
Now it has everything to do with you!

637
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,140
See? You assaulted an officer!

638
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,220
Get up! Let's go!

639
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:17,620
Come on!

640
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:39,700
A chelating agent!

641
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:44,220
Now I know why there was

642
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,090
no Luminol reaction.

643
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:51,860
A chelating agent

644
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:54,090
is a chemical substance that can form

645
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,570
stable complexes with

646
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:56,330
metal ions.

647
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:57,530
It's commonly found

648
00:31:57,550 --> 00:31:58,570
in cleaning agents.

649
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,530
In industrial cleaning,

650
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:02,010
it's often used to remove

651
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:03,330
metal deposits and grime

652
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:04,290
from equipment

653
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:05,180
and pipes.

654
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:08,570
Gao Yuan.

655
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:09,290
Mr. Qi.

656
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,290
Let me ask you.

657
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:11,290
What's the principle

658
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:12,090
behind the Luminol test?

659
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,940
The Luminol test...

660
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,290
Human blood

661
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:16,530
contains ferrous ions.

662
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,660
The Luminol solution

663
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,570
contains hydrogen peroxide.

664
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:19,620
When combined,

665
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,490
they react

666
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:22,420
to form water and singlet oxygen.

667
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,620
The singlet oxygen oxidizes

668
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,250
the Luminol,

669
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:25,180
causing it to luminesce.

670
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:25,730
That is

671
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:26,900
the principle of the Luminol test.

672
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:28,420
That's it.

673
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:30,460
Can you simplify it?

674
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,490
So, what if

675
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,180
the iron ions in the blood

676
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:35,490
weren't catalyzed,

677
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:36,980
but were chelated instead?

678
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:40,490
If the iron ions are chelated,

679
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,290
they won't catalyze
the hydrogen peroxide,

680
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,570
and the reaction won't occur.

681
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:45,290
Then the Luminol won't glow.

682
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,180
Can you stop using

683
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,380
so many technical terms?

684
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:49,810
Keep it simple.

685
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:52,330
There's a solution

686
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:53,290
that reacts with iron ions,

687
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:53,980
preventing them

688
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:54,730
from participating

689
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:55,570
in other reactions.

690
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:56,700
So no matter

691
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,490
how we test,

692
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,180
the Luminol won't glow.

693
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:00,770
So,

694
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,810
if we detect traces

695
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:04,620
of the chelating

696
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,490
agent,

697
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,290
we can prove

698
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,290
Hu Jie's primary death scene

699
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:11,980
was at the clinic.

700
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:29,490
Hello?

701
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:32,530
Yes, they did come to me.

702
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:34,420
But I didn't say anything.

703
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:37,330
Understood.

704
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:48,980
Mr. Qi!

705
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,180
Mr. Han!

706
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:53,530
Look here!

707
00:33:58,350 --> 00:33:58,940
Here too.

708
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:02,700
And here.

709
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:12,130
Su,

710
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,940
arrest Chen Chuchuan immediately!

711
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,340
Why are you looking at me?

712
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:58,980
Get to work!

713
00:34:59,030 --> 00:34:59,740
Get to work!

714
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,980
When one loses too much
blood in a short time,

715
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:04,050
they'll lose lucidity.

716
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:05,210
The probability of Wan

717
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:06,460
achieving a precise headshot

718
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:07,300
is extremely low.

719
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:10,010
There might have been a
third person at the scene.

720
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:12,050
I found

721
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:13,570
the suspect with the tattoo on his neck.

722
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:14,650
He was at the hospital then.

723
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:15,610
This drug bottle

724
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:16,740
was found at Cui Hao's home.

725
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,530
Is cedilanid

726
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:19,260
the drug that caused Li Yiqi's death?

727
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,260
This is the patient list from
Chen Chuchuan's clinic.

728
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:22,490
Here are his prescribed drugs.

729
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,820
Mr. Han, we received a tip.

730
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,900
Chen Chuchuan's car seems to be

731
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,380
heading towards the border
town of Luowang.

732
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:27,380
Notify Han Feng

733
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:28,460
to arrest him immediately.
