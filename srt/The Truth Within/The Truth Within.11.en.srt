1
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:43,340
Wan,

2
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,170
goodbye.

3
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:44,730
Okay.

4
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,410
Bye.

5
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:53,500
Zhu.

6
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,570
It's time to get off work.

7
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:56,410
Let's go get dinner.

8
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,780
Long time since we ate.

9
00:03:58,590 --> 00:03:59,010
Wan.

10
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,540
I feel like something's

11
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,100
off about this case.

12
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,980
What's off?

13
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,100
The case's closed.

14
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,290
Relax. Okay?

15
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:08,260
Let's go eat.

16
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:09,060
Ms. Zhu,

17
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,130
check this out.

18
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:12,690
This Ding Youmei is

19
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:13,940
different from what we expected.

20
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:19,700
These kids are really

21
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,660
going wild these days.

22
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,290
There's more.

23
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:27,250
Where's this video from?

24
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,780
I found it online.

25
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,610
Were you researching

26
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:19,780
the brain's reflection

27
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:21,460
of light to help Li Ming

28
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,020
study drugs?

29
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,410
You...

30
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,340
How did you get this?

31
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:26,580
You...

32
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,410
You got into my office?

33
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,020
That's illegal.

34
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,370
You don't have a search warrant.

35
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:35,050
I'm reporting you for trespassing!

36
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:35,700
Huang Zhengming.

37
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:36,100
You...

38
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:36,580
Tell me.

39
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,140
I...

40
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:37,730
You got ties

41
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:38,780
to Raw Diamond?

42
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:39,490
You...

43
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,730
- Huang Zhengming.
- Mr. Huang!

44
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,460
Mr. Huang!

45
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,490
Zhengming.

46
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,370
Mr. Huang!

47
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:46,490
Mr. Huang!

48
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,250
Huang Zhengming.

49
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:48,610
Mr. Huang!

50
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:49,780
Mr. Huang!

51
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:51,850
Mr. Huang!

52
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:55,780
Come in.

53
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:57,850
Okay.

54
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,540
Mr. Bai.

55
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:17,580
Huang Zhengming reported you

56
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,370
for trespassing.

57
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:20,170
His neighbor also testified

58
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,780
that you assaulted Huang Zhengming,

59
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,980
causing him to fall and get injured.

60
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,290
Explain this?

61
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,020
I suspect Huang

62
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,250
was involved with Raw Diamond.

63
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:28,810
Proof.

64
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:30,980
He's got Li Ming's watch.

65
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:32,250
And this.

66
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,250
This paper was written by him.

67
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,140
Combined with recent cases,

68
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,250
Li Yiqi and Li Shuting's reactions

69
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,700
to light are completely consistent

70
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:41,780
with what's written

71
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,930
in this paper.

72
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,580
We checked Huang Zhengming

73
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,980
when we investigated
the Raw Diamond case.

74
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,490
It had nothing to do with him.

75
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,020
Li Ming used

76
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,610
his research results.

77
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,490
Huang Zhengming was unaware.

78
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:56,020
I don't believe it.

79
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:59,020
Mr. Bai,

80
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:01,340
Raw Diamond is still escalating.

81
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,290
This means we haven't caught

82
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:04,610
the real culprit yet.

83
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:05,900
Huang Zhengming...

84
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,220
Hand over your work

85
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,490
to Gao Yuan.

86
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:10,980
Take a few days off.

87
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,930
The truth comes after the evidence.

88
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:25,020
But you've got it backwards.

89
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,810
The truth comes after the evidence.

90
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,810
But you've got it backwards.

91
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:29,930
Song,

92
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:32,700
we've been here so many times.

93
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:34,890
How come we've never seen your daughter?

94
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,420
She's grown up.

95
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:42,490
I can't control her.

96
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:10,100
How old are you?

97
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:11,980
Twenty-nine.

98
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:13,700
Ding Youmei,

99
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,650
who is Gao Huilan?

100
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:18,010
She's my mom.

101
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:19,940
Do you know Liu Yuanyuan?

102
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:23,890
Look closely.

103
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,770
Does this person

104
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:27,940
look familiar?

105
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,300
It's me.

106
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:52,730
Can't I go out with my friends?

107
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:55,820
Yes, you can.

108
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,490
We're not interested

109
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:58,490
in who you hang out with.

110
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,250
Ding Youmei, look at this.

111
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,060
Look closely.

112
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,820
Remember?

113
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,580
The button Liu Yuanyuan's mom,

114
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:19,610
Su Huizhen,

115
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:21,060
was holding before she died

116
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,340
was torn from this coat

117
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,100
of yours.

118
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:31,220
There are so

119
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,370
many similar coats.

120
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:34,700
How can you prove it's mine?

121
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:37,650
My mom has already confessed.

122
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,650
She admitted to killing them.

123
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:42,180
It's not evidence at all.

124
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:45,770
That's not enough?

125
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:47,890
Wait.

126
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:30,060
Liu Yuanyuan's mom

127
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,010
once bought her

128
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:32,010
a stuffed toy.

129
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,370
It contained a

130
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:34,460
hidden camera.

131
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:44,580
We found a video.

132
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:45,940
Can you

133
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,100
recover the video?

134
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,220
The previous data was overwritten.

135
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,060
We need it now.

136
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,340
Okay, I'll try.

137
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:52,850
Look.

138
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:54,850
Is this you?

139
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:02,420
No.

140
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,850
This... It can't be.

141
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,220
This... It can't be!

142
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,580
No. Impossible.

143
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:11,730
It's impossible!

144
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:12,610
No.

145
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:13,650
Impossible.

146
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:15,460
Go ask my mom.

147
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:16,820
Let my mom handle this.

148
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,530
Go ask my mom!

149
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:18,420
Ding Youmei.

150
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:20,980
No use finding anyone.

151
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:33,580
Speak.

152
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:42,650
Come on.

153
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,850
Why did you kill Su Huizhen?

154
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:57,650
Fine.

155
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,060
When

156
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,100
my dad

157
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,300
died,

158
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,010
I thought my good days

159
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:11,100
were finally coming.

160
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:12,980
But what happened?

161
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:15,460
My mom always said

162
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,460
she was doing it for my own good,

163
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:20,850
using protecting me as a cover

164
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,850
to make me the girl she wanted me to be.

165
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,940
Is making me

166
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,940
the obedient girl

167
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,250
she envisions good for me?

168
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,980
Am I wrong to want

169
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,100
to live my own life?

170
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:34,340
Why did she give the money

171
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,340
that belonged to me

172
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:37,250
to Liu Yuanyuan and her mom?

173
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:38,100
Why?

174
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:40,530
Yeah.

175
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:43,940
They don't love me.

176
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:47,850
They don't love me at all.

177
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,980
Liu Yuanyuan

178
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:45,770
was an

179
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:47,220
ungrateful bitch.

180
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:50,530
My mom gave her money

181
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,300
to take the exam for me.

182
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,180
She used

183
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,060
that money to treat her mom

184
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,530
so she could live a few more years.

185
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:58,340
This was

186
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,610
a fair deal.

187
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:01,730
She didn't want to take
the exam herself.

188
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,130
She didn't take it the first year,

189
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,770
but she could have taken it again.

190
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:06,420
She didn't take it.

191
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,730
Why was she blaming me?

192
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,300
Yes.

193
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,130
Liu Yuanyuan wanted to kill me.

194
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,650
She wanted to kill me.

195
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:17,980
I acted in self-defense.

196
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:18,850
She deserved to die!

197
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:19,700
She wanted to kill me!

198
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,940
She deserved to die!

199
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,650
Ding Youmei,

200
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,420
you killed my mom.

201
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,250
You murdered her.

202
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,010
Why are you

203
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:46,340
and your mom

204
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,610
haunting me like ghosts?

205
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,130
You know

206
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,460
your mom's health better than I do.

207
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:52,890
Do you think she

208
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:53,850
was happy living

209
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:54,650
in such pain?

210
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,010
Can you say you never wanted

211
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:57,180
her to die sooner?

212
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:01,250
Stop pretending.

213
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,300
I was helping you.

214
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:06,250
I was freeing you from your life.

215
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:07,730
I was also freeing you

216
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:08,820
from her life.

217
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:11,220
You should be thanking me.

218
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,370
You murderer!

219
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,650
If I find out you're asking

220
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:16,850
my mom for money again,

221
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:19,530
you'll be the one who dies next.

222
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,460
Give me the button.

223
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:35,340
Liu Yuanyuan!

224
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:36,700
Liu Yuanyuan!

225
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,010
I'm telling you,

226
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:41,220
don't show up

227
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,420
in front

228
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,220
of me again!

229
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:46,060
Don't ask my mom for money again.

230
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,460
Don't ask my mom for money again!

231
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:49,610
Liu Yuanyuan,

232
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,340
I don't want to see you again!

233
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,060
You'd better disappear.

234
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:56,130
What are you doing?

235
00:16:59,030 --> 00:16:59,460
Mom!

236
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:01,010
She tried to kill me!

237
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:03,130
You killed my mom.

238
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,250
You have to pay for her life!

239
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:13,980
Mei.

240
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:16,530
Tell me.

241
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:18,860
What have you done?

242
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:21,700
You...

243
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,290
You really killed her mom?

244
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:30,940
Yes.

245
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,180
I killed her.

246
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,810
What's wrong, Mom?

247
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:42,940
Why are you looking at me?

248
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,220
Do you feel that your good daughter

249
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,660
has disappointed you again?

250
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:01,570
Yuan,

251
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:03,330
listen to me.

252
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:04,490
Please,

253
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:05,940
please don't tell anyone about this,

254
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:06,380
okay?

255
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,460
Youmei was wrong.

256
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,660
She was wrong.

257
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:12,420
She knows it.

258
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,050
I beg you,

259
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,140
please don't tell anyone about this,

260
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:15,700
okay?

261
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:16,420
You can start

262
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,980
over with your life.

263
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:18,900
I beg you.

264
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:20,330
Mei was really wrong.

265
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:21,330
Please.

266
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,420
I'll give you all my money.

267
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,530
You can go to school,

268
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,860
you can open a bookstore,

269
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,940
or any other shop.

270
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:27,770
Please.

271
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:29,250
Don't tell anyone about this,

272
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:29,810
okay?

273
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:31,460
I'm sorry.

274
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:32,810
I can be your mom.

275
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:33,980
I can take care of you.

276
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,290
Okay? Please.

277
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:37,330
Don't tell anyone, okay?

278
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,530
Don't tell anyone, okay?

279
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:54,940
What did I do?

280
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:02,050
It's okay.

281
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:03,570
It's okay.

282
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:05,810
It's okay.

283
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,090
Mom,

284
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:24,620
you said you would protect me,

285
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:26,420
right?

286
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:46,570
No, that's not it.

287
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:48,140
You must have made a mistake.

288
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,460
I killed them.

289
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,090
How could it be my daughter?

290
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,330
She was so well-behaved.

291
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:55,220
How could she possibly kill someone?

292
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:56,980
I killed Yuan

293
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,180
and her mom.

294
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:58,730
Gao Huilan,

295
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,010
you keep saying you're

296
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:03,700
protecting your daughter.

297
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,570
Do you know

298
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,140
that what you did

299
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,290
is harming her?

300
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:15,220
Eleven years ago,

301
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,620
you had Liu Yuanyuan

302
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:18,460
take the exam for your daughter.

303
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,660
From that day on,

304
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,090
you chose the

305
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:24,530
wrong path for her.

306
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,490
If you really wanted to help her,

307
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,620
you should have guided her,

308
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:37,730
letting her find her own path

309
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:39,290
through her own efforts.

310
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,050
You should have shown her

311
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:42,940
what's right.

312
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,860
Your daughter has ended up

313
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:52,490
like this because of you.

314
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,420
Wait.

315
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:10,620
Wait.

316
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,380
I don't want to go.

317
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:30,770
Where's my mom?

318
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:32,900
Please call my mom to save me!

319
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:34,570
Call my mom to save me!

320
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:36,660
Please call my mom to save me!

321
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:38,860
I'm begging you.

322
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,900
Please call my mom to save me!

323
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:43,530
Call my mom to save me!

324
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:53,090
Come on.

325
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:55,700
Here, your favorite beef tenderloin.

326
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,620
Is there any more?

327
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,220
There's plenty.

328
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,290
Don't order too much.

329
00:21:59,310 --> 00:21:59,860
It's too much.

330
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:00,900
That's enough.

331
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:01,330
Thanks.

332
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,380
Don't eat all.

333
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,330
Let's wait for Mr. Qi.

334
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:05,700
Mr. Qi.

335
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:06,220
Mr. Qi.

336
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:06,570
Mr. Qi.

337
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:07,530
Mr. Qi.

338
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:08,810
Sit here.

339
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,940
Su, sit.

340
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,620
Mr. Qi,

341
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:25,810
it's just a suspension.

342
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,330
It's nothing serious.

343
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,050
After noon tomorrow,

344
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:29,900
you'll still

345
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,140
be the chief forensic pathologist.

346
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:32,620
Don't worry.

347
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:36,730
Um,

348
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,140
I'll make a toast on behalf of Mr. Han.

349
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,980
We solved this case.

350
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:43,090
Everyone worked hard.

351
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:44,660
Mr. Han said

352
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:46,730
he wanted to thank Mr. Qi.

353
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,530
Without Mr. Qi,

354
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,330
we wouldn't have

355
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:50,050
solved it so quickly.

356
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,250
Let's all toast Mr. Qi.

357
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:52,530
Yeah.

358
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,050
Cheers.

359
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:53,530
Come on.

360
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,530
Thank you guys.

361
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,140
Mr. Qi.

362
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:55,940
Come on.

363
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:57,660
Waiter.

364
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:58,180
Come on.

365
00:22:59,000 --> 00:22:59,660
Oh, Zhu.

366
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,700
Speaking of which,

367
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,490
your interrogation skills

368
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:04,860
have improved lately.

369
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,420
You've even

370
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,290
surpassed me.

371
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,290
I never taught you like that.

372
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:10,660
I learned from my brother.

373
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:13,140
Ms. Zhu was awesome.

374
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,490
If it were me, I would've

375
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,380
given myself away.

376
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:16,220
I couldn't do it.

377
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:19,290
Liu Yuanyuan's mom

378
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:20,290
once bought her

379
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:21,220
a stuffed toy.

380
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,660
It contained

381
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,770
a hidden camera.

382
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,900
Tech said the video

383
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,490
was overwritten.

384
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:27,090
Can't be recovered.

385
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,490
Just a screenshot?

386
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:30,940
Yes.

387
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:33,490
Okay, I got it.

388
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:45,860
You're really something.

389
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,140
What if it gets exposed...

390
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,530
Don't say that. Shut up.

391
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:53,940
Mr. Qi,

392
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,420
we all hope there's no

393
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:56,460
misunderstanding between

394
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:57,490
you and Mr. Han.

395
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:00,620
Mr. Han pleaded with Mr. Bai.

396
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,090
He told Mr. Bai

397
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,420
he hoped he would

398
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,010
be punished along with you.

399
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,490
Pleading with Mr. Bai

400
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,460
isn't something

401
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,140
you'd do.

402
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:31,490
Do you know why

403
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:32,420
I stopped you from

404
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,490
investigating Huang Zhengming?

405
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:36,810
I solved the Raw Diamond case.

406
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:39,420
I know better than you
whether he's guilty.

407
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:41,980
But you still insisted.

408
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,090
I did act impulsively

409
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:50,290
regarding Mr. Huang.

410
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,530
That watch was a gift from Li Ming.

411
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:57,900
Do you believe my reasoning?

412
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,090
If you're coming to talk

413
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:04,220
about Raw Diamond,

414
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:05,010
no, thanks.

415
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:06,810
Let's do it another day.

416
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:39,180
Dear citizens,

417
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,010
this is a fire alarm.

418
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,770
Please remain calm

419
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,180
and evacuate in an orderly manner.

420
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,380
Please note,

421
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:48,420
the fire alarm will sound continuously

422
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:50,220
for 30 seconds at a time.

423
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,980
Please take immediate action

424
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,380
upon hearing the alarm.

425
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,940
Ensure your safety.

426
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,490
Dear citizens,

427
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:02,220
this is a fire alarm.

428
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:04,050
Please remain calm

429
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:06,290
and evacuate in an orderly manner.

430
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:07,490
Please note,

431
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:09,570
the fire alarm will sound continuously

432
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,420
for 30 seconds at a time.

433
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:13,250
Please take immediate action

434
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:14,490
upon hearing the alarm.

435
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:16,140
Ensure your safety.

436
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:40,860
Li Yiqi is dead?

437
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,620
The fire alarm went off

438
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,460
at 1:15 AM yesterday.

439
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,290
The on-duty

440
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,250
doctor then found

441
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:49,180
Li Yiqi dead in his ward.

442
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,700
Hospital surveillance footage

443
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:51,570
shows a person

444
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:52,730
wearing a doctor's coat

445
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:53,980
entered the ward

446
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:54,770
before Li Yiqi died.

447
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:56,420
But no face was captured on camera.

448
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,330
What's the cause of death?

449
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:05,140
Mr. Gao's conducting tests.

450
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:14,730
Everyone,

451
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:15,770
listen up.

452
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,620
This person is currently
the prime suspect.

453
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,330
We'd expand the investigation.

454
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,620
We must find him.

455
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:22,660
Yes.

456
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:46,660
We checked the surveillance footage.

457
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,730
He went towards the parking lot.

458
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:50,810
The cause of death is confirmed.

459
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:53,530
An allergic reaction

460
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:54,660
to medication led

461
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,380
to asphyxiation.

462
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,810
It's very likely digoxin.

463
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,420
We found the suspect's license plate.

464
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:06,220
B53617.

465
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,770
The plate is fake.

466
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,050
But traffic police tracked him

467
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,730
into Fenglin Ducheng
Community last night

468
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:14,140
and he stayed there for an hour.

469
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:15,460
Coincidentally,

470
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,570
an incident occurred there

471
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,730
at the same time.

472
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,050
Ms. Zhu has already gone there.

473
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:30,460
The deceased in the Fenglin

474
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,250
Ducheng Community

475
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:32,860
fall case is Zhai Xixi, 24 years old.

476
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,140
A neighbor heard a heavy thud

477
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,250
around 1 AM last night

478
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:38,140
and found her lying

479
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,220
on the ground.

480
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:40,900
The initial assessment

481
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:41,980
is suicide.

482
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:43,140
But whether

483
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,490
homicide can be completely ruled out

484
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,140
requires further investigation.

485
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,140
The deceased's father believes

486
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,290
she couldn't have committed suicide.

487
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:06,490
Mr. Han,

488
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:07,730
the car was last seen

489
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:09,290
at a construction site not far away.

490
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:11,250
A Worker noticed thick smoke

491
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:11,940
and got suspicious.

492
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:12,810
When he arrived,

493
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:13,900
he only found the car.

494
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:15,090
He didn't see anyone else.

495
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,180
The car was completely burned

496
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,090
when it was found.

497
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:30,380
Mr. Han,

498
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,420
the car is

499
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,290
completely burned.

500
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,220
What could possibly be left?

501
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:36,730
Tow it back for inspection.

502
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:54,220
You mean you just got home when

503
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:54,860
your daughter fell?

504
00:32:58,960 --> 00:32:59,860
You've been drinking?

505
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:02,490
I only had a little.

506
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:04,530
I was not drunk.

507
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:20,660
Xi.

508
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:24,010
Xi?

509
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:28,090
I called out a few times.

510
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,290
Xi?

511
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,900
I didn't see her.

512
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:32,980
I thought she might

513
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:38,050
had taken Xiaoshan out.

514
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:44,770
Xi?

515
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,570
Xi.

516
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,290
Before I could even sit down,

517
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:53,460
someone knocked on my door.

518
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:57,010
Zhai! Zhai!

519
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,180
Zhai! Zhai, open the door!

520
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:01,290
Open the door, Zhai!

521
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,490
Open the door!

522
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,090
Zhai!

523
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:07,050
Zhai! Your daughter fell!

524
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:09,050
Come with me.

525
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:12,610
What's wrong with this elevator?

526
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:14,260
Come on.

527
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,210
Hurry. Hurry.

528
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,940
I ran downstairs

529
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,530
and saw my daughter

530
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:31,010
lying there.

531
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:56,690
With all that

532
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:57,460
commotion,

533
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,260
didn't you hear

534
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,460
Zhai Xixi's cries for help?

535
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:01,010
I...

536
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:03,690
She...

537
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:05,530
She was mute.

538
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:07,980
She couldn't make a sound.

539
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:12,820
Ms. Zhu.

540
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:15,610
This is Zhai Xixi's brother,

541
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:16,170
Zhai Xiaoshan.

542
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:16,900
He just came home.

543
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:17,530
It was you!

544
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:18,460
It was you!

545
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:19,860
You killed Mom,

546
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:21,530
and now you've killed my sister!

547
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,340
Xiaoshan.

548
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:22,980
Xiaoshan.

549
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:24,300
Why did you kill her?

550
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,260
Why did you kill her?

551
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,050
Xiaoshan, let go.

552
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:27,740
Calm down.

553
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:28,860
Why did you kill her?

554
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,130
Why?

555
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:30,610
Calm down.

556
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:31,900
You ruined this family!

557
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:32,380
Xiaoshan!

558
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:34,300
You ruined this family!

559
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:34,860
Kid, shh.

560
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:35,210
Xiaoshan.

561
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,340
Xi.

562
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:36,980
Xiaoshan.

563
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,900
Give me back my sister!

564
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:39,820
Calm down.

565
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,820
Xi.

566
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:41,900
Calm down.

567
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:43,300
Calm down. Speak slowly. Let go.

568
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:43,980
Come on.

569
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,490
Calm down. Calm down.

570
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:46,740
He killed

571
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:48,130
my sister.

572
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,130
Arrest him.

573
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:58,170
Xiaoshan.

574
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:58,740
Xiaoshan!

575
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,570
What happened to him?

576
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,530
Xiaoshan?

577
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:01,460
What's wrong with him?

578
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:03,130
My son has a heart problem.

579
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:03,780
Come on.

580
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,210
Ambulance! Hurry!

581
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:06,010
Call an ambulance!

582
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:38,530
Mr. Qi,

583
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,050
look.

584
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:49,860
Zhai Xixi had an unusual

585
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,050
bruise on her left ankle.

586
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,490
Was this injury present

587
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,780
at the scene?

588
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:54,780
No.

589
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:07,380
Ms. Zhu, I'll go to the hospital.

590
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,130
Be careful.

591
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:14,340
I'll ask the neighbors

592
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,050
again.

593
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:22,530
Ms. Zhu.

594
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:24,260
Mr. Qi.

595
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:25,860
The autopsy is over.

596
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:26,980
There are some doubts.

597
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:29,380
I want to go back to confirm.

598
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:34,170
There are several abrasions on the body,

599
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,530
but no contusions or lacerations.

600
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:37,570
There's a fracture on the
right side of the skull.

601
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,900
The cervical spine's severely fractured.

602
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:40,570
There is a large amount
of vomiting blood.

603
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,010
The organs are severely ruptured.

604
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:43,900
The cause of death

605
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:44,980
is confirmed as a fall from a height.

606
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:51,420
The toxicology test?

607
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:53,490
The results aren't out yet.

608
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,420
Before Zhai Xixi fell,

609
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:17,690
a witness saw someone

610
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,170
under the tree

611
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:22,420
constantly flashing

612
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,940
a flashlight.

613
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:24,860
And she

614
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,610
jumped at the same time.

615
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:29,260
But that was a blind spot

616
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:30,460
for the cameras.

617
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,650
Based on everyone's testimonies

618
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:33,490
and the traces at the scene,

619
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:34,460
it can be inferred

620
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,420
that she struggled before her death.

621
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,490
She most likely fell accidentally.

622
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:39,940
Mr. Qi,

623
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,740
what were the doubts you mentioned?

624
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,300
Her right shoe was still on her foot.

625
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:53,860
Where was the

626
00:38:54,110 --> 00:38:55,170
left shoe originally?

627
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:56,210
Here.

628
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:02,940
I checked.

629
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:04,690
Her right shoe was very

630
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:05,860
securely fastened.

631
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,570
The laces showed no signs of loosening.

632
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,170
I tried.

633
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,340
It's practically impossible

634
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,460
for her shoe to come off

635
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,050
on its own without the

636
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:13,900
laces being loosened.

637
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:15,490
But her left shoe

638
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,210
came off.

639
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:19,010
So someone loosened

640
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:21,050
her shoelaces so her

641
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:22,740
left shoe fell?

642
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:24,860
Look.

643
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,490
There's blood on the balcony railing.

644
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,130
This means she must have struggled

645
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,340
for a while

646
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:33,860
while holding onto the railing

647
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:35,340
before falling.

648
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:38,900
So her fall

649
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,050
was probably

650
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,650
near vertical.

651
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,170
But her body

652
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:46,900
was still some distance

653
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:48,460
from the building.

654
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:26,780
Let's go downstairs.

655
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:37,860
Zhu.

656
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:40,490
I've asked all the

657
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:41,460
neighbors upstairs.

658
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,210
Didn't get any useful information.

659
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:47,570
Hello?

660
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,780
Stop. Nobody's there.

661
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:53,860
That apartment is listed for sale.

662
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:55,260
This one.

663
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:57,090
Shiyi Real Estate.

664
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,010
Thanks.

665
00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:03,650
Wan,

666
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:04,610
call and check.

667
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,460
I don't know what went wrong today.

668
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:09,130
Someone fell from the building.

669
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:10,940
Now there are kids fighting

670
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,090
in the stairwell.

671
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:13,690
So much trouble.

672
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:19,940
Come on.

673
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:20,860
Come on in.

674
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:21,780
This is it.

675
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:29,780
Has this door been open all along?

676
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:33,300
I can't quite remember.

677
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:39,420
Has anyone come recently?

678
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:41,900
The last person came

679
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:42,780
was probably last month.

680
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,740
The market is bad lately.

681
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:46,340
This apartment is old,

682
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,420
and the owner won't lower the price.

683
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,570
Now with this incident,

684
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,300
it's even harder to sell.

685
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:55,610
Officer,

686
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,050
are you here to investigate the fall?

687
00:41:59,030 --> 00:41:59,900
Mind your

688
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:00,690
own business.

689
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,340
Besides you, does anyone else have a key

690
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:04,530
to this apartment?

691
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:07,010
They only entrusted it to our company.

692
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:08,740
The landlord left us

693
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:09,460
a spare key.

694
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:10,420
We bring clients

695
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:11,460
to see the apartment.

696
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:19,260
Ms. Zhu!

697
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:23,980
Take us over there.

698
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:26,490
What's wrong, Mr. Qi?

699
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:27,650
Look.

700
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:33,090
This clothesline is bent.

701
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,690
There were bruises

702
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,780
on Zhai Xixi's left ankle.

703
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:46,650
But these marks weren't

704
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,050
on the body

705
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:49,050
at the scene.

706
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:51,210
They appeared slowly

707
00:42:51,510 --> 00:42:52,420
during the autopsy.

708
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:54,420
This is the result

709
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,170
of strong pressure

710
00:42:57,190 --> 00:42:58,050
on the skin.

711
00:42:58,510 --> 00:42:59,860
The signs don't appear immediately.

712
00:43:00,510 --> 00:43:01,420
It can take minutes

713
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:02,650
or hours.

714
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:03,860
So

715
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:06,090
the bruises on Zhai Xixi's ankle

716
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:08,820
must have been caused shortly

717
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:09,900
before or after her death.

718
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:11,940
I suspect

719
00:43:13,030 --> 00:43:13,780
her bruises

720
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,340
were caused by falling

721
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:16,300
on the clothesline.

722
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:24,740
Zhai Xixi may not

723
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,170
have fallen accidentally.

724
00:43:27,670 --> 00:43:28,340
She may have been murdered.

725
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:01,650
Three months ago,

726
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:02,570
Zhai Xixi bought an insurance

727
00:44:02,590 --> 00:44:03,690
worth three million.

728
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:04,980
The beneficiary is Zhai Xiaoshan.

729
00:44:05,230 --> 00:44:05,860
Suicide?

730
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:07,780
She wouldn't abandon us.

731
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:10,210
The wear on the heels of
these two pairs of shoes

732
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:11,010
is completely different.

733
00:44:11,070 --> 00:44:12,050
When she fell...

734
00:44:12,070 --> 00:44:13,130
There must have been
someone else present.

735
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:14,900
Someone switched her left shoe.

736
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:16,900
Mr. Han, Mr. Qi.

737
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:17,740
Got it.

738
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:19,570
The people who could
enter those two rooms

739
00:44:19,630 --> 00:44:20,380
must be real estate agents.

740
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:21,300
A witness said there were flashes

741
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:23,090
of light coming from the
building across the street.

742
00:44:23,230 --> 00:44:24,570
You suspect she's like

743
00:44:24,590 --> 00:44:25,650
Li Yiqi and Li Shuting?

744
00:44:26,150 --> 00:44:28,010
You all think the truth is important.

745
00:44:28,030 --> 00:44:30,170
Sometimes the truth is meaningless.

746
00:44:30,550 --> 00:44:32,460
Lies always leave traces.
