1
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,130
Mr. Gao.

2
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:42,690
Hey.

3
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,130
His neck

4
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:54,220
was broken?

5
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:55,090
Yes.

6
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:56,730
The murderer used a lot of force,

7
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:58,180
causing the victim's cervical vertebrae

8
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,220
to fracture and become misaligned.

9
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,090
We just checked

10
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:02,300
the victim's eyes.

11
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:03,900
It must have happened suddenly.

12
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:05,050
He didn't have time to react.

13
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,570
This powder

14
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,490
was probably sprinkled

15
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:19,900
on him after he died.

16
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,490
Good.

17
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:13,260
[Episode 18]

18
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:30,500
The body is still warm.

19
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,780
The suspect shouldn't have gone far.

20
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,450
Request backup.

21
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,780
Conduct a thorough search.

22
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:35,940
Okay.

23
00:03:59,470 --> 00:03:59,940
Chen,

24
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,850
are you really going to
switch to psychology?

25
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,980
The trauma from mental illness

26
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:07,850
far outweighs

27
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:09,540
the pain from physical illness.

28
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:11,220
Helping others is helping yourself.

29
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:15,980
You're too young.

30
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,340
You'll understand when you grow up.

31
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:18,580
I'm not a kid.

32
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:22,700
Promise me

33
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,020
you'll become an excellent

34
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:25,850
forensic pathologist.

35
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:28,900
Okay.

36
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,020
Bye.

37
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,610
Human

38
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:53,100
consciousness

39
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:54,700
is like

40
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,580
an iceberg on the water.

41
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,490
Only the small tip

42
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:01,700
above the surface

43
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:04,100
is what you and others

44
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,140
truly want to see.

45
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,370
I never addressed

46
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:47,250
him as brother.

47
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,100
I always called him Wan.

48
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:51,460
But now he can't

49
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:52,980
hear me anymore.

50
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:58,540
Wan would be very gratified.

51
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:39,900
Salute!

52
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:53,140
Attention!

53
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:56,100
Hats off!

54
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,250
Silent tribute!

55
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:21,810
Attention!

56
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,250
Ms. Zhu!

57
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:59,050
Based on the extracted fingerprints

58
00:07:59,070 --> 00:07:59,980
and skin tissue,

59
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,340
we compared them with the database.

60
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,490
We can now confirm

61
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:03,660
the suspect is Wang Bo.

62
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:05,850
Okay.

63
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:07,930
Su.

64
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,410
Check on Wang Bo.

65
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:12,490
Okay.

66
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:19,540
Wang Bo was imprisoned four years ago

67
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,340
for intentional assault.

68
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:20,980
After his release,

69
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,100
he disappeared.

70
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,140
He told other inmates

71
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,780
that he had a girlfriend named Fan Xiao

72
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,780
who worked at a massage parlor.

73
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,050
We don't know which

74
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:27,780
massage parlor yet.

75
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:30,980
Let's split up and investigate.

76
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,010
We must find Wang Bo.

77
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,060
Let's go in.

78
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:34,530
Okay.

79
00:08:59,480 --> 00:08:59,940
Gao Yuan.

80
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,220
Mr. Qi,

81
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,490
find anything?

82
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:05,730
Look.

83
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:10,980
These drugs should all

84
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,530
be experimental samples.

85
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:18,340
Wang Bo has murdered

86
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,650
Li Yiqi, Wang Chen,

87
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,060
Cui Hao, Wan Guoxin, and others.

88
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:22,890
This constitutes

89
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,100
a major serial

90
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,250
murder case.

91
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:26,700
If the organization behind it

92
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,460
isn't cracked soon,

93
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:28,580
more people

94
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,490
may die.

95
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,490
Mr. Bai.

96
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:33,940
We analyzed the

97
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,700
drugs extracted

98
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:35,940
from Chen Chuchuan's body.

99
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:37,060
The drugs

100
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:38,370
also contain

101
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,490
antidepressant components.

102
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,460
We combined previous cases,

103
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,940
including Li Yiqi, Li Shuting,

104
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,730
Xiao Lin, Song Weimin, and others.

105
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:47,770
We found

106
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:49,060
that the chemical formula

107
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,010
of this new drug has

108
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,340
been constantly modified.

109
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:54,300
You mean the two drugs

110
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,490
might be the same drug?

111
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:56,370
Very likely.

112
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,490
It should be a new type of drug.

113
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,100
And Wang Bo is also

114
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,530
related to the new drug.

115
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:02,890
Although we cannot

116
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,460
yet confirm whether this drug

117
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:05,940
is Raw Diamond,

118
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,530
in terms of harm,

119
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:09,060
it has surpassed Raw Diamond.

120
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:14,650
I have already reported

121
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:17,370
this case to the provincial bureaus.

122
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:19,530
They have decided to establish
a special task force

123
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,130
and require our criminal
investigation team

124
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,650
to cooperate with the drug enforcement.

125
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,250
The provincial task force

126
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:24,980
is on its way

127
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:25,980
and will be here soon.

128
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,010
We must eradicate all new drugs

129
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,530
as quickly as possible.

130
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,370
Yes.

131
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:48,340
Guys,

132
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,370
Cao Liangsheng, captain of the

133
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,700
Provincial Narcotics Control Bureau,

134
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:54,490
is in charge of this case.

135
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:57,530
Mr. Cao, please.

136
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,060
Given that this case

137
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:02,490
involves several

138
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:03,610
major criminal cases

139
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,460
and is also related to drugs,

140
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:07,890
the Provincial Bureau has decided to
establish a special task force

141
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:10,060
to conduct a joint investigation.

142
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,490
Lixing,

143
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,850
please tell us

144
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:13,940
about what you know.

145
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:14,420
Okay.

146
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:16,980
There is a drug dealer

147
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,340
in Decang City

148
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,340
named Nuo Sha.

149
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,490
His real name is Zhang Fu.

150
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:21,820
Everyone calls him General.

151
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,610
He is very mysterious

152
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:24,700
because no one

153
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,340
has ever seen

154
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,250
his real face.

155
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:28,820
He has been dealing drugs

156
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:30,180
in Decang City since the 1970s.

157
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:31,730
But 20 years ago,

158
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,730
the police destroyed his
drug trafficking group.

159
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,650
He fled abroad and disappeared.

160
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,370
Six months ago,

161
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:37,940
we received a report from an informant

162
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:39,250
that Nuo Sha

163
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,610
would be active soon.

164
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,340
Moreover, he has already

165
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:43,420
sent people to He City.

166
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,650
Have you found out their purpose

167
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:46,220
in coming here?

168
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:47,850
It's highly likely that they

169
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:48,940
are dealing in this new drug.

170
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,250
We've investigated many

171
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:51,370
traditional drug markets

172
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:52,220
and found no trace

173
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,730
of the new drug.

174
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,370
We've found that the transaction

175
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:57,370
volume in traditional drug markets

176
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:58,580
is decreasing sharply.

177
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:00,180
That's all we know.

178
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:01,980
Han Feng,

179
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,610
provide an update on the

180
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:04,250
situation in He City.

181
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,460
We've discovered

182
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,220
that all the cases

183
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,180
involving the new drug

184
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,100
are connected

185
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,010
to criminal cases.

186
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,770
In the 788 Bar stabbing case,

187
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:13,300
the perpetrator, Li Yiqi,

188
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,490
exhibited unusual behavior

189
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:16,060
and phototaxis after using it.

190
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,820
Next is the spider case

191
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,300
at Bat Cave.

192
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,420
The perpetrator, Li Shuting,

193
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,340
also exhibited

194
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,530
the same phototaxis.

195
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,370
Li Shuting had consulted

196
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:25,940
a psychiatric clinic a year ago

197
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:27,730
and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.

198
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:28,980
Her method of murder

199
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,700
mimicked a spider's predation.

200
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,010
Then there's the Donghu
double homicide case.

201
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:34,130
The victim, Song Weimin,

202
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,650
also exhibited phototaxis.

203
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:36,650
Following this lead,

204
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:37,940
we located the clinic

205
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:38,850
of Chen Chuchuan

206
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:40,650
and discovered that the

207
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:41,490
medications he prescribed

208
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:43,700
contained components of this new drug.

209
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,100
Currently, this component

210
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,180
is still experimental

211
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,180
and has not been widely
distributed on the market.

212
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,370
All of these patients

213
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:50,300
suffer

214
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,770
from mental illnesses.

215
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,490
Nuo Sha's sudden action indicates

216
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:55,580
that the deployment

217
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:56,980
and trafficking of this
new drug has begun.

218
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:57,850
We need

219
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,820
to find the source

220
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,820
of these drugs as soon as possible.

221
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:01,060
Mr. Qi,

222
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,580
tell us more

223
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:03,770
about this new drug.

224
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,250
Yes.

225
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:06,980
We deduced the evolution

226
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,130
and development

227
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:09,060
of the new drug

228
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:09,940
from previous

229
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,100
related cases.

230
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:12,370
We found

231
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:13,890
that as the

232
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:14,730
new drug evolves,

233
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:16,130
the symptoms of users

234
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,220
also change.

235
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,890
But one thing is common.

236
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:20,890
They experience a blissful feeling

237
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,730
in the initial stages

238
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,770
of use.

239
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:25,730
However, as the dosage increases,

240
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,700
they gradually begin

241
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:28,730
to experience hallucinations

242
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,100
and feelings of fear.

243
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,890
Ultimately, they become addicted,

244
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:34,180
leading to self-harm
and violent behavior.

245
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:35,100
These drugs

246
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,530
are constantly evolving,

247
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:38,700
but their origin is consistent.

248
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,010
These drugs

249
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,460
are likely experimental.

250
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,530
This origin is

251
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:44,490
the same as Raw Diamond.

252
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,820
We have confirmed

253
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,460
that the new drug and Raw Diamond

254
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:49,940
are identical

255
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,250
in their core atomic components.

256
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,340
If it is an upgraded
version of Raw Diamond,

257
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:58,420
the situation will become more serious.

258
00:13:59,480 --> 00:13:59,850
Ms. Zhu,

259
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:02,610
what leads

260
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:03,940
do you have

261
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,770
on the suspect,

262
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:05,770
Wang Bo?

263
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:07,180
We're all set up.

264
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:08,700
We believe we'll catch him soon.

265
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:11,980
Do you have

266
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,610
anything to add?

267
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:13,730
We found

268
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,010
a body this morning.

269
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,220
The deceased died

270
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,370
from having his neck broken.

271
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:18,850
We found some white powder

272
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:19,610
at the scene.

273
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:20,700
This powder contains

274
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,530
small amounts

275
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:23,100
of components of the new drug.

276
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:24,460
Based on the surveillance footage,

277
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:25,820
we got the murderer's face.

278
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:28,300
Biao.

279
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,460
He's one of Nuo Sha's henchmen.

280
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:31,940
He's been active on the border.

281
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,060
It seems Nuo Sha

282
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,180
has started making moves.

283
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:49,180
I misjudged

284
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,130
the Raw Diamond case.

285
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,130
Now that

286
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,130
we've confirmed

287
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:01,940
Raw Diamond isn't over,

288
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:03,940
let's investigate

289
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,490
and find the real murderer of Fei.

290
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:10,250
This time,

291
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:12,890
we must catch him.

292
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,530
According to our investigation,

293
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,650
Biao has an accomplice.

294
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:25,180
They are hiding in this building.

295
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:32,420
Ms. Zhu,

296
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:33,980
Biao went in your direction.

297
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:40,890
Su and I will handle him.

298
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,250
Go get the other one.

299
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,220
Roger.

300
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:15,130
Ms. Zhu, Biao is

301
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:16,060
trying to run!

302
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:17,300
Stop!

303
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:22,370
Move!

304
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:43,130
Trying to run?

305
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:44,180
Keep running.

306
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,250
Come on.

307
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,090
Police. Don't move!

308
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:23,730
Stop!

309
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,050
Lie down.

310
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,090
On your knees!

311
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,980
Trying to destroy evidence?

312
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,330
I'll kill you.

313
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:48,490
Come on.

314
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:48,940
Come on.

315
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:49,460
Come on.

316
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:59,050
Not moving now?

317
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:01,420
Trying to kill me?

318
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:07,940
Take him away.

319
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:15,660
Mr. Han. Mr. Han.

320
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:16,460
Are you alright?

321
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:17,460
Yeah.

322
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:17,940
Where's Wu Ya?

323
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:18,700
In the back.

324
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:22,180
Sit still.

325
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,460
Behave yourself.

326
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:24,140
Come on.

327
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:24,900
Let's go back.

328
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:36,770
Do you know him?

329
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:41,010
You killed him, right?

330
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:45,530
Do you know this guy?

331
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:47,420
Did you kill him?

332
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,050
You've been here for a week
and you've already killed a man.

333
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:53,140
Do you think

334
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,420
this is Decang City?

335
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,180
I don't know anything.

336
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:58,530
Don't know?

337
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:03,570
Watch this video.

338
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,810
Is that you in the video?

339
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:07,900
Why did you kill him?

340
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:11,900
When we caught you,

341
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,090
we found a large quantity of drugs.

342
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,290
Do you know what the penalty is

343
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:16,420
for carrying so many drugs here?

344
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:17,420
According

345
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,900
to Article 348 of the Criminal Law of

346
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,250
the People's Republic of China,

347
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,090
anyone illegally possessing more

348
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:23,180
than one kilogram of opium,

349
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,250
more than 50 grams of heroin

350
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:26,220
or methamphetamine,

351
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:27,980
or other drugs shall be sentenced

352
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,900
to not less than seven years

353
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,860
or life imprisonment

354
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,010
and shall also be fined.

355
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:36,330
Think about the consequences.

356
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:38,980
Consequences?

357
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:40,620
What consequences?

358
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,660
I'm unlucky to have been caught

359
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,460
by you this time.

360
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:47,180
But it's okay.

361
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:49,140
I'll still be a hero

362
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,570
in my next life.

363
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:53,810
Yeah.

364
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:54,570
It's okay.

365
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:56,090
Even if you don't tell,

366
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,420
Wu Ya will.

367
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:00,180
You might not know

368
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,460
my relationship with Biao.

369
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:02,980
We're friends who have

370
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,380
gone through death together.

371
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,700
He would never betray me.

372
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,620
Biao told us

373
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,220
he went out

374
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,660
to buy medicine for you.

375
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,660
He told us a lot of things about you.

376
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,220
Do you want to know?

377
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,220
Wu Ya

378
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,090
told you?

379
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:46,460
How would we know

380
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:47,940
such private matters

381
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,220
if Wu Ya didn't tell us?

382
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:52,050
Biao,

383
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,620
think about it.

384
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,290
If you don't confess,

385
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,620
Wu Ya will confess everything.

386
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,090
Then you'll face

387
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:59,180
legal consequences.

388
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:01,180
We're giving you

389
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,180
one last chance.

390
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,460
Confess or not?

391
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,620
Stop! Stop!

392
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,090
Stop!

393
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:20,900
Alright.

394
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:22,940
I'll confess.

395
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:36,180
We came

396
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:37,620
to He City

397
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:40,660
to find a new drug.

398
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,420
Someone said he has it.

399
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:54,050
Where is it?

400
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:07,900
This isn't what I wanted.

401
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:10,530
I don't care

402
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:11,290
if it is.

403
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:12,900
You said you wanted to buy it,

404
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:13,900
so give me money.

405
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:17,380
Come on,

406
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,290
money.

407
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:29,290
That's more like it.

408
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:37,810
We're new here.

409
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,090
I didn't want to cause trouble.

410
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,180
But Biao couldn't

411
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,140
control his temper.

412
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:54,420
People like that shouldn't be alive.

413
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:57,420
I...

414
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:05,420
We really came here

415
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:09,250
for a new drug.

416
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:14,380
Traditional drugs are
high-risk and low-profit.

417
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:16,220
General hasn't dealt with them

418
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:16,940
in a long time.

419
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:18,730
Half a year ago,

420
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,050
someone told him

421
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,220
that He City had a new drug,

422
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,620
rumored to be stronger than Raw Diamond.

423
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:30,090
Is this it?

424
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:38,380
Yes.

425
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:40,620
I've tried it.

426
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,460
After taking it,

427
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,570
you can't remember any

428
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,660
of your troubles.

429
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:50,770
The most amazing thing is...

430
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:51,810
Do you

431
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,290
remember

432
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:55,460
the happiest time

433
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,330
of your life?

434
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:57,220
Focus!

435
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,460
Tell us your next plan.

436
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,730
General originally wanted us

437
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:04,770
to find someone who runs

438
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:06,380
a mental health clinic

439
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,010
and has a medical background.

440
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,250
He said he had the stuff we wanted.

441
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:14,330
But we called for two days

442
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:16,140
and no one answered.

443
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:17,940
Why him?

444
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:21,940
What else do you know

445
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:24,570
about him?

446
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,420
General only said

447
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:39,460
that Cha Kun and Mr. K

448
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:41,530
were killed by the police back then,

449
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:43,490
so this new drug must

450
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:46,810
be made by a more

451
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:47,860
skilled drug maker.

452
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:06,090
We're not sure

453
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:07,490
yet if this is Chen Chuchuan.

454
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:08,490
He will figure it out.

455
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,570
General told us

456
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,050
to find someone

457
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:21,090
named A She.

458
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,180
A She?

459
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:25,250
Does A She know who
the new drug maker is?

460
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,700
I don't know.

461
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:29,660
General just wanted us

462
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:32,090
to make a deal with A She.

463
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:34,380
How do you plan to make the deal?

464
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:39,620
Take the reduced sentence chance.

465
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:57,660
The day after tomorrow at 9 PM.

466
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:01,810
The location

467
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:04,770
is Dongxiang Village.

468
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:07,460
Mr. Bai,

469
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,140
only Shan Yuanyang and Guan Lixing

470
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,380
from the Drug Enforcement Unit

471
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,900
were included in the task force.

472
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:13,050
However, Guan Lixing

473
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:13,940
went undercover

474
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,290
in Decang City three years ago.

475
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,090
Nuo Sha's men have all seen him.

476
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:19,010
He can't go this time.

477
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:20,050
And Shan has no

478
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:21,530
experience in undercover work.

479
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,620
Mr. Bai,

480
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,090
so I hope Mr. Han

481
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,330
can assist us this time by posing

482
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,330
as a drug dealer for a transaction.

483
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:32,860
Han Feng was a good narcotics officer

484
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,380
before joining the
criminal investigation team.

485
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,220
Han Feng,

486
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:38,660
assist the Drug Enforcement Unit.

487
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:39,770
Yes.

488
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:48,900
People

489
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:50,330
change.

490
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:52,490
He would.

491
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:54,180
You would.

492
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:57,010
I would too.

493
00:26:58,270 --> 00:26:59,620
If this new drug you're talking

494
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,490
about could

495
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,180
let you see Yu Fei,

496
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:04,980
do you think you could

497
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:06,530
resist the temptation?

498
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:10,250
It's all in the past.

499
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,570
This is over

500
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:14,770
for both you

501
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:16,620
and Yu Fei.

502
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:19,420
(Chen,)

503
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:21,730
(did you make this new drug?)

504
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:48,530
Feng.

505
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:54,980
These three buckets contain

506
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,180
several pigs that have been

507
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:59,220
dead for different numbers of days.

508
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:01,050
Your assignment today

509
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:02,490
is to identify

510
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:03,900
how many pigs are

511
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:05,980
in these three buckets in total.

512
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:08,570
You also need to tell me

513
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:09,770
how many days

514
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,620
each pig has been dead.

515
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,660
You all say you want to be

516
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,730
excellent forensic pathologists.

517
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:16,570
But a real forensic pathologist

518
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:18,660
doesn't just dissect corpses

519
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,570
in the autopsy room.

520
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:21,330
Going to crime scenes

521
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:23,050
is also an essential part

522
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,900
of the work.

523
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:26,660
Okay.

524
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,140
Who wants to start?

525
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:53,660
Prof. Qi.

526
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,620
This is today's assignment report.

527
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,050
There are four pigs in these buckets.

528
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:02,530
They died two weeks, ten days,

529
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:04,660
and three days ago, respectively.

530
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,250
One of them

531
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,380
was probably slaughtered this morning.

532
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,620
I also noticed

533
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,660
that three of them are white-haired,

534
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,290
and one is black-haired.

535
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,810
Judging from the marks on them,

536
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,220
you probably

537
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,250
bought them

538
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:21,250
from three different places.

539
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,330
Yu Fei,

540
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,940
how did you figure that out?

541
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:35,700
You can tell from their

542
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,530
chopping techniques.

543
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:37,730
It's clearly

544
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:39,250
not the same method

545
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,180
of chopping meat.

546
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:44,940
You're very observant.

547
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:46,570
Thank you, Professor.

548
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:48,980
But actually,

549
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:51,290
all these pigs

550
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:52,380
were bought from the

551
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,010
same place.

552
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,660
I asked the butcher

553
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,530
to use different methods and techniques

554
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:58,090
to chop them.

555
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,460
Don't be discouraged.

556
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,250
Because you're the only one

557
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:09,460
who discovered

558
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,220
that I had set

559
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,460
up this clue.

560
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:13,660
I believe you will become

561
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,140
a good forensic pathologist someday.

562
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,530
Someday?

563
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:19,770
So you're not going to listen to his

564
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:20,490
advice to ask me to quit?

565
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:24,330
Sizhe!

566
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,810
Han Feng?

567
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:34,940
What are you doing here?

568
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:35,980
What are you doing here?

569
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,380
I'm here to teach a class.

570
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:38,460
What class?

571
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:39,490
I'm a visiting professor

572
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:40,620
of forensic medicine here.

573
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,490
But what's a

574
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:43,810
police officer like you

575
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,220
doing at the university?

576
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,570
Visiting professor of forensic medicine?

577
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,700
Do you know a girl

578
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,290
named Yu Fei?

579
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:54,660
You know Yu Fei?

580
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:56,140
Great.

581
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:57,810
You have to help me with this.

582
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,050
You can't let Yu Fei

583
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:02,420
like forensic medicine.

584
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:02,940
Wait.

585
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,180
What? Why?

586
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:09,570
He asked you to persuade
me to quit, right?

587
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:11,420
He just can't

588
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:13,050
keep secrets.

589
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,330
He's been all smiles ever
since he came back

590
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,490
from school that day.

591
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:17,980
Plus, with your background,

592
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:20,140
I could guess you know him even

593
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,620
without you saying anything.

594
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:24,980
Yu Fei,

595
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,620
you are

596
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:29,570
really observant.

597
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:30,770
So please,

598
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:31,660
don't listen to him.

599
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,940
If I can't continue my studies,

600
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:36,900
the forensic field will lose

601
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:38,090
a valuable talent

602
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:39,090
like me.

603
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:40,810
You're confident.

604
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:44,570
Yu Fei,

605
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,250
let me ask you.

606
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:48,330
Why do you want to be

607
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:49,250
a forensic pathologist?

608
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,900
I want to find the truth

609
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:56,090
for those

610
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:56,900
who can't speak,

611
00:32:58,110 --> 00:32:59,290
so they can

612
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,250
rest in peace.

613
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,250
Fei,

614
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,460
if I had listened to Han Feng

615
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,250
and asked you to quit,

616
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:14,010
if I had

617
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:16,660
received your call

618
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,700
sooner that day,

619
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,010
if I had found you sooner…

620
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:45,530
Fei.

621
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:47,810
Fei.

622
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:49,660
Are you hurt?

623
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,290
What happened?

624
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:03,700
I didn't protect you.

625
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:11,690
Fei,

626
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,130
I will definitely find the truth

627
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,340
for you and put an end

628
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,090
to this case.

629
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:48,260
We've just located

630
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:48,980
Wang Bo.

631
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,090
Ms. Zhu, Su,

632
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:51,650
proceed with the arrest.

633
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:52,650
Yes, sir.

634
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:53,300
Han Feng,

635
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:54,820
take Wu Ya to make

636
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,380
the deal with the drug dealers.

637
00:34:57,110 --> 00:34:57,420
Mr. Guan,

638
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,050
lead the rest

639
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:00,460
as the advance team.

640
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:01,980
Guys,

641
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:03,210
be careful.

642
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:04,090
Go.

643
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,170
Where's Qi Sizhe?

644
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:43,490
Cooperate with us.

645
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:44,460
Don't try anything.

646
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:45,380
Let me introduce him.

647
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,900
This is Mr. Meng.

648
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,860
If you want to make money,

649
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,820
let me meet the drug maker.

650
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:51,530
You lied to me?

651
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:53,090
Don't fucking try to scam me!

652
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:54,900
You think we can't find
out if you don't tell us?

653
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,650
You'd better explain everything clearly.

654
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:58,210
Hydrofluoric acid

655
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,780
is usually processed and manufactured

656
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,940
in glass factories.

657
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:01,900
Attention,

658
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:02,740
get ready.

659
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:09,170
Stop!

660
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,010
Watch out!

661
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:14,490
Ms. Zhu!
