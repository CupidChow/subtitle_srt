1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000


2
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:08,890
Mr. Qi,

3
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,340
the results are in.

4
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,130
Liao Yunsheng's dead.

5
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:29,730
Xie Yaoqi's situation is unknown.

6
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,660
Seems we're back to ground zero.

7
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:34,570
If Xie Yaoqi weren't dead,

8
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,130
tonight would

9
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,450
be our last chance to save her life.

10
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:39,220
Logically speaking,

11
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:40,850
all the victims

12
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,260
should be linked somehow.

13
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,980
Ye Yingying, Xie Yaoqi,

14
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,820
Li Shuting, and Liao Yunsheng.

15
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,060
Four unrelated people.

16
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,010
Their only common link is Liao Dong,

17
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:54,730
from the cosmetic clinic.

18
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:59,220
But we've already verified

19
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:00,940
Liao Dong's alibi for the day

20
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,060
of the pork shop case.

21
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,060
But he's the only one connected

22
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,130
to the case now.

23
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,100
Call him over and ask him.

24
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,980
Yunsheng had it rough.

25
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:21,980
His parents died young.

26
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:24,610
It was my mom who raised him.

27
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:26,900
But now,

28
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,220
how am I going to explain it to my mom?

29
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,540
After he came to He City,

30
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:33,610
what friends did he make?

31
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,580
Who was he with?

32
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,660
What did he do

33
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:36,780
outside the university?

34
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,340
Do you know?

35
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:39,250
No idea.

36
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,220
Yunsheng has been

37
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,730
introverted since childhood.

38
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,410
He was shy and rarely talked.

39
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,540
Didn't have many friends.

40
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,020
He didn't talk much,

41
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,170
even when he came to my clinic.

42
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,540
Do you know how your nephew

43
00:04:58,510 --> 00:04:59,410
and these three girls

44
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:00,660
met each other?

45
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:02,660
Well...

46
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:04,540
I think so.

47
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:09,170
Xie was working part-time for me

48
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:11,340
and met Ye Yingying.

49
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,810
Xie brought this girl over.

50
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,220
But after they knew each other,

51
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:18,810
they seemed to get along well.

52
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,340
They were always

53
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,370
chit-chatting together.

54
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:24,610
I...

55
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,140
Just say what you want.

56
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:32,610
Tell us every detail

57
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:34,170
you can remember.

58
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,850
It will help us find

59
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,370
who killed your nephew.

60
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,980
Only when Yunsheng was on break

61
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,100
would I call

62
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,340
and tell him to come over.

63
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:47,100
However,

64
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,020
I felt

65
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:51,490
he was quite into Xie.

66
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,370
I saw him peeking at the girl

67
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,100
quite a couple of times.

68
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:04,540
Did they have

69
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,580
any further progress?

70
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:06,930
No.

71
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,900
And I was mocking him

72
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,250
for his far-fetched thoughts.

73
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,100
As I said,

74
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,140
Yunsheng was very introverted.

75
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,170
At most, he'd bring Xie water

76
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:20,660
or buy her a drink.

77
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,490
Nothing else.

78
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:24,290
What's his relationship

79
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:25,020
with the other two?

80
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:26,220
The other...

81
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:27,850
The other two weren't

82
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:28,980
that close to him.

83
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,100
They rarely

84
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,140
talked to each other.

85
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,700
There was only once

86
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:36,050
when all four of them

87
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,540
came to the clinic.

88
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:38,780
Did anything

89
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:40,340
happen that time?

90
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,700
Well, nothing special.

91
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:43,930
That day,

92
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:45,730
the three girls were

93
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,610
talking and laughing,

94
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,370
and Yunsheng suddenly came.

95
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:50,730
Really?

96
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,980
He was asking me before...

97
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:57,900
Yaoqi.

98
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,730
The thing he recommended

99
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,140
last time was really useful.

100
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,220
Then, that girl

101
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:18,930
never came to my clinic again.

102
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,460
Here's Liao Yunsheng's autopsy report.

103
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,020
We were all misled.

104
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:36,930
Liao Yunsheng

105
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,410
was the first victim.

106
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,490
The victim, Liao Yunsheng.

107
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:46,730
Like the first victim,

108
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:47,610
Ye Yingying,

109
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:48,660
we also found

110
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:50,540
a wound resembling a spider's mouthparts

111
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,250
piercing its prey on his abdomen.

112
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:54,610
And his organs also
had signs of corrosion

113
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:55,540
from hydrochloric acid.

114
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,220
Behind his ear,

115
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:58,610
we also found a needle hole that

116
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,100
could have caused a venous embolism.

117
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,930
Whether judging from the method

118
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,930
or the cause of death,

119
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,340
the killer is the same person.

120
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:07,460
Therefore,

121
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,700
he was the first victim?

122
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,290
However,

123
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:14,170
because the body was treated

124
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:15,370
with formalin and plastic wrap,

125
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,290
we can't determine

126
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:17,370
the exact time of death.

127
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,490
But after

128
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:20,410
our further examination,

129
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,810
it can be roughly estimated

130
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,410
that Liao Yunsheng

131
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,370
has been dead for at least four weeks.

132
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:29,370
If what Mr. Qi said

133
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:30,410
was right before,

134
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,490
the crime cycle

135
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:32,820
was 13 days,

136
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:33,610
then Ye Yingying

137
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:35,060
was killed after him.

138
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,770
That 13-day

139
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:37,530
killing cycle

140
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:38,530
isn't accurate anymore.

141
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,490
According to Li Shuting,

142
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:42,890
the killer killed Xie Yaoqi beforehand.

143
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,580
And the time when
Li Shuting was kidnapped

144
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,460
was also earlier.

145
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,300
What's the reason?

146
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,460
Has Su found anything new

147
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,420
in room 604,

148
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,300
where Liao Yunsheng's

149
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,060
body was found,

150
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,770
and that shed?

151
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:56,850
Room 604 belongs

152
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,250
to Chen Hua, Liao Yunsheng's

153
00:08:58,270 --> 00:08:59,340
classmate in vet school.

154
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:01,130
Chen Hua has been living abroad.

155
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,300
So he let Liao Yunsheng

156
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,460
look after that house.

157
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,010
We're already running

158
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:06,420
a comparison of the fingerprints

159
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,770
found in room 604.

160
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:09,220
The results should be in soon.

161
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:10,890
And that shed belongs

162
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:11,490
to Zhao Si,

163
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:12,940
a nearby villager.

164
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,420
But he accidentally

165
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,060
fell off when repairing his roof

166
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:16,770
a month ago.

167
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:17,650
He's been bedridden

168
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:18,300
for over a month.

169
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:19,700
He has no idea

170
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:20,890
what had happened in the shed.

171
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,060
The body of the first victim,

172
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,250
Liao Yunsheng, was found in room 604.

173
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,650
The estimated time of death

174
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,940
was more than four weeks ago.

175
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,340
Around four weeks

176
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,420
after Liao Yunsheng died,

177
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:32,490
we found Ye Yingying's body

178
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:33,580
in a cave in Beishan.

179
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,300
She was the second victim.

180
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:36,610
As marked in the calendar,

181
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:37,700
Ye Yingying was killed

182
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,490
around August 14th.

183
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,580
And three days
after Ye Yingying's death,

184
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,610
Xie Yaoqi was kidnapped.

185
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,420
Currently, we can't confirm

186
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:45,490
whether she's still alive.

187
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:47,730
These two are Xie Yaoqi.

188
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:49,770
Could the killer have painted

189
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:50,890
all the victims?

190
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,650
The fourth victim,

191
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:53,530
Li Shuting,

192
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,650
was rescued in an abandoned factory.

193
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,730
The killer fled.

194
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,340
Judging from the killer's pattern,

195
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,180
with Li Shuting,

196
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,100
not only was

197
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,130
the crime cycle

198
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,420
changed,

199
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:10,850
but even the location

200
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,460
and logic

201
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:13,700
were different.

202
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,530
The two scenes before

203
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,130
had funnel webs

204
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,010
made by the killer.

205
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,220
Why doesn't this scene have one?

206
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:21,370
If the killer

207
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,980
sees this place as the new nest,

208
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:24,940
Xie Yaoqi should be here.

209
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,530
But she doesn't.

210
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,700
Li Shuting claimed

211
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:30,580
the kidnapper was Liao Yunsheng.

212
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,650
But Liao Yunsheng was already dead.

213
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,300
There's no way it was him.

214
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,530
Then who could it be?

215
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,530
When Xie Yaoqi got kidnapped,

216
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,700
we received a call

217
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:42,850
from the pork shop's owner.

218
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,220
But he's dead.

219
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,490
Therefore,

220
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,250
no one could prove

221
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,770
Xie Yaoqi was kidnapped.

222
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:52,940
You suspect Xie Yaoqi?

223
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:55,300
If Xie Yaoqi were the killer,

224
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:56,610
things would make sense.

225
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:04,300
In that case,

226
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,850
Xie Yaoqi left the hair

227
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:06,940
at the pork shop

228
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,490
just to mislead us.

229
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:10,180
From the start,

230
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,300
as soon as we arrived

231
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,130
at the scene,

232
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,250
we already stepped into her trap.

233
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,100
She let all the leads

234
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,010
trace to Liao Yunsheng.

235
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,530
Because Liao Yunsheng had

236
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:30,180
all the characteristics of a criminal.

237
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:31,180
See?

238
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:33,060
An agricultural college student

239
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,010
who has access to pathogens.

240
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:36,730
His uncle, Liao Dong,

241
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,250
owned an unlicensed clinic.

242
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,700
And all the victims

243
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,100
were related to the clinic.

244
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,130
According to Li Shuting,

245
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,100
Xie Yaoqi and Liao Yunsheng

246
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:46,250
were in a relationship.

247
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:48,060
So Xie Yaoqi had great chances

248
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,100
to enter the shed

249
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:50,340
and frame Liao Yunsheng.

250
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:51,890
Yaoqi?

251
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:01,650
The point is that

252
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:02,890
Liao Yunsheng is dead now.

253
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,340
We'd never find him,

254
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,130
no matter how.

255
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,340
Before finding the body,

256
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:09,850
we could only assume he was the killer.

257
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,370
We've always thought

258
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,770
Xie Yaoqi was the victim.

259
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:15,890
But if she were lying,

260
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,370
all our inferences

261
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:19,490
and evidence

262
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,180
would be wrong.

263
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,300
The comparison results

264
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:26,980
of the other

265
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,580
DNA sample

266
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:28,580
from the scene are in.

267
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,300
Who is it?

268
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:31,490
Xie Yaoqi.

269
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,530
When Liao Yunsheng was killed,

270
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:43,940
Xie Yaoqi hadn't gone missing.

271
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,770
If Li Shuting was telling the truth

272
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,100
that they were in a relationship,

273
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,530
it wasn't strange

274
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:50,700
that her DNA appeared in room 604.

275
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,130
The chance of Xie Yaoqi

276
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:53,770
being the killer is even higher.

277
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,700
If Xie Yaoqi were the killer,

278
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,850
could we still believe

279
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:05,650
what Li Shuting said?

280
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,580
He showed me some paintings.

281
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:09,730
What paintings?

282
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,940
It was Yaoqi.

283
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:14,370
He painted Yaoqi.

284
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,650
The way Yaoqi died...

285
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,580
It was horrible!

286
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:21,490
Is Li Shuting

287
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,420
at the hospital now?

288
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:23,700
No, she said she was fine.

289
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:24,460
So I sent her home.

290
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:26,130
Let's go find her

291
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,180
and confront her.

292
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:27,890
One of them

293
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,060
must be lying.

294
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:29,890
Okay.

295
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:30,770
Okay, Ms. Zhu.

296
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:31,980
Let's go.

297
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,650
I dropped her downstairs.

298
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:58,650
She came up alone.

299
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:00,340
304.

300
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:01,300
Here.

301
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,220
Li Shuting?

302
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:07,890
Li Shuting?

303
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,370
Li Shuting!

304
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:13,580
Li Shuting!

305
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:15,850
Was the killer after her again?

306
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,340
Move aside.

307
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,250
Who are you looking for?

308
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,060
Hello, is Li Shuting here?

309
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:27,490
Who?

310
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:28,420
Li Shuting.

311
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:28,980
Who is it?

312
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:29,890
This girl.

313
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,370
Have you seen this girl?

314
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:38,770
Doesn't she live here?

315
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,890
I live here alone.

316
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:48,060
Thanks.

317
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:57,420
Han Feng!

318
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,340
Ms. Zhu.

319
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:04,890
It was Li Shuting.

320
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,370
Li Shuting

321
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,370
has been misleading us.

322
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,530
Mr. Han, Ms. Zhu.

323
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:11,940
I checked the info

324
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,060
Li Shuting left at the hospital.

325
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:14,180
Besides the address

326
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:14,890
you just went to,

327
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:15,980
her number

328
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,180
and the emergency contact

329
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:17,730
she left

330
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:18,580
were also fake.

331
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:19,730
All fake?

332
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,490
When did you think of that?

333
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:24,370
It just came to me.

334
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:26,250
Xiaoxi,

335
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:28,220
can you check

336
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:29,650
where Li Shuting went

337
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,060
after we sent her home?

338
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,460
I'm on it.

339
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,770
Su, where's Wan?

340
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,420
He's asking the students

341
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,770
at the Agricultural University.

342
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:43,220
Hey, Wan.

343
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:44,940
Ask specifically

344
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:45,770
if any student

345
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,180
has seen Li Shuting before.

346
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,250
Okay.

347
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:50,890
I first saw Li Shuting

348
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,820
at the entrance

349
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:53,100
of our police department.

350
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,490
She was about to go in.

351
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:03,370
But she didn't.

352
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,460
She tried to convince me that Xie Yaoqi

353
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:06,890
only went missing to avoid

354
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:07,610
her parents.

355
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,100
Did you see her parents?

356
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,460
Conservative folks from the countryside.

357
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:13,650
They couldn't accept

358
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:14,980
their daughter having

359
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:15,940
cosmetic surgery.

360
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:17,730
That's why Yaoqi

361
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:18,770
was avoiding them.

362
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,420
I don't think Yaoqi was missing at all.

363
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,610
We found the clinic's address.

364
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,340
Where's the clinic

365
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,100
she worked in?

366
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,610
There's a business card...

367
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:32,490
With that card,

368
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:33,460
we traced it to the clinic

369
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:34,610
and Liao Yunsheng.

370
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:35,850
If Li Shuting

371
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:36,980
were really the killer,

372
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,300
she must have planned

373
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,340
to shift all the blame

374
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,730
to Liao Yunsheng

375
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:41,650
from the beginning.

376
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:43,980
This way, your inference

377
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,220
will make sense.

378
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:06,250
Help me, please!

379
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:08,010
He said he'd kill me

380
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:08,900
after killing

381
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,980
Yaoqi tonight!

382
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,380
It's so dark here!

383
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,940
With the sound of machines!

384
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,050
Look, is that Liao Yunsheng?

385
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:41,380
That's him!

386
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,660
Seems like him.

387
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,380
Mr. Han,

388
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:45,570
a security camera

389
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:46,530
captured someone

390
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:47,140
suspicious

391
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,290
in a black hoodie

392
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:49,330
and holding

393
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:50,420
an empty feeding box.

394
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,940
Could it be Liao Yunsheng?

395
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,660
That also explains

396
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:55,730
why the killer changed the pattern

397
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:56,770
when it

398
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:57,770
came

399
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:58,980
to Li Shuting.

400
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:00,860
Because it was all just an act

401
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:02,620
staged by Li Shuting herself

402
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,730
to cover up everything she did.

403
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,140
That means

404
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,570
the crime cycle of 13 days might

405
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:08,660
still be accurate.

406
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,380
Xie Yaoqi is probably still alive.

407
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,730
So our utmost priority is

408
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,980
to find where Li Shuting

409
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,420
hid Xie Yaoqi.

410
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:18,220
The agricultural professor said

411
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:20,220
the experiment for bovine tuberculosis

412
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:21,940
and the pathogens
used in the experiments

413
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:23,330
were strictly controlled.

414
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:24,810
Not everyone

415
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:25,940
had access to those.

416
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:27,420
We checked the students

417
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,770
who participated in the experiment.

418
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:30,250
Li Shuting wasn't there.

419
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:35,290
I believe

420
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,860
Li Shuting must have

421
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,140
something to do with this session.

422
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,330
Too many students chose

423
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:44,490
my elective courses.

424
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,770
I've only seen them once.

425
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,290
I can't remember them.

426
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:50,420
How about this, officer?

427
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:51,900
My TA has always been

428
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,620
in charge of taking attendance.

429
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:54,770
Fang.

430
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,010
Come over.

431
00:18:59,160 --> 00:18:59,490
Hello.

432
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,090
Hello.

433
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,090
Take a look.

434
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:02,290
Do you know this student?

435
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:04,660
Looks familiar.

436
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,700
Seems to be one of the students

437
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,490
in our class.

438
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,660
Do you have a group photo?

439
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,490
Or maybe photos taken in classes?

440
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:15,530
We do.

441
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,010
In the first class,

442
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:20,250
I took several photos.

443
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:21,660
Look.

444
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:28,860
This was taken during the bovine

445
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:29,860
tuberculosis lab session.

446
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:30,490
Yes.

447
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,460
Looks like her?

448
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:34,980
But the face is covered.

449
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:36,810
This person's name?

450
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,900
Wang Qilong.

451
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,010
He answered after being called twice.

452
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,330
Li Shuting used a fake identity?

453
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:45,180
Yes.

454
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,660
Their TA confirmed that

455
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,180
Li Shuting might have disguised herself,

456
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,570
using the name

457
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:51,220
Wang Qilong.

458
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,380
So Liao Yunsheng met Li Shuting

459
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,460
at the course.

460
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,460
But the one he met

461
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,420
was her in disguise.

462
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,860
No wonder he had that reaction

463
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,810
in the cosmetic clinic.

464
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,900
This one, room 101.

465
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,140
Thank you.

466
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:33,620
Alright.

467
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:42,940
Hello, anyone?

468
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,290
Who are you?

469
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,010
Wang Qilong.

470
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,810
Do you know this person?

471
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:10,620
Which one is you in the photo?

472
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:17,220
This one.

473
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,330
Are you sure?

474
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:19,980
Yes.

475
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,460
At the same time,

476
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,180
your TA also took

477
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,380
a photo from the side.

478
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:27,980
Take a closer look.

479
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,420
Check it out.

480
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,180
Is this also you?

481
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:37,980
It's me.

482
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,380
Who's the student

483
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,180
next to you?

484
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,140
I don't remember.

485
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:46,770
You've been with them

486
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,140
for so many sessions,

487
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,220
yet you can't remember the names?

488
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:53,570
I...

489
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,010
I rarely talk to my classmates.

490
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:00,810
Calling you here

491
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:01,660
for questioning

492
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:03,570
means we've already got

493
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,380
certain evidence.

494
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:06,860
I'll ask one last time.

495
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:08,940
Who is

496
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:10,730
this person?

497
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,420
What's her name?

498
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:18,810
Did something

499
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:19,730
happen to Shuting?

500
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:21,490
Is she alright?

501
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,010
Her name's Li Shuting, right?

502
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:26,140
Why did she

503
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,050
show up in class

504
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:28,090
in your name?

505
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:35,460
That day,

506
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:37,900
Shuting heard I had a lab session

507
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,460
and felt interested,

508
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,250
so she wanted to go.

509
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,380
She never went to college.

510
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:44,660
She was curious about

511
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,380
everything there.

512
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,650
I never liked attending

513
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:48,290
lab sessions.

514
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:49,810
So I let her go for me.

515
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,770
Did Li Shuting know

516
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:54,090
what your lab session covered?

517
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,090
That was a session where we conducted

518
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:58,090
experiments separately.

519
00:22:59,110 --> 00:22:59,860
I thought

520
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,860
no one would notice.

521
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:02,490
So I let her go

522
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:03,490
dressed as me.

523
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,660
That's all?

524
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:05,460
That's all.

525
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:07,140
What happened to her?

526
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,420
Why do you keep asking?

527
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,570
Do you know something?

528
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,090
Or did she tell you something?

529
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:13,180
Has Li Shuting gone

530
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,530
to classes in your name

531
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,420
except this once?

532
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:18,140
It was the only time.

533
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,700
Where is Li Shuting now?

534
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:22,700
I don't know.

535
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:24,810
What happened to her?

536
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,980
Answer our questions first.

537
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:29,090
I really don't know.

538
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,420
What happened to Shuting?

539
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:30,900
When was

540
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,380
the last time you saw Li Shuting?

541
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:34,420
We hadn't seen

542
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:36,330
each other for a while before that.

543
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:38,220
He cares about her.

544
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:40,730
He asked three times.

545
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,010
Does Li Shuting keep spiders?

546
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:54,940
Why do you ask?

547
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,490
This is her pet, right?

548
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:02,980
I can tell you care about her.

549
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,010
You must know that

550
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:06,050
she's mentally ill, right?

551
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:08,530
Does she often fantasize

552
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:09,620
that she is a spider?

553
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,860
We suspect she killed these two people.

554
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:28,860
Is...

555
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,940
Is this all Li Shuting's doing?

556
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,290
Yes.

557
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,420
She killed people?

558
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:35,900
Do you know something?

559
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:36,660
She murdered them?

560
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,330
Yes.

561
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:43,860
And if you

562
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,620
tell us about it,

563
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:45,330
we will be able

564
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:46,250
to save another life.

565
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,730
If you want to help her,

566
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,730
tell us everything you know.

567
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:20,460
I know nothing.

568
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:27,290
This guy definitely knows something.

569
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:50,770
Your face

570
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:53,220
does look pretty.

571
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:58,380
No matter how hard I try,

572
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,090
I'll never be like you.

573
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,220
You know how much I envy you?

574
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,420
No one likes me.

575
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,860
No matter how pretty I become,

576
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:50,140
no one will ever like me.

577
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:18,700
Didn't you and Ye Yingying

578
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:21,460
always call me ugly

579
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:22,490
and terrifying?

580
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:25,050
I heard everything.

581
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:29,860
Did you forget?

582
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:32,700
Back at that clinic,

583
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,980
when the three of us had our

584
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:37,290
beauty shots together.

585
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,380
Shuting, Yaoqi,

586
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,140
let me tell you.

587
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,250
This beauty injection is very effective.

588
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:42,810
Get the second shot

589
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:43,660
after three months,

590
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,620
and I guarantee you'll find a new self!

591
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,980
Yingying, there's a spider behind you!

592
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,570
Is it off?

593
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:55,290
There! It's over there!

594
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:03,050
This thing looks so creepy.

595
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:04,700
These scary

596
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,420
and hairy things

597
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,010
give me the creeps.

598
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,620
Such bad luck.

599
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:13,620
This stupid thing

600
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,660
ruined my day.

601
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,620
Spiders are so ugly.

602
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,420
They don't deserve to be in this world.

603
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:20,730
So filthy!

604
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:21,940
Shuting?

605
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,620
Don't you feel disgusted?

606
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:35,090
Didn't you say I didn't deserve

607
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:36,050
to be in this world?

608
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:49,980
Your time is almost up.

609
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:29,620
We searched their places.

610
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,530
Nothing was found.

611
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:32,250
Now we lost track

612
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:33,180
of Li Shuting, too.

613
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:34,980
Keep stalling like this,

614
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:36,900
and she'll kill again.

615
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:41,980
I always felt there must be

616
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:44,050
some blind spot in this case.

617
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:45,900
Blind spot?

618
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:47,980
In fact, we have no

619
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:49,570
solid knowledge of the killer.

620
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:51,980
What if we got fooled?

621
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,010
Neither the killer nor the victim

622
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,290
is who we think they are.

623
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:56,490
Just like Li Shuting,

624
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:57,770
the killer could

625
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:58,730
hide as a victim.

626
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,530
Victims are both male and female.

627
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:03,220
This doesn't fit a serial killer's

628
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:04,380
mindset at all.

629
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:06,770
Both male and female...

630
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:33,980
What is it?

631
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,900
Before, we assumed
that the killer killed

632
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,180
not for preying,

633
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,860
but for reproduction.

634
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:42,770
Strangely, though,

635
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:43,660
there were no

636
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,620
signs of sexual assault on Ye Yingying.

637
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:46,770
However,

638
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:48,140
if Li Shuting were the killer,

639
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,010
finding no signs of sexual assault

640
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:51,010
would make sense.

641
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,250
But...

642
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,940
But she was supposed to kill men.

643
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:56,810
If the killer's purpose

644
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,330
was to reproduce,

645
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,620
why did she kidnap

646
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,860
Ye Yingying and Xie Yaoqi,

647
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,570
who were female just like her?

648
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:06,570
The first one she killed
was Liao Yunsheng.

649
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,380
Killing Liao Yunsheng is to mimic

650
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,290
a female spider

651
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:13,220
killing a male spider.

652
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:14,860
So she treated Liao Yunsheng

653
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,090
as a male spider.

654
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,180
But after killing him,

655
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,940
she should have mimicked laying eggs.

656
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:22,220
Why did she do the same

657
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:23,660
to Ye Yingying and Xie Yaoqi?

658
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:25,050
Unless...

659
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,900
Unless she couldn't lay eggs at all.

660
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:32,220
Ye Yingying's body had

661
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:33,530
a wound on the abdomen.

662
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,050
Her uterus was damaged.

663
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,330
The killer appeared

664
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:37,660
to kill women out of hatred.

665
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:39,530
Perhaps

666
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:41,140
her purpose was to destroy

667
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:41,980
their uteri.

668
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:45,980
If she couldn't reproduce...

669
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:51,620
Ibuprofen,

670
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:53,010
Yasmin,

671
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:55,290
fluoxetine,

672
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,770
and estradiol valerate.

673
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,620
These were

674
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:00,940
the medicines in Li Shuting's bag

675
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:03,290
when I first saw her.

676
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,860
You were in Narcotics before.

677
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:07,530
You should know

678
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:08,490
about the medicines.

679
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:10,290
Estradiol valerate.

680
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:10,940
For women,

681
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,010
it helps with ovarian health

682
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:12,810
and fertility.

683
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:13,860
Some also use it

684
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:14,770
for irregular periods.

685
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:16,900
What about men?

686
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:27,940
Li Shuting has been taking

687
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,050
estradiol valerate.

688
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:30,220
He's not a girl at all.

689
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:31,860
You still don't get

690
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,090
how serious the situation is.

691
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,620
If you don't tell the truth now,

692
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,700
your life will be ruined.

693
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:42,180
Tell us everything you know.

694
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:57,530
Shuting... He...

695
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,180
He's not Li Shuting.

696
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:07,810
His...

697
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,010
His name was Li Shujun.

698
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,690
They don't know my beauty.

699
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:13,340
But that's alright.

700
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:15,860
Soon, they will pay the price.

701
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:19,380
Very soon.

702
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:27,530
He's Li Shujun.

703
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:31,130
I'm Wang Qilong.

704
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:34,820
We've known each other

705
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:35,570
since childhood.

706
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:37,980
We were both orphans.

707
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:44,340
Twinkle twinkle little star,

708
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:48,740
how I wonder what you are.

709
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:49,980
Flowers!

710
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,530
Wang Qilong, are you done yet?

711
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,820
Wang Qilong?

712
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,610
Stop running!

713
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,940
I'll catch you!

714
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,690
Isn't this that freak

715
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:07,050
Li Shujun in our class?

716
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,570
But Shujun wasn't a freak.

717
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,740
He just had bisex chromosomes,

718
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,980
but he was rejected,

719
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:17,300
even bullied.

720
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,170
That's why he ended up this way.

721
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,260
Shujun has always been

722
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:24,530
introverted

723
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:25,530
and shy.

724
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:27,380
But I was the opposite.

725
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,380
Looks pretty?

726
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,170
At the age of eight,

727
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,460
he wanted to start fresh
with a new name.

728
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:35,460
Since then,

729
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,010
he became Li Shuting.

730
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:40,340
He said

731
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:43,130
he'd be happy that way.

732
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:52,130
Alright, kids.

733
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,570
What are your names?

734
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:55,300
I'm Li Shuting.

735
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:57,530
Here, let's take ID photos.

736
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,340
Lower your head a little bit.

737
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,210
Tilt to the left a bit more.

738
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:15,900
I wanted him to be happy.

739
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:19,460
I didn't want him to get bullied.

740
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:43,900
What are you doing?

741
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:44,690
Don't push me!

742
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:45,860
So what if I do?

743
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:47,170
Li Shujun?

744
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:48,490
Li Shujun!

745
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:48,900
Ma'am,

746
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,260
someone's fighting over there.

747
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,170
Hey, stop it now!

748
00:37:57,590 --> 00:37:58,090
Let go!

749
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:02,340
Wang Qilong.

750
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,170
That's you. There you go.

751
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:16,740
What's your name?

752
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,610
Wang Qilong.

753
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,900
How old are you?

754
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:19,650
Nine.

755
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:20,530
Okay.

756
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:24,340
Your turn.

757
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,300
What's your name?

758
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:27,420
Li Shuting.

759
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:28,900
How old are you?

760
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:29,780
Eight.

761
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:30,980
Eight, alright.

762
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:32,490
So you kept hiding

763
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:33,940
his identity for him?

764
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:35,420
Yes.

765
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,610
He left our hometown

766
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,260
with a new identity.

767
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,170
No one knows us here.

768
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:46,980
We became our new selves.

769
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:54,130
Goodbye, Li Shujun.

770
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,980
Goodbye, Wang Qilong.

771
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:03,780
Officer,

772
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:07,740
I beg you, please.

773
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:10,530
Please tell me

774
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:13,050
what happened to Shuting.

775
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:16,650
I shouldn't have

776
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:18,010
let him go to the lab for me.

777
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,170
It's all my fault.

778
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:22,090
All because of me.

779
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:22,980
You can still

780
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:23,690
help him.

781
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:25,380
Just tell us

782
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:27,380
where he is now.

783
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:45,130
I just want to be pretty

784
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:47,090
like you people are.

785
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,130
What's wrong with that?

786
00:40:14,590 --> 00:40:16,610
After meeting me at school,

787
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:18,300
he thought I was a freak.

788
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:20,940
And you looked down on me
after finding out.

789
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:22,820
I saw him in the toilet at school.

790
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,130
He acted sneaky,

791
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:25,010
doing something.

792
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:26,940
What?

793
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,210
That's insane.

794
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:29,690
What a freak.

795
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,490
And he's been so close to us!

796
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,010
It feels so disgusting.

797
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,940
Geez, what a pervert!

798
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:37,130
Do you know that

799
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:41,340
anyone who mocks me deserves death?

800
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:09,530
Do you know

801
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,130
how it feels to be reaching
the end of your life?

802
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,780
Don't you deserve death?

803
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:27,940
Don't be afraid.

804
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,050
It will all be over soon.

805
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:08,420
How is she?

806
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:09,740
Need detox ASAP.

807
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,420
Could Li Shuting's hallucination

808
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:13,650
be caused by his medicine?

809
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,090
You keep dwelling on it.

810
00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:17,300
You still can't get over Fei's death.

811
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:18,820
You think she'd be happy with this?

812
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:20,690
How did a missing case
get transferred to us?

813
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:22,130
The victim's name is Liu Yuanyuan.

814
00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:23,900
Her mother died
from illness a while ago.

815
00:43:24,110 --> 00:43:25,530
My mom was murdered.

816
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:26,460
I'll avenge her.

817
00:43:27,070 --> 00:43:27,900
These look like

818
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:28,820
human bones.

819
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:29,820
Female,

820
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:31,300
above 45 years old.

821
00:43:31,510 --> 00:43:32,210
New discovery.

822
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:33,940
Human bones in
three different locations.
