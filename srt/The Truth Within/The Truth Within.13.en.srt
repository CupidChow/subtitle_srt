1
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:39,580
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

2
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:54,290
We found

3
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:55,340
a pill bottle in a drawer

4
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,290
at Zhai Xixi's place.

5
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:57,890
After pharmacological analysis,

6
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,660
I found it has the same

7
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,570
ingredients as Li Shuting's

8
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:01,170
anti-manic-depressive drugs.

9
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:18,380
Li Ming,

10
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:19,660
have you seen this?

11
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,290
It's about Fei's case again?

12
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:29,730
Do you know

13
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:31,290
that antidepressants

14
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:33,820
can make people phototactic?

15
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,340
Why do you ask?

16
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,100
I think someone's making

17
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,730
narcotics under the pretense

18
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,380
of making drugs.

19
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:48,610
Do you remember

20
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,410
what our professor told us?

21
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,820
Drugs can be poisonous too.

22
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,850
It's all up to the developers.

23
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:58,450
Li Ming...

24
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:59,570
I know what you're going to say.

25
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:01,660
But Qi,

26
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:03,340
let bygones

27
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,260
be bygones.

28
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,290
It's all over now.

29
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:16,810
It's been so many years.

30
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:20,340
Are you really doing this

31
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,490
for Fei?

32
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:23,730
Or

33
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,460
because of your obsession?

34
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:27,850
My obsession?

35
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,660
It's all in the past.

36
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,490
This matter,

37
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,340
for both you

38
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,580
and Yu Fei,

39
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,050
is all clear now.

40
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:43,140
For something like this,

41
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,250
as long as it ends,

42
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,900
no matter the result,

43
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,020
it's still better than holding onto it.

44
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,340
The insured and the insurance agent

45
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,700
appeared in the same spot

46
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,490
at the same time,

47
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,370
and the insured is dead.

48
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:21,900
Mr. Han,

49
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:23,250
something's off

50
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:24,100
with the insurance agency.

51
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,540
Ms. Zhu, Mr. Han!

52
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,580
We got something new!

53
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,660
I checked all the

54
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,660
social media accounts that

55
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:32,340
Zhai Xixi had

56
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,460
and found a deleted group chat.

57
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,700
Cherry Blossoms?

58
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,540
This is the restored chat history.

59
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,930
They seem normal.

60
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,050
Why did she delete it?

61
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:43,220
Ms. Zhu,

62
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:45,140
go to the hospital with Wan and

63
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,370
ask Zhai Xiaoshan and Zhai Shanjun

64
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,250
if they know about

65
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:47,850
this group chat.

66
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:48,730
Xiaoxi,

67
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,900
keep looking into Wang Chen.

68
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,340
There must be more.

69
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:51,810
Okay.

70
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:53,170
Su, come on!

71
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,140
Let's head to that agency.

72
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,170
So you're saying that

73
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,410
Wang Chen lied about the Zhais?

74
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,140
That's right.

75
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,050
If we had known

76
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:01,900
that they were poor,

77
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,660
Zhai Shanjun had a broken leg,

78
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,780
the insured Zhai Xixi

79
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,700
was a disabled person,

80
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:07,340
and the beneficiary Zhai Xiaoshan

81
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,250
was also seriously ill,

82
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,220
we wouldn't have

83
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,220
approved this insurance.

84
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,050
Officers, you can imagine

85
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,220
what a high risk

86
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,660
it is for us to have such a client.

87
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,700
We would never approve this.

88
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,580
Have you done anything to Wang Chen?

89
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:20,410
We've already suspended him

90
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:21,730
and had him under investigation.

91
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,100
Can you show us

92
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:25,900
a list of the clients

93
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,540
he's handled?

94
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,220
Of course.

95
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:27,900
We'll cooperate

96
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,490
with you.

97
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,250
Please follow me.

98
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:29,810
Okay.

99
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,050
Have you seen Zhai Xixi use

100
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,050
this group chat before?

101
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,340
No.

102
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,810
Is Xiaoshan awake?

103
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:43,250
Can I talk to him?

104
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:44,580
Sure.

105
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,170
Xiaoshan,

106
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:52,490
how are you feeling?

107
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:53,780
Xiaoshan,

108
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:55,050
- so...
- Out!

109
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,170
I don't want to see you!

110
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:58,250
Wait, Xiao...

111
00:06:58,510 --> 00:06:59,540
Get out of here!

112
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:00,220
Xiaoshan!

113
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:01,850
Why haven't you arrested him?

114
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,100
He's the murderer!

115
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:05,020
Isn't it your job

116
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:05,930
to arrest murderers?

117
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,250
Why haven't you arrested him?

118
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:08,580
Xiaoshan, calm down...

119
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,170
He's a murderer!

120
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:10,220
Why didn't you arrest him?

121
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,610
Calm down!

122
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,930
It wasn't your dad.

123
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,140
Calm down.

124
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,290
Xiaoshan,

125
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:23,780
listen to me.

126
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,370
Your dad didn't do it.

127
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,490
We saw the footage before

128
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:29,220
Xixi jumped off the building,

129
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,900
and your dad was in the footage.

130
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,170
If you know something,

131
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:36,980
please tell me.

132
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:41,810
You must be mistaken.

133
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:43,610
He has to be the murderer.

134
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,980
He ruined our family.

135
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:48,780
We were supposed to be a happy family,

136
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,580
but now I'm all alone.

137
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:53,580
It's all his doing.

138
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:56,410
He ruined our family completely.

139
00:07:59,120 --> 00:07:59,980
I do understand

140
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,660
how you feel.

141
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:02,460
Xiaoshan,

142
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,250
please listen to me.

143
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:07,140
I had a brother before,

144
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:08,980
but he passed away too.

145
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,170
Just like you, I cried

146
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,660
my eyes out every day,

147
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,100
refusing to talk to anyone.

148
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,290
But later, I realized

149
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,100
that people around me

150
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:22,340
had always been there for me,

151
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:23,930
ready to help.

152
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:27,250
Then I gradually walked out of the pain.

153
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:30,700
If you have anything to say,

154
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,130
you can always tell me,

155
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:33,250
alright?

156
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:43,770
Can you help me?

157
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,130
Let's find out

158
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,370
the truth about Xixi together.

159
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:54,980
Do you know this group chat?

160
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:03,980
Xixi...

161
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:05,940
Why's Xixi in the group too?

162
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,420
So you know about this group chat?

163
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,490
Members of this group chat

164
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:14,940
all intend to end their lives.

165
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:16,980
There was a woman who

166
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,250
was a hospital volunteer.

167
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,890
She specialized in counseling us.

168
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:21,490
I...

169
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:23,940
I used to be a member too.

170
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:26,940
So,

171
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,420
your sister joined it

172
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,010
because of you?

173
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:45,770
Hello,

174
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,770
may I ask if Ms. Liu is working here?

175
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:49,420
She's working over there.

176
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:50,370
I'll go check for you.

177
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,220
Please wait a moment.

178
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:53,890
Honey, please don't be upset,

179
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,490
and don't give up. Be strong.

180
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,060
Just you don't give up...

181
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,580
Ms. Liu,

182
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,890
someone's here for you.

183
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,370
Take care of yourself, okay?

184
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:08,420
Xiaoshan told me

185
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,010
that this woman called Liu Qing

186
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,300
is a hospital volunteer.

187
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,100
To make him feel better,

188
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:13,770
she would introduce

189
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:14,340
people who shared

190
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,850
the same intention to him.

191
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:17,820
Is she also a member?

192
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:19,370
Yes.

193
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:21,530
When Xixi learned

194
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:22,610
about my intention,

195
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,220
she slapped me in the face

196
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:25,700
and cried.

197
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,010
Ever since my mom passed away,

198
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,650
I've never seen her cry.

199
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:32,530
But she really scared me.

200
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,130
So I promised never

201
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,820
to do such a thing again.

202
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,490
I've only joined

203
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,890
their gatherings a few times,

204
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:41,700
then I quit the group chat.

205
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,460
Why did you stop joining them?

206
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,460
I had nothing to share,

207
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,980
nor did I have any stories

208
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:50,610
to help encourage others.

209
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,130
The warmer they were to me,

210
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:54,130
the worse I felt.

211
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,580
This place looks

212
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,730
perfectly normal.

213
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,250
Why did Zhai Xixi delete

214
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:02,370
the group chat before she died?

215
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,250
I don't think she deleted it herself.

216
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:08,730
Hello,

217
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:11,220
what can I do for you?

218
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,490
I started that group chat,

219
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,370
and the group was made up of young

220
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:20,010
people struggling with
suicidal thoughts.

221
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,370
I was thinking

222
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:22,490
of offering them a space

223
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:23,770
where they can know each other

224
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:24,650
and share their stories.

225
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,820
Some things just need to be said.

226
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,060
Oh, Ms. Liu,

227
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,580
may I ask

228
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,010
if you know

229
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:32,730
this girl?

230
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,370
I remember her name was Xixi.

231
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:39,700
Her brother had heart disease

232
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:42,300
and wanted to end his life
so as not to burden her.

233
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,340
I talked him out of it.

234
00:11:58,510 --> 00:11:59,580
Sir, this water's for you.

235
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,770
Have you seen this man?

236
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:10,610
And this one?

237
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:12,980
No.

238
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,650
Do you know this group chat?

239
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:22,940
Yes.

240
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,180
We joined that group chat because

241
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,130
we wanted to end our lives.

242
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:28,580
You joined the group chat too?

243
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,300
What kind of person is Liu Qing?

244
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,220
She actually cares about us.

245
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:46,850
She wants us to live

246
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:47,980
a meaningful life.

247
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:52,420
I'm glad

248
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:54,180
to see all of you here today.

249
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,460
We're all living in pain,

250
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:57,700
struggling to survive.

251
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:00,460
I hope you can all find the courage

252
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:01,980
to keep going by getting
to know each other

253
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:04,370
and sharing your stories.

254
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:05,610
Lili,

255
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:06,580
would you like

256
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,700
to share with us

257
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,340
what's been going on with you?

258
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:16,010
My mom

259
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,700
has been diagnosed

260
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:21,370
with acute myocardial
infarction complicated

261
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,250
by coronary artery blockage.

262
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,100
After the surgery,

263
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,300
she was moved to the ICU.

264
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,420
Since she's still trying,

265
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,220
I can't just give up.

266
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,340
Thank you!

267
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,460
Thank you, Lili.

268
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,610
We should all learn from her.

269
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,180
Life can be hard,

270
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:43,700
but as long as we don't give up,

271
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:45,370
things will always turn around.

272
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:56,850
Xiao Lin,

273
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:58,770
would you like to share your story?

274
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,220
This might be

275
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:08,100
my last time with you.

276
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:11,340
I thought my life

277
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,300
would be hopeless,

278
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,370
but thankfully, I met Ms. Liu.

279
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,530
Thank you for guiding me.

280
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:21,060
You helped me find

281
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,530
the silver lining in my life.

282
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:24,610
Thank you!

283
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:33,850
The album

284
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:35,220
is full of pictures of this flower

285
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,890
and the members' signatures.

286
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,130
Mandala?

287
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:43,580
Qi Sizhe told me

288
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:45,370
that this flower is the main ingredient

289
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:46,060
in anesthetics.

290
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:47,460
Use it well, it heals.

291
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:49,180
Use it ill, it kills.

292
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,250
So it can be harmful

293
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:51,100
and beneficial.

294
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:52,300
They obviously

295
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,530
value this flower a lot.

296
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,820
What do these signatures

297
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,460
represent?

298
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:57,420
No idea.

299
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,250
Let's find out.

300
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,610
Okay, I'll check it.

301
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,220
Hello?

302
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:12,420
(Mr. Han,)

303
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:13,890
(I found that Wang Chen)

304
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:15,300
(had another client a year ago.)

305
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:29,580
Sir, wake

306
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,180
me up when we arrive.

307
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:39,300
Song!

308
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:41,580
Song!

309
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:46,650
Mr. Han,

310
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:48,580
Song probably isn't here.

311
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:49,530
They don't usually close

312
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,420
the diner at this hour.

313
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,460
If it was really his daughter,

314
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,610
he must know something.

315
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:54,850
Keep looking.

316
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:55,700
Got it.

317
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,220
Sir,

318
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,940
where are we?

319
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:27,580
I'm going to the train station.

320
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:30,180
Hey, I'm talking to you!

321
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:33,300
I'm asking you

322
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:34,610
where you're driving me!

323
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:36,580
Stop! Pull over!

324
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,580
Do you remember Qian?

325
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,490
When did you come here

326
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:03,100
last night?

327
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,010
About 6 to 7 p.m.

328
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:07,290
after dinner.

329
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,860
Did you notice anyone

330
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,290
suspicious when you got here?

331
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,770
There was no light here,

332
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:12,490
so it was quite dark.

333
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:13,810
I didn't really notice anyone.

334
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,250
I only saw the headlights

335
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:17,250
were on.

336
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,730
That's why I noticed
the car in the lake.

337
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:42,770
Kexin.

338
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:43,660
Mr. Qi.

339
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,180
Are there no brake marks here?

340
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:47,250
We need to check

341
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:48,290
the vehicle's braking system

342
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:49,770
to determine whether
it was brake failure

343
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:50,730
or an intentional act

344
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:51,620
of driving into the lake.

345
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,220
Mr. Han,

346
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:06,010
no driver's license found.

347
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:06,770
There are only

348
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:07,290
two ID cards.

349
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:08,420
So we're not sure

350
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:09,090
why they ended

351
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:09,900
up in the same taxi.

352
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:11,090
Check the car owner.

353
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:11,860
Okay.

354
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:33,620
The victim shows a bluish face,

355
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,700
froth at the mouth and nose,

356
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,380
and goosebumps.

357
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,770
Initial signs point

358
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:39,700
to drowning

359
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,810
before death.

360
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:42,420
We need to

361
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:43,660
perform an autopsy to

362
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,330
know the specifics.

363
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,660
Look, guys,

364
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:17,700
both individuals have bruising

365
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,050
of varying degrees on their bodies.

366
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:20,250
We believe the bruising

367
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:21,010
on Wang Chen has

368
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:21,810
been caused by the

369
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:22,620
impact force when the

370
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,490
car plunged into the lake.

371
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:24,530
Furthermore, we found

372
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:26,050
water in Wang Chen's lungs,

373
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,770
severe emphysema and edema,

374
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,860
and sediment

375
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:29,570
in his airways.

376
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:30,810
Our initial judgment is that

377
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,860
he likely died from drowning.

378
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,900
Song Weimin has bruising on his neck.

379
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,660
We compared the shape of the bruising

380
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:36,860
and confirmed it matches

381
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,860
the seatbelt in the car.

382
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:38,810
Moreover,

383
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:40,220
no edema or emphysema

384
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,090
was found in Song Weimin's lungs.

385
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:43,420
Therefore, it can be inferred

386
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:44,620
that he was already dead

387
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,420
before drowning.

388
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,220
Judging by the bruising,

389
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:49,570
he was likely strangled to death

390
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,940
by Wang Chen using the seatbelt.

391
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:56,290
In the confined space of the car,

392
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:58,220
Wang Chen could only have

393
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,380
completed the act

394
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,810
of strangling him

395
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:02,180
if Song Weimin was in the driver's seat.

396
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,700
From this, it can be further inferred

397
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,330
that after Song Weimin was strangled,

398
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,140
Wang Chen placed his body

399
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,180
in the back seat,

400
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,900
after which he got the
car into the water.

401
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,220
So, what do you think?

402
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:17,050
Could Wang Chen have

403
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:18,220
committed suicide out of guilt?

404
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,730
Is that why

405
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,700
he drove the car with
Song's body into the lake?

406
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:26,530
According to the forensic report,

407
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,220
Wang Chen's seatbelt was
properly fastened.

408
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:28,940
No signs of

409
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,940
pulling on the car doors.

410
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,460
Generally, a person would

411
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,530
struggle desperately for
survival before drowning.

412
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,810
The complete lack of struggle
marks seems unlikely.

413
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,530
Are there no brake marks here?

414
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,010
We need to check

415
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,010
the vehicle's braking system

416
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:42,420
to determine whether
it was brake failure

417
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:43,460
or an intentional act

418
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,290
of driving into the lake.

419
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,530
Could Wang Chen have been unconscious

420
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,420
before the car plunged into the lake?

421
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,140
There were only two people,

422
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,620
and Song Weimin was already dead.

423
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,330
Why was Wang Chen unconscious?

424
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:56,010
There was a third man.

425
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:58,490
Did you check the owner?

426
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,490
He and Song were old friends.

427
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,490
When Song borrowed the car

428
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:03,660
from him yesterday during the day,

429
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,860
he said he was picking up a friend.

430
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:05,940
He didn't think much

431
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:06,730
and gave him the keys.

432
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,660
He has an alibi

433
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,620
for the time of the incident.

434
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:14,570
Besides,

435
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:15,860
we found irregular masses

436
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,770
on the surface

437
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,700
of Song Weimin's kidneys.

438
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,460
The tissue section confirmed it was

439
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:21,940
late-stage kidney cancer.

440
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,180
Wan,

441
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:24,730
did you know Song was sick?

442
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:26,900
No.

443
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:29,050
I just thought he seemed tired lately.

444
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,570
I assumed it was because

445
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,770
of losing his daughter.

446
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,860
His daughter passed away?

447
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,290
Su checked.

448
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,140
A year ago,

449
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,010
Song Qian was also Wang Chen's client.

450
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:39,330
And she also died

451
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:40,250
from an accidental fall.

452
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:42,730
Song,

453
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,900
I've been dining here
so many times.

454
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:46,810
How come I've never seen your daughter?

455
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,380
She's a big girl now.

456
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,660
I can't keep her now.

457
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:54,700
Song Qian and Zhai Xixi

458
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,220
both bought insurance
from Pingtai Insurance.

459
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:57,860
Both were three-million-dollar claims.

460
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,140
Wang Chen handled both cases.

461
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:09,730
Xiaoxi,

462
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:12,330
have you checked

463
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:14,010
Wang Chen's recent call records

464
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:15,420
and his usual connections?

465
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:16,660
Not yet.

466
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,570
I'm on it.

467
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:18,810
I'll go with you.

468
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:20,700
Okay.

469
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,290
The tire marks were
deliberately covered up.

470
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,220
Qi Sizhe,

471
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:15,090
there is really a third man.

472
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:17,250
Wang Chen's death wasn't an accident.

473
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,290
And

474
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:19,420
this person

475
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,700
is connected to Li Yiqi's death.

476
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:21,770
He's very likely

477
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,090
the person we're looking for.

478
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:24,530
Have a look yourself.

479
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,180
I had Xiaoxi

480
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,940
check Wang Chen's call records.

481
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:30,980
After Li Yiqi died,

482
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,420
a phone number

483
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:33,460
called Wang Chen.

484
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,330
And before Wang Chen died,

485
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:36,460
he also called

486
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,090
a number.

487
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,420
These two numbers are a match.

488
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:40,380
Meanwhile,

489
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,860
this number is now deactivated.

490
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:43,460
Can it be such a coincidence?

491
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,530
Then our inference might be correct.

492
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,980
That person went to find

493
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:48,330
Wang Chen that night.

494
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:49,380
This could also explain

495
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,660
why the car was burned

496
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,770
in the abandoned factory near the

497
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:52,730
Fenglin Ducheng Community.

498
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:53,460
Mr. Han,

499
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:54,770
good timing.

500
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:55,730
Forensics just

501
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:57,330
finished sorting out the water-damaged

502
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:58,010
materials from

503
00:23:58,030 --> 00:23:58,730
Wang Chen's box.

504
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,730
There's an insurance policy.

505
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,940
Also a three-million-dollar

506
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,090
accident insurance policy.

507
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,620
The insured's name is Xiao Lin.

508
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:07,770
Xiao Lin?

509
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:10,140
Do you know this group chat?

510
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,090
Yes.

511
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:13,220
We joined that group chat because

512
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,220
we wanted to end our lives.

513
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,460
This might be

514
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,330
my last time with you.

515
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,420
The next one could be her.

516
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,860
Did you see Xiao Lin today?

517
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:28,770
No.

518
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:33,420
Hello, Mr. Han.

519
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:35,140
The ID card and household register

520
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,730
list an address from over ten years ago.

521
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:37,860
That area is deserted;

522
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,570
she can't live there.

523
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:46,940
Hello,

524
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,220
have you seen this person?

525
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:48,660
No.

526
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:49,660
Okay, thank you.

527
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:51,490
Hi,

528
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:52,620
have any of you seen this person?

529
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,380
No, I haven't.

530
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:14,180
Found it.

531
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:15,660
The address left when Xiao Lin's

532
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,490
father was hospitalized

533
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:17,620
is Jinrong Community,

534
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,940
No. 32 Bei'an Road, He City.

535
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,380
Xiao Lin is likely there.

536
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:57,090
Call 911!

537
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,940
Hi, someone wants to commit suicide.

538
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,530
The address is No. 32

539
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:04,490
Bei'an Road, He City.

540
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,010
According to witness accounts,

541
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:24,330
before Zhai Xixi fell,

542
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,490
someone was seen

543
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,420
under the tree

544
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:27,770
flashing a flashlight

545
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:28,460
repeatedly.

546
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:30,050
There's indeed a third person.

547
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:31,380
And

548
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:32,530
this person

549
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:33,860
is connected to Li Yiqi's death.

550
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,330
Mr. Han!

551
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:24,700
Stop!

552
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:50,460
Don't run! Stop!

553
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:13,810
Ms. Liu?

554
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:29,660
Have some water.

555
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:33,380
Now, let's talk.

556
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,620
Why did you do that?

557
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:39,010
Who was Wang Chen to you?

558
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,330
Do you know these girls?

559
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:53,570
Speak!

560
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:57,660
We've already checked.

561
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,700
Your father is in the hospital.

562
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:00,770
He has late-stage cancer.

563
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:03,380
You bought the

564
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,090
insurance, right?

565
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:08,460
Why did you buy it?

566
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:10,730
Do you really think that

567
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:11,900
if you were gone

568
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:13,860
and your father got the compensation

569
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:14,860
and beat his illness,

570
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,380
he could live well alone?

571
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:22,250
Wang Chen is already dead.

572
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:27,490
When he died,

573
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:28,940
this girl's father

574
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,900
was right beside him.

575
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:32,090
Why do you think

576
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:33,620
a father would kill?

577
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:35,730
The girl in this photo

578
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,290
did the same thing

579
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:38,700
as you a year ago.

580
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,620
She traded her own life

581
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:42,940
for a sum of money

582
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:44,420
to treat her father's illness.

583
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:45,900
But her father

584
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:46,940
didn't spend a single cent.

585
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,730
The money she traded her life

586
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,050
for is still sitting untouched

587
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:01,220
in front of her memorial photo.

588
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,460
Just yesterday,

589
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,700
this girl's father

590
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:12,900
and Wang Chen,
who processed your insurance,

591
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,380
both died.

592
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:17,380
Do you think a father would

593
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,530
actually use the money

594
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:19,770
his daughter traded her life for to

595
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,660
treat his illness with
a clear conscience?

596
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,810
You and Wang Chen

597
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,900
had several calls

598
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:28,860
before Zhai Xixi's death.

599
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,460
We also found

600
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:32,770
Wang Chen's fingerprints and a large

601
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:34,250
amount of cash in your cafe.

602
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:39,730
How do you explain?

603
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,730
If you don't speak,

604
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:45,980
with Wang Chen's death,

605
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:48,050
we'll just identify you
as the mastermind.

606
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,770
Not everyone who joins the group

607
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,570
ends up taking that path.

608
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,420
Ms. Liu genuinely cared about us.

609
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,490
She just wanted to find

610
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:01,250
one last way out for people like us

611
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:04,180
who feel desperate.

612
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,490
She wanted to make the lives

613
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:08,980
of people like us

614
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:09,980
have some purpose.

615
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:13,010
If it weren't for me,

616
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,620
they wouldn't have lived until now.

617
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:20,490
Society is getting colder.

618
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:23,180
Everyone is selfish.

619
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:26,140
But Xixi and Xiao Lin weren't like that.

620
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:28,620
Their sacrifice

621
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,980
was out of love for their family;

622
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,010
they were even willing
to sacrifice themselves.

623
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:34,980
They used their own lives

624
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,530
to relieve their family's suffering,

625
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:38,380
trading death for life.

626
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,010
They were the ones who
truly understood love.

627
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:43,420
My dad's illness

628
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,980
requires so much money.

629
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:47,940
What should I do?

630
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,490
How can I save him?

631
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:51,530
Do you really want to save your father?

632
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,420
I really want to save my dad!

633
00:31:58,350 --> 00:31:59,940
There's one last way.

634
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:02,700
So you colluded with Wang Chen,

635
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:04,660
having these girls buy insurance,

636
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:05,860
then disguising their suicide

637
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:07,860
as accidents to commit
insurance fraud so

638
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:09,570
their families would get money,

639
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:10,090
right?

640
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,090
It wasn't fraud.

641
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,460
It was fulfilling.

642
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:17,620
They were suffering for their families.

643
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:19,380
They wanted to sacrifice for

644
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,570
their families but didn't know how.

645
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:21,940
I just helped to

646
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:22,980
fulfill their hopes.

647
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:24,660
How is that fulfilling?

648
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:25,700
You think you

649
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,460
are some great saint,

650
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:26,940
huh?

651
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,730
Please, I beg you,

652
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,490
don't blame Ms. Liu.

653
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,420
She just wanted to help us.

654
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,460
Only she genuinely

655
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:35,900
cares about us

656
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,490
in this world.

657
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,140
Don't blame her, okay?

658
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,700
You've all been used by her.

659
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,980
Are you treating us like fools?

660
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,530
The payout for one life

661
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:47,420
is three million dollars.

662
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:48,900
How much can they have

663
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,010
after you and Wang Chen's cut?

664
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,530
I never did it for myself!

665
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:54,980
I just wanted to

666
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,860
help more people in need.

667
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,810
I was doing good.

668
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,420
I was well-intended!

669
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,050
Because of their sacrifice,

670
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:03,460
I helped

671
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,050
more people who are still alive.

672
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,620
We are all living in the darkness.

673
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,490
But you must remember,

674
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,730
no matter how dark your life is,

675
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:16,140
there is always a light

676
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,860
guiding you.

677
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:21,940
Just get close to this light,

678
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,050
embrace it,

679
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,330
and you can relax

680
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,530
and get everything you want.

681
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:34,460
It's you!

682
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,620
It's you who made their sacrifice

683
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,620
completely pointless!

684
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:39,730
You prevented them
from resting in peace!

685
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:40,250
Take her away!

686
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:41,660
It's you!

687
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:42,770
It's you

688
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:44,770
who made their deaths

689
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:46,010
worthless!

690
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,660
It's all because of you!

691
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:49,660
Shouldn't you take responsibility?

692
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:56,700
Wait!

693
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:00,660
Have you seen this person?

694
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:06,770
No.

695
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:10,980
Let's go.

696
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,420
Mr. Qi,

697
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:24,820
we found this pill bottle

698
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,570
at Xiao Lin's home.

699
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:27,010
It's the same as the one

700
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:27,740
Li Shuting had.

701
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:47,170
Where

702
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,380
did you get this medicine?

703
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:52,980
Wang Chen gave it to me.

704
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:54,570
Everyone in our group

705
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:55,490
has it.

706
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:57,380
I only took it once,

707
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:58,780
but I saw something

708
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,980
really horrifying.

709
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,820
I asked others about it,

710
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,740
but they said after taking it,

711
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,010
they all felt very happy

712
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:08,130
and didn't see anything horrifying.

713
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,570
Did you take it before you jumped?

714
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:11,610
Yes.

715
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:14,570
They said this medicine

716
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:16,820
gives us the courage to jump.

717
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:26,210
This person...

718
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:28,170
Have you ever seen him?

719
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:51,490
Xiao Lin got this medicine

720
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:52,340
from Wang Chen.

721
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:01,900
Where did

722
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,940
Wang Chen get it then?

723
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,490
Probably from that

724
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:07,460
person with the tattoo.

725
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,460
Regardless,

726
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,420
this drug is now

727
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,420
starting to spread.

728
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:15,300
We need to report to Mr. Bai.

729
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,650
Oh, come with me.

730
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,650
This money is for you.

731
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:27,010
Xiaoshan needs it for surgery.

732
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,050
No, no,

733
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:29,010
Ms. Zhu,

734
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:29,740
but thanks anyway.

735
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:30,570
I can't accept it.

736
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:31,940
Your team members

737
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:33,050
have already lent me money.

738
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:34,530
Thank you so much!

739
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:35,780
I really appreciate

740
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:36,820
all your help.

741
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,340
Um, I need to go check on Xiaoshan now.

742
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:40,570
Thank you!

743
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:41,340
Thank you a lot!

744
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:41,860
Thank you!

745
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:49,490
Here.

746
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:53,900
Was Xixi's death a suicide?

747
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,570
The police will definitely

748
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:01,610
reveal the truth to us.

749
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:03,490
Xiaoshan,

750
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:04,980
no matter why

751
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:07,050
your sister did this,

752
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,260
you have to believe

753
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,490
she always had our best
interests at heart.

754
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:12,490
She always wanted what was best for us.

755
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,130
She wanted you

756
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:16,210
and me

757
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:17,900
to pull ourselves together.

758
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:19,940
Xixi

759
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,380
was a great sister to you.

760
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:25,130
I won't drink anymore,

761
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:27,780
and I won't let you and
your sister down again.

762
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,130
I'll carry your sister's hopes

763
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,570
and raise you properly.

764
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:34,260
So,

765
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:36,460
we both need to live well.

766
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,300
What's going on?

767
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:02,860
Before Li Yiqi died,

768
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:03,860
a person in a white coat

769
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:04,610
entered the ward,

770
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:05,820
but the face is unclear.

771
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,860
Police! Get out of the car!

772
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:52,050
It's a woman!

773
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:52,650
Call the police!

774
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,300
Call the police!

775
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,940
It is initially confirmed to
be a young woman.

776
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:56,130
The fingerprints are worn off.

777
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:56,780
The fatal wound's

778
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:57,570
to the carotid artery.

779
00:38:57,630 --> 00:38:59,090
The shape of the weapon is very special.

780
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:00,570
There was an unsolved
case ten years ago;

781
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:01,900
the weapon was a fountain pen.

782
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,300
The deceased is named Fan Jiangxue.

783
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,210
The wound surface is on
the right side of the neck.

784
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,130
It should be a forward diagonal stab.

785
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,690
The perpetrator is left-handed.

786
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:10,740
This person is...

787
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:11,570
Hu Jie.

788
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:13,420
She went abroad to study
when she was a teenager

789
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:14,300
and has returned lately.

790
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:14,980
Blood.

791
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,260
This painting also bears

792
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,340
the fingerprints of a third man.

793
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,570
These three must know each other,

794
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:21,130
and they met up

795
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,740
to paint the same landscape.
