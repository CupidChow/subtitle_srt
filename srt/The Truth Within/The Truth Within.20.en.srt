1
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:10,060
Bitch.

2
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:12,380
You've got some nerve.

3
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,050
Daring to impersonate the chemist

4
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:18,620
and steal my business?

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,140
I really don't know anything.

6
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:23,460
I don't know anything.

7
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:31,900
Don't know?

8
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,770
Do you really think

9
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,370
I don't know about your things

10
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:42,620
with Wang Bo?

11
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,260
He killed Chen Chuchuan,

12
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,370
got Nuo Sha's

13
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:47,620
contact details,

14
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,220
and gave them to you.

15
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,330
And what do you do?

16
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,540
You pull

17
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:54,730
a sneak attack on me.

18
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:56,730
My godfather said

19
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:59,090
you need a lesson.

20
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,010
You love playing, huh?

21
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,490
Then enjoy it.

22
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:05,330
No!

23
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:53,060
[Episode 20]

24
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,610
X5

25
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,850
has a positive effect

26
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,340
on inducing norepinephrine

27
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,010
and serotonin.

28
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:14,380
The experimental data is perfect,

29
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:16,570
providing new ideas

30
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:17,850
for practical applications.

31
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,500
X5?

32
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:21,260
Norepinephrine?

33
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,610
The depression rate

34
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,340
stands at

35
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,060
five percent.

36
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:26,850
It has become a global

37
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:27,540
health crisis,

38
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,610
and it's getting worse.

39
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:31,540
But I think

40
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,260
depression

41
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:34,730
is preventable

42
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:35,980
and treatable.

43
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:38,410
It just lacks policy attention

44
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:39,570
and social resources.

45
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:41,260
My research shows

46
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:44,010
norepinephrine

47
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,380
is effective

48
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,260
against depression.

49
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:49,940
Mr. Qi.

50
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:51,100
Li Shuting's

51
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,100
drug test results are in.

52
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,980
He was on anti-manic meds.

53
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,010
During this operation,

54
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:13,100
we found a drug lab

55
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,410
and research materials

56
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:15,340
at the factory.

57
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:16,490
We interrogated

58
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:17,780
the people at the factory.

59
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:19,580
The factory belongs to Zhengxi.

60
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,660
We all listen to him.

61
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,980
We do whatever

62
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:22,900
he tells us to do.

63
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,580
He's the boss.

64
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,700
Never goes out for work.

65
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:27,980
Just researches

66
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,290
in the factory.

67
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,410
Originally, we didn't know

68
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,170
what he was doing.

69
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,730
Later, we found out

70
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:34,930
it was drugs.

71
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,100
I don't know about chemists.

72
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:39,850
He makes us

73
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,100
call him Mr. Feng.

74
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,410
But we call him Old Poison in private.

75
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,610
He's venomous.

76
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,730
Aside from Chen Chuchuan and Feng Zhengxi,

77
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:51,610
I don't know

78
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:52,780
who else could supply it.

79
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:56,850
The items

80
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:57,490
from the factory

81
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:58,580
have been tested.

82
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,140
Same substance

83
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:01,660
in wine

84
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,730
as in Mr. Han's sample.

85
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:05,170
The toxicology results are consistent.

86
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:07,700
What they're making

87
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:08,660
is the new drug

88
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,780
we've been looking for.

89
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:11,930
Mr. Qi.

90
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:22,370
I don't have much

91
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,660
to report for now.

92
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,540
Let's divide the tasks.

93
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:27,980
Okay.

94
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,170
Hi, Mr. Qi.

95
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:42,580
Xiaoxi,

96
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:43,900
could you

97
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,730
check someone's entry

98
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:45,610
and exit records?

99
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:46,780
Sure.

100
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:03,580
Mr. Qi,

101
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:05,100
she's been in He City.

102
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,050
No exit record.

103
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:48,930
(Li Ming!)

104
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:52,220
This is your exam subject, right?

105
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,220
Memorize the notes

106
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:55,540
in this book,

107
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:56,700
and you'll pass.

108
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,780
You're a real pal.

109
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:00,730
Study hard.

110
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,050
Don't fail again.

111
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:31,540
What's up?

112
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,850
This notebook was found

113
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,900
at the factory.

114
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,250
Wu Yongchang left me this note

115
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:39,810
in college.

116
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,460
Wu Yongchang?

117
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:43,170
Get an expert

118
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:44,580
to verify the handwriting.

119
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,050
Another strange thing.

120
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,220
This book

121
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:54,700
was left by my bedside

122
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,780
three years ago

123
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,140
when I was in a coma.

124
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,410
But today at home,

125
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:00,490
I found it

126
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:01,410
and remembered

127
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:03,460
I gave this to Li Ming

128
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,610
back in college.

129
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:20,930
What's this?

130
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,100
A chemical formula.

131
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,100
It's confirmed

132
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:56,250
that this is Li Ming's handwriting.

133
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,650
Probably he was the one who left

134
00:08:58,670 --> 00:08:59,300
the book.

135
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:00,850
But now

136
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:01,980
it's impossible to verify.

137
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,340
Why did he

138
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,770
send you a formula?

139
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,130
It must be

140
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,820
what the drug ring

141
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,980
has been searching for.

142
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:13,610
They need

143
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:14,820
this molecular formula

144
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:17,100
to produce the final drug.

145
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:18,370
So they've

146
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:19,460
been experimenting

147
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,610
on people.

148
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:23,820
Han Feng,

149
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:25,940
could you

150
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,130
give me the details

151
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:28,700
about how you solved

152
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,700
the Raw Diamond case?

153
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,420
The goods?

154
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,220
(Soon after infiltrating)

155
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,220
(Cha Kun's operation,)

156
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,940
(I ran into Li Ming)

157
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:43,940
(during a deal.)

158
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:48,250
And the money?

159
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,300
(An anonymous call)

160
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,460
(came in)

161
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,730
with the exact location

162
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:04,610
of the drug factory.

163
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,770
Mr. Guan and I teamed up

164
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:10,980
and took them all down.

165
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,980
Thinking back,

166
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,130
it went rather well.

167
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:15,420
I still remember

168
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,250
Li Ming's expression.

169
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,060
Police?

170
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,180
You're setting me up!

171
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:35,130
Go!

172
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:43,610
(Li Ming died that day.)

173
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,060
Did you find out

174
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:49,610
who made

175
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:50,530
that call?

176
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,340
No.

177
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,220
And Wu Yongchang?

178
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,340
Has his handwriting

179
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,460
been identified?

180
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:03,700
Yes.

181
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:05,220
Your teacher

182
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,220
might be connected

183
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:07,940
to this case.

184
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:09,890
Besides,

185
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:11,220
Wang Bo has confessed

186
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:12,890
to the drug ring's structure.

187
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:15,420
Our drugs

188
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,650
all came from Feng Zhengxi's lab.

189
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,250
Chen Chuchuan

190
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:20,940
got his drugs from there too.

191
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,460
But he wasn't involved

192
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,530
in the trade.

193
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:25,530
His job

194
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,340
was finding lab rats.

195
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:28,700
Lab rats?

196
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,490
Human guinea pigs.

197
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,650
What role

198
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:33,890
Wu Yongchang plays

199
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,980
remains unclear.

200
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:39,300
I'll go to the school tomorrow

201
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,370
to talk to Wu Yongchang.

202
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:42,460
I'll go with you.

203
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,420
No need.

204
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,340
We should avoid alerting him.

205
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,580
I'm just going

206
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:49,890
to feel him out.

207
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:51,980
Alright.

208
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,730
I'll report to Mr. Bai.

209
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:54,980
Be careful.

210
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:56,610
Stay in touch.

211
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:57,610
Yeah.

212
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,300
Sizhe?

213
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,370
Mr. Wu.

214
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:37,940
The three of us

215
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,980
always see you as a father.

216
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:44,180
Mr. Wu.

217
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,850
Can we

218
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,130
talk honestly today,

219
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:52,770
like family?

220
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:57,370
Go ahead.

221
00:12:58,750 --> 00:12:59,460
Among the drugs

222
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,250
Chen Chuchuan

223
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:02,180
gave his patients,

224
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:03,610
some were

225
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:05,100
experimental drugs.

226
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:06,220
And

227
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,770
we confirmed

228
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:08,820
your handwriting

229
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:10,730
in the research notes

230
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,460
from the drug lab.

231
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,100
My notes

232
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,010
were misused?

233
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:18,300
By whom?

234
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:20,530
Don't you know this?

235
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:21,890
How would I know?

236
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,420
What about Mrs. Wu?

237
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,180
We checked it.

238
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:28,890
She has never

239
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:29,940
left the country.

240
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,700
Where's she?

241
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,940
I'll take you somewhere.

242
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,770
Then you'll know.

243
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:09,180
Yongchang.

244
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:12,180
See who's here.

245
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:14,820
Sizhe.

246
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:17,060
Since Sizhe came to visit you,

247
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,130
I'm taking you home today.

248
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:20,340
Good!

249
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:21,700
Sizhe, go.

250
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,130
Okay.

251
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:22,940
Let's go.

252
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:42,820
Mr. Wu,

253
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:44,890
how did Mrs. Wu

254
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:46,130
develop depression?

255
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:49,980
I'm not sure.

256
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:52,850
One day I came home

257
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,180
and found she had taken many sleeping pills.

258
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:56,650
Guifen?

259
00:14:58,910 --> 00:14:59,490
Guifen?

260
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:03,490
An ambulance!

261
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,980
I need an ambulance!

262
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:07,700
She got many prescriptions,

263
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:09,980
but none worked well.

264
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,060
So from then on,

265
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,370
I tried to develop

266
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:14,650
new medication.

267
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,730
I didn't mean to hide it,

268
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,770
but private development

269
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:21,980
is illegal.

270
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,850
How could I tell you?

271
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:26,580
But

272
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,610
I never produced drugs.

273
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:31,250
It wrecks lives.

274
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:32,420
I know that.

275
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:34,490
Li Ming

276
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,130
was killed by drugs.

277
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:43,940
And Chen Chuchuan?

278
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:47,770
How much do you know

279
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:49,060
about Chen Chuchuan?

280
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,130
Chuchuan...

281
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:54,980
He also had depression.

282
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:56,340
Chuchuan,

283
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:58,060
I'm developing

284
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:00,130
a drug for depression.

285
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,770
Once it's ready,

286
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:03,340
I'm sure you'll be healed.

287
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,370
Don't give up on yourself,

288
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:06,980
okay?

289
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,530
Healers often can't

290
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:14,060
heal themselves.

291
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:15,890
Mr. Wu,

292
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,250
I can cure many,

293
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:21,890
but I can't

294
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:22,820
cure myself.

295
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,890
I know.

296
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:29,250
But I don't know

297
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:30,730
how he got involved

298
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,940
with drugs.

299
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:42,890
Mr. Wu.

300
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:46,130
Are you still

301
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:47,300
developing that drug?

302
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,610
No.

303
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:49,730
I gave up a long time ago.

304
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,130
Has anyone suspicious

305
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:54,940
contacted you recently?

306
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,610
contacted you?

307
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,300
Suspicious?

308
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,370
Well... I think there was one.

309
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:02,340
I don't know

310
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:02,980
how he

311
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,180
got the information.

312
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,420
He said

313
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:07,730
he wanted

314
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,250
to give me a lab.

315
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,090
How could I dare?

316
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,180
Thinking about

317
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,220
what happened to Li Ming,

318
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:14,290
I was scared.

319
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:16,010
So I turned him down.

320
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,460
Mr. Wu,

321
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:19,380
what does he

322
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,380
look like?

323
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,420
Not fat.

324
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:24,860
Bug-eyed.

325
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,730
Slicked-back hair.

326
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:29,660
Take a look.

327
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:33,980
Is it him?

328
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:36,730
Yes. It's him!

329
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,490
Looks like

330
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,180
Mr. Wu is a suspect.

331
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,530
But his explanation

332
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,220
is reasonable.

333
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,290
(Feng Zhengxi contacted him.)

334
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:54,660
I got the number

335
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,660
Feng Zhengxi used

336
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,460
to contact him.

337
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:57,700
Go ahead.

338
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:06,900
Xiaoxi.

339
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,290
Check this number.

340
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:08,900
Yes.

341
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,290
If what he said

342
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:11,570
is true,

343
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,860
I'll send people to watch him

344
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:14,250
to prevent Feng Zhengxi

345
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,460
from harming him.

346
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:16,660
Has Su found

347
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:18,730
any info on Feng Zhengxi?

348
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:19,900
Su...

349
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:22,330
How's it?

350
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:23,290
Nothing found.

351
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:24,770
I'll keep you posted.

352
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:28,660
Mr. Han,

353
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:30,220
the number is disconnected.

354
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:34,940
Su,

355
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:37,140
look into the sanatorium
where Wu Yongchang's wife

356
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:37,770
lives now.

357
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:38,700
See if he's

358
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,490
drugging his wife.

359
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,250
Yes.

360
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,530
Wu Yongchang is missing.

361
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,330
We analyzed

362
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:29,330
the blood samples

363
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,380
from Wu Yongchang's home.

364
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,420
They are from

365
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:33,180
Wu Yongchang and Lin Guifen.

366
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,250
The kidnapper could be Feng Zhengxi.

367
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,290
But we can't

368
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,420
locate him yet.

369
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,900
Mobilize all units.

370
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,010
Launch a manhunt for Feng Zhengxi immediately.

371
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:59,180
Based on the current
drug manufacturing logic

372
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:00,940
and the molecular formula

373
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,220
provided by Li Ming,

374
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,460
the drug ring

375
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:05,250
is searching for

376
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:06,180
this formula.

377
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:07,700
Their goal

378
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:09,290
is to manufacture

379
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:10,530
the new drug.

380
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:11,420
Hence,

381
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:12,530
if we show

382
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:13,860
the book with Li Ming's clue

383
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,530
to the public

384
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,700
and claim

385
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:18,290
it's a clue

386
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,460
left by Mr. K

387
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,290
in the Raw Diamond case,

388
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,140
I guess

389
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,220
it will attract

390
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:23,380
the drug ring's attention.

391
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,530
If they want the formula,

392
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:27,570
they will make a move.

393
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:32,570
Everyone,

394
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,770
this is what we got

395
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:38,250
from the Raw Diamond case.

396
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:45,940
Besides these drugs,

397
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,380
we seized

398
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,810
the drug notes

399
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:50,730
of Mr. K.

400
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,140
Mr. Bai,

401
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,380
it's risky for Qi Sizhe

402
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:51,490
to go solo.

403
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,380
Right.

404
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,290
Too dangerous.

405
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:54,380
I don't agree.

406
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:55,420
Mr. Han,

407
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,490
Mr. Cao,

408
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:57,530
Mr. Bai,

409
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,730
what they want most

410
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,460
is the chemical formula

411
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,330
for this new drug.

412
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:03,810
Therefore,

413
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:05,490
before they get it,

414
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,770
they shouldn't harm me.

415
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,090
What's more,

416
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:10,530
this operation determines

417
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:11,530
whether we can soon

418
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:12,810
get to the bottom

419
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:14,570
of this case.

420
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:16,660
That's why I volunteer.

421
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,420
This matters greatly

422
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:19,940
to the team

423
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:21,460
and to me.

424
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,380
Han Feng.

425
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:59,250
You follow Qi Sizhe.

426
00:22:59,640 --> 00:22:59,980
Got it.

427
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:01,330
(Lixing, Yuanyang,)

428
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:02,860
you two move parallel to his car

429
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:05,220
from the east and west.

430
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,330
Be ready to flank him.

431
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:07,570
Yes.

432
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:24,140
Where's Mr. Wu?

433
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,250
Don't move.

434
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:28,010
Put it on.

435
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:39,700
Turn right.

436
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:48,530
Hurry up.

437
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:52,420
Turn around.

438
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:54,770
Hands behind you.

439
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,050
Turn left ahead.

440
00:25:59,240 --> 00:25:59,730
Turn right.

441
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:45,330
Su.

442
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,140
Check every crossing.

443
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,050
Get Xiaoxi on the cams.

444
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:48,860
Yes.

445
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,530
Let's grill Wu Ya.

446
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,860
Do you have a partner

447
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:55,620
in He City?

448
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:58,090
Know him?

449
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:00,460
Tell us.

450
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:12,290
His name is Sen.

451
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:15,180
He's Nuo Sha's most trusted man.

452
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:17,420
We used the formula

453
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,530
to lure the drug ring.

454
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:19,980
Why did he come?

455
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:21,530
Is he with Nuo Sha,

456
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:22,530
or with the chemist?

457
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:25,420
How would I know?

458
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:26,490
You've had me

459
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:27,250
locked up here.

460
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:27,810
Maybe Nuo Sha

461
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:28,460
connected with

462
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,250
the drug ring.

463
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:30,860
Wu Ya,

464
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,930
I'll give you one more chance.

465
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,540
How to contact Sen?

466
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:35,260
Answer us!

467
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:20,250
He's here.

468
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:22,180
(Give me two days.)

469
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,180
(When I get the formula,)

470
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,010
(deal's on.)

471
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:48,940
Shut up!

472
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,090
(Stay quiet if you want drugs.)

473
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:52,770
(Bunch of addicts.)

474
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:07,090
Mr. Wu?

475
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:08,460
Mr. Wu!

476
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:10,490
Sizhe.

477
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:11,050
Get up.

478
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,330
They got you too?

479
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:17,900
And Mrs. Wu?

480
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,010
I don't know where she is.

481
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:22,980
Sizhe,

482
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,900
he's the man

483
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:25,570
you're hunting.

484
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,180
Come on.

485
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,620
Making a movie?

486
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,290
Well, continue.

487
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,180
Let me see how touching it is.

488
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,140
Feng Zhengxi,

489
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:39,860
you've already got me.

490
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,180
Let my teacher go.

491
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:44,290
Let him go?

492
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:45,810
Don't be naive.

493
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:48,380
If not for you,

494
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,010
my glass factory would be fine!

495
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:53,140
Feng Zhengxi!

496
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:56,980
Take it out on me!

497
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:59,460
If you're really devoted,

498
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:00,620
then give me

499
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,940
Mr. K's diary.

500
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:03,460
Otherwise,

501
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:06,010
I'll kill

502
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,250
your teacher.

503
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:11,770
Feng Zhengxi!

504
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:15,570
If you still want

505
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:17,490
that formula,

506
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:19,570
don't act rashly.

507
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,460
Just kidding.

508
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:38,770
Your teacher

509
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:40,050
is important to me.

510
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:41,770
How would I harm him?

511
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,660
But no guarantees

512
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,010
about the guys out there.

513
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,620
What do you want?

514
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:00,090
Go!

515
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:05,570
Open up.

516
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:07,290
Open up!

517
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,010
Mr. Qi,

518
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,700
give me the formula.

519
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,420
Or else

520
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,090
the others will end up like her.

521
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:57,490
Think about it.

522
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:06,700
Even if you get Sen,

523
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,380
it's too late.

524
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:09,180
They must have handed him

525
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,420
over to the drug ring.

526
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:10,980
Shut up.

527
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:12,180
No tricks.

528
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,900
Sen, here.

529
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:50,140
I brought you a partner.

530
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,530
He's one of us. Don't worry.

531
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:25,650
Han Feng!

532
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:26,570
Stop!

533
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:30,090
Move!

534
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:30,900
Mr. Han.

535
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:32,780
Are you okay?

536
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:33,860
I'm fine.

537
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:34,900
After Wu Ya!

538
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:35,690
Okay.

539
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:43,570
Han Feng!

540
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:44,650
Don't run!

541
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:17,940
Sen!

542
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:19,610
Help me!

543
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:21,210
General...

544
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:26,570
What do we do?

545
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:31,940
Sen!

546
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,690
What do we do now?

547
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,300
Save him!

548
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,090
Move!

549
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:29,210
Stop!

550
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:29,690
Freeze!

551
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:30,690
- Stop! - Go!

552
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,380
- Get down! - Stop!

553
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:32,900
Get down!

554
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:33,690
Get down!

555
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:42,420
Move them.

556
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:43,170
Get up!

557
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:43,820
Get up!

558
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,090
Go!

559
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:45,570
Go!

560
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:29,900
Get over there!

561
00:37:58,840 --> 00:37:59,900
He killed my brother!

562
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:00,860
I will

563
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:01,940
avenge him.

564
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:02,980
Your brother dealt drugs.

565
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:04,340
I arrest every dealer I find!

566
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,380
Do you really think I won't kill him?

567
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:07,090
Si Zhe!

568
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:07,650
Mrs. Wu!

569
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:08,380
Si Zhe!

570
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,780
Sorry! It's all my fault!

571
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:10,380
Mrs. Wu!

572
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,130
After talks,

573
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:13,420
Mr. Bai and I have approved

574
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,460
Han Feng's undercover op.

575
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:15,420
Nuo Sha?

576
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:16,820
Old man.

577
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,010
If the formula is correct,

578
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:20,340
there shouldn't be a problem.

579
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:21,260
Move now.

580
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,610
Shut down the drug factory

581
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,740
as soon as possible.

582
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,170
Bring Han Feng and Qi Sizhe

583
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,610
back safely.

584
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,490
Evacuate the hostages!

585
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:29,570
Drop it!

586
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:30,690
Drop it!
