1
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:04,850
Hello?

2
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:07,380
Hairs?

3
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:09,410
OK, I got it.

4
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:10,340
Well,

5
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,410
you can send them

6
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,170
to take a DNA test.

7
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:13,540
OK.

8
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,060
Mr. Han.

9
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:19,780
A few long hairs were found

10
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,940
in the pork shop.

11
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,010
I suspect they're

12
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:22,780
the missing girl's.

13
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:23,850
I've asked the lab

14
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:24,610
to take a DNA test.

15
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,340
Alright.

16
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:34,450
Hello?

17
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,170
Any new clues?

18
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,130
Mr. Han?

19
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:39,260
Wan just visited

20
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,540
the villagers around the cave.

21
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,660
They said

22
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,890
an unregistered crew

23
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,100
used to film a video there.

24
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,170
Those spider webs, cocoons,

25
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,130
and dolls

26
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,380
are abandoned props.

27
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,690
We've verified

28
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:51,940
that's true.

29
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:52,940
The art designer

30
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,010
has sent the pictures.

31
00:03:58,910 --> 00:03:59,450
Photos.

32
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:00,820
Thanks.

33
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:04,780
Mr. Qi.

34
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:11,060
Photos from the crew.

35
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:19,290
Han Feng.

36
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:20,730
The crew should have used

37
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,660
the ordinary spider web.

38
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:23,170
But the murderer

39
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,980
changed it to

40
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:26,700
the unique funnel web.

41
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,250
This is a funnel-web spider.

42
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,460
Extremely venomous.

43
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:36,610
If an adult is bitten,

44
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,980
he'll die in 15 minutes.

45
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,220
The funnel-web spider is

46
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,610
the most venomous of

47
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,050
over 30,000 known spider species.

48
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:45,810
I think

49
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:47,700
the murderer might

50
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,700
imitate the funnel-web spider

51
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:50,100
to kill people.

52
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,170
Any grounds?

53
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:53,780
Ms. Zhu.

54
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:54,980
Make a video call,

55
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,170
and I'll tell you.

56
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:01,980
Look at here.

57
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,050
Two pinholes are parallel.

58
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:08,490
And the skin around

59
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,050
has been damaged.

60
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,930
This should be the scar

61
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,170
after injecting

62
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:14,020
the neurotoxin.

63
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:15,460
And here.

64
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,900
These two wounds.

65
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,410
Based on the caliber,

66
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,700
they were likely caused by

67
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:23,850
a tubular material like a PVC pipe

68
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,490
sticking into the body.

69
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:27,490
There are signs that

70
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:28,930
the victim's organs were

71
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:30,250
dissolved by a strong acid,

72
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,460
which might be injected

73
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,340
into the victim's body

74
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,050
through the wounds.

75
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:36,340
This modus operandi

76
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:37,980
probably simulated

77
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:39,460
the spider's way of eating,

78
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,140
like sticking its fangs

79
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:42,460
into the prey's body

80
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,930
and dissolving organs

81
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:44,700
with digestive enzymes.

82
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:45,850
However,

83
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:47,170
the murderer used a strong acid

84
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,370
as a substitute.

85
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,100
So, in order to simulate

86
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,700
the spider's hunting skills,

87
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:56,340
the murderer wrapped the corpse
with plastic wrap.

88
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:58,100
Using plastic wrap and alcohol

89
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,020
to wrap the corpse

90
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,340
can embalm the corpse

91
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:01,900
by isolating the air.

92
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:04,410
Although the murderer

93
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:05,730
killed people like a spider,

94
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,580
that isn't

95
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:08,900
the real cause of death

96
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,410
but this.

97
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,340
See the pinhole behind the ear?

98
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,810
When I studied anatomy

99
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,100
in Medical University,

100
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,020
to reduce the pain

101
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,580
of experimental rabbits

102
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,900
when they were dying,

103
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,100
the school usually

104
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,900
injected air behind their ears

105
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:25,460
to cause an air embolism.

106
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,020
And this can also

107
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,780
apply to humans.

108
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,540
Why did the murderer do this?

109
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:31,780
The victim was dead.

110
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,780
It was unnecessary.

111
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,020
The venom and the strong acid.

112
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:36,370
Not enough?

113
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:39,020
Based on the blood coagulation,

114
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,490
the murderer should have

115
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:41,980
injected the neurotoxin,

116
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:44,490
but the victim didn't die.

117
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:45,410
Therefore,

118
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:46,980
he injected the air.

119
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,020
Someone who knows this

120
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:50,810
should have a medical background?

121
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:53,660
For now, everything is speculation.

122
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:54,780
The details...

123
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:55,900
We have to wait for

124
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,540
the toxicology report

125
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,100
to decide if that is

126
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,170
the venom of the funnel-web.

127
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,610
Now, that girl

128
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,980
is still in danger.

129
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,490
We have to find her.

130
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,370
Mr. Han.

131
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:11,810
Here's a clue.

132
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,220
Last night,

133
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,290
8:17 pm,

134
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:28,730
the platform received a call

135
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:29,900
from the North Pork Shop.

136
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,580
When the policemen arrived there,

137
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:32,730
Huang Hao, the reporter,

138
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,700
also the shop's owner,

139
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,460
had died.

140
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:37,250
The murderer disappeared

141
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,140
with the kidnapped girl.

142
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,730
In a nearby cave,

143
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,290
we found a dead woman,

144
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,490
the victim in the cocoon.

145
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,290
The victim has an obvious knife wound,

146
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:46,250
deep in her uterus,

147
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:47,980
causing great damage.

148
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,490
Maybe the murderer hates women.

149
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:52,810
She also suffered a wound

150
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:53,900
in her belly

151
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,340
after her death.

152
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,460
The length is about 20 centimeters.

153
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:59,460
Besides, from the time of death,

154
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,050
the victim is probably not

155
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:02,140
the kidnapped girl.

156
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,930
This is the rope we found

157
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,250
in the cave on the North Mountain.

158
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:07,020
According to the report,

159
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:08,220
the DNA

160
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:08,610
on it

161
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,140
doesn't

162
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,370
match the victim

163
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:11,610
in the cocoon.

164
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:12,780
And look,

165
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:14,660
the cross section is new.

166
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:15,930
We also found

167
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:16,700
its fiber

168
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,020
on a nearby stone.

169
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:19,410
So, it's likely that

170
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:20,900
the victim was imprisoned

171
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,050
in the cave by the murderer,

172
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:23,930
and then she broke the rope

173
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:24,900
with a stone

174
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,020
and escaped to the pork shop

175
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,100
to ask for help.

176
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:34,220
Unluckily,

177
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,250
the murderer found it.

178
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,220
Then he chased to the pork shop,

179
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,700
killed the shop's owner.

180
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:44,300
Meanwhile,

181
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:45,700
he took the victim away.

182
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,130
Based on these clues,

183
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,730
the kidnapped woman

184
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,460
is probably still in the murderer's hands.

185
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:52,700
This victim's identity

186
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,460
has been confirmed.

187
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:54,650
She's Ye Yingying,

188
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,820
25 years old,

189
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,340
a PR practitioner in a marketing agency.

190
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,770
On October 1st,

191
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:00,010
her family called the police.

192
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,340
She's been missing for a month?

193
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:02,460
Yes.

194
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:03,490
In this time,

195
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:05,060
any ransom call from the kidnapper?

196
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,610
Not at all.

197
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:08,130
Colleges in other bureaus

198
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,460
had investigated her house too.

199
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,130
There was no trace of robbery

200
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,530
or kidnapping.

201
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:15,580
In fact, they've been looking for

202
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,530
the missing woman.

203
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:17,060
And we just

204
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,340
found the corpse before them.

205
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,980
Tell them about this.

206
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:20,730
This case,

207
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:21,850
due to the jurisdiction,

208
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,820
we'll take it over.

209
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:23,460
OK.

210
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,700
Any clues about the doll?

211
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,060
Organs in the doll

212
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,460
are verified as

213
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:29,420
a cow's lymph, lung, and intestines.

214
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,700
And we're doing

215
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,490
a further check.

216
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,940
The murderer is likely

217
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,580
to have a medical background.

218
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,300
Having some medical knowledge,

219
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:39,460
meticulous,

220
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:40,700
pursuing a sense of ritual,

221
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:42,100
having some mental problems.

222
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,250
Those dolls

223
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,610
should be the practice props.

224
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:45,530
Practice?

225
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,300
You mean, using living people to learn

226
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,370
hunting skills like a spider?

227
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,130
Typical antisocial personality disorder.

228
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:54,420
Was Song Liang questioned?

229
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:54,980
Yep.

230
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,300
He insisted he's no murderer,

231
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,250
just stealing things.

232
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,300
Surveillance video.

233
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:00,890
We also compared

234
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,460
Mr. Qi's anatomical report

235
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:04,220
with the result of the on-site survey

236
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:05,370
confirmed

237
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:06,850
he didn't kill people.

238
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:07,580
Indeed.

239
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,010
We checked

240
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,250
all footprints on the site

241
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:11,180
and confirmed

242
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,100
Song Liang stayed on the 2nd floor.

243
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,340
That is to say,

244
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:17,850
now, we have

245
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:18,980
hardly any clues

246
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:22,300
except for two victims.

247
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,130
Since the crime occurred,

248
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:27,460
a dozen hours have passed,

249
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:30,010
and we still

250
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:30,940
can't be sure

251
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,460
if the victim is still alive.

252
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,220
When we found the victim,

253
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,730
her feet and hands were tied up.

254
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:41,180
Maybe the murderer

255
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:43,580
imprisoned her for a time

256
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:45,180
before killing her.

257
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,130
Don't get upset.

258
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:51,770
Creatures in nature

259
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:52,700
always have

260
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,420
their unique behavior patterns.

261
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,370
If the murderer indeed

262
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:57,490
imitated a spider,

263
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:58,890
he must have a fixed mode

264
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:00,490
of imprisoning others

265
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,420
and the crime cycle.

266
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:03,850
Xi.

267
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,300
This is a calendar we found

268
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,250
in the cave.

269
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:10,490
There's a mark on "August 1st".

270
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:11,980
And on this day,

271
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:13,610
Ye Yingying's family

272
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,530
called the police.

273
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,250
The next mark

274
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:17,700
is "August 14th".

275
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:20,060
A 13-day interval.

276
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,250
It happens to match

277
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:22,220
Ye Yingying's death time

278
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:22,980
I got

279
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,180
from the autopsy.

280
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:26,300
If the circle is "kidnapping",

281
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:27,580
and the cross is "murder".

282
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,980
Then, on August 17th,

283
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,060
he kidnapped another person.

284
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,130
And the next killing time...

285
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,180
August 30th.

286
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:35,850
If your guess is right,

287
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:36,460
we only have

288
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,340
three days left.

289
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,250
No matter what we do,

290
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:44,530
we must save her.

291
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:51,940
Li,

292
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:53,940
try to look for

293
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,220
all the surveillance videos

294
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:55,850
around the scene.

295
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:57,650
Shops

296
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,060
and surrounding roads.

297
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:00,460
As long as the passing car

298
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:01,980
has a dash camera,

299
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,420
retrieve the footage.

300
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:04,610
Besides,

301
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:06,250
when the victim escaped

302
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,220
from the cave,

303
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,220
she was pictured.

304
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:08,980
Find her.

305
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,300
We must know who she is.

306
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:13,180
Wan.

307
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,340
Visit the crime scene,

308
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:15,490
find out if there are

309
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:16,490
more witnesses,

310
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:17,890
and ask them whatever you can.

311
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:20,820
And don't forget the settlement

312
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,610
around the cave.

313
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:22,850
The murderer imprisoned

314
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:23,770
the victim for a long time.

315
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:24,980
Don't miss

316
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,180
anything strange happened

317
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,180
in this month.

318
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:34,370
About Ye Yingying,

319
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:35,300
what was she like at work?

320
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:36,340
Su,

321
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:37,770
investigate

322
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:38,700
Ye Yingying's colleagues

323
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,580
and family members

324
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,580
to check anything

325
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:41,580
we left out.

326
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,530
Did she have any hobbies?

327
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:45,460
She had a love of beauty.

328
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,530
She often went to the aesthetic clinic.

329
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:28,530
Mr. Han,

330
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:29,220
documents.

331
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,420
The pork shop is lonely.

332
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:32,300
No surveillance camera

333
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,130
within a 5 km radius.

334
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:34,250
When it's dark,

335
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:35,220
no car will pass there,

336
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,220
so the traffic police

337
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,220
have no clues either.

338
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:39,250
Hello, Su.

339
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:40,100
What happened?

340
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:40,980
Mr. Han,

341
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,770
I'm in Ye Yingying's company.

342
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,530
Her colleague said she had no boyfriend.

343
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:46,490
And she loved dressing up

344
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:47,770
and aesthetic courses.

345
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:49,130
I remembered,

346
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,420
in Mr. Qi's report,

347
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:52,610
Ye Yingying's mandible

348
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,820
has tiny pinholes.

349
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:55,180
Scars of

350
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,300
the aesthetic medicine?

351
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,100
Hmm...

352
00:13:58,790 --> 00:13:59,940
The report of organs

353
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:01,130
comes out.

354
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:02,850
They are from ill cattle.

355
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,250
Suspected to be Bovine TB.

356
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:08,730
Alright, I got it.

357
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:11,370
Police station on Unity Road called us.

358
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:12,220
Someone is missing.

359
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:14,180
From the description,

360
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,370
it should be our victim.

361
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:16,340
I'll go there.

362
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:17,420
Ms. Zhu.

363
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,420
Follow up with Mr. Qi.

364
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:18,850
OK.

365
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,850
Let's go, Mr. Qi.

366
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:07,460
When did you

367
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,250
lose her contact?

368
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,460
We'd been contacting on WeChat.

369
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:12,010
She sent us voice messages
(Watch on www.kisskh,la to support Admin)

370
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,060
and made voice calls.

371
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:15,770
But in the past month or so,

372
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:16,820
she only sent texts.

373
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:17,890
We tried to call her,

374
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:18,890
but she never received it.

375
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,490
Her dad had a birthday a few days ago.

376
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:22,530
She didn't come back.

377
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:23,820
We thought it was weird,

378
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,490
so we came to He City.

379
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:26,650
Ten days ago,

380
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,060
we still had a chat

381
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:29,250
promising to visit her.

382
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:30,370
She said yes.

383
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,010
Any records?

384
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:39,300
Here.

385
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:42,700
However, we found no one

386
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,250
in her house.

387
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:44,890
Everything was covered with dust.

388
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:46,100
We went to

389
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,530
the hospital where she worked.

390
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,460
Until then,

391
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:50,890
she'd quit the job for a month.

392
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,770
As you were in He City,

393
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,650
did she contact you?

394
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,250
We've been here for a week

395
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:57,890
but couldn't find her.

396
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:00,060
So we called the police.

397
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:01,250
A week?

398
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:01,730
Yes.

399
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:14,850
The biological institute

400
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:15,850
has been excluded.

401
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:17,580
Among nearby universities,

402
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,820
only this agricultural university

403
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:19,530
is researching

404
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:20,530
bovine TB.

405
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,220
It hasn't broken out

406
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:23,610
for ages in this province.

407
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:25,580
Maybe this is an individual case.

408
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,460
And those organs.

409
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,980
Although corroded

410
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:29,820
by hydrochloric acid,

411
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:31,250
we can still recognize

412
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:33,100
the scar caused by the operation.

413
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:37,610
Bovine TB spreads through

414
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,220
droplets in the air and dust.

415
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:42,220
It mainly infects airways

416
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,890
and then digestive tracts.

417
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,300
One and a half months ago,

418
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:56,100
we indeed experimented on

419
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,300
bovine TB.

420
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,250
But all the samples

421
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,250
had been decontaminated

422
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:02,980
after the experiment.

423
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:05,140
They couldn't spread.

424
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:06,860
What if some students

425
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,730
took them out secretly?

426
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,570
Impossible.

427
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:13,810
Prof. Wang.

428
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:16,140
This is the tissue slice.

429
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:18,620
With this,

430
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:19,490
please help us confirm

431
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:20,980
if it's the same type

432
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:22,140
as what you used

433
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:22,940
for the experiment.

434
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,490
And a list of participants

435
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:25,460
in this experiment.

436
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:26,490
Please provide it

437
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:27,050
for us.

438
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,290
You're suspecting

439
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:31,010
it's relevant

440
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,140
to the school?

441
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,620
Prof. Wang,

442
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,730
do you know if

443
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,940
someone raises spiders?

444
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,460
Is she afraid of spiders?

445
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,010
Spiders...

446
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:47,980
Spiders?

447
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:50,980
Yaoqi is the most afraid of spiders.

448
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,860
There was a little one in the house.

449
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,530
She saw it

450
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:54,980
and was scared to go back.

451
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:56,380
Did this

452
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:57,860
have anything to do with

453
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,660
her missing?

454
00:17:59,400 --> 00:17:59,770
No.

455
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,180
Not yet.

456
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:02,660
Alright.

457
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:04,180
We're almost done.

458
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,770
We'll inform you of new information.

459
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,180
Please follow me

460
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,180
to complete the transcript.

461
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,940
Need a long time?

462
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,770
Yaoqi's friend is

463
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:15,810
waiting for us downstairs.

464
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:16,700
Friend?

465
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:17,900
Oh,

466
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:18,900
that's it.

467
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:20,700
When we visited Yaoqi's house,

468
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:21,380
we met her.

469
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,660
She sent us here

470
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,620
with enthusiasm.

471
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:37,460
Hello.

472
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:41,940
No, thanks.

473
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,220
You're Yaoqi's friend?

474
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:45,570
Yep.

475
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,770
Did they finish the statement?

476
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,980
Why don't you come upstairs?

477
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,090
Your name?

478
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,770
I'm Li Shuting,

479
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,860
Yaoqi's colleague.

480
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:05,860
There's something

481
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,620
I can't say

482
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,090
in front of her parents.

483
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:11,050
What?

484
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,090
I didn't tell them

485
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,290
Yaoqi was actually fired.

486
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,570
Why?

487
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,090
She did a part-time job.

488
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:21,700
A part-time job?

489
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,900
In an aesthetic clinic.

490
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:27,860
Her parents

491
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,220
wanted her to come home and get married.

492
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:32,980
But she had a love of beauty.

493
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:33,730
So...

494
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,140
So what?

495
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,530
The money she made

496
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:40,330
was put into the clinic.

497
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,770
Having a part-time job there

498
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:43,220
can offer

499
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:44,490
an employee discount.

500
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,220
I'm in Ye Yingying's company.

501
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,730
Her colleague said she had no boyfriend.

502
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,980
And she loved dressing up.

503
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,490
Ye Yingying's mandible

504
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,770
has tiny pinholes.

505
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:53,570
Scars of

506
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:54,570
the aesthetic medicine?

507
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,380
You've seen her parents, right?

508
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,180
From the countryside,

509
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,490
they're conservative.

510
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,570
How could they agree

511
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:04,090
on plastic surgeries?

512
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:05,860
So Yaoqi

513
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,090
kept hiding herself.

514
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:08,250
I think Yaoqi

515
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:09,620
didn't disappear.

516
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,770
Where is the clinic

517
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,290
she worked in?

518
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:20,940
I have a name card.

519
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:23,900
Here you are.

520
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,290
I'd also been there.

521
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,530
Yaoqi said

522
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,530
the clinic has no compliance,

523
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:34,660
but it had a lower price.

524
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,980
Don't worry too much.

525
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,620
We'll try our best to find her.

526
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,250
Contact us

527
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:42,140
if you have any problems.

528
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:42,980
OK.

529
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,290
Hey.

530
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,620
Are you alright?

531
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:46,220
Yes.

532
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:48,730
Be careful.

533
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:49,460
Sir.

534
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:50,860
You're weak.

535
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:52,180
I'll help you.

536
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:57,940
Your phone number.

537
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,250
Make a statement afterwards.

538
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,570
Can you keep a secret

539
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:10,380
from her parents

540
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,250
about what I've said?

541
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,530
She'll be angry if she knows this.

542
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:14,460
OK.

543
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,420
I gotta go.

544
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:19,900
Let's go.

545
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:22,620
Give it to me.

546
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:27,620
What's that?

547
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,380
Zhu.

548
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:39,940
Mr. Qi.

549
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:42,050
Here's the comparison result

550
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:42,980
of the bovine TB

551
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:44,250
from Prof. Wang.

552
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:46,180
This is a name list

553
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,490
of the participants, and photos.

554
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:48,700
Besides,

555
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,050
Prof. Wang had

556
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:50,900
a reliable alibi.

557
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:52,660
He was at home that night.

558
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:56,700
Confirmed.

559
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,810
The organs are from

560
00:21:58,830 --> 00:21:59,490
the experiment.

561
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:01,090
Therefore,

562
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,530
the murderer is one of those

563
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:04,380
who participated in

564
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,090
this experiment.

565
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:12,570
Is every student here?

566
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:13,810
Yes.

567
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:14,530
Oh.

568
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,810
Six students haven't arrived.

569
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:16,810
Zhu.

570
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:18,570
Xi assembled all the students

571
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:19,620
who participated in

572
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,770
the bovine TB experiment.

573
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:21,250
They're here.

574
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:22,940
Everybody, be quiet, okay?

575
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:24,570
Please cooperate with us.

576
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:25,290
Name list.

577
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,620
Six students haven't arrived yet.

578
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,660
They're on vacation.

579
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:31,860
Let's go.

580
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,660
I'm Luo Hongcai.

581
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,250
Luo Hongcai.

582
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,570
On the evening of Aug. 26th,

583
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:39,660
where were you?

584
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,140
At home.

585
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:42,570
Your age?

586
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:43,420
Nineteen.

587
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:43,860
Nineteen?

588
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:44,290
Yes.

589
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:45,980
Do you know them?

590
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:46,860
Yes.

591
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:47,860
My classmates.

592
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:51,050
How many people are in your dorm?

593
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:51,660
Four.

594
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,810
Where were you that day?

595
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:53,860
I was at home.

596
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:55,490
The dorm's gate has a camera.

597
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,810
You can have a check.

598
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,010
I promise I didn't go out.

599
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:59,420
Who can prove it?

600
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:00,860
I was sleeping.

601
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:01,860
How did I do that?

602
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:02,980
No one in your house?

603
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:04,900
Can you tell me

604
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,660
your parents' names?

605
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:07,570
Usually, the girls' dorm...

606
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,620
When you had a class,

607
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,250
did you notice

608
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:10,090
any strange people?

609
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:11,900
Sorry, I didn't.

610
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:12,530
Alright.

611
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:13,420
Sign here.

612
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,660
Why is the clinic here?

613
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:29,380
It isn't unregistered, dude.

614
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,620
Be careful.

615
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:32,330
OK.

616
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,380
Sir.

617
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:42,180
We're closed.

618
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,050
See you.

619
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:46,220
Police.

620
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:57,460
Why are you here?

621
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,250
Hey.

622
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:02,530
Hmm...

623
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,010
Just... Just the glucose solution.

624
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:11,180
For myself.

625
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:25,570
Sir, I...

626
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:41,050
What's your business?

627
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,250
Tuina.
[*A kind of Chinese massage]

628
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,140
Unregistered clinic?

629
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:44,330
No, no, no.

630
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:44,700
Not at all.

631
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,180
Sit down!

632
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:47,290
Sit down.

633
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,460
What do you do here?

634
00:24:58,310 --> 00:24:59,050
Tuina.

635
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:00,570
Need so many things?

636
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:03,420
Medical license?

637
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:04,730
Show me.

638
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,570
Sir.

639
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,220
Just some small business.

640
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,570
I did nothing bad.

641
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,050
Nothing bad?

642
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,380
Then listen to my question.

643
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:20,290
Know her?

644
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:22,620
No.

645
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:28,900
Think twice and answer me.

646
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:31,250
If there's nothing else,

647
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:31,860
I'm leaving.

648
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:38,460
Ms. Zhu.

649
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,730
I've asked everyone reachable.

650
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,050
Excluded their suspicion.

651
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,220
The rest are either out of town

652
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,050
or back home.

653
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,180
I'll keep contacting.

654
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:46,460
OK.

655
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:48,380
We don't have much time.

656
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,250
Quick as possible.

657
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:57,620
I know her.

658
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,380
She was my nurse

659
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:00,700
as a part-time job.

660
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:02,380
These medicines.

661
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:03,730
She brought them from the hospital

662
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,180
and sold them here.

663
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:07,770
This woman?

664
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,250
Maybe.

665
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:11,810
Have no impression.

666
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:15,980
Look up.

667
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,180
Look up!

668
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:20,250
Did you kill her?

669
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:23,140
Killed... Killed her?

670
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:24,180
No, no, no.

671
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,050
Impossible!

672
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,330
How can I kill her?

673
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:27,940
Why killed her? How?

674
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:29,250
You wronged me.

675
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:30,940
How dare I kill her?

676
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,420
Just a skin-whitening injection.

677
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:33,730
It can't make her die.

678
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:34,770
Her cause of death.

679
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,010
How can I know that?

680
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,220
I didn't kill her!

681
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:41,010
This girl had an anesthesia allergy.

682
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:41,770
How?

683
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:44,730
She came here for an injection.

684
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,140
The moment she received the anesthesia,

685
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,530
she began convulsing

686
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,220
and fainted.

687
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:49,900
Yaoqi...

688
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:51,220
Yingying.

689
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:52,620
Yingying!

690
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:54,620
Yingying!

691
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,140
Dong!

692
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:57,330
What happened?

693
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:58,940
Is she allergic?

694
00:26:59,110 --> 00:26:59,460
Allergic.

695
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,460
Yingying.

696
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:01,530
Hello?

697
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,380
Where are you?

698
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,860
Come... Come here quickly.

699
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:04,730
Bad thing!

700
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:05,570
Hurry up!

701
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:06,490
Then... Then...

702
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:07,700
Then you saved her.

703
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:08,770
No, no, no.

704
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:10,380
I didn't know that.

705
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,180
What?

706
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,180
Speaking.

707
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:15,490
Sir.

708
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:17,090
I beg you.

709
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,810
If I tell you,

710
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,290
don't stop my nephew

711
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:21,530
from being a doctor, okay?

712
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,050
Say it.

713
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:25,530
I have a nephew.

714
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:27,140
He's learning to be a doctor.

715
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,090
What doctor?

716
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:31,810
An animal doctor
in Agricultural University.

717
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,140
But...

718
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:34,140
As he came here,

719
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:35,460
he cured this girl.

720
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,490
Afterwards, the girl

721
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,530
left here alone.

722
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,380
You can check

723
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:39,380
the surveillance video.

724
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:40,290
She walked out,

725
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,220
safe and sound.

726
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,290
I'm done. Send them away.

727
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:52,620
Hello, Mr. Han?

728
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:54,490
Ms. Zhu.

729
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,620
Help me find

730
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,730
if a student's surname

731
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:58,420
is Liao.

732
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:00,900
Let me have a look.

733
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:05,330
Yes.

734
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:06,860
There is a student

735
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:08,010
called Liao Yunsheng.

736
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,660
Your nephew is Liao Yunsheng?

737
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:12,490
Yes. Yes.

738
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:15,090
That's him.

739
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:18,660
Anyone questioned a student

740
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,770
called Liao Yunsheng?

741
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:22,460
Nope.

742
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:23,530
Me either.

743
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,530
Liao Yunsheng?

744
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:25,980
Liao Yunsheng.

745
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:26,700
I didn't.

746
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,250
No.

747
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:31,700
Where's your nephew?

748
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:35,090
I've lost his contact

749
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:35,980
for a while.

750
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,490
Maybe he returned to his hometown.

751
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,090
Is he in school, or anywhere else?

752
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:41,290
Did he rent a house?

753
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:43,860
This kid

754
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:45,810
had few communications with me.

755
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:47,460
When something happened,

756
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:48,860
I called him.

757
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:50,380
I really don't know.

758
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:52,770
I'm not lying.

759
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,900
I really don't know that.

760
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,090
Thank you

761
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:57,810
and your students

762
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:58,900
for the cooperation.

763
00:28:59,070 --> 00:28:59,660
You're welcome.

764
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:00,420
Take care.

765
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,250
Bye.

766
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:02,490
Then we're leaving.

767
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:02,900
OK.

768
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,460
It's late.

769
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:03,980
Goodbye.

770
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:05,050
Guys. Guys!

771
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:05,940
Wait a second.

772
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,330
Do you know

773
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:08,220
Liao Yunsheng?

774
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:11,660
Do you know him?

775
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:13,770
Unfamiliar with him?

776
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,330
Liao Yunsheng.

777
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:18,570
I... I'm familiar with him.

778
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:20,940
His home?

779
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:23,620
Wu Village.

780
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:26,570
Wu Village.

781
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,090
Take him back

782
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:54,330
and confiscate this shop.

783
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,090
No problem.

784
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:41,660
Be careful.

785
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:17,900
Here it is.

786
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,090
I'll check houses next to it.

787
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,010
OK.

788
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:23,090
Take care.

789
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:23,810
OK.

790
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,330
Xi, follow me.

791
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:52,460
There's no

792
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:53,810
funnel-web spider.

793
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:55,010
Mr. Han.

794
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:57,380
Look,

795
00:31:58,070 --> 00:31:58,860
this is Ye Yingying,

796
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:00,090
the first victim.

797
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:17,140
These two are Xie Yaoqi.

798
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,460
Did he draw pictures

799
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,420
of all the victims?

800
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:36,530
Who's this?

801
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:39,570
Don't tell me

802
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:40,660
this is the third victim.

803
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,090
I'm Li Shuting,

804
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:54,530
Yaoqi's colleague.

805
00:32:56,270 --> 00:32:56,900
Your phone number.

806
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:58,570
I gotta go.

807
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:00,810
I've seen her.

808
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:54,660
Evidence all points to Liao Yunsheng.

809
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,330
He's the prime suspect in this case.

810
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:58,010
Do you know a kind of people

811
00:33:58,110 --> 00:34:00,180
imagining themselves as animals?

812
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:01,330
Clinical lycanthropy.

813
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:03,010
This is a mental illness.

814
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,330
Thirteen days

815
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,140
is the interval

816
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,420
between mating and egg-laying.

817
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:07,700
There were no signs

818
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,010
of sexual assault on Yingying's body.

819
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:11,050
It's dark. Sound of machinery.

820
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:11,900
We split up

821
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,130
to find suspected places.

822
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,340
You've met Liao Yunsheng.

823
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,420
Is that him?

824
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,690
Center the search on the clinic,

825
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:22,010
check all surrounding crossroads.

826
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,050
We can't let him go this time.
