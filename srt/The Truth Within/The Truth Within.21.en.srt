00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:35,780
[Episode 21]

2
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,850
How did you get to He City?

3
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:55,610
Where's Nuo Sha?

4
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:05,410
Where is he?

5
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,170
Investigated for so long,

6
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:11,890
and you still don't know

7
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:13,340
who exactly he is?

8
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:16,010
Sen!

9
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,060
Just cooperate with us!

10
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:21,060
Cooperate?

11
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:22,850
Fine.

12
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,010
You want Nuo Sha?

13
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:27,980
I can send you to him.

14
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:29,730
Is this funny?

15
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:32,100
I asked you, where is he?

16
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,130
In hell.

17
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,890
Sen!

18
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,130
Save me!

19
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,100
Save the General!

20
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,780
In Decang City,

21
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,170
there's a drug lord

22
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,260
named Nuo Sha,

23
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,410
known as General.

24
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,130
He is very mysterious.

25
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,380
Because until now,

26
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,260
no one

27
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,850
has seen his real face.

28
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:05,570
Didn't you see it yourself?

29
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,410
Wu Ya

30
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,010
is Nuo Sha.

31
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,540
What's this?

32
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:43,250
Where's the last page?

33
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:45,490
Release

34
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:46,850
the people you've locked up,

35
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:47,980
and I'll tell you.

36
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,140
You really think

37
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,050
I won't kill him?

38
00:04:58,870 --> 00:04:59,410
Sizhe!

39
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:00,930
Sizhe!

40
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:01,780
Sizhe!

41
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,460
Stop playing tricks.

42
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:07,900
Just cooperate!

43
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,220
Fine.

44
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,540
Kill this man first,

45
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:12,850
and I'll cooperate.

46
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:13,490
Listen.

47
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,020
You're a suspect now.

48
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:16,140
This is your chance

49
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,460
for redemption.

50
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,780
You're in no position

51
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,700
to bargain with us.

52
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,050
He killed my brother!

53
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,730
A life for a life.

54
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:25,460
I'll have my

55
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,410
revenge.

56
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,370
Traitor!

57
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:31,930
Stop!

58
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:35,100
He was an undercover

59
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:35,810
agent by my brother.

60
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,810
He betrayed my brother.

61
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:41,700
Come out!

62
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:45,370
Traitor, come out!

63
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:06,780
Brother?

64
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,050
See these people?

65
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,610
See them?

66
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,660
Your brother killed them all.

67
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,170
Your brother is a dealer.

68
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,170
I'll bust them all!

69
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:42,810
Mr. Wu.

70
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,170
Drop the act.

71
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:48,580
We checked the nursing home.

72
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,050
I ran the tests.

73
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,810
It's been confirmed.

74
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:54,780
The pills Mrs. Wu took

75
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,610
are designer drugs.

76
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,290
You must have

77
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,140
realized she was addicted.

78
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:03,610
That's why you

79
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:04,810
sent her there.

80
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:07,050
What pills?

81
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,020
She's at the nursing home

82
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:11,850
for depression.

83
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:25,370
Sizhe.

84
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:26,900
Sizhe.

85
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,100
Let me explain.

86
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,290
I... I only did it

87
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,580
because they forced me.

88
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,810
They forced me to make drugs.

89
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:42,140
I never intended to use medicine

90
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:43,660
to develop drugs.

91
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,660
So,

92
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:49,050
you admit

93
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,980
you made those drugs?

94
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,660
I did.

95
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:55,810
They threatened Guifen.

96
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:57,930
If I didn't cooperate,

97
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:58,850
they'd kill her.

98
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,250
What about Li Ming and Chen Chuchuan?

99
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:04,900
When did they

100
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,730
get involved?

101
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,140
Mr. Wu.

102
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,370
This stuff...

103
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,170
Do you even know

104
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:11,780
the demand for it?

105
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,460
If we mass-produce it,

106
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:15,700
the profits would be insane!

107
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:18,340
I'm warning you, Li Ming.

108
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,660
I'm making medicine.

109
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,220
I'm not touching drugs.

110
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,100
It's medicine! Medicine!

111
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,490
But even to develop medicine,

112
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,490
the following

113
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:31,170
equipment and research

114
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,730
all need funding, right?

115
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,770
After Li Ming died,

116
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,180
you didn't

117
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,420
stop the research.

118
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:40,060
Is that medicine? It's drug!

119
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:40,340
Mr. Wu.

120
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,420
I said it's medicine!

121
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,100
Just stop this, okay?

122
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:44,060
Whether it's drug

123
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,300
depends on how you use it!

124
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,730
We've come this far.

125
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,580
No turning back.

126
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:55,100
Otherwise,

127
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,890
what about Guifen?

128
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,250
What about you?

129
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:01,220
Yes.

130
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:03,580
I...

131
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,220
Seeing Jiangxue

132
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,060
makes me happy.

133
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,370
But the price

134
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:13,100
of this happiness is too high.

135
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:18,060
I've always made medicine.

136
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:20,370
But they wanted drugs!

137
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,130
I didn't expect

138
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:24,730
it would end like this.

139
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,580
Li Ming and Chuchuan,

140
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:30,610
they died because of you!

141
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:31,980
Don't you

142
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,370
regret any of it?

143
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:34,850
Their deaths weren't my fault.

144
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:36,340
I have principles.

145
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,060
The killing

146
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:40,890
was all their doing.

147
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,300
Enough of that.

148
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,700
You, Qi!

149
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,100
Give me the last page now.

150
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:48,650
Otherwise,

151
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,340
your precious professor

152
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,370
and his wife

153
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,130
will be fed to the dogs!

154
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:54,460
Understand?

155
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,130
Sizhe.

156
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:00,940
Just give the formula, okay?

157
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:02,730
Save Guifen.

158
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,370
Save her!

159
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:08,700
Feng Zhengxi.

160
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:10,820
Bring Mrs. Wu over.

161
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,340
I want to ensure her safety.

162
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,610
Based on the lab tests,

163
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,580
the soil from

164
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,980
Mr. Qi's home contains

165
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,980
high levels of methamphetamine.

166
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,370
That's the main raw material

167
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:30,250
for making drugs.

168
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,250
We're certain

169
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:33,250
that wherever this soil is,

170
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,300
there's a drug factory.

171
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,700
Can you locate

172
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,180
where the soil comes from?

173
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:41,180
It's hard to tell.

174
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:44,250
But the soil

175
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:45,460
is highly saline.

176
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:48,100
It could be from

177
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:49,940
rising groundwater levels

178
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,340
saturating the rock.

179
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,300
Mr. Zhuang.

180
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,850
In English, please?

181
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:57,220
Simply put,

182
00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:00,060
it's likely near a reservoir,

183
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:01,820
or where one

184
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,250
used to be.

185
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:05,250
But it's not certain.

186
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:06,580
Su.

187
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,460
Check for matching reservoirs.

188
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:09,130
Okay.

189
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,100
I'll do it now.

190
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,580
Han.

191
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,010
I think I found

192
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,530
a way to break Sen.

193
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:21,650
Sen.

194
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,060
Do you know

195
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:24,370
the details back then?

196
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,730
I only know he was undercover.

197
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:28,820
He's the one

198
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:30,730
who shot my brother.

199
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,650
The day your brother was killed,

200
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,890
we didn't plan to act early.

201
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:38,100
But we got a tip-off,

202
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,220
so we had to move in.

203
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,130
He was undercover.

204
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,820
Why would he need a tip-off?

205
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,220
We didn't have

206
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,300
concrete evidence then.

207
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:49,300
We didn't know

208
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,610
where the hideout was.

209
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,730
I'd only just joined.

210
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,650
Our original plan

211
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:55,650
was to take them alive.

212
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:57,490
We only moved

213
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:58,650
because of that tip.

214
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:00,980
Think about it.

215
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,420
With Li Ming and your brother dead,

216
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,650
who benefited the most?

217
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,220
I'm planning

218
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:13,370
to build a factory.

219
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:16,460
We can work together.

220
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,100
Going solo?

221
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,250
Aren't you afraid of the cook?

222
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,060
All you want

223
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:28,490
is just

224
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:29,650
a steady supply.

225
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:31,850
I have the formula.

226
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:34,180
You have the market.

227
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:36,530
We'll be swimming in money.

228
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:40,420
Raw Diamond was already

229
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,180
on the police's radar.

230
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,100
To save himself,

231
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,010
the real cook

232
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,490
framed Li Ming

233
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:48,420
as a scapegoat.

234
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,580
He set up the bust

235
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,610
with Cha Kun.

236
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:52,100
Cops?

237
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:54,220
You framed me!

238
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,420
Then he lay low

239
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,100
in the shadows

240
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:58,850
to wait for a comeback.

241
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,130
The cook

242
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:02,420
is the real mastermind.

243
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:03,460
Sen.

244
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:04,980
Cooperate with us.

245
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,180
Bring him to justice.

246
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:08,300
That's the only way

247
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,130
to avenge your brother.

248
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:22,300
Ning, samples collected.

249
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:39,700
Our investigation shows

250
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,820
villagers claim

251
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,610
the wastewater

252
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:42,980
is from the upstream valley.

253
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,460
The valley is huge.

254
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,700
We still can't

255
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,610
locate the drug factory.

256
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:48,940
We need

257
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,180
a more efficient way.

258
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,650
Qi Sizhe has been held

259
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:52,730
for over ten hours.

260
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,940
We're running out of time.

261
00:13:58,510 --> 00:13:59,100
Sizhe?

262
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,370
Sizhe!

263
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:01,530
Sizhe!

264
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:02,060
Mrs. Wu.

265
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:02,820
I'm sorry!

266
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:04,180
This is all my fault!

267
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:04,730
Sizhe!

268
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:06,340
Save Guifen!

269
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,060
Mrs. Wu!

270
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:08,370
Save her!

271
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:17,300
You've seen her.

272
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,940
Now, write it.

273
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:25,490
Paper and pen.

274
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,610
Formula for

275
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:36,610
stabilizing the drug is here.

276
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,060
Get out.

277
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:42,610
Out!

278
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,420
Mr. Bai.

279
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:28,610
The cartel replied

280
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:30,220
the text I sent with Sen's phone.

281
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,300
I know it's risky,

282
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:36,850
but it's

283
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:37,980
the fastest way.

284
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,300
I'll pose as Nuo Sha

285
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:40,490
to meet them.

286
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,940
Have Sen help us

287
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,100
find the cook.

288
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:44,770
Sen's goal

289
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:46,010
now matches ours.

290
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,010
The new formula must come

291
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,130
from Sizhe's work.

292
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:50,420
So he's in

293
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,130
grave danger.

294
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:52,700
I'll send coordinates

295
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,730
upon arrival.

296
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:55,060
Please approve, sir.

297
00:15:58,550 --> 00:15:59,730
Is this Sen trustworthy?

298
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,650
Don't forget

299
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:03,250
he still hates you.

300
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:30,460
After discussion,

301
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:32,370
Mr. Bai and I agree.

302
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:33,180
Han Feng

303
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,490
will go undercover.

304
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:40,850
Han Feng will take Sen

305
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,610
to the meeting point

306
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,490
set by the cook.

307
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:46,460
Lixing.

308
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,100
Track and deploy teams.

309
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,180
Su and Yuanyang, support them.

310
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,010
Once we find Sizhe

311
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,300
and he's safe,

312
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:04,810
Han Feng will signal us.

313
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,050
Once signaled,

314
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:19,330
raid the place

315
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,460
and arrest the cook.

316
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,860
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

317
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:39,660
Boss.

318
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,530
They're here.

319
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:55,900
Nuo Sha?

320
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,380
Old man?

321
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,810
Finally, we meet.

322
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,490
That belly of yours

323
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,050
needs some exercise.

324
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:12,700
So?

325
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:14,010
About the new product...

326
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,620
It's all right here.

327
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:20,180
A complete success.

328
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:24,090
Kidnapping that cop

329
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:25,940
really paid off.

330
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,180
I've got to hand it to you.

331
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:30,900
Daring to kidnap a cop.

332
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:33,900
So?

333
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,490
Is he dead yet?

334
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,980
Do you want him alive

335
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:40,570
or dead?

336
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,490
That depends on

337
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,090
your preference, old man.

338
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:58,290
Let's go.

339
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:00,050
Show me

340
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:00,770
your productivity.

341
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:04,770
Productivity is no issue.

342
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:05,770
We can supply plenty.

343
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,090
But can you handle

344
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:09,900
this kind of volume?

345
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,490
You know who I am.

346
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:16,860
If you talk like that,

347
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,180
you're not being sincere.

348
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,330
Doubting my orders?

349
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:47,860
Shall we?

350
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,250
Your security and

351
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,570
secrecy are top-notch.

352
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,420
No wonder the cops can't find it.

353
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:09,700
Indeed.

354
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:11,250
Well?

355
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,420
Can we talk business now?

356
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:14,770
Of course.

357
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,730
But not with you.

358
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,090
Excuse me?

359
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:25,660
I deal with the cook directly.

360
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:27,290
You are not him.

361
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:30,770
As expected of General Nuo Sha.

362
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:32,140
Forgive me.

363
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:34,810
These are sensitive times.

364
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:36,140
Better safe than sorry.

365
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,180
I understand.

366
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:49,700
Suit yourself.

367
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:50,980
I'll go get the cook.

368
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:52,860
Okay.

369
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:03,380
This way.

370
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,900
My man here says

371
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:23,940
he's seen you somewhere before.

372
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:37,180
Mr. Cao, Mr. Bai.

373
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,180
Mr. Han sent the signal.

374
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:39,530
Move in now!

375
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,140
We must destroy

376
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:42,220
the drug factory quickly.

377
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:43,900
Bring Han Feng and Qi Sizhe

378
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:45,380
back to us untouched!

379
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:46,420
Yes, sir.

380
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:48,010
Move!

381
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:13,570
Get out.

382
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:15,570
This is a sterile lab.

383
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,940
You can't treat him like this.

384
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:53,530
Untie him.

385
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,770
Let's talk this out.

386
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,290
You never listen to me.

387
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,940
He's with HCPD,

388
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:10,770
the Captain.

389
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:13,220
Messing with him

390
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:14,730
is a bold move.

391
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,010
I'll be gentle.

392
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:18,700
It won't hurt as much.

393
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:26,380
Wu Yongchang.

394
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,460
You hid it well.

395
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,050
What are you doing?

396
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:34,090
I told you

397
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,010
he's a cop!

398
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,490
Don't you want a way out?

399
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:38,490
Wu Yongchang.

400
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,700
Stop the act.

401
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:42,900
Everything before

402
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:46,050
was your doing, right?

403
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,420
I'm the one who got away.

404
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,140
The one who got away?

405
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:05,570
Qi Sizhe was right.

406
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,940
Raw Diamond and the designer drug

407
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,730
were all your doing.

408
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,010
Medicine is medicine.

409
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:14,860
Drug is drug.

410
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,330
I always tried

411
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,290
to stay away from drugs.

412
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:23,330
I expected the same from my students.

413
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,660
Sadly,

414
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:28,330
Li Ming wouldn't listen.

415
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:29,770
Stop the act.

416
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:32,570
I gave the tip-off back then.

417
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,700
Otherwise, you'd never have

418
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:35,810
found Li Ming so fast.

419
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,010
Good.

420
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:43,620
Be safe.

421
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,250
My pleasure

422
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:50,460
Hello, Police?

423
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,290
I want to report a drug deal.

424
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:54,730
So that anonymous tip

425
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:57,090
was yours?

426
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:00,730
Just to research that stuff?

427
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:03,660
Have you no humanity left?

428
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,700
I'm saving lives!

429
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:05,570
Whose life?

430
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:06,770
I'm not like them!

431
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:07,700
Not like who?

432
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:09,620
You're worse than all of them!

433
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,490
Stop lying to yourself.

434
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:16,940
Yu Fei.

435
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:20,570
Was it you?

436
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,140
Did you kill her?

437
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,090
Talk.

438
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:27,420
Did you kill Yu Fei?

439
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,050
There's one thing

440
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,220
you might not know yet.

441
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:04,700
The day Yu Fei died,

442
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,330
you met Li Ming,

443
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:07,140
didn't you?

444
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:11,730
What do you mean?

445
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:14,220
You're here.

446
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:16,900
This way.

447
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:31,180
I gave you a chance.

448
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,250
It's your fault!

449
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:33,810
You failed to save her!

450
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:34,940
Failed to save Yu Fei!

451
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:36,290
Wu Yongchang.

452
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,090
Mr. Han.

453
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,380
Do you feel

454
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,730
deeply regretful now?

455
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:47,380
And ashamed?

456
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:48,860
No matter.

457
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:50,570
I'll end your pain.

458
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:53,660
Stop.

459
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,380
Mr. Qi is here.

460
00:27:59,030 --> 00:27:59,490
Han Feng.

461
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:01,050
Perfect.

462
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,050
Your dear Captain

463
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,090
wants to try the new drug.

464
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:08,420
If the formula is correct,

465
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,380
he should be fine.

466
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:14,420
Wu Yongchang.

467
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,050
Let Han Feng go.

468
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,180
I'll be your test subject.

469
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,140
No way.

470
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,290
I can't let you get hurt.

471
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,730
If the formula is wrong,

472
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,620
who will pay the price?

473
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:28,660
Please.

474
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:53,460
Mr. Wu.

475
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,530
It's not too late to stop.

476
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,010
Leave him alone!

477
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:08,460
Come at me!

478
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,530
Wu Yongchang!

479
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:11,330
Come at me if you dare!

480
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,660
You coward!

481
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,730
Yellow-belly!

482
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,420
Do it yourself if you dare!

483
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:17,940
Coward!

484
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:20,250
Do it yourself!

485
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,290
Stop it!

486
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:23,140
Han Feng!

487
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:25,770
Han Feng!

488
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:31,050
You...

489
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:32,660
You...

490
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,220
Do it...

491
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:39,900
yourself...

492
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:53,860
Han Feng!

493
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:55,530
Han Feng!

494
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,380
Still wrong.

495
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:11,700
Sizhe.

496
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:13,530
Sizhe.

497
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:15,770
This formula is incomplete.

498
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:16,860
Right?

499
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:19,380
Wu Yongchang.

500
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,090
Just give them the formula!

501
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,620
They'll kill!

502
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:27,090
Stop making mistakes.

503
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,530
How many more must die?

504
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:31,860
You gave the formula!

505
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:33,180
If he dies,

506
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:34,290
it's on you!

507
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,420
I want no more deaths.

508
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:41,380
No more deaths!

509
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:51,660
Cops!

510
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:53,900
Run!

511
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,220
Cops are here!

512
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:57,490
Run! Get out!

513
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,420
Hurry!

514
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:01,730
Go! Leave them!

515
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:09,730
Han Feng.

516
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:10,810
How are you?

517
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:20,220
Quick!

518
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:27,140
Pour it all out!

519
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:28,620
Fast!

520
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:30,010
Dump it all!

521
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:35,220
Go get Wu Yongchang.

522
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:36,570
I'll chase Feng Zhengxi.

523
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:37,330
Careful.

524
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:01,770
Move!

525
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,330
Move!

526
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:35,810
Careful.

527
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,090
Watch out.

528
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:38,810
Come on.

529
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:40,980
Yongchang.

530
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:42,700
Let's turn ourselves in.

531
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:45,860
Wu Yongchang!

532
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:51,620
What are you doing?

533
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:53,220
For my brother's life,

534
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,620
you pay today!

535
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:56,330
You both must die!

536
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:28,770
Guifen.

537
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:30,380
Don't cry.

538
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:32,810
Promise me.

539
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:35,250
Turn yourself in.

540
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:37,770
Don't...

541
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:42,140
make more mistakes.

542
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,050
Okay.

543
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:44,940
Okay.

544
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:47,810
Stay with me!

545
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:48,770
Hang on!

546
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,090
Wu Yongchang!

547
00:33:58,110 --> 00:33:58,660
Guifen!

548
00:33:59,070 --> 00:33:59,770
It's your turn!

549
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,420
Hold on!

550
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:01,380
Hang on!

551
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,820
Why?

552
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,650
Why punish me like this?

553
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:32,980
Wu Yongchang.

554
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:34,530
Surrender and come back.

555
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,570
Mrs. Wu would want that too!

556
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:55,130
Help them out!

557
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:04,860
Don't move!

558
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:11,300
Mr. Han.

559
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:17,460
Su.

560
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:19,260
Evacuate the hostages now.

561
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:22,900
Sizhe.

562
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:25,980
I'm sorry.

563
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,090
I failed Yu Fei.

564
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:33,610
Yu Fei?

565
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,380
How did she die exactly?

566
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,340
Mr. Wu.

567
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,050
What now?

568
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,570
Give her the drug.

569
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,050
It'll control her.

570
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,130
But she's Sizhe's girlfriend.

571
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:57,570
Sentimentality

572
00:35:58,110 --> 00:35:59,050
achieves nothing.

573
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,170
I'm sorry.

574
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,050
Sorry about this.

575
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:37,420
I have to

576
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:38,690
keep you here for now.

577
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:42,980
I can't untie you.

578
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,050
Wait here for me.

579
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:45,900
Be right back.

580
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:54,010
You're here.

581
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:17,690
Any problems?

582
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:18,900
None.

583
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:27,820
My pleasure.

584
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:42,980
Fei.

585
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:44,690
Hang on.

586
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:39,010
Did you really kill Fei?

587
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:45,460
I killed your girlfriend.

588
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:48,490
I...

589
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,820
I ruined Ming.

590
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:52,900
And Chuchuan.

591
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,050
Just kill me.

592
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,000
Alright?

593
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:01,300
Kill me.

594
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:02,860
Let me die with Guifen.

595
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,420
It all should end.

596
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:37,090
Drop it!

597
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,050
Peng Ba.

598
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,010
Let me.

599
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:53,420
Wu Yongchang.

600
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:54,860
What are you doing?

601
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:13,460
What are you doing?

602
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:15,170
No!

603
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:16,260
Wu Yongchang!

604
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:18,740
Wu Yongchang!

605
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:43,010
Fei.

606
00:43:44,510 --> 00:43:46,130
Sizhe and I are here to see you.

607
00:43:47,630 --> 00:43:49,010
It's been a while.

608
00:43:50,070 --> 00:43:51,340
Don't be mad at us.

609
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:56,460
Your killer

610
00:43:58,190 --> 00:43:59,980
was finally caught by

611
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,210
your thick-headed boyfriend.

612
00:44:06,590 --> 00:44:08,260
He is actually better than me.

613
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,340
You chose well.

614
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:15,210
Fei.

615
00:44:17,590 --> 00:44:18,420
Your dream

616
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:20,530
was always to be

617
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:21,740
a great forensic doctor.

618
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:24,940
Someday,

619
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:27,130
I'll carry your dream

620
00:44:28,590 --> 00:44:29,460
forward.

621
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:34,340
Come on.

622
00:44:38,070 --> 00:44:38,570
Here.

623
00:44:43,510 --> 00:44:44,460
Staying in He City?

624
00:44:51,590 --> 00:44:52,050
And you?

625
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:56,300
Will you stay in CID

626
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:57,900
or go back to Narcotics?

627
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:00,380
I haven't decided yet.

628
00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:01,820
You think

629
00:45:02,510 --> 00:45:03,460
transfers are that easy?

630
00:45:07,190 --> 00:45:07,740
Han Feng.

631
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:09,610
Remember

632
00:45:10,230 --> 00:45:11,420
what you said before?

633
00:45:14,230 --> 00:45:15,210
If I quit Narcotics,

634
00:45:15,550 --> 00:45:17,820
I'll join your team in CID.

635
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:18,740
Together,

636
00:45:19,110 --> 00:45:19,980
no case is unsolvable.

637
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:21,130
You said it.

638
00:45:21,590 --> 00:45:22,650
Don't back out later.

639
00:45:24,710 --> 00:45:25,260
It's a deal.

640
00:45:27,670 --> 00:45:28,300
Deal.

641
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:31,980
As long as we team up,

642
00:45:34,110 --> 00:45:35,530
no case is unsolvable.

643
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:36,260
Right.

644
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:39,490
You remembered.

645
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:41,740
Hard to forget.

646
00:45:44,710 --> 00:45:45,380
In that case,

647
00:45:46,630 --> 00:45:48,050
let's both stay in He City

648
00:45:49,110 --> 00:45:49,940
and keep teaming up.

649
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:54,570
Sounds like a plan.

650
00:46:20,670 --> 00:46:21,260
Don't forget.

651
00:46:22,190 --> 00:46:23,050
There's one more person.
