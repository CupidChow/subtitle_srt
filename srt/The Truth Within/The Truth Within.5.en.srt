1
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,620
Shuting,

2
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:40,090
where are you?

3
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:41,620
Why weren't you answering?

4
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:42,540
Well, any leads?

5
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,290
Not yet.

6
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,010
I need to

7
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,690
verify something.

8
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,290
But I believe

9
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:51,060
the killer could not

10
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,610
change his behavior pattern so easily.

11
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,410
If our reasoning is correct,

12
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:56,610
then Xie Yaoqi

13
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:58,340
still has a chance.

14
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:02,340
Forensics has confirmed

15
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:04,220
the tread and soil

16
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,500
on the sneakers

17
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,540
from Liao Yunsheng's home

18
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:09,260
match the findings

19
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,260
from the bat cave.

20
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,410
And we already know

21
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:15,130
his involvement in the
bovine TB experiments.

22
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,850
All the evidence points to

23
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,810
his presence at the crime scene.

24
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,340
Now Liao Yunsheng

25
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,370
is the prime suspect.

26
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,410
The victim

27
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,660
is the owner of the phone

28
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,540
found yesterday at Liao's place.

29
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,020
I told you

30
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,930
I saw her yesterday.

31
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,810
Xie Yaoqi's friend,

32
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:31,490
Li Shuting.

33
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,980
The hair found at the pork shop

34
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:33,900
has been confirmed

35
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,370
to be Xie Yaoqi's.

36
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:38,490
So, based on this,

37
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:39,490
we can infer

38
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,580
that after killing

39
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:41,930
Ye Yingying,

40
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,930
Liao Yunsheng kidnapped

41
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:44,540
Xie Yaoqi and Li Shuting.

42
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:45,980
I checked Li Shuting's phone.

43
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,540
Not much useful info.

44
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,220
The killer might have deleted it.

45
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,540
We only know she's 25.

46
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,660
Both parents are dead.

47
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,100
No other family.

48
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,140
Her place

49
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:56,980
is under her name,

50
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:58,220
but it's outdated.

51
00:04:58,510 --> 00:04:59,730
The landlord says she moved out

52
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:00,540
years ago.

53
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,410
What about Xie Yaoqi's place?

54
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,730
Like her parents said,

55
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,930
covered in dust.

56
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:06,140
No one's been here in ages.

57
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,540
Well, Mr. Qi,

58
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,100
any leads

59
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,370
on the syringe

60
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:12,410
from Liao's home?

61
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,170
The residue in it

62
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:15,410
has been identified.

63
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,250
It's funnel-web spider toxin.

64
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,540
Same as in Ye Yingying's body.

65
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,810
Based on

66
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,020
your calendar theory,

67
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,780
the killer is mimicking a spider.

68
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,290
He kidnapped Xie Yaoqi

69
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:27,490
three days after killing

70
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,340
Ye Yingying.

71
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:29,290
Then why did he

72
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:30,810
take Li Shuting earlier this time?

73
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:34,900
Su,

74
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,020
get a BOLO

75
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:36,980
issued on Liao

76
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,660
to all units.

77
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,100
Xi, keep checking the cameras.

78
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:40,540
Wan,

79
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,810
check around

80
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:42,290
his place.

81
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,170
Ms. Zhu, we're on the funnel-web spider.

82
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:54,580
Funnel-web spider.

83
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,050
Funnel-web spider.

84
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:01,250
Funnel-web spider?

85
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:25,580
Dr. Chen.

86
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,100
You brat,

87
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,340
sending me such expensive wine?

88
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,100
This wine

89
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,900
reminds me

90
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,780
of our school days.

91
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,410
You and Li Ming

92
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:40,610
often came find me

93
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,900
for a drink after school.

94
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:53,410
Well,

95
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,250
how have you been feeling?

96
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:56,610
Not bad.

97
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:57,730
Don't worry.

98
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,140
Anytime you need help, come find me.

99
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:03,220
My rates are steep.

100
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,170
I actually have something

101
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,370
to ask you about.

102
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:09,290
Go ahead.

103
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,220
Here's the thing.

104
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:15,050
Do you know there's a type of person

105
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,580
who imagines themselves

106
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,580
to be a certain animal?

107
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,020
For example,

108
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:21,220
a spider.

109
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:27,810
A moment.

110
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,100
Here.

111
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,290
See.

112
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,700
Clinical lycanthropy.

113
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:43,930
A type of

114
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:45,020
mental illness.

115
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:47,220
During an episode, the patient

116
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,050
believes they are a wolf.

117
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:50,540
Their lifestyle

118
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,660
mimics that of a wolf.

119
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,100
It's not

120
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:53,930
just wolves

121
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:54,730
they imagine being.

122
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,810
They can imagine being other animals.

123
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,140
Like insects.

124
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,900
You said someone might think

125
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,220
they're a spider.

126
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,020
It's highly possible.

127
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,220
Chen,

128
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,780
do you know

129
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:08,020
what causes this?

130
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,540
The causes of mental illness

131
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,730
are complex.

132
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:14,490
With physical illnesses,

133
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,490
you can pinpoint

134
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,730
an exact origin.

135
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,410
But mental illness

136
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,610
is rooted

137
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,580
in abnormal brain function.

138
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:25,140
The triggers

139
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:26,370
can be

140
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,050
psychological trauma,

141
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,370
family issues,

142
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,050
medication overuse,

143
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,700
or even drugs.

144
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,100
Do they

145
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:43,770
really lose the line between delusion

146
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,580
and reality?

147
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:51,300
During an episode,

148
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:52,940
these patients

149
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,770
fabricate lies that
deceive their own minds.

150
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,010
For them,

151
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,250
it's genuine.

152
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:12,180
Mr. Qi,

153
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:13,370
the materials

154
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:14,530
from Liao Yunsheng's greenhouse

155
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,420
are here.

156
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:17,610
After mating,

157
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,340
female spiders

158
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:20,530
may kill the males.

159
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:26,100
For funnel-web spiders, the average time

160
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,250
from mating to egg-laying is 13 days.

161
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:33,340
Thirteen days?

162
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:45,660
You mean

163
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,850
he wants to lay eggs himself?

164
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,660
Alright, send me the photos.

165
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:53,900
Qi Sizhe says,

166
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,610
based on

167
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:55,700
the materials we found,

168
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,130
Liao Yunsheng truly thinks

169
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:57,930
he is a spider.

170
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,420
The 13 days on the calendar

171
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:00,970
is the time

172
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,900
from mating to
egg-laying for funnel-webs.

173
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:05,060
So

174
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:06,980
he wrapped the victim into an egg?

175
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:08,300
Yeah,

176
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,420
pretty much.

177
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:27,420
Funnel-webs are highly venomous.

178
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,340
No way I'd sell them.

179
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:29,650
Who knows what could happen?

180
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:32,300
Are you the only spider seller

181
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,060
around here?

182
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:34,130
Yes.

183
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,010
I'm the only one for miles.

184
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,010
Have you seen him?

185
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:41,490
He's Liao Yunsheng.

186
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:44,220
No.

187
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,940
Any membership info?

188
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,580
I run a traditional business.
No computer.

189
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,730
I only keep records for deliveries.

190
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:01,060
Sir.

191
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,180
What will a funnel-web spider do

192
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,940
when its habitat

193
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:06,850
is destroyed?

194
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:08,300
Find a new place

195
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,610
to build a web.

196
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:15,250
Sedentary.

197
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,700
Nest in fixed locations.

198
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,220
The nest provides for feeding, capture,

199
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:21,250
shelter, and breeding.

200
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,580
They don't migrate frequently.

201
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:24,890
Territoriality.

202
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:26,610
Highly territorial

203
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:27,700
around their nest.

204
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:29,530
After building a nest,

205
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:30,420
they'll defend

206
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:31,940
their domain and resources.

207
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,250
Nocturnal. Mostly active at night.

208
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,180
During the day, they hide in the nest

209
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:37,980
to avoid sunlight

210
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,130
and predators.

211
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:42,820
Mostly active at night.

212
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,580
Don't migrate frequently.

213
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,220
If Liao Yunsheng is really mimicking

214
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:52,490
a spider,

215
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,180
then that cave

216
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,420
was his nest.

217
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,180
He killed Ye Yingying

218
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,180
and wanted to kill Xie Yaoqi,

219
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,610
but Xie escaped.

220
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,730
Mr. Qi barged into the cave,

221
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,730
forcing him to relocate

222
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,940
and make a new web.

223
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,530
Perhaps at a specific time,

224
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:11,300
Li Shuting intruded

225
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,610
and became his next target.

226
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,010
Right.

227
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:15,940
Liao Yunsheng usually helps out

228
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,700
at his uncle's illegal clinic.

229
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,340
Ye Yingying and Xie Yaoqi

230
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,300
had both been there.

231
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,940
Li Shuting also went there later.

232
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,730
Liao must have been scouting

233
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:25,060
for victims there.

234
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,700
But I still don't get it.

235
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,700
Mr. Qi says

236
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:30,850
the victim is not prey,

237
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,010
but an egg.

238
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:33,130
Why?

239
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:34,180
Giving birth.

240
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,180
Giving birth?

241
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,340
Qi Sizhe mentioned this

242
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:38,420
on the phone.

243
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,490
After mating,

244
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,100
female spiders

245
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:43,770
may kill the males.

246
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,580
But there were no signs

247
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,610
of sexual assault on Ye Yingying.

248
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:50,370
Yeah,

249
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,850
that's what's puzzling me.

250
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:57,300
Hello?

251
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,220
Got it.

252
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,010
Mr. Han,

253
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:06,180
they received

254
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,370
a distress call.

255
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:08,530
Might be Li Shuting.

256
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:20,100
Help me!

257
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:21,850
He said tonight,

258
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:23,980
after killing Yaoqi, he'll kill me.

259
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,300
It's very dark here.

260
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,730
I can hear machinery.

261
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:32,490
It cut off here?

262
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,420
Can we trace it?

263
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,060
No caller ID.

264
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,300
And the call was too short.

265
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:40,490
No way to track it.

266
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,700
She heard machinery.

267
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:46,530
Maybe near a factory?

268
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:47,770
Xi,

269
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:48,980
can we run a check?

270
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,890
I will

271
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:52,530
give it a try.

272
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:54,490
Come on!

273
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:55,850
Do you know

274
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:56,770
how many factories

275
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:58,130
there are in this city?

276
00:13:59,030 --> 00:13:59,730
How would you check?

277
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,730
Then how?

278
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:01,940
We must check!

279
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,250
There is a way

280
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:04,420
to narrow it down.

281
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:13,610
Funnel-webs don't migrate.

282
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,490
But if their habitat

283
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:16,610
is destroyed,

284
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,250
they'll seek a new place.

285
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,220
I think

286
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,580
we should search around

287
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:23,300
the Beishan cave

288
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:24,820
and his home.

289
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:29,940
He can't have gone far.

290
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:31,610
Now he just needs

291
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:32,420
a new hiding place

292
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,580
where is dark, damp,

293
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:34,580
low-traffic,

294
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,580
and suitable

295
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,300
for funnel-webs.

296
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:37,980
We're running out of time.

297
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:38,700
Since the body

298
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,010
was found in the cave,

299
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,530
let's search the area

300
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:42,130
around it.

301
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,100
Request support from all precincts.

302
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,100
Have them check near
Liao Yunsheng's home

303
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:47,340
for any suspicious places.

304
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,250
We'll split up.

305
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:48,940
Yes.

306
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:58,300
What about

307
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,530
the Xiangfan Factory west of

308
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:00,770
Beishan South Road?

309
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:02,850
It's abandoned.

310
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,650
Fits a funnel-web's needs.

311
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,420
What else

312
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,850
around there that fit?

313
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,580
All residential.

314
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,100
Not suitable.

315
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,340
Mr. Han,

316
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,530
I spotted

317
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,420
someone suspicious

318
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,100
on the camera.

319
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:22,180
He was carrying

320
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,250
an empty terrarium

321
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:24,490
and wearing a black hoodie.

322
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:25,820
Could it be Liao?

323
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:26,980
Location?

324
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:28,700
Beishan South Road.

325
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:31,770
Not far from that factory.

326
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:56,300
We split up.

327
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,010
Okay.

328
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,060
Mr. Qi,

329
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:22,340
I'll check there.

330
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:23,850
Be careful.

331
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,330
Qi Sizhe!

332
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:35,010
You okay?

333
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,090
Yeah, go after him.

334
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,380
Mr. Qi, are you fine?

335
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:44,570
Didn't see his face.

336
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:32,530
Are you okay?

337
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:44,900
Li Shuting,

338
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,530
can you tell us

339
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,900
what happened?

340
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:54,570
Sorry.

341
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:56,660
I didn't

342
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:59,380
tell you before.

343
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:00,770
Actually, Yaoqi

344
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:03,660
was dating Liao Yunsheng.

345
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,380
I thought

346
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,250
she was hiding

347
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:09,290
to avoid her parents.

348
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:11,700
I thought

349
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:13,530
she was with Liao Yunsheng.

350
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:14,570
I wanted to talk to her,

351
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,420
so I went to Liao Yunsheng's place.

352
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:17,810
I...

353
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,140
But...

354
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:31,860
Yaoqi?

355
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:35,530
Yaoqi?

356
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,140
Yaoqi?

357
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:39,900
Yaoqi?

358
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,700
Did you see him clearly? Was it Liao?

359
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,570
No.

360
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:15,860
And you?

361
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:17,180
Did you see

362
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:18,330
his face?

363
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:21,730
I only know

364
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,090
he wore

365
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,980
a black hoodie.

366
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,490
He showed me some paintings.

367
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:36,810
What painting?

368
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:41,490
Of Yaoqi.

369
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:43,940
He drew her.

370
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,250
Her looks when she died.

371
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,090
It's horrifying.

372
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:55,090
What did he do

373
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:55,770
to you?

374
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:57,940
He believes

375
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,010
he's a spider.

376
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,250
He kept wrapping me

377
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:02,570
in plastic wrap.

378
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:04,490
I couldn't breathe.

379
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:14,380
You've met Liao Yunsheng.

380
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,770
Was it him?

381
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:40,980
Do they

382
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,220
really lose the line between delusion

383
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,700
and reality?

384
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:48,220
I don't know.

385
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:49,860
I was too scared.

386
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,010
During an episode,

387
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,530
these patients

388
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:59,140
fabricate lies that
deceive their own minds.

389
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:01,290
For them,

390
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:02,620
it's genuine.

391
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:13,940
I only found

392
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,980
Li Ming's DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid)

393
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:16,940
in the car.

394
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:19,010
But when you were unconscious,

395
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:20,050
you saw someone.

396
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,420
Your intuition

397
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,570
and your memory

398
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:23,860
are unreliable.

399
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:25,330
Qi Sizhe,

400
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:26,900
you just can't

401
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,730
convince yourself

402
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:30,420
that the Raw Diamond case is over.

403
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,530
You're refusing to face reality.

404
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:48,050
You okay?

405
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:55,420
I'm fine.

406
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:01,530
If what Li Shuting says is true,

407
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,090
is Xie Yaoqi

408
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:04,330
in serious danger?

409
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,010
Something doesn't add up.

410
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:07,140
What?

411
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,940
Based on the evidence,

412
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:10,530
we infer

413
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:11,730
that the killer

414
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:12,980
has a mental illness.

415
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:14,620
During episodes,

416
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,700
he imagines himself as a spider,

417
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:18,530
adopting its habits

418
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:19,810
and behavioral patterns.

419
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:21,700
This much is clear.

420
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:24,420
Then

421
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,700
after killing Xie,

422
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,810
he should have

423
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,770
waited until August 30th

424
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:33,330
to go after the next person.

425
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,420
He shouldn't have taken Li Shuting

426
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:36,730
at this time.

427
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:38,620
But why?

428
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:44,700
If he really thinks

429
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:45,940
he's a spider,

430
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,860
he wouldn't easily break

431
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,050
his established pattern.

432
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,700
Something must have happened

433
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:53,660
to force him to change his plan.

434
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:57,290
Perhaps Li Shuting

435
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:58,660
found something,

436
00:23:59,000 --> 00:23:59,730
so he had to

437
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,290
kill her in advance?

438
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,940
That's possible.

439
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:04,700
However,

440
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:08,620
her statement doesn't add up.

441
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:09,860
He believes

442
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,010
he's a spider.

443
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,180
He kept wrapping me

444
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,420
in plastic wrap.

445
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:16,420
I couldn't breathe.

446
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:18,250
Clearly,

447
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:20,570
he was in an episode

448
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:21,700
and believed

449
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,140
he was a spider,

450
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:24,730
so he chose

451
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:26,330
an abandoned factory

452
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,620
that suits a spider's needs.

453
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:33,940
But the events

454
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:34,860
at that factory

455
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,620
don't feel right.

456
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:39,980
Let's go.

457
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:41,330
To the scene.

458
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,770
Find out

459
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:44,620
what's off.

460
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:50,730
This is the abandoned factory

461
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:51,770
where Li was found.

462
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,180
This is where Xi spotted Liao Yunsheng

463
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,530
on the cameras.

464
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:57,660
Since Mr. Qi

465
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,330
was attacked at the factory,

466
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,570
we've set up checkpoints

467
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,860
at major intersections nearby.

468
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:03,570
All units are assisting

469
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:04,700
in Liao's arrest.

470
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:05,900
The cave

471
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:06,940
where Ye's body was found,

472
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:08,530
Liao's uncle's illegal clinic,

473
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:09,530
and his university

474
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:10,530
are under surveillance.

475
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:11,530
We'll be the first

476
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:12,330
to know.

477
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,050
Good.

478
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:16,050
Wan, you and Su take a team each.

479
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:17,810
Search all suspicious places

480
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:18,660
one more time.

481
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,290
This time, we can't let him get away.

482
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:22,380
Yes.

483
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:49,290
The first two scenes

484
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:51,730
both had funnel-web nets

485
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,090
left by the killer.

486
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,980
Why are there none here?

487
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:07,050
He killed Ye Yingying

488
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,090
in the cave.

489
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,570
Then he brought

490
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:12,380
Xie Yaoqi there,

491
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:13,730
because that was

492
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:14,860
his nest.

493
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,250
Now he brought

494
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:18,140
Li Shuting here.

495
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,010
If he saw this

496
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:21,620
as his new nest,

497
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,290
Xie Yaoqi should be here.

498
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,050
But she's not.

499
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:31,660
There are no webs here.

500
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,860
And the 13-day cycle is broken.

501
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:36,570
Why would

502
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:37,940
the killer

503
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,250
change his own pattern?

504
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:42,140
So he changed

505
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:45,290
and decided to kill Xie Yaoqi early?

506
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:28,330
Hello.

507
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:28,900
Hello.

508
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,620
ID. Driver's license.

509
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,570
Pop the trunk.

510
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:31,140
Okay.

511
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:35,940
Here.

512
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:37,330
Well, thanks.

513
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,290
Thank you.

514
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:53,730
You're welcome.

515
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:55,730
Is something happening?

516
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,490
Just routine check.

517
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:11,420
Maggie.

518
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:13,180
Sorry.

519
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:14,700
I got stopped at a police checkpoint.

520
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:16,050
Is the client here?

521
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:17,530
Not yet.

522
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,770
I hit a checkpoint too.

523
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:21,530
Really?

524
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,570
People near the Beishan cave say

525
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,620
the police

526
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,700
found a woman's body.

527
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,570
They've been asking around

528
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,220
if anyone keeps spiders.

529
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:31,250
Strange, right?

530
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:32,250
Why spiders?

531
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,770
Don't tell me that girl

532
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:35,860
was killed by a spider?

533
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,180
That's fearsome.

534
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,140
Good thing I didn't book you

535
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:41,620
with that client.

536
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,660
If you'd gotten bitten too,

537
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:44,900
I'd be out of a job.

538
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:48,420
What client?

539
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:50,420
He came a few days ago

540
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,810
and looked odd.

541
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:53,810
Wore a hat

542
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,530
and was bundled up tight.

543
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:56,530
He was fiddling with

544
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,380
a medicine bottle

545
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,570
or something.

546
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:00,490
I asked if he was okay.

547
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:02,180
He said he wanted to see a doctor

548
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,570
and felt like a spider.

549
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,330
Do you know there's a type of person

550
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,620
who imagines

551
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,570
themselves to be a certain animal?

552
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:11,980
For example,

553
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,250
a spider.

554
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:15,860
Did you register him?

555
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,860
I was about to,

556
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:19,570
but when I came back with the form,

557
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:20,660
he was gone.

558
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,180
Well, check the footage.

559
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,090
See if it caught him.

560
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:31,900
Qi,

561
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,250
I'd like

562
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:34,180
to tell you something.

563
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,050
Any other angles?

564
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,860
He didn't enter.

565
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,180
There's only one camera.

566
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:00,530
Is that him?

567
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:06,090
He wore a hat. I didn't see clearly.

568
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,330
Thanks, Chen.

569
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:14,940
Hello? Ms. Zhu.

570
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:18,250
Okay.

571
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,620
I'll deploy teams now.

572
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,010
Everyone,

573
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:26,730
we have a new lead.

574
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:28,420
After Ye Yingying was taken,

575
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:29,700
the killer went to

576
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:30,900
this psychology clinic.

577
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:32,420
Use this clinic

578
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:33,180
as the center.

579
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:34,530
Check every nearby crossroads

580
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,770
and look for

581
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:36,700
the killer's trace.

582
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:38,980
Maybe we could find Xie Yaoqi.

583
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:39,980
-Yes.
-Okay.

584
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:48,620
Ms. Zhu,

585
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:50,050
after leaving

586
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:51,050
the clinic,

587
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:52,290
he traveled via Beiyi Road

588
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:53,660
and headed south.

589
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:01,940
Dongning Road's camera

590
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:02,770
didn't catch him.

591
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,180
Here. Xiwan Road, southbound.

592
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:36,220
Ms. Zhu, we've got him.

593
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:38,570
He exited the highway and went nearby,

594
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:39,420
then vanished.

595
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,290
Must be in a nearby neighborhood.

596
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:49,380
Mr. Han, we've found him.

597
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:20,740
Ms. Zhu?

598
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:21,300
Hello.

599
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,300
All old neighborhoods here.

600
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:22,940
South gate.

601
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:23,610
North gate.

602
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:24,570
Only seniors

603
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,530
live here.

604
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:26,740
Only these two

605
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,650
have young people.

606
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:28,570
I see.

607
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,260
We'll split up.

608
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:31,050
Wan,

609
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:33,090
you, the local officer, and Su

610
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:34,380
search there.

611
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:35,650
I, Mr. Han,

612
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,130
and Mr. Qi will search here.

613
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:37,820
Okay.

614
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,050
Let's go.

615
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:07,980
Mr. Han,

616
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,380
the precinct

617
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,380
contacted the committee.

618
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:11,530
Several renters there

619
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:12,690
match the suspect's profile.

620
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,740
When processing evidence

621
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,130
from the greenhouse,

622
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:17,820
we found a water bill.

623
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,130
It's unit 604.

624
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,010
604.

625
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:14,570
Here.

626
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:39,820
It's Liao Yunsheng.

627
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:04,130
We've been misled.

628
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:05,980
Liao Yunsheng was the first victim.

629
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:07,170
You suspect Xie Yaoqi?

630
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:10,090
We all thought Xie Yaoqi was a victim.

631
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,340
No one can prove she was kidnapped.

632
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,010
Why did the killer change his pattern

633
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:16,300
when it came to Li Shuting?

634
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,050
Li Shuting?

635
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,340
Li Shuting?

636
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:20,650
Estradiol Valerate Tablets.

637
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,490
Women take it for ovarian health

638
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:23,090
and fertility.

639
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:24,130
What if a man uses it?

640
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:26,010
Who's this person?

641
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:28,940
Wang Qilong.

642
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:30,650
Has something happened to Shuting?

643
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,300
Answer our questions first.

644
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:34,940
I don't know anything.
