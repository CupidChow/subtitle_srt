1
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,700
Just a heads-up.

2
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:39,970
You and the new guy

3
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:41,500
have gotten close recently?

4
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:42,290
What's wrong?

5
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:43,650
Stay away from him. I hate him.

6
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:45,330
He's a total loose cannon

7
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:46,090
and a loner.

8
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,940
If he's such a free spirit,

9
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,820
why didn't he stay

10
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:50,380
in Narcotics?

11
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,730
What's he doing on our squad?

12
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,410
Wan,

13
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:54,410
Mr. Han just transferred from Narcotics.

14
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:56,180
And he was undercover.

15
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:57,770
He doesn't work the way

16
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,650
we do.

17
00:05:58,910 --> 00:05:59,500
Understandable.

18
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:00,820
Understandable my ass!

19
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:02,140
I've been

20
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,460
on this squad for years.

21
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,700
When Zhu joined

22
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,260
the squad,

23
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,060
she was just a kid.

24
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:07,180
How did he

25
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,330
parachute in as captain?

26
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:11,090
In skill, seniority, or brains,

27
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:13,090
he's no match for Zhu,

28
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:13,730
right?

29
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,650
Come on, Wan.

30
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:15,970
Leave me out of it.

31
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,380
Attention!

32
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,180
Homicide reported at 788 Bar.

33
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,460
All nearby units,

34
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,290
respond now.

35
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:21,940
Over.

36
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:23,530
Contact Mr. Han.

37
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:32,500
Move!

38
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:33,260
Go!

39
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,140
Hurry!

40
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,180
Watch the steps!

41
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,060
Don't go in!

42
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:37,730
Police!

43
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:38,460
Where is he?

44
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,020
Still inside.

45
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:40,620
But...

46
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,020
I don't know where exactly!

47
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:42,820
Excuse me.

48
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,260
Come here.

49
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,020
Come here.

50
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:50,890
Where's he?

51
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,410
Went that way.

52
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,060
Get away!

53
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:41,970
Get away!

54
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:43,850
Get away!

55
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,940
Get away!

56
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,970
Why won't you leave me alone?

57
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:15,410
My friend!

58
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:17,580
Come down.

59
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:19,090
Come down. It's dangerous.

60
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:24,650
Come on, get down.

61
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,530
Let's talk.

62
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:35,970
Why am I here?

63
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:37,850
Yeah.

64
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:39,610
Come here.

65
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,130
Come on.

66
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,090
It's me.

67
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,900
Your friend. Come over here.

68
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,540
Yeah, come here.

69
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:49,130
Nice and slow.

70
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:54,370
You can tell me anything.

71
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:54,900
Come here.

72
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:55,900
Be careful.

73
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:14,820
Go!

74
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,460
What's going on?

75
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,090
Ms. Zhu,

76
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,780
stabbing reported upstairs.

77
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:22,210
We're evacuating

78
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:22,730
the crowd.

79
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,370
Let me go!

80
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,130
Here!

81
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,540
Over here, everyone!

82
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:26,610
Mr. Han!

83
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,090
Su!

84
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,060
Coming through!

85
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:30,970
Sorry!

86
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:31,850
Coming through!

87
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,540
Help me.

88
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:40,900
Please don't let go.

89
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,090
I don't want to die.

90
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:50,300
Let go!

91
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,820
Come help!

92
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,250
Let me go!

93
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,540
Let me go!

94
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,490
Mr. Han.

95
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,300
Stay back! Don't move forward!

96
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:16,940
Stay back!

97
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:17,970
Doctor!

98
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:19,660
Doctor!

99
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,250
Are you okay?

100
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:27,900
Doctor,

101
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:28,970
is he fine?

102
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,900
He's unconscious, but breathing.

103
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,250
Wan.

104
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,420
How's he?

105
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:34,820
Unconscious.

106
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:35,730
Still has a pulse.

107
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,060
We need to get him to a hospital.

108
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:47,370
What's the situation?

109
00:10:59,390 --> 00:10:59,820
Morning.

110
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,060
All healed up?

111
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:01,730
Took a hit?

112
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,460
Caught an armed robber.

113
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,370
Zhang,

114
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:05,660
take him in.

115
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,250
Okay.

116
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:10,730
Sallow face. Bad teeth. Frostbite.

117
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,180
He's looking at serious time.

118
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,940
That's pure Narcotics skill.

119
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:30,370
You've fully recovered?

120
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:32,300
Yeah, I'm fine now.

121
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:33,970
Well, we've got a new case.

122
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,250
Get on it now.

123
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,330
Okay.

124
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,090
I have a question.

125
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,730
Was there another reason

126
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,330
for coming back this time?

127
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:53,250
Just wanted a new environment.

128
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:56,660
Fine.

129
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,490
Do a good job.

130
00:11:59,270 --> 00:11:59,730
I will.

131
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,090
Mr. Gao,

132
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:27,330
Mr. Bai said

133
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:28,700
our new forensics chief

134
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:29,460
is arriving today.

135
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,420
He's probably almost here.

136
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:32,460
Hello.

137
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,180
Hello.

138
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,250
I'm the new forensics chief,

139
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:38,010
Qi Sizhe.

140
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:39,370
Hi,

141
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:40,330
I'm Gao Yuan.

142
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:41,700
Hello, Mr. Qi.

143
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,940
I'm the forensic intern,

144
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,490
Qiu Lanzi.

145
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,580
Do we have the blood sample

146
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,610
of the man

147
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:48,540
who fell from 788 Bar

148
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:49,540
last night?

149
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:50,780
Just arrived.

150
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,540
Can I see it?

151
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,900
Sure. Let's go.

152
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,180
This way.

153
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,180
Li Yiqi.

154
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,010
32 years old, from Li City.

155
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:06,250
He was in compulsory rehab for drug use.

156
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:07,300
Three months ago,

157
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,130
he came to He City.

158
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,300
We interviewed

159
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:10,330
the witnesses

160
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:11,540
last night.

161
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,660
None of them knew him.

162
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,900
And they didn't know

163
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,970
why he attacked anyone.

164
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:16,540
This appears

165
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,420
to be a random act of violence.

166
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,370
We can only

167
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,010
figure out why once he's up.

168
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,540
Xi,

169
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:24,580
pull up the footage from the stairwell

170
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,090
to the roof.

171
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:25,660
Yes.

172
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,370
What's he doing?

173
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:34,730
Out of his mind?

174
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,460
Did he see something?

175
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,210
He's totally out of it.

176
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:40,090
Talking to himself.

177
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,180
Classic signs of being wasted.

178
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:43,370
Xi,

179
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,250
roll the video I sent you.

180
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,490
This is Li Yiqi about 30 minutes

181
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:54,850
before the attack.

182
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:58,900
Are they making some kind of deal?

183
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:06,780
Well, stop.

184
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:07,850
I arrested

185
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:09,180
this guy

186
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,700
during a drug bust in Biannan.

187
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:12,090
He's Jiang Fei,

188
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:13,780
a drug dealer.

189
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:28,540
Gao Yuan.

190
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,010
Let me handle the blood sample.

191
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,490
Okay.

192
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:39,250
Mr. Han,

193
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,370
can I ask

194
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,700
where you got those videos?

195
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:43,610
No.

196
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:48,330
I've been here three months

197
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:50,130
and met quite a few people.

198
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:51,580
Yeah.

199
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,780
Any method's fine,

200
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:53,900
if it solves the problem.

201
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:55,490
Right, we're just solving...

202
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,250
Why are you here?

203
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,140
Are you Ms. Zhu?

204
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:15,300
I just started

205
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,060
as the new forensics chief here.

206
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:19,060
I'm Qi Sizhe.

207
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:19,820
Hello,

208
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,020
I'm Zhu Qingyue.

209
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:22,700
I've heard a lot about you.

210
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:26,020
Li Yiqi's blood composition

211
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:27,380
needs further comparison.

212
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:28,380
One moment, please.

213
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:29,500
Alright.

214
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,020
Then I'll come later.

215
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,540
Thank you, Mr. Qi.

216
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:50,180
Mr. Han!

217
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:52,850
I traced Wang Qiang's network.

218
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:53,970
He might know

219
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:55,130
Jiang Fei.

220
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,210
Let's go.

221
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:00,780
Sir,

222
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:02,700
I've told you everything.

223
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,060
I'm just a user.

224
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:06,780
This isn't my first time anyway.

225
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:08,090
Do what you gotta do.

226
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:09,250
Is that your final answer?

227
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:12,780
Heroin, Ketamine,

228
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,010
Meth, and Ecstasy.

229
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,660
Sir,

230
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:18,460
I can't afford those.

231
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,700
I usually just get some...

232
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:22,460
fuel.

233
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:23,700
For relief.

234
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:24,820
Fuel?

235
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:25,900
Weed.

236
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:27,300
Can't afford those.

237
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,610
So you resort to armed
assault and robbery?

238
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,300
No, sir.

239
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,850
All that was just

240
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:35,660
to get fuel.

241
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:37,370
I only do that

242
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,420
when I'm broke.

243
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:41,250
Do you know him?

244
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:45,970
He's a dealer.

245
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,490
And you? Are you involved too?

246
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,130
Are you two partners?

247
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,610
How long have you been dealing?

248
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:54,300
When did it start?

249
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:55,010
I just use drugs.

250
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:56,900
I'm just a user, not a dealer.

251
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,420
This guy...

252
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,370
Jiang Fei.

253
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:02,460
What Jiang Fei did

254
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,770
has nothing to do with me.

255
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,380
I've never been involved

256
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,660
with his business.

257
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:07,770
Really, sir.

258
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,530
How do you know his name?

259
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:17,250
Where does he live?

260
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:19,970
Mr. Qi,

261
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:21,340
here are

262
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,340
Li Yiqi's drug test results.

263
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,660
We tested for everything

264
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,340
on the list.

265
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,100
Li Yiqi is clean.

266
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:28,700
Raw Diamond.

267
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:30,250
Was it tested for?

268
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:33,290
Raw Diamond...

269
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:35,290
Here.

270
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:39,570
Years ago, Raw Diamond was listed

271
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:40,660
as a major target.

272
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,770
It's on the list too.

273
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,250
The result was also negative.

274
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:46,180
Mr. Qi,

275
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:47,860
are you suggesting

276
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,250
Li Yiqi was using Raw Diamond?

277
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:50,570
But that case

278
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:51,490
was closed, wasn't it?

279
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,250
I heard the ringleader was shot dead.

280
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,180
The urine test is back. It's positive.

281
00:17:58,550 --> 00:17:59,100
Thanks.

282
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,620
Oh, Ms. Zhao,

283
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,050
I'd like to ask you something.

284
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,010
What is it?

285
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,340
Do you

286
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:08,140
know of any substances

287
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,100
that can cause

288
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,140
hallucinogenic effects?

289
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,460
A drug dealer?

290
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,810
Still investigating.

291
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:18,900
Have you heard of a drug

292
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,810
called Raw Diamond?

293
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,100
Raw Diamond?

294
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:22,700
Yeah.

295
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:25,380
I heard

296
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:26,210
our bureau

297
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,250
made a huge push years ago

298
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:28,660
to wipe it off the streets.

299
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:30,180
Raw Diamond

300
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:31,900
causes severe brain damage.

301
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:33,900
And it can trigger hallucinations

302
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,140
that lead to violence.

303
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:36,770
Many deaths I've examined

304
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,700
were linked to it.

305
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,490
The last case I remember

306
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,100
was a 17-year-old girl.

307
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,490
Raw Diamond made her

308
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,490
suffer brain damage

309
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:45,490
and become vegetative.

310
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:48,380
From my experience over the years,

311
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,180
Raw Diamond

312
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,210
is the most dangerous hallucinogen.

313
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,380
Jiang Fei lives here?

314
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:57,530
Be careful. Drug dealers are desperate.

315
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,210
Jiang Fei

316
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,490
has multiple hideouts.

317
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:16,810
But which one he's in exactly...

318
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:18,530
You'll have to

319
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:19,570
find that out yourselves.

320
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,810
No known drugs

321
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:35,380
in Li Yiqi's system.

322
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:37,290
Finding Jiang Fei is the only way

323
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:37,970
to know

324
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:38,810
his connection

325
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:39,700
to this case.

326
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,210
We've found Jiang Fei.

327
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:06,730
Mr. Han,

328
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,620
the Forensics Team collected

329
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,970
many partial and smudged prints.

330
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,340
Looks like

331
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,570
most are just routine traces.

332
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,810
All the data's here.

333
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:27,250
Mr. Qi,

334
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,180
over here.

335
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,290
Mr. Qi.

336
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:50,380
What's the status?

337
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,100
Skin wrinkling on extremities,

338
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:53,530
probably due to soaking.

339
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,770
But with the bathtub there,

340
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,340
water at the bottom is normal.

341
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:58,050
I've checked the entire body.

342
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,770
No obvious trauma.

343
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,250
Mr. Qi,

344
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:02,460
with no trauma,

345
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,660
can you determine the cause?

346
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,570
My initial assessment is

347
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:16,100
severe intoxication

348
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:17,900
and a disulfiram-like reaction,

349
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,210
causing respiratory depression,

350
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,010
seizures,

351
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,250
cardiac dysfunction,

352
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,210
likely

353
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,250
with shock,

354
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:26,970
and resulting in acute
heart failure and death.

355
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:29,900
Cephalosporins and alcohol,

356
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:30,900
a fatal mix.

357
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,140
So it's an accidental death.

358
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:35,970
Yes, for now.

359
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,180
However,

360
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:38,660
the exact cause

361
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:39,810
can only be confirmed

362
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:40,460
after the autopsy.

363
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:42,460
Gao Yuan,

364
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,530
send the body to the bureau.

365
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:45,860
I'll do the autopsy.

366
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:46,620
Okay.

367
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:55,460
Qi Sizhe.

368
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:01,340
You requested a transfer here.

369
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:03,050
What's your purpose?

370
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,420
And you, Han Feng?

371
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,050
You suddenly moved from Narcotics

372
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,970
to detective work.

373
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:20,770
Why?

374
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:48,700
Jiang Fei may have multiple residences.

375
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,010
Wan.

376
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:51,970
Go to Kundu again.

377
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:53,380
See if anyone has seen him.

378
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,730
Okay, I'll change and head out.

379
00:25:58,750 --> 00:25:59,250
Xi,

380
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,620
track Jiang Fei's recent movements.

381
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:02,620
Last two days especially.

382
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:03,810
Keep me posted.

383
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,290
Got it.

384
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:25,970
Ms. Zhao,

385
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:27,660
I'll leave the tox screen

386
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,050
to you.

387
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:31,210
Thanks to you,

388
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,290
my workload

389
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:33,290
will be much lighter,

390
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,660
and I'll have fewer late nights.

391
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:35,460
Thanks.

392
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:36,420
Appreciate it.

393
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,660
I'll go organize the drug samples.

394
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:42,620
Mr. Qi,

395
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:43,860
I'll go prepare

396
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:44,900
the body storage unit

397
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:45,530
and fill out

398
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:46,290
this report.

399
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,290
I'll handle the autopsy report.

400
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:49,660
You store the body.

401
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:51,530
Alright.

402
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:54,810
Mr. Qi,

403
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:56,290
I'll document the scene

404
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,490
and send the body later.

405
00:26:59,070 --> 00:26:59,460
Okay.

406
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,250
Mr. Han,

407
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,010
are you investigating
Jiang Fei over Li Yiqi

408
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:34,460
or over his own dealing?

409
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,620
When I was in Narcotics in Biannan,

410
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:38,570
he was dealing.

411
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,340
And he got away during a bust.

412
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:41,530
Now he's still dealing.

413
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,250
I want to catch him myself.

414
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:45,140
I feel like

415
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,940
he's connected to Li Yiqi.

416
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:48,570
But you should know,

417
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,620
if Jiang Fei really died accidentally,

418
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:51,940
his case

419
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,180
has nothing to do

420
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:53,860
with us.

421
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:56,100
This notebook

422
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,900
has to go to Narcotics.

423
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:58,970
Fine. I know.

424
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:18,860
Jiang Fei's autopsy is complete?

425
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:20,700
Mr. Han.

426
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,340
Jiang Fei's body...

427
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:24,770
What's wrong?

428
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:26,250
Any findings?

429
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,420
No... Nothing found.

430
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,660
I'm off duty, Mr. Han.

431
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,570
I'm leaving.

432
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:40,180
Mr. Han.

433
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,010
Have you ever encountered a case

434
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,490
that involves someone around you?

435
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,010
I'm a cop.

436
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:53,210
Whoever I'm investigating,

437
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:55,290
I'll do my job.

438
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,210
Who were you working with just now?

439
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,810
What's on your mind?

440
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:06,860
No. Nothing at all.

441
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,860
I'm going, Mr. Han.

442
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:34,770
Hasn't Gao Yuan always been
the one handling the reports?

443
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:38,940
Answer me.

444
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:41,810
This is the Forensics Lab.

445
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:43,860
I'm the forensics chief.

446
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,050
Can't I handle the reports?

447
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,380
Qi Sizhe,

448
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,290
you can fool others,

449
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:51,140
but not me.

450
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:54,210
Why did you request a transfer here?

451
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:03,570
What about you?

452
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:05,770
Han Feng.

453
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:15,570
Hello?

454
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:16,730
Ms. Zhu,

455
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,900
got something on camera.

456
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:18,860
Come take a look.

457
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:20,250
Well, I'll be right there.

458
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:22,050
Mr. Han,

459
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:23,530
got something on camera.

460
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:24,660
Let's go take a look.

461
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:41,050
Hello? Ms. Zhu.

462
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:42,660
Where are you?

463
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:43,340
I...

464
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,490
I want to tell you something.

465
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:47,100
About Jiang Fei's body.

466
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:48,730
Okay.

467
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:49,970
Mr. Han and I will be

468
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:51,620
at the Forensics Lab in ten minutes.

469
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:52,970
Alright.

470
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:57,530
Ms. Zhu, Mr. Han,

471
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,860
I spotted a suspicious person

472
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,810
near Jiang Fei's place.

473
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,660
This person was tailing Jiang Fei

474
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,700
all the way to his place.

475
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:04,730
We also checked that bar's footage

476
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:05,570
from that night.

477
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,460
This person was there too.

478
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:08,900
Play it.

479
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,140
Hui, roll the bar's footage.

480
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,460
Can you zoom on the face?

481
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:15,860
One moment.

482
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:41,660
Sorry.

483
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:43,340
Really sorry.

484
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:44,900
Mr. Qi.

485
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,530
I'm so sorry. I didn't see you there.

486
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:48,860
I have something to do.

487
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,460
I'm going.

488
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:49,940
Never mind.

489
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:20,420
Qiu Lanzi.

490
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:31,900
Qiu Lanzi.

491
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,290
Qiu Lanzi?

492
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:35,970
Lanzi?

493
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,210
Lanzi?

494
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:39,010
She's dead.

495
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:48,460
Mr. Han.

496
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:50,900
Have you ever encountered a case

497
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,380
that involves someone around you?

498
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:54,380
Can't I handle the reports?

499
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,700
You requested a transfer here.

500
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:57,010
What's your purpose?

501
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:44,570
Go.

502
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:48,770
Han Feng?

503
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,460
What do you want?

504
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,730
You're suspected of
murdering Qiu Lanzi.

505
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:55,250
Come with me.

506
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:30,130
A murder in our bureau is unprecedented.

507
00:34:30,990 --> 00:34:32,690
We must solve it quickly.

508
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:33,970
We owe the public answers.

509
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,740
Qi Sizhe is our colleague.

510
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,340
Do you have any concrete leads?

511
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:40,860
If not,

512
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,340
you can't just point fingers.

513
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,050
Footage from near Jiang Fei's residence

514
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:50,050
and 788 Bar

515
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,530
shows Mr. Qi

516
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:52,860
was present at the scene.

517
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:56,970
What else?

518
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,460
Qiu Lanzi called me

519
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,780
before she died.

520
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:02,300
Hello? Ms. Zhu.

521
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:03,900
Where are you?

522
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,610
I... I want to tell you something.

523
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:07,970
About Jiang Fei's body.

524
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,490
Our bureau's camera shows

525
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,460
the last person Qiu Lanzi saw

526
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:13,650
was Qi Sizhe.

527
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:25,690
Han Feng.

528
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:29,300
What's your idea?

529
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,490
I agree with Ms. Zhu.

530
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:34,860
I saw Qiu Lanzi before she died.

531
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,490
She seemed disturbed.

532
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:37,260
Mr. Han.

533
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:39,130
Have you ever encountered a case

534
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:40,650
that involves someone around you?

535
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:41,970
What's on your mind?

536
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:45,490
No. Nothing at all.

537
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,970
You think this is related to Qi Sizhe?

538
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,940
If the cases of Li Yiqi and Jiang Fei

539
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:52,130
are connected to Qi Sizhe,

540
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:55,340
then what could Qiu Lanzi have found

541
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,300
on Jiang Fei's body

542
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:58,860
that would push Qi Sizhe to kill her?

543
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,570
We must apply the law

544
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,740
fairly and justly to everyone.

545
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,690
Don't worry, Mr. Bai.

546
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,570
The evidence will speak.

547
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,610
If you watched the camera,

548
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,130
you'd know

549
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:17,570
I'm not the killer.

550
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,220
Why go to Jiang Fei's home?

551
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:25,610
You were there when
Li Yiqi attacked someone.

552
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,460
And you went to see him at the hospital.

553
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:30,130
Why?

554
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:34,530
I was studying

555
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,050
the city's trouble spots.

556
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:38,380
Because I'm not just
a forensic examiner.

557
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,010
I'm also a cop.

558
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:42,010
Do you think

559
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:43,090
we would believe that?

560
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,170
Yeah, Han Feng.

561
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:52,090
When have you ever believed me?

562
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:01,740
Li Yiqi,

563
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:02,460
Jiang Fei,

564
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:03,610
and Qiu Lanzi.

565
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:05,970
You appeared before
each of their deaths.

566
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,220
How do you explain it?

567
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:09,050
A coincidence?

568
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,300
Do you find it credible?

569
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:14,820
Tell me Lanzi's cause of death,

570
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:16,300
and I'll explain.

571
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:26,380
Is this when you switched

572
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:27,740
Qiu Lanzi's water bottle?

573
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,900
Gao Yuan's preliminary finding

574
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:34,090
is that Qiu Lanzi died
from potassium cyanide.

575
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:35,970
Your prints are on this bottle.

576
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,050
Explain this.

577
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:47,650
Sorry.

578
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,130
Between her picking up the bottle

579
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,220
and us finding her body,

580
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:06,300
only three minutes passed.

581
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,610
You suspect I poisoned the water?

582
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,650
Was the water tested?

583
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,340
Was cyanide found?

584
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,570
Get your facts straight.

585
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,690
We're questioning you.

586
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,220
Don't tell us how to do our job.

587
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,010
Before the autopsy report

588
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,900
and lab results are back,

589
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:39,460
we have nothing to say.

590
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,220
Fine.

591
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,460
We'll wait for the results.

592
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:05,970
Mrs. Qiu, sorry for your loss.

593
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,530
Rest assured. We will find the killer.

594
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:34,380
Well, leave it to me.

595
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:43,260
Mr. Han.

596
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:46,380
Qiu Lanzi did die
from cyanide poisoning.

597
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:48,490
But no cyanide was
detected in that water.

598
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,050
And no cyanide was found

599
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,420
in Mr. Qi's belongings.

600
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,530
The results are in.

601
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,490
Qiu Lanzi died from potassium cyanide.

602
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:13,460
She only contacted you
before she was poisoned.

603
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:14,970
Explain that.

604
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,530
And that water?

605
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:19,820
Any cyanide?

606
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:29,570
You found my prints on the bottle,

607
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:32,940
so you suspect I laced
the water with cyanide

608
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:35,610
and switched the bottles,

609
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,650
causing Lanzi to drink it and die.

610
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:41,260
But you found no cyanide

611
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:43,220
in the water,

612
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,340
in my belongings,

613
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:47,460
or anywhere near Lanzi.

614
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:49,300
So

615
00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:52,170
your conclusion isn't
backed by any evidence.

616
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:54,130
But as a medical examiner,

617
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,690
you'd have plenty of
opportunities and methods.

618
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,090
Potassium cyanide is deadly.

619
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:00,570
One touch is lethal.

620
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,740
If I poisoned Lanzi,

621
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,460
there are only two ways.

622
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:06,130
First,

623
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,340
I watched her

624
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:10,570
ingest the cyanide

625
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:13,530
and saw her die.

626
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:16,340
But I wasn't in the bureau at the time.

627
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,570
So that's impossible.

628
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:20,300
Second,

629
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:23,380
I gave her food

630
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,570
laced with cyanide,

631
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,970
and she ate it the moment she walked

632
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:27,970
into the office.

633
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:29,570
Then she died.

634
00:42:39,110 --> 00:42:40,530
By that logic,

635
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,300
it wouldn't just be me.

636
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:43,780
Anyone in this bureau,

637
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,010
or even anyone she met

638
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:47,380
after she left here

639
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:49,460
could be the killer.

640
00:43:18,990 --> 00:43:21,050
A person dies from cyanide poisoning,

641
00:43:21,070 --> 00:43:23,340
yet you can't determine

642
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:25,570
when or where the
cyanide was administered.

643
00:43:25,710 --> 00:43:26,860
Have you ever heard of

644
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:27,860
remote investigation?

645
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:29,300
Even if you're not there,

646
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,650
the scene and the body

647
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:32,380
tell the whole story.

648
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:34,460
Why did Qiu Lanzi take pictures

649
00:43:34,550 --> 00:43:35,610
of Jiang Fei's body?

650
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:36,820
What did she discover?

651
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:38,900
Let me see Jiang Fei's autopsy report.

652
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:40,490
You should step aside

653
00:43:40,670 --> 00:43:41,780
from these two cases.

654
00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:43,300
We have other medical examiners.

655
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,130
Not every case has to be handled by you.

656
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:46,420
Do you really believe

657
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,490
I would kill a trainee

658
00:43:48,590 --> 00:43:49,820
I barely knew?
