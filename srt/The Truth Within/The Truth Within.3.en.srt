1
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:20,780
Stay away!

2
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:25,460
Stay away!

3
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,580
Stay away from me!

4
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,100
No!

5
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,100
It's not me.

6
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,130
I didn't kill him.

7
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:54,100
It wasn't me.

8
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:54,940
It wasn't me!

9
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:55,820
It wasn't me!

10
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,780
I told you I'm not the killer!

11
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,730
It wasn't me!

12
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,660
It wasn't me!

13
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:00,450
I beg you!

14
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,060
Don't arrest me!

15
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,660
It's not me!

16
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:02,690
I've never killed anyone!

17
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:03,500
She's not the killer.

18
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,730
Her shoulders

19
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,340
don't line up right.

20
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:09,260
And when she gets nervous,

21
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:10,260
her left hand

22
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,060
has involuntary spasms.

23
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:13,690
That's a typical sign

24
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,410
of congenital nerve palsy.

25
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,570
The one we're looking for

26
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,850
must have the physique

27
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,610
and strength to move

28
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:24,890
Jiang Fei's body.

29
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:27,890
But a person

30
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,890
with nerve palsy

31
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,220
could never

32
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,610
handle Jiang Fei's body alone.

33
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,540
I'll go ask.

34
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:52,780
Han Feng!

35
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:57,940
What is it?

36
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:00,570
I suspect

37
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,380
that someone tampered with Jiang Fei's

38
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,170
autopsy report.

39
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:05,060
What do you mean?

40
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,130
How long have you been here?

41
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,290
How does it relate to the case?

42
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,250
The killer staged this,

43
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:17,660
trying to mislead us

44
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:18,930
about the assessment

45
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:20,140
of the cause of death.

46
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,730
But meanwhile,

47
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,700
they also exposed their characteristics.

48
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,580
They know pharmacology, anatomy...

49
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,410
even the case-handling

50
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:29,140
procedures

51
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:30,290
of our department.

52
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,100
They even have

53
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,290
access to the case files.

54
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,410
Only people within the department

55
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:38,140
can match these characteristics.

56
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,410
You're saying

57
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,100
the murderer is one of us?

58
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:09,980
Ms. Zhao,

59
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,410
you'd still have to help with

60
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:12,850
the toxicology testing.

61
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,020
Thanks to you, Mr. Qi,

62
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,100
my work will be a lot

63
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,100
easier in the future,

64
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,540
and I will have fewer night shifts.

65
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:20,250
Thank you.

66
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:21,340
No, thank you.

67
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,250
I'll go sort the drug samples.

68
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,220
Mr. Qi,

69
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,410
I'll go prepare

70
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,490
the freezer for the body

71
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:31,850
and fill out the autopsy report.

72
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:32,780
No need.

73
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,810
I'll fill out the report.

74
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,340
You go store the body.

75
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,140
Okay.

76
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:44,340
Mr. Qi,

77
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,850
I'm staying to document it.

78
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:47,140
I'll deliver the body later.

79
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,100
Jiang Fei is dead.

80
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,900
She saw my name

81
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:22,460
on the body.

82
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:04,460
The body has been disturbed.

83
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,220
You mean

84
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:20,580
before he died,

85
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,540
he wrote the murderer's name on his body

86
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:23,610
with invisible ink,

87
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:25,050
but it was erased.

88
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:26,050
Yes.

89
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,730
Moreover, the black light
photos that Lanzi took

90
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:30,340
were also deleted.

91
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:34,140
It's Eva.

92
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:43,140
Is your English name Eva?

93
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,170
It was Jiang Fei

94
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,290
who gave me the name Eva.

95
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,850
Whenever he took me out,

96
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,250
he'd tell everyone that I was Eva.

97
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:55,660
And he made me wear that Lolita dress.

98
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:57,900
He bought me that dress.

99
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,410
He also gave me money and gifts.

100
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,140
I have no reason to kill him.

101
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:04,170
His death won't do me any good.

102
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,490
That night when you
met Jiang Fei at the bar,

103
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,020
you claimed he had a cold and

104
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:09,900
took cephalosporin?

105
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:11,100
Yes.

106
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,930
Where is the cephalosporin?

107
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:13,980
I took it.

108
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:15,980
It should be

109
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,540
on the lab table right now.

110
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,370
Mr. Han, Ms. Zhu.

111
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:38,820
Did it match the drug in Jiang Fei?

112
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,820
Before, we assessed the cause
of Jiang Fei's death

113
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,940
to be acute heart failure
from alcohol intoxication

114
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,420
and a disulfiram-like reaction.

115
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,610
But we just tested the cephalosporin.

116
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:48,580
In it, we found no

117
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,220
methyltetrazole group.

118
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:51,370
Put it simply.

119
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,180
Not all cephalosporins

120
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,700
cause a disulfiram-like reaction.

121
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,890
Only those with methyltetrazole groups

122
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:57,730
would trigger it.

123
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:00,770
So Zhang Lu's medicine isn't the cause.

124
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:01,650
Yes.

125
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,460
Did we find another box of cephalosporin

126
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:04,980
in Jiang Fei's house?

127
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:05,820
Yes.

128
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,650
That opened box contains

129
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:09,060
methyltetrazole groups.

130
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:11,890
That's why we identified the cause

131
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,180
as an acute heart failure.

132
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:13,980
Yes.

133
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,370
Jiang Fei was frozen to death.

134
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,300
The murderer wanted to make us believe

135
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:19,820
that it was an accidental death.

136
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,060
If Zhang Lu were really the killer,

137
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,180
she wouldn't have told us

138
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,460
Jiang Fei took the meds.

139
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:27,420
That would only overturn
the theory of accidental death.

140
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:28,980
Keep investigating.

141
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:30,490
Okay.

142
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,650
You can see from this angle

143
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,220
that Jiang Fei and Zhang Lu were here.

144
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,060
Jiang Fei did take some meds before her.

145
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,460
But we can't see clearly

146
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,420
what they exactly are.

147
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:40,340
Zoom in.

148
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:46,580
That box in Zhang Lu's hands is

149
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:47,700
the same one in the lab.

150
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:49,130
So she didn't lie.

151
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:51,250
A disulfiram-like reaction was also

152
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,490
detected in Jiang Fei's body.

153
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:54,370
If this box wasn't the cause,

154
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,980
the culprit must have made him

155
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,370
take another box at some point.

156
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:58,850
Play it again.

157
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:04,340
Mr. Qi.

158
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,340
I just found the test Lanzi was

159
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,340
running before she died.

160
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,420
Seems like she was
separating a drug formula.

161
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,420
Were you asking her to run a comparison?

162
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:16,820
Raw Diamond?

163
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,370
Did you test it?

164
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:20,890
It was already listed
as a major investigation project.

165
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:22,100
It's also within scope.

166
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,650
But it's not detected.

167
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:27,770
Where's Li Yiqi's blood sample?

168
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:28,850
Li Yiqi?

169
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,300
Do you think Li Yiqi's case

170
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:33,180
is connected to Lanzi and Jiang Fei's?

171
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,180
Stop.

172
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:48,180
Rewind.

173
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:52,890
Play it again.

174
00:10:59,200 --> 00:10:59,890
One's left-handed.

175
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,610
One's right-handed.

176
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,130
This is not Zhang Lu.

177
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:05,700
No, wait.

178
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,460
Then why did the blood
from Jiang Fei's house

179
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,060
match Zhang Lu's?

180
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:16,180
Mr. Qi.

181
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:16,610
Han Feng.

182
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:17,770
- Where's Gao Yuan?
- Where's he?

183
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:24,730
Gao Yuan!

184
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,130
Ms. Zhu, Mr. Han,

185
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:27,770
what's wrong?

186
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,250
Did you handle the blood sample

187
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:29,980
of Jiang Fei's case?

188
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:31,100
No, not me.

189
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:32,370
What about the drug test?

190
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,580
None of the tests

191
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,060
on this case

192
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:34,700
were done by me.

193
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,220
Is there something wrong with

194
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:40,850
the blood test?

195
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:49,820
The results are in.

196
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:51,340
It's her.

197
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,850
Where's Ms. Zhao right now?

198
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,180
This is your daughter Zhao Yiwa's

199
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:19,980
transfer application.

200
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:21,610
Please sign your name.

201
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,460
The blood comparison results are in.

202
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:09,820
It's clean this time.

203
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:02,300
Ms. Zhao,

204
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:03,980
I didn't expect

205
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,700
to see you here in this way.

206
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:13,650
The test results are in.

207
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:15,340
Your blood

208
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:16,980
matches the blood we found

209
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,730
at Jiang Fei's house.

210
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:24,370
You killed Jiang Fei

211
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,700
for your daughter,

212
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,060
Zhao Yiwa, right?

213
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,220
I arrested Jiang Fei before.

214
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,420
He sold a drug

215
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:39,420
called Raw Diamond,

216
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:40,580
causing many deaths.

217
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,180
We did our research.

218
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:44,130
You worked in Li City before.

219
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:46,250
Your daughter was 16 then.

220
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,580
She once attempted suicide,

221
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:49,460
cutting her wrists.

222
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,850
Though found

223
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,730
and rescued,

224
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,340
she fell into a coma.

225
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:57,580
And in her system,

226
00:14:58,390 --> 00:14:59,980
large quantities of drugs were detected.

227
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:02,770
The main one was Raw Diamond.

228
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:07,490
Have you heard of a drug

229
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:08,370
called Raw Diamond?

230
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:10,300
I've examined many bodies before,

231
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,250
all died from it.

232
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:12,980
The last one I remember

233
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,340
was a 16-year-old girl

234
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:16,650
who got brain damage

235
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:17,700
and turned vegetative

236
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,770
from taking Raw Diamond.

237
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:20,940
It was on the day that

238
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,130
you heard Jiang Fei's name.

239
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,060
Jiang Fei has no

240
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,340
fixed residence.

241
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:28,340
As for where he is now,

242
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,010
you'll have

243
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,060
to look into it.

244
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,130
You impersonated Zhang Lu,

245
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,490
got close to Jiang Fei,

246
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:53,650
and found the chance to drug him.

247
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:01,100
One's left-handed.

248
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:01,890
One's right-handed.

249
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,340
This is not Zhang Lu.

250
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:08,370
You coaxed Jiang Fei at the bar

251
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:09,370
into taking the meds.

252
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,180
After we arrested Zhang Lu,

253
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:14,180
you used your position

254
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,370
to frame Zhang Lu

255
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,180
to clear your own name,

256
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,300
am I right?

257
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,220
If Zhang Lu's blood matches

258
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,300
the blood sample we collected

259
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,530
from Jiang Fei's house,

260
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:25,530
she's most likely

261
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,180
the one who killed him.

262
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:34,610
You swapped Zhang Lu's blood

263
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:35,730
with the blood sample from

264
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:36,490
Jiang Fei's house,

265
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:37,980
framing her as the killer.

266
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:39,980
You did all this

267
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,340
to cover the fact that

268
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:42,250
you killed Jiang Fei.

269
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:01,130
So Jiang Fei's time of death

270
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,490
was around 4 AM.

271
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,420
I've checked.

272
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,140
There was no power outage that night.

273
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,220
The killer must

274
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:15,860
take the knife away from the scene.

275
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,290
That means...

276
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:19,420
That knife wasn't stabbed at the victim.

277
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,420
It was the killer.

278
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:22,770
Do you remember Zhao Yiwa?

279
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:36,420
Did you find a knife on the site?

280
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,140
The forensic team collected many

281
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,660
incomplete and disordered fingerprints.

282
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,250
We assume that most of them

283
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:45,290
are traces of daily life.

284
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,770
During the autopsy, you found

285
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,660
the name written on Jiang Fei's wrist.

286
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,420
You killed Qiu Lanzi because

287
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,050
she saw the name Eva, right?

288
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,490
You were worried that
once we found out about it,

289
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,050
it'd trace to your daughter Zhao Yiwa

290
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,940
and expose your motive for murder.

291
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:08,940
If you got caught,

292
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:10,940
you wouldn't be able
to take your daughter

293
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:13,090
to seek other treatment abroad.

294
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:16,090
It was also you who deleted
the photos in the camera, right?

295
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,330
To keep the secret,

296
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,330
you put potassium cyanide
into Qiu Lanzi's stomach medicine

297
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:22,490
and killed her.

298
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:39,180
Jiang Fei caused my daughter's death.

299
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,140
He deserved it.

300
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,140
What about Zhang Lu?

301
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:47,180
Don't you feel guilty about

302
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,700
framing someone innocent?

303
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:55,620
And also Qiu Lanzi.

304
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,660
What did she do wrong?

305
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:04,010
She was simply doing

306
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:06,140
her job as a forensic pathologist.

307
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:08,770
Why did she deserve to die?

308
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,660
It wasn't only Jiang Fei

309
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:14,380
who killed your daughter.

310
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,250
She's a good doctor.

311
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:26,460
She saves other people,

312
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,660
but never has time for me.

313
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,660
This was your daughter's last post

314
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:37,860
before she committed suicide.

315
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,050
She's a good doctor.

316
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,700
She saves other people,

317
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:44,050
but never has time for me.

318
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:49,740
Thanks, Mr. Han.

319
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,060
Jiang Fei's case is finally solved.

320
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,530
I haven't treated everyone

321
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,090
to a meal since I came to He City.

322
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,300
I'll treat you guys

323
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,570
to send Qiu Lanzi off in a few days.

324
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:04,300
Then I'll thank you
on everyone's behalf.

325
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:07,730
By the way,

326
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:10,210
please thank Mr. Qi for me.

327
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,820
He worked hard for Qiu Lanzi's case.

328
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:19,040
I know you and Mr. Qi

329
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:20,170
were once good friends.

330
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:22,690
Are you two like this now

331
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:24,450
due to the Raw Diamond Case?

332
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,240
We're simply colleagues now.

333
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:52,930
I'm the police captain,

334
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:54,320
and he's the forensic.

335
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:55,130
Don't worry.

336
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:56,760
It won't affect our work.

337
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:00,690
I know.

338
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:03,240
I'll fill out the case report now.

339
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:15,240
The Raw Diamond Case is closed.

340
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:17,850
Why are you still after it?

341
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:19,520
Han Feng,

342
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:22,650
I've told you so many times.

343
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:23,690
You think

344
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:25,320
Li Ming is the drug manufacturer.

345
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:26,930
But Li Ming has suffered

346
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:28,040
from polio since childhood.

347
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,040
He's limp in his left leg.

348
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,450
But the person who got out of that car

349
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:35,930
at the scene

350
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:36,760
back then

351
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:38,240
wasn't limping at all!

352
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:40,370
So I can be certain

353
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:41,970
that it wasn't Li Ming at all!

354
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:44,760
You didn't

355
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:46,080
investigate Fei's death properly.

356
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:48,320
Li Yiqi

357
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:49,650
and Jiang Fei

358
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:51,240
were the leads

359
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:52,240
on that case back then.

360
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:54,850
So you came to He City

361
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:55,610
because of this?

362
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:57,890
Back then,

363
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,890
only Li Ming's DNA

364
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:00,930
was found in my car.

365
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:02,970
And you think you saw someone,

366
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,040
but you were unconscious.

367
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,280
Your intuition

368
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:06,520
and your memory

369
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:08,480
are both unreliable.

370
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,240
Qi Sizhe,

371
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:11,720
you just simply can't

372
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:12,560
convince yourself.

373
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:15,240
The Raw Diamond Case is closed.

374
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:17,370
You just don't want to face the truth.

375
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:33,650
Who is it?

376
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:35,690
Help me!

377
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:50,170
Miss?

378
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:51,480
Are you okay?

379
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:01,040
Here, sit down.

380
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:21,170
Don't be afraid.

381
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,480
It's very safe here.

382
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:23,560
I've called the police.

383
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:24,690
They'll be here soon.

384
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,040
Just rest assured.

385
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,130
How did you get injured?

386
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:32,210
Can you hear me?

387
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:35,520
See?

388
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:37,000
I told you the police would come.

389
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:37,890
Just wait here.

390
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:38,560
No!

391
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:39,610
No...

392
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:40,720
No...

393
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:41,320
Don't worry.

394
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:41,930
It's fine.

395
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:45,520
Officer?

396
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:47,130
You guys come quickly.

397
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,210
My eyes!

398
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:58,690
Who are you?

399
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:22,560
Sorry, Mr. Bai.

400
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:24,210
We didn't notice

401
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:25,240
Ms. Zhao's issue.

402
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:26,560
It was my mistake.

403
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:28,650
It's not your responsibility alone.

404
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:30,080
None of us expected that.

405
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:32,930
You still have work ahead of you.

406
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:34,210
I hope you can

407
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:35,930
quickly adjust your mindset

408
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:37,320
and carry on.

409
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:38,610
I understand.

410
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:42,850
Oh, Mr. Bai.

411
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:46,320
Mr. Han and Mr. Qi,

412
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:47,850
did something happen

413
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:48,800
between them before?

414
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:50,370
Their relationship always

415
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:51,210
seems odd to me.

416
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:55,130
Come in.

417
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:57,560
Mr. Bai, Ms. Zhu.

418
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:58,170
New case.

419
00:27:58,540 --> 00:27:59,040
Mr. Han

420
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:00,000
and Mr. Qi are informed.

421
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:02,320
I'll go now.

422
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:02,890
Okay.

423
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:15,800
Mr. Han.

424
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:16,930
Sit rep?

425
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:19,610
The victim is Huang Hao,

426
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:20,970
owner of this pork shop.

427
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,410
We received his emergency call

428
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:23,280
at 8:17 PM.

429
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:24,240
In the call, he said

430
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:25,610
a girl ran into his house

431
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:27,130
and seemed very frightened.

432
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,560
When we arrived

433
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:29,240
at 8:37 PM,

434
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:30,170
he was already dead.

435
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:31,410
No other leads yet.

436
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:33,040
And the girl?

437
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:34,170
Didn't see her.

438
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:13,720
The murderer probably used

439
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:14,520
pepper spray first.

440
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,760
While losing his vision,

441
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:18,480
the victim took several

442
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:20,240
heavy blows to the head.

443
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:25,000
After losing the ability to resist,

444
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,280
a bone was pierced
directly into his heart,

445
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:28,450
causing his death.

446
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:05,890
This size...

447
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:07,480
Is it the girl

448
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:08,450
mentioned in the call?

449
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,800
Judging from the footprint size,

450
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:17,130
the person is around 160 cm,

451
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:19,240
likely a female.

452
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:25,370
Here's a larger shoe print.

453
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:40,410
These two bloody shoe prints are

454
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:41,370
not the victim's.

455
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:43,280
Most likely left by the murderer.

456
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:45,240
The shoe prints indicate

457
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:46,930
weight shifted backward,

458
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:48,280
pressed deep and evenly

459
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:49,520
into the ground.

460
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:50,650
It suggests that

461
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:52,890
they may have carried someone else.

462
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:55,320
Ms. Zhu,

463
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:56,760
when will you arrive?

464
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,240
The murderer

465
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,480
probably took the injured girl.

466
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:00,760
We need backup.

467
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:01,720
Expand search scope.

468
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:02,970
Yes.

469
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:07,850
Freeze! Stop there!

470
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:10,450
You stay here

471
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:11,450
and wait for Ms. Zhu.

472
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:13,280
Han Feng?

473
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:19,130
Where?

474
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:20,240
Went that way.

475
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:21,320
Careful. Wait for backup.

476
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:21,850
Yes.

477
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:52,680
Ms. Zhu.

478
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:54,930
We received the call

479
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:55,810
at 8:17 PM.

480
00:34:55,910 --> 00:34:56,770
When we arrived

481
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:57,370
at 8:37 PM,

482
00:34:57,390 --> 00:34:58,290
the victim was already dead.

483
00:34:58,950 --> 00:34:59,370
Also,

484
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:00,480
we spotted someone

485
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,330
suspicious on the hill.

486
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,480
Mr. Han's after them.

487
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:03,730
And Mr. Qi?

488
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:05,290
Mr. Qi

489
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:07,080
seems to go that way.

490
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:04,560
Ms. Zhu!

491
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,040
Ms. Zhu,

492
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:09,560
we couldn't reach Mr. Han.

493
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:11,200
Where's our backup?

494
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:13,120
About 15 minutes to arrive.

495
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:15,680
Hey, look.

496
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:17,410
There's a cave here.

497
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:19,370
The kidnapped girl was

498
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:20,850
probably taken inside.

499
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:23,520
Could Mr. Qi also go inside?

500
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:39,640
Su,

501
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:40,330
go that way.

502
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:40,770
Okay.

503
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:01,810
Ms. Zhu!

504
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:09,330
Found a glove.

505
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:12,640
Probably left to us

506
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:13,480
by Mr. Qi.

507
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:14,890
Come on.

508
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:25,640
This way.

509
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:28,040
Still running?

510
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:29,450
Huh?

511
00:38:29,830 --> 00:38:31,290
You chased me, of course I ran!

512
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:33,120
Why did you commit murder, and how?

513
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:34,410
I didn't!

514
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,640
I'm not a murderer!

515
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:38,560
Stealing, too?

516
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:40,040
I... I just stole a few things.

517
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:41,040
I didn't kill anyone!

518
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:42,480
I saw the murderer!

519
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:07,330
You mean the killer took someone

520
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:08,000
and left the shop?

521
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:09,000
To where?

522
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:10,200
I don't know that!

523
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:11,080
I really don't!

524
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:11,770
Be honest now!

525
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:12,770
No, I don't know!

526
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:14,600
I really don't!

527
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:20,970
I didn't kill anyone!

528
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:21,600
Watch him.

529
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:22,520
Wait for me.

530
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:23,680
Mr. Han.

531
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:24,600
Where are they?

532
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:26,290
Mr. Qi likely went after the killer.

533
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:27,640
Ms. Zhu and Su went to find him.

534
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:28,560
Couldn't reach them.

535
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:29,040
Where?

536
00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:29,810
Over there.

537
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:01,640
Ms. Zhu?

538
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:03,040
Ms. Zhu!

539
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:05,450
I've checked that side.

540
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:06,810
All dead ends.

541
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:07,890
Ms. Zhu!

542
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:08,970
Mr. Han.

543
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:10,850
Where's Qi Sizhe?

544
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:12,200
No sign yet.

545
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:14,330
That guy I just arrested said

546
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:15,330
the killer was in the shop.

547
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:16,730
Qi Sizhe should be after them.

548
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:17,680
Now we know that

549
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:18,520
the killer killed one

550
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:19,450
and likely kidnapped one.

551
00:41:19,790 --> 00:41:20,370
Don't know what

552
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:21,000
will happen.

553
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:22,290
Time's running out.

554
00:41:22,310 --> 00:41:22,850
We must hurry.

555
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:25,160
Both sides are dead ends.

556
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:26,730
Let's go and see that way.

557
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:27,200
Come on.

558
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:41,290
Qi Sizhe,

559
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:44,690
you shouldn't...

560
00:41:45,790 --> 00:41:46,280
Don't move.

561
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:00,410
This is a funnel-web spider.

562
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:01,680
Highly poisonous.

563
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:03,930
An adult bitten

564
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:06,120
will die in 15 minutes.

565
00:42:07,390 --> 00:42:08,410
Don't go investigate

566
00:42:08,470 --> 00:42:09,290
alone ever again.

567
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:11,520
I didn't find the girl.

568
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:12,680
However,

569
00:42:13,870 --> 00:42:14,770
I found this.

570
00:42:22,270 --> 00:42:22,970
More to this side.

571
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:46,250
Take it slow.

572
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:52,480
Could every cocoon

573
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:53,410
have a person inside?

574
00:43:02,910 --> 00:43:03,480
Just a doll.

575
00:43:04,430 --> 00:43:04,970
Mr. Gao?

576
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:06,330
Found anything?

577
00:43:06,910 --> 00:43:07,600
All dolls.

578
00:43:14,870 --> 00:43:15,640
Something's inside.

579
00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:17,930
Gao Yuan?

580
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:35,000
What's that smell?

581
00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:37,330
Mixed gas.

582
00:43:38,910 --> 00:43:39,770
Hydrochloric acid,

583
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:41,480
concentrated.

584
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:47,680
Isn't this doll filled

585
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:50,370
with human remains?

586
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:52,680
No human.

587
00:43:54,270 --> 00:43:55,080
Should be animals.

588
00:43:56,470 --> 00:43:57,330
Probably cow's.

589
00:43:58,310 --> 00:43:59,080
Ms. Zhu.

590
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:01,120
We had some new discoveries.

591
00:44:01,790 --> 00:44:02,560
We found a new

592
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:03,640
open area ahead.

593
00:44:03,790 --> 00:44:04,680
There are human cocoons.

594
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:06,330
Not sure if any victims are involved.

595
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:07,850
We need your backup.

596
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:09,200
Just go straight

597
00:44:09,270 --> 00:44:10,290
on this road,

598
00:44:10,390 --> 00:44:11,290
and you'll find us.

599
00:44:11,350 --> 00:44:12,000
Hurry.

600
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:18,250
Wan?

601
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:53,770
Be gentle.

602
00:45:03,310 --> 00:45:04,080
Still a doll.

603
00:45:12,350 --> 00:45:12,850
Wan.

604
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:14,600
Look.

605
00:45:19,990 --> 00:45:21,250
So much garbage.

606
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:24,370
The suspect has been living here

607
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:25,120
for quite a while.

608
00:45:28,910 --> 00:45:29,480
Mr. Gao.

609
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:31,160
Take this waste back

610
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:31,850
and run

611
00:45:31,990 --> 00:45:32,850
a DNA test.

612
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:33,560
Okay.

613
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:05,730
Be careful!

614
00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:11,200
That sound...

615
00:46:50,270 --> 00:46:51,120
It's not a doll.

616
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:53,290
It's a body.

617
00:47:11,350 --> 00:47:13,290
The killer might be mimicking
the funnel-web spider

618
00:47:13,350 --> 00:47:14,040
to kill his prey.

619
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:16,410
Those dolls were likely
his practice pieces.

620
00:47:16,470 --> 00:47:17,970
The kidnapped female is likely

621
00:47:17,990 --> 00:47:19,290
still in the killer's hands.

622
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:20,600
We must get her out

623
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:21,480
no matter what!

624
00:47:21,580 --> 00:47:22,680
The organs inside the doll

625
00:47:22,790 --> 00:47:24,450
were leaked from
their virus experiments.

626
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:27,040
Do you suspect that
this is related to the school?

627
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:28,080
The killer's probably

628
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:29,890
among the students in the experiment.

629
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:33,370
Ye Yingying has tiny pinhole
marks on her chin.

630
00:47:33,430 --> 00:47:34,640
Could it be from cosmetic surgery?

631
00:47:35,430 --> 00:47:36,330
Why did you kill her?

632
00:47:36,350 --> 00:47:37,040
And how?

633
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:38,520
Why would I kill someone?

634
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:41,080
He didn't paint all

635
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:42,200
his victims, did he?

636
00:47:42,470 --> 00:47:43,250
I've seen her.
