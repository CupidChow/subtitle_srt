1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000


2
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:25,980
The evidence report is in.

3
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,820
The taxi's gear shift at the scene

4
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,890
was not engaged.

5
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,610
I went to the scene and noticed

6
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:33,010
that the concealed tire marks

7
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,380
showed the front wheels had

8
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,060
significantly greater
friction than normal.

9
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,010
I think the perpetrator

10
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,100
pushed the car into the lake

11
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,660
after committing the murder.

12
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,500
Hello? You need to come quickly.

13
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:57,980
I'm at the reservoir

14
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,780
right now.

15
00:02:59,150 --> 00:02:59,540
Yes.

16
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:00,980
Bad news.

17
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,100
Something bad...

18
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:04,540
Someone's dead.

19
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:06,570
Yes.

20
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,570
I'll wait here.

21
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,570
I'll wait.

22
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,460
How's Ms. Zhu now?

23
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,100
She's okay.

24
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:25,490
Zhu!

25
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:26,250
Hey, Wan!

26
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:27,100
You got hurt?

27
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,660
It's nothing. Let's go.

28
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,660
What do you mean?

29
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,340
We're already here.

30
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,050
Get a CT scan

31
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:31,850
and a full check-up.

32
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:33,780
I've asked for a day off for you.

33
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:34,540
Come on!

34
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,340
I'm really fine.

35
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:35,930
Let's go.

36
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,410
Zhu Qingyue!

37
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:43,730
Huatao specifically asked me

38
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:44,850
to take good care of you

39
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:45,700
when he passed away.

40
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,050
And now you won't even

41
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:47,490
listen to me?

42
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:48,900
Can we skip him?

43
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:53,290
Go get a proper check-up later.

44
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:54,580
Wan,

45
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:56,140
I saw the suspect from the

46
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:56,580
Li Yiqi case.

47
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:08,730
She didn't rest?

48
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,340
We've traced the license plate.

49
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:13,140
It's B53617,

50
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,610
but it's fake.

51
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,930
Yet traffic police tracked it entering

52
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,810
the Fenglin Ducheng
Community last night,

53
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,370
where it stayed for an hour.

54
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,250
Coincidentally,

55
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,340
a fatal fall occurred in the community

56
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,410
at the exact same time.

57
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,170
That person went there

58
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,540
that night to find Wang Chen.

59
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,170
They said this medicine

60
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,140
gave us the courage to jump.

61
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:37,660
Mr. Qi,

62
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:39,540
Wang Chen's blood test report

63
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,020
is out.

64
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,290
Traces of an anesthetic were found.

65
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,410
What... what is this?

66
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,290
What?

67
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:10,850
What's so heavy?

68
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:11,850
A box?

69
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,170
Help me out.

70
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:13,810
Come on!

71
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:14,780
Just leave it.

72
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:15,340
Let me see.

73
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:21,900
It's a woman!

74
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:23,810
Call the police!

75
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:24,700
Call the police!

76
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,540
How did it go?

77
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:38,220
Ning,

78
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:38,700
the boss

79
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,980
says no strangers appeared.

80
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:40,850
Ask them.

81
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:41,580
Got it.

82
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,020
Ning,

83
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,580
I've asked several households too.

84
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,900
Nothing so far.

85
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:48,140
Okay, I understand.

86
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:52,020
Make way.

87
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:53,700
Everyone, please make way.

88
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:54,460
Mr. Han.

89
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,220
This body

90
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:02,340
was found in a trash bin

91
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,490
by those two sanitation workers.

92
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,250
I just looked around;

93
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:06,540
there's no security camera here.

94
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:09,610
How is it?

95
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,540
The victim is

96
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,540
a young woman.

97
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:13,220
Apart from facial disfigurement,

98
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:14,610
her fingerprints are worn off.

99
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,340
Mr. Han,

100
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:17,340
I don't understand why

101
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,850
there are so many homicide cases lately?

102
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,220
I found something strange.

103
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,700
Time of death is

104
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,940
estimated to be about two days ago,

105
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,180
between 9 and 11 PM.

106
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:45,650
Mr. Han.

107
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,460
How did it go?

108
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,060
The deceased is female,

109
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,100
approximately 5'41'' tall,

110
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,130
weighing around 110 pounds.

111
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,370
Judging from the fusion

112
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:52,730
of the epiphyseal lines in the long

113
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,610
bones and the symphyseal
surface of the pubis,

114
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,730
the estimated age

115
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,130
is between 29

116
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,420
and 32.

117
00:08:58,750 --> 00:08:59,490
No childbirth history.

118
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:00,250
No signs of

119
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,180
sexual assault before death.

120
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,010
We found some food residue

121
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:04,580
in the deceased's stomach:

122
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:06,220
beef, bread, and broccoli.

123
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:06,980
The blood

124
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,890
contained alcohol.

125
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,010
Based on several post-mortem indicators

126
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,730
and the stomach contents,

127
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:12,460
the estimated time

128
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,610
of death is

129
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,300
about two days ago,

130
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:16,730
between 9 and 11 PM.

131
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,890
Cause of death is massive hemorrhage.

132
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,010
The fatal wound is to

133
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:21,730
the carotid artery.

134
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:22,940
What kind of weapon caused it?

135
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,340
The shape of the weapon
is very peculiar,

136
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:26,890
resembling

137
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,770
a triangular, blade-like object.

138
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,730
The wound is on the right side.

139
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,490
The perpetrator is left-handed.

140
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:33,730
Very likely.

141
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,060
What about the DNA?

142
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:36,370
No matches found

143
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:37,340
among missing persons.

144
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,460
So we can only start

145
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:43,100
investigating with that tattoo

146
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,100
on her lower back.

147
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:47,420
I remember something.

148
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,980
I think I recall an unsolved case.

149
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,730
The wounds on the victim were

150
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,180
very similar to hers.

151
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:53,770
Fourteen years ago,

152
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,580
a murder occurred in Lijia Town.

153
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:57,490
The victim was a 19-year-old

154
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:58,250
female college girl.

155
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,700
The perpetrator was never found.

156
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:01,130
The officers at the time deduced the

157
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:02,220
weapon was a fountain pen.

158
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,250
Was the weapon found at the scene?

159
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,420
No.

160
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,490
Is there

161
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,130
more information on this case?

162
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,370
For more information,

163
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,650
we'll need to go back to the scene

164
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:14,100
and find the detectives of the case

165
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,220
to get the basic details.

166
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,890
Do you think these two cases

167
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:18,700
are connected?

168
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,940
Judging from the wounds,

169
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,610
they are very similar.

170
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,180
But to determine

171
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:26,850
if the perpetrator's methods
are consistent,

172
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:28,770
we need more information.

173
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:30,100
Alright.

174
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:30,730
Ms. Zhu,

175
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,700
you follow up on the tattoo lead.

176
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,100
We'll go to Lijia Town.

177
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:47,850
Hello, Mr. Han!

178
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:48,890
Mr. Li.

179
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:49,770
You must be Mr. Qi!

180
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:50,250
Hello.

181
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:50,770
Hi.

182
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,220
For the case you mentioned,

183
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:53,460
we've got the materials ready.

184
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,580
Let's talk inside.

185
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,220
Okay.

186
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:55,490
Come in.

187
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,580
Here, have some tea.

188
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:01,820
Thanks.

189
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,890
This case you mentioned

190
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,890
caused quite a stir

191
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:11,250
in our town back then.

192
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,460
Tell us about it.

193
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:16,580
The deceased was named Fan Jiangxue.

194
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,730
She was raised

195
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:20,580
by her grandmother.

196
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:23,530
We all watched her grow up.

197
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,100
She loved painting since she was a child

198
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,700
and often went to the
back mountain to sketch.

199
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,370
On the day of the incident,

200
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,820
the whole town was in chaos.

201
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:33,890
Everything

202
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:35,650
was thrown into disarray.

203
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,650
No suspect was caught back then?

204
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:39,730
Our town

205
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:41,770
had never seen

206
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:43,130
such a brutal case.

207
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:45,130
Plus, over a decade ago,

208
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,940
investigative methods
weren't as advanced.

209
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,420
I was wondering

210
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:51,100
if this case would

211
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,650
remain unsolved

212
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:53,980
until my retirement.

213
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,130
For the body you found,

214
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:02,580
do the wounds really match Jiangxue's?

215
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:06,130
Could the killer be the same person?

216
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:07,850
It's not certain yet.

217
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:18,250
This person is...?

218
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:21,220
This girl

219
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,650
is named Hu Jie.

220
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,700
She grew up with Jiangxue.

221
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,770
Jiangxue's family was poor,

222
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,490
but Hu Jie was

223
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:30,300
kind-hearted and

224
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:31,180
didn't despise her.

225
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:32,300
The two of them

226
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,220
often went up the mountain
to paint together.

227
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,610
Was this Hu Jie present at

228
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,850
the time of the incident?

229
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:41,060
She said she had a cold and stayed

230
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,130
home that day.

231
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,300
So she wasn't there.

232
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,300
I'm glad she didn't go.

233
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:46,370
If she had,

234
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:48,250
she might have been killed too.

235
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,180
Does she live in town now?

236
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:52,250
Can we see her?

237
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,250
Since Jiangxue's case had
remained unsolved,

238
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,890
the whole town was on edge.

239
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,460
Many people moved away.

240
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,610
As for Hu Jie, I heard

241
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,490
her parents

242
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:04,460
arranged for her to study abroad.

243
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:09,940
Ms. Zhu,

244
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,220
I've checked a few tattoo shops

245
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,580
but found no lead.

246
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:14,530
Keep looking.

247
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,100
Okay.

248
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:20,300
Ms. Zhu, I found something!

249
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:25,180
I found a girl

250
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,530
with the exact same tattoo

251
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,420
in a video posted

252
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,530
by an online blogger.

253
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:29,610
Yes,

254
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:30,940
that's the one!

255
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:32,420
It's identical to the Jane Doe's;

256
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,250
so is the location!

257
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:34,530
She went abroad

258
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:35,370
to study art when

259
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:36,060
she was a teenager

260
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,010
and has returned lately.

261
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,300
What's her name?

262
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:39,220
Don't know yet.

263
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:40,700
I only know her username.

264
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:42,300
Confirm her identity

265
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,220
as soon as possible.

266
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:44,180
Got it.

267
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:45,700
She was abroad.

268
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,650
Figures we can't track her.

269
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,340
Good job, Su!

270
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,700
Her friend was killed the same day

271
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,650
she happened to be absent.

272
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,610
After that,

273
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:56,370
she went abroad.

274
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,490
Hu Jie is definitely suspicious.

275
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,010
Age-wise,

276
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,940
she's also close to the Jane Doe.

277
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:04,420
Hello?

278
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:05,610
Hello, Mr. Han.

279
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:06,730
We found a girl

280
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:07,650
online with

281
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,580
a tattoo identical

282
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,180
to the Jane Doe's.

283
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:11,490
(We're still)

284
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:12,250
(checking her ID.)

285
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:13,820
I'll send you the photo.

286
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,220
Su,

287
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:16,610
send to Mr. Han.

288
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:17,130
Okay.

289
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,700
It's Hu Jie.

290
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:28,980
This girl is

291
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,730
the friend of the
deceased from Lijia Town.

292
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:31,420
Her name is Hu Jie.

293
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,940
I'll send you Hu Jie's

294
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,610
information.

295
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:34,980
Find her family to

296
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,060
compare DNA and

297
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:36,650
confirm ID.

298
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:37,530
Okay.

299
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:54,850
Hello.

300
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:56,980
This cabin

301
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,340
was originally used as a rest stop

302
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,730
for nearby forest rangers.

303
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:03,650
Over time, fewer people came,

304
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:04,980
so

305
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,490
it was abandoned.

306
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:08,180
Come take a look.

307
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,220
Come on.

308
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,300
Jiangxue and Hu Jie

309
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,180
used to

310
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:22,060
come here to play a lot.

311
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:23,980
However,

312
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,700
after what happened to Jiangxue,

313
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,890
no one dared to come in anymore.

314
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:32,220
Be careful.

315
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:33,250
It's fine.

316
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:35,420
Some kids in town

317
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,820
call this place the haunted house

318
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,820
and come exploring.

319
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,010
Occasionally,

320
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:42,530
a few mischievous kids

321
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:43,460
come up here.

322
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,580
Watch your steps.

323
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:46,650
Over here.

324
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:04,650
This was the crime scene back then.

325
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:06,370
The body was right there.

326
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:24,650
Here?

327
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,220
Yes.

328
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:42,820
The forensic examiner
back then concluded

329
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,820
that the cause of death
was excessive blood loss

330
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,370
after the carotid artery was pierced;

331
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:47,850
the weapon was a fountain pen,

332
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:49,370
but it wasn't found

333
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:50,420
at the scene.

334
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,370
How do you know it was a fountain pen?

335
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,340
The wound shape matched,

336
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,980
and fountain pen ink was
found in the wound.

337
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:06,050
We also found

338
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:06,900
an easel at the scene.

339
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,090
Next to Fan Jiangxue

340
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,290
was a fountain pen

341
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:12,530
with only her own fingerprints,

342
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,290
but no blood.

343
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:15,700
Also,

344
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,730
we noticed that someone

345
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,220
had obviously cleaned the scene.

346
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,860
Fingerprints, footprints,

347
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:20,860
all gone.

348
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:23,140
Finally, we found a strand of hair.

349
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,460
The shape of the weapon
is very peculiar,

350
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:27,010
resembling

351
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,900
a triangular, blade-like object.

352
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,700
How was the perpetrator's method

353
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:01,180
determined back then?

354
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:02,860
The wound surface is

355
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,140
on the right side of the neck.

356
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,980
When analyzing the entry
wound and the force applied,

357
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,330
it should be a forward diagonal stab.

358
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,290
But if the right hand
was used, the killer

359
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,330
could only stab with a backhand,

360
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:15,980
which would be

361
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:17,420
extremely awkward.

362
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,980
However, if the left hand was used,

363
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,250
there would be no such problem.

364
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,380
So,

365
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:26,290
the perpetrator is left-handed.

366
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:27,380
Correct.

367
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,420
That was

368
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,050
our judgment back then.

369
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:33,250
What was the result

370
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,460
of the hair comparison?

371
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:36,050
That hair was

372
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,180
a broken strand,

373
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,660
completely lacking the follicle.

374
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:39,660
So,

375
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:41,380
it couldn't be used for identification.

376
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,490
We only knew

377
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:44,050
it wasn't Fan Jiangxue's.

378
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:58,050
There was only an easel at the scene,

379
00:18:58,350 --> 00:18:59,330
but no painting was found.

380
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,010
We found it

381
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:02,460
quite puzzling as well.

382
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,290
We thought it might have been blown away

383
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:04,770
or something.

384
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,620
So we had people search

385
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,530
the entire area,

386
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,900
but found no painting.

387
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:11,940
The killer probably left evidence on it,

388
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,090
so they took it away.

389
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:14,980
No idea.

390
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,330
Ms. Zhu,

391
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:51,900
we've contacted

392
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,700
Hu Jie's parents.

393
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,290
They are currently abroad.

394
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:56,250
They said

395
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:57,420
Hu Jie returned several months ago.

396
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:58,730
But we checked her

397
00:19:58,750 --> 00:19:59,770
communication records.

398
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:00,660
Her phone number is an

399
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,290
Australian number.

400
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:02,770
There's currently no

401
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:03,730
effective information.

402
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:06,290
This is the cleaning lady from her home.

403
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:07,570
She let us in.

404
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,330
Ms. Zhu.

405
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:14,180
Hi, ma'am.

406
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,380
Hello.

407
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,530
Let's sit and talk.

408
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:18,140
Here.

409
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:19,620
Please, ma'am.

410
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:22,660
I'll just ask you a few
simple questions.

411
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,460
When was the last time

412
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,140
you saw Hu Jie?

413
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,220
When I came to clean
the day before yesterday.

414
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:30,490
What time did you arrive?

415
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:32,940
Around 2 PM.

416
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,860
Was Hu Jie home at that time?

417
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:36,860
Yes.

418
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,770
I started cleaning in the afternoon

419
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,330
and left around 6 PM.

420
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:42,250
Ms. Hu

421
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:43,860
went out a little after 5 PM.

422
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,700
It seemed like she had
a dinner appointment.

423
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:02,620
She got a call

424
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:04,050
and left in a hurry.

425
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:05,660
Do you know who

426
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,700
she was meeting for dinner?

427
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:08,860
I only heard her on the phone,

428
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,140
but don't know who it was.

429
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:12,090
Okay,

430
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,460
thank you.

431
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,290
Hui,

432
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,180
take a statement from her

433
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:17,250
and then escort her home.

434
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,220
Got it.

435
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,290
We'll contact you again

436
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:20,250
if we need anything later.

437
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:21,140
Okay.

438
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:21,490
Thank you.

439
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,490
Thanks.

440
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,090
Ms. Zhu,

441
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:34,140
come take a look at this.

442
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:36,250
She must have been copying this one.

443
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,290
I've noticed something.

444
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,770
All her paintings

445
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:02,660
have the initial "H".

446
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,090
It's likely her signature.

447
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,490
Only this one doesn't.

448
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,330
This painting

449
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,620
might not be hers.

450
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,420
Take all these back

451
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,180
for comparison.

452
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,660
Okay. I'll go call them.

453
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:25,730
Gao Yuan,

454
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,620
any findings?

455
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:27,460
Ms. Zhu,

456
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:29,180
we just discovered several

457
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:29,770
fingerprints.

458
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:30,770
Here's a hair strand.

459
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,220
We'll test them to see if they

460
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,090
belong to Hu Jie

461
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:33,810
or someone else.

462
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:35,220
Okay.

463
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:56,490
Gao Yuan,

464
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,860
look, there are bloodstains.

465
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:31,810
Ms. Zhu, we found something.

466
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:37,810
A large number of wiped bloodstains

467
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,180
were also found in the bathroom.

468
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:41,490
Could this be the

469
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:43,090
primary crime scene
where Hu Jie was killed?

470
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:52,330
Got it.

471
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,660
The Jane Doe is confirmed to be Hu Jie.

472
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:58,330
The crime scene is her home.

473
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,420
I've already requested to transfer

474
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:07,620
the materials from

475
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,050
the Fan Jiangxue case to our department.

476
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,980
According to what Xiaoxi has found,

477
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:11,860
Hu Jie

478
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:12,940
is now

479
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,810
a professional painter.

480
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,460
I'll ask the Director

481
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:16,940
to help search for

482
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:19,530
any paintings

483
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:20,730
Fan Jiangxue did back then.

484
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:22,380
We can bring them for comparison

485
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,940
to see if there are new clues

486
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,290
to help us find

487
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,290
the missing painting.

488
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:53,380
Han Feng,

489
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,250
have we identified the killer

490
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:57,860
of Li Yiqi?

491
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,090
Wan is on it.

492
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:04,050
The killer is related to
the "Diamond" case.

493
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:05,940
We are police officers;

494
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:06,770
we need evidence.

495
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,420
In the Jiangxue case,

496
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,860
the hair strand without

497
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,220
a follicle found back then is

498
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:25,980
called the hair shaft.

499
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:27,490
The follicle

500
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:28,940
contains nuclear DNA,

501
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,900
but the hair shaft does not.

502
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:32,770
So that strand of hair

503
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,490
wasn't much help in solving

504
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,460
the case.

505
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,140
After Fan Jiangxue was killed,

506
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:40,660
Hu Jie left Lijia Town

507
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,330
and went abroad.

508
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:43,770
Fourteen years later, Hu Jie returned,

509
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,620
and within a few months she was killed.

510
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:47,660
The perpetrator's method

511
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:49,050
is consistent with the method

512
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:50,220
used to kill Fan Jiangxue.

513
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:52,090
Can we infer

514
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:53,660
the perpetrator might
be the same person?

515
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,290
Another connection is

516
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,380
these paintings.

517
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,050
This one was found at Hu Jie's home.

518
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:03,980
This one

519
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,140
was found in Fan Jiangxue's

520
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:05,730
file.

521
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,530
They both depict

522
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:07,050
the same place.

523
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,420
Ten years apart, not much

524
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,290
difference.

525
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,050
This painting,

526
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:14,140
although also left

527
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,250
at Hu Jie's home,

528
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:16,010
doesn't

529
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,660
have Hu Jie's signature.

530
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:18,980
And this one's

531
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,530
paper is obviously yellowed.

532
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:21,730
It should be an old painting.

533
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:22,900
Could it possibly be the

534
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,860
one missing from the scene?

535
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:26,090
This requires further appraisal

536
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:26,810
to know.

537
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:28,490
Currently, we only know

538
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,050
that besides

539
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,220
Fan Jiangxue's

540
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,570
and Hu Jie's fingerprints, it also

541
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,090
bears someone else's prints.

542
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:35,730
Su,

543
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:37,250
find a professional appraiser

544
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:38,140
to determine

545
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,010
whether this painting
was done by Hu Jie

546
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:40,810
or Fan Jiangxue,

547
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:41,730
or by a third person.

548
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:43,730
Perhaps solving this mystery

549
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:44,940
can help us find

550
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:45,900
the truth behind

551
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:46,860
Fan Jiangxue's murder.

552
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:48,180
Okay, I'll handle it later.

553
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:49,900
Oh, Gao Yuan, have

554
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,090
you got the fingerprint match results

555
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:52,900
from Hu Jie's?

556
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,090
We didn't find

557
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:54,900
a suitable match in the

558
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,620
fingerprint database.

559
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:57,180
We're still investigating

560
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,530
who Hu Jie went to meet before

561
00:26:58,550 --> 00:26:59,090
her death.

562
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:00,180
Now we can only judge,

563
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,530
based on the food residue like beef

564
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:02,530
steak in her stomach,

565
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,220
that she likely

566
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,380
dined at a Western restaurant.

567
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:05,530
Alright, Ms. Zhu.

568
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:06,980
You continue investigating Hu Jie.

569
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:08,620
We'll look

570
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,700
into the paintings.

571
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,900
Xiaoxi, keep checking the footage.

572
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:12,530
Okay.

573
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,180
These three paintings

574
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,620
were from three different people.

575
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:20,380
These two were

576
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,380
also not from the same person?

577
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,530
Because the unsigned painting

578
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,940
used a fountain pen nib

579
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,220
with a reverse oblique cut,

580
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:28,090
while Fan Jiangxue's painting

581
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,420
used a standard nib.

582
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,330
Reverse oblique nibs

583
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,140
are generally

584
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:34,420
for left-handed writers.

585
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,220
Fan Jiangxue's painting

586
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:37,900
used right-handed techniques.

587
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:39,530
You mean

588
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,730
the unsigned painting

589
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:42,770
was painted by some

590
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,290
left-handed person?

591
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,380
Yes, exactly.

592
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,380
Also,

593
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:49,490
Fan Jiangxue's painting skills
were relatively immature,

594
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,330
with a big gap compared to the painting

595
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,620
signed by Hu Jie.

596
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:56,090
Is it possible

597
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,250
the unsigned one was

598
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:58,380
also painted by Hu Jie?

599
00:27:58,590 --> 00:27:59,460
I'm not sure.

600
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,730
But both Hu Jie's paintings

601
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,490
and the unsigned one

602
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:05,140
were painted using a reverse

603
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:05,770
oblique nib.

604
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:07,700
However, in terms of skill level,

605
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,290
there's a clear gap between the two.

606
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:11,660
Judging by painting technique,

607
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:13,330
they are clearly not

608
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,010
painted by the same person either.

609
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:16,660
Instead,

610
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,810
Hu Jie's paintings

611
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,570
seem to be imitations

612
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:23,380
of this unsigned painting.

613
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,010
Okay, thank you.

614
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:28,620
I'll consult you again if needed.

615
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:29,660
Alright.

616
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,730
I'll take my leave now.

617
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:35,980
What do you think?

618
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:37,900
Mr. Li only mentioned

619
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,570
that Fan Jiangxue and Hu Jie

620
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,660
used to meet often

621
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:42,770
to paint on the mountain.

622
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:44,090
But he didn't mention

623
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:45,460
the existence of a third person.

624
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:46,860
So,

625
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:48,770
that third person

626
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,220
must have only stayed

627
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,420
briefly in Lijia Town.

628
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:52,860
The locals

629
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:54,420
didn't know of his existence.

630
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,420
These three must know each other,

631
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,220
and they met up

632
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,570
to paint the same landscape.

633
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,140
The fingerprint on this painting

634
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:04,570
must have

635
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:05,700
been left by the third person.

636
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,140
He waited for Hu Jie to
return to the country

637
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,290
and then killed her

638
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:10,940
using the same method.

639
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,460
I don't think it's like that.

640
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,810
The weapon in both cases
was a fountain pen,

641
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:17,220
but

642
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:19,050
the perpetrator's methods
actually differed.

643
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:19,940
Look,

644
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,290
this is Hu Jie's wound.

645
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:24,490
When the killer murdered Hu Jie,

646
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,250
it was clean and precise.

647
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:27,220
The pen tip

648
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,250
accurately pierced the carotid artery

649
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:31,050
without the slightest deviation.

650
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,940
Now look at Fan Jiangxue's wound.

651
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:34,700
This location

652
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:37,620
is between the throat
and the carotid artery.

653
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,980
And judging from the wound,

654
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,330
it doesn't look

655
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:43,490
like a direct pierce into the artery,

656
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:44,660
more like

657
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:46,220
a scratch.

658
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,330
The killer targeted

659
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,980
the carotid artery in both murders.

660
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,570
Fourteen years later,

661
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,290
the second killing was

662
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:55,810
quicker and more precise than the first.

663
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:14,940
Mr. Han,

664
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:16,420
Mr. Qi,

665
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:17,810
the hair from Fan Jiangxue's scene

666
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,090
doesn't match Hu Jie's.

667
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:32,460
Correct.

668
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:34,420
Last Friday night,

669
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:35,250
this lady

670
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,570
did come to our restaurant

671
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:37,050
for dinner.

672
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,660
They sat at that table upstairs

673
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:40,860
by the window.

674
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:42,980
Why do you remember

675
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:43,570
so clearly?

676
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,660
Because she had

677
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,810
a big argument with her friend.

678
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,010
This lady

679
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:49,620
even threw a drink at her friend,

680
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:50,700
causing quite

681
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,010
a commotion in the restaurant.

682
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:53,220
Do you remember

683
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,330
what the person she argued with

684
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:55,290
looked like?

685
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:57,660
It was a man.

686
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:58,700
He wore a suit

687
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,530
and looked quite refined.

688
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:06,380
Can your surveillance cameras

689
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:07,730
capture that area?

690
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:08,570
Yes.

691
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:10,530
Pull it up for me.

692
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:10,940
Follow me.

693
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:15,700
Can you fast-forward?

694
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,090
Alright.

695
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,290
Play from here.

696
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:28,570
They were arguing so fiercely.

697
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,330
Did anyone here hear

698
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:32,530
what they were arguing about?

699
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,980
Not sure.

700
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,420
I wasn't here at the time.

701
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:38,940
Can you help me

702
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,330
copy this video footage?

703
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:41,330
Sure.

704
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:42,490
Thank you.

705
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:43,530
Wang.

706
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:44,220
On it.

707
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:53,810
Hello, Mr. Han.

708
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,490
We've found a suspect.

709
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,050
We've traced this guy named Ruan Mingyu.

710
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,770
He's Hu Jie's domestic art agent

711
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,180
who sells her paintings.

712
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:06,570
This

713
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:08,330
is his studio.

714
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,570
Hello, who are you?

715
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:38,700
Hu Jie...

716
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,180
she's really dead?

717
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:01,620
So,

718
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:03,490
the killer is left-handed.

719
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:04,460
Correct.

720
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:05,490
That was

721
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:06,980
our judgment back then.

722
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:13,770
We just had

723
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:14,900
dinner a few days ago.

724
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:15,620
I never thought...

725
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:19,530
How did she die?

726
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:21,290
After dinner,

727
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,330
where did you go?

728
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,380
After dinner,

729
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:25,730
I came back here.

730
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:27,570
This is my studio;

731
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:28,810
I usually live here too.

732
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,010
Can you tell us

733
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:37,330
about the situation

734
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:38,700
at dinner that day?

735
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:44,810
We parted

736
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,490
on bad terms that day.

737
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:48,010
A buyer

738
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,730
took a liking to a painting

739
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:50,770
she did many years ago.

740
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:53,140
I had negotiated the price for her,

741
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:55,010
but she kept putting it off,

742
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:56,220
refusing to give it to me.

743
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,570
I finally managed

744
00:33:57,590 --> 00:33:58,420
to meet her that day,

745
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,620
hoping to get the painting from her.

746
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:02,570
But she regretted it again.

747
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,180
Because of this,

748
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:06,050
we had a small disagreement.

749
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:07,770
Are you sure

750
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,820
it was just a small disagreement?

751
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:20,780
We did have

752
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:22,090
quite an intense argument.

753
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:23,380
Actually, it wasn't

754
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,900
the first time Hu Jie went crazy.

755
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,650
She was always

756
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:28,090
a very emotional person.

757
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,530
Sometimes she would shut herself

758
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:31,420
away for no reason,

759
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,170
not talking to anyone for a long time.

760
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,170
Sometimes she was overly excited,

761
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:36,570
painting for several days

762
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:37,740
without eating or sleeping.

763
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:39,340
In short,

764
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,610
she was

765
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:42,210
quite capricious.

766
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:43,900
Are these all

767
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:44,900
Hu Jie's paintings?

768
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:46,980
Not all.

769
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,490
Some belong to others.

770
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:50,460
Before their paintings are sold,

771
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,860
they are displayed here.

772
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,860
You can think of this place

773
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:56,210
as a display room.

774
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,860
Can we look around?

775
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:01,010
Please.

776
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:26,610
By the way,

777
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:28,170
do you know this person?

778
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,420
No.

779
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:33,690
Have you been to Lijia Town?

780
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:35,820
Where?

781
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,490
Lijia Town.

782
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,170
This painting is priceless.

783
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:13,380
Every decision I make is
for your own good.

784
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,380
Can we not talk about this?

785
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,340
It's really annoying!

786
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,820
Are you crazy?

787
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:17,900
The hair sample collected from

788
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,050
Hu Jie's home matches
that of Ruan Mingyu.

789
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:21,380
Let's not waste time here.

790
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:22,210
Hu Jie's death

791
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,610
has nothing to do with me.

792
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:25,210
Song Weimin's sister
came to claim the body.

793
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,340
When I sorted through

794
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,340
his things the other day,

795
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,900
I found he had left behind
a lot of drugs.

796
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,690
This contest has been stopped for years.

797
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:31,940
This is Hu Jie's Silver Award.

798
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:32,690
Gold Award.

799
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:33,940
Chen Chuchuan...

800
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,690
What does he have to do with

801
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:36,460
the Raw Diamond case?

802
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:37,340
We are just one step

803
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:39,090
away from the truth.

804
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:39,900
Han Feng!

805
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,460
You must stop here.
