00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:23,860
[Episode 15]

2
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,780
Lijia Town.

3
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,500
Going where?

4
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:49,380
Why'd you arrest me?

5
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:50,410
Let go!

6
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,260
Go on, run!

7
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,850
(Maybe a third person.)

8
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,540
And...

9
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:07,660
this person

10
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,010
is connected to Li Yiqi's death.

11
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,130
Maybe he's the one

12
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,130
we're looking for.

13
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,340
Here's

14
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,340
Wang Chen's blood report.

15
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:15,820
It shows an anesthetic.

16
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,780
Perhaps Wang Chen was unconscious

17
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,540
before falling into the lake?

18
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,060
Only two guys in the car.

19
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,980
Song Weimin was dead.

20
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,660
Wang Chen was unconscious? How?

21
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:28,980
A third person.

22
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,540
(Song Weimin killed Wang Chen)

23
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,780
(for his daughters.)

24
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,100
(Then how does the killer)

25
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,410
(link to Wang Chen?)

26
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,220
(Li Yiqi)

27
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,610
(was killed after 1 AM.)

28
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,140
(Judging from the cars movement,)

29
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,900
(the killer went to)

30
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,250
(see Wang Chen later.)

31
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:54,300
(Nothing nearby was open.)

32
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,220
(Where did they meet?)

33
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:01,570
Zhang Chunmin.

34
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,220
You've seen

35
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,100
the other places

36
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:06,780
Wang Chen rented.

37
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:07,730
This is the last one.

38
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,780
It's quite tidy.

39
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:10,820
Thank you.

40
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,410
Sure thing.

41
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,050
Zhang.

42
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,020
Is that house vacant now?

43
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:20,660
A few days ago, two men

44
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,020
had a nasty argument.

45
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,250
Did they move out?

46
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,290
How about renting it

47
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,220
to my friend

48
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,250
at a discount?

49
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,410
No problem.

50
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,050
Thanks.

51
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:29,580
My pleasure.

52
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,340
Excuse me.

53
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,050
You said

54
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,610
you saw those two men?

55
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,020
I saw them

56
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,780
go inside.

57
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:41,580
That night,

58
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,610
I got up to use the bathroom

59
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:46,050
and heard noise outside the door.

60
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,410
What a mess!

61
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,220
You've gotten me into trouble!

62
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,490
Take a look.

63
00:04:59,160 --> 00:04:59,980
Is it him?

64
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,730
Uh...

65
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,730
Not sure.

66
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:08,930
And this tattoo?

67
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,020
Remember it?

68
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:11,610
Yes.

69
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,100
It's him.

70
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,610
I remember thinking

71
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,370
he couldn't be a good guy.

72
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:19,050
You said

73
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,540
they were arguing.

74
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,540
Could you

75
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,050
make out what they said?

76
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:29,220
I only saw them go in together.

77
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,780
Then...

78
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,930
after a little while,

79
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:34,140
I heard a loud door slam

80
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:35,850
and footsteps leaving.

81
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,340
Thanks.

82
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,140
Zhang.

83
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:42,580
Don't forget

84
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:43,490
my house.

85
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:44,220
Sure.

86
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,290
Hello?

87
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,220
Mr. Qi,

88
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,580
we found something.

89
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:50,660
Need a match.

90
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:51,370
Okay.

91
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:52,410
On my way.

92
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,020
Ms. Zhu.

93
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,100
Are the hair sample results

94
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,050
for Fan Jiangxue back?

95
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,610
Still processing.

96
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:23,810
How much longer?

97
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:25,020
Soon.

98
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:28,410
Ms. Zhu,

99
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,700
the hair from Hu Jie's home

100
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:32,850
is a match

101
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:33,700
for Ruan Mingyu.

102
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:38,460
Once ready,

103
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,050
call me.

104
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:39,850
Okay.

105
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:47,050
Mr. Han,

106
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:48,490
the match

107
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,410
is back.

108
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,700
It's Ruan Mingyu's.

109
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,730
The print match

110
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,730
will take a bit.

111
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,900
Let's begin first.

112
00:06:58,430 --> 00:06:59,460
You and Hu Jie

113
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,050
had an argue at the restaurant.

114
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:04,580
She left first,

115
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:05,410
then you left.

116
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,250
Surveillance shows

117
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,140
you left

118
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,730
at 7:36 PM.

119
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,810
Hu Jie died

120
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,140
between 9 PM and 11 PM.

121
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,460
We've confirmed

122
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,250
that her home is the primary scene.

123
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:18,930
We found

124
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,900
your hair, fingerprints,
and skin cells there.

125
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:23,370
We're friends.

126
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,100
I often visited her.

127
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,980
Finding my traces there

128
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:27,900
isn't weird.

129
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,100
Besides,

130
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,100
a piece of advice.

131
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,610
Use your brain

132
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:34,540
when working a case.

133
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,850
How would I kill her?

134
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,580
I sell her paintings.

135
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:41,410
You didn't kill Hu Jie.

136
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:42,610
Why did you run?

137
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,340
Though from different angles,

138
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:54,900
these two are of the same place.

139
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,340
14 years ago, you went to Lijia Town?

140
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,050
Are you linked

141
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,020
to Fan Jiangxue's death?

142
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,220
What really happened to Hu Jie?

143
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:37,940
Mr. Qi,

144
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:39,490
the results are in.

145
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,370
The prints on the painting

146
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,730
don't match

147
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,460
Ruan's.

148
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:50,180
I see.

149
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,180
Mr. Qi, the results are ready.

150
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:06,340
You will catch the killer.

151
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:08,250
Right?

152
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:10,820
Tell us

153
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,530
everything you know.

154
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:22,300
After parting with
Hu Jie at the restaurant,

155
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,820
I did go to her place.

156
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,130
It was for this painting.

157
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,220
But I truly meant to help her.

158
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:32,010
That was her last chance.

159
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:41,650
Jie.

160
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:44,250
Last night,

161
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,490
the buyer called me again.

162
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,220
It's been over a month.

163
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:49,850
When will you deliver

164
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:50,530
the painting?

165
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,340
I finally get out for a meal.

166
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:55,700
Can we not talk about

167
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,820
such a downer?

168
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,820
I don't want to ruin the mood.

169
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,250
But...

170
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:02,820
No sales for quite a while.

171
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:04,340
Now

172
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,340
someone finally wants your work.

173
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,370
You should know

174
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,100
you need the money.

175
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:11,850
If something

176
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:12,770
bothers you,

177
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,010
tell me, and I'll sort it out.

178
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:18,580
I've told you many times.

179
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:19,980
This painting

180
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,100
is priceless.

181
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:25,980
Then tell me

182
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,490
how you plan to repay

183
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:29,370
your debts abroad?

184
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:31,460
Can we please drop this?

185
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:42,610
Jie.

186
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:44,820
I'm your agent.

187
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,060
We've worked together for years.

188
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,460
You know

189
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,820
what I care about

190
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,890
isn't my commission.

191
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:52,130
Every decision I make

192
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:53,060
is for your good.

193
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,130
Can we stop?

194
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,220
It's really annoying.

195
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:55,940
I know

196
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,220
this was created years ago.

197
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:57,940
It's not

198
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,700
your style now.

199
00:10:58,790 --> 00:10:59,610
You don't wanna sell it.

200
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:00,940
But now someone finally

201
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,820
wants your work

202
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,250
and is offering a high price.

203
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:04,340
You have to

204
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,180
face reality.

205
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:05,890
Understand?

206
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:11,460
Are you crazy?

207
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:13,890
Let me go!

208
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:15,490
At my place,

209
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:16,460
I told you

210
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,850
Hu Jie lacked emotional stability.

211
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:20,530
She really

212
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:21,580
made me extremely angry.

213
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,890
But after I cooled down,

214
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:25,700
I got worried about her.

215
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:26,980
I called her,

216
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,580
but she didn't answer.

217
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,650
So I went to

218
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:32,100
her place

219
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,580
to see

220
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,250
if she was fine.

221
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,420
Of course,

222
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,340
I really wanted to know

223
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,060
what was wrong with the painting.

224
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:42,850
When did you

225
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:43,940
go to Hu Jie's place?

226
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:45,890
Around 11 PM.

227
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,340
I had alcohol,

228
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,180
so I took a cab.

229
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,650
You can check

230
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:51,250
ride history.

231
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:56,940
How did you get in?

232
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:00,420
Hu Jie was abroad then.

233
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:02,700
I helped her

234
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:04,370
buy that apartment.

235
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,220
So I have a spare key.

236
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:08,730
What did you do inside?

237
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:11,770
I entered without asking.

238
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,060
And I didn't want her to know

239
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,060
I had a spare key.

240
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:15,580
So...

241
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,460
I was nervous.

242
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:18,850
I left lights off.

243
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:22,010
I wanted to see

244
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:23,100
if the painting

245
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:24,610
was there.

246
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,530
That's when it hit me.

247
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:51,890
She had stained the painting

248
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:53,730
and couldn't hand it over.

249
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:55,890
She wanted to repaint it

250
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:56,730
but failed.

251
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,340
So she kept delaying it.

252
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:06,340
Ruan Mingyu's prints

253
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,180
don't match the ones

254
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,420
from the unsigned painting.

255
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,340
And the hair match?

256
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,610
Not from

257
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:14,890
the same maternal lineage.

258
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:18,460
Mr. Han.

259
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:21,650
I just asked the security

260
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,340
at Ruan Mingyu's place.

261
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,460
His story checks out.

262
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,770
He came home after nine

263
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,250
and left after 11.

264
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:28,890
His ride history supports this.

265
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:38,370
Hey, Su.

266
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,060
Got it.

267
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,180
Song Weimin's sister

268
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:46,220
is here.

269
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,580
I'll go.

270
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,180
Go ahead.

271
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,370
Stop wasting time.

272
00:13:58,390 --> 00:13:59,530
Please believe me.

273
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:01,060
Hu Jie's death

274
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:02,940
has nothing to do with me.

275
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,220
Then tell us

276
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:06,460
your relationship with her.

277
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,730
Hu Jie and I

278
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,250
met at a university

279
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,650
art competition.

280
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:21,490
She's pretty

281
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:23,730
and talented.

282
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,980
I was deeply drawn to her.

283
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:29,370
That summer,

284
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,730
I secretly went to
Lijia Town to see her.

285
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,300
What are you shooting?

286
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,250
It's you. See.

287
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:04,220
Delete it.

288
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:06,300
Delete it!

289
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,420
Hurry!

290
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,700
You... Delete it now!

291
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:11,490
Alright.

292
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:14,580
I was very curious

293
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:16,980
and asked her

294
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,100
what she threw.

295
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:18,940
She didn't tell me.

296
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:20,980
She reacted very intensely

297
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,890
and insisted

298
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:24,220
I delete the photo.

299
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:26,610
Did you see what she threw?

300
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,180
No.

301
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:32,010
But people in town said

302
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,180
someone died in the hills that day.

303
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:37,180
Killed by a pen

304
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,340
to the neck.

305
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:40,980
Given Hu Jie's reaction

306
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:42,770
to the photo...

307
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:46,530
I thought

308
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:48,730
it might

309
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:49,700
be connected to Hu Jie.

310
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:52,180
What she threw into the lake

311
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:54,300
might be

312
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,420
that pen.

313
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:59,100
Why didn't you call the police?

314
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:00,580
I love her.

315
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,100
She's the one

316
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:07,610
I wanna protect.

317
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:10,770
So many times I've dreamed...

318
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,130
this secret

319
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:16,770
was mine alone.

320
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,250
If I kept

321
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,220
this secret,

322
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:20,730
would she

323
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,940
be with me forever?

324
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,890
So you deleted it?

325
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:29,010
No.

326
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,180
The photo is on my computer.

327
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:36,460
You can check.

328
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,220
But even so,

329
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,060
Hu Jie didn't want

330
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:41,820
to be with me.

331
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,060
Because back then,

332
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:47,530
she loved someone else.

333
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:49,770
Do you know him?

334
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:51,180
No.

335
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:52,820
I don't know him.

336
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,060
I only know

337
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:56,650
she met him

338
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:57,770
at a competition

339
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:59,420
in Jiang City.

340
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:03,100
She won the Silver Award.

341
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:06,220
That guy won the gold.

342
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:08,860
She took the one she liked

343
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,730
to Lijia Town.

344
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:11,730
But he

345
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:12,660
fell in love

346
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,940
with her friend, Fan Jiangxue.

347
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,050
I knew Hu Jie well.

348
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:17,050
She couldn't handle it.

349
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:20,460
So I went to Lijia Town

350
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,010
to comfort her.

351
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:25,940
I failed to protect her.

352
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:28,770
That's why everything happened.

353
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,700
Yes.

354
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,290
It's Weimin.

355
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:13,940
Sir,

356
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,220
who killed

357
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,570
my brother?

358
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,380
We're still investigating.

359
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:21,420
He and I

360
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,980
hadn't seen each other for years.

361
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,810
Last month, I visited him.

362
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:28,090
He wasn't

363
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:30,530
doing well mentally then.

364
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,570
Kind of strange.

365
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:40,330
Weimin.

366
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:42,810
Weimin?

367
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:45,570
Weimin?

368
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:47,290
Weimin?

369
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:50,860
You...

370
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:53,010
What are you looking at?

371
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:55,660
You're here.

372
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,940
Who are you smiling at?

373
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,290
What happened next

374
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:07,530
was even stranger.

375
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:10,940
Come on.

376
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:11,810
Qian,

377
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:12,940
eat it.

378
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:16,980
Weimin,

379
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,050
Qian is gone.

380
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:21,010
Please live your life well.

381
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,330
Pull yourself together!

382
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,530
Qian is always by my side.

383
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,810
I tried to talk to him,

384
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,860
but he snapped at me.

385
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,460
We ended up having a big fight.

386
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,570
I never expected

387
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,220
that would be

388
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,660
our last meeting.

389
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,140
I thought he became like this

390
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:48,770
because of Qian.

391
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,380
But when I

392
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,980
was packing his things,

393
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,090
I found his medication.

394
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:58,620
Can you

395
00:19:58,960 --> 00:19:59,860
bring them over?

396
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:02,010
This is the photo

397
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:02,730
Ruan mentioned.

398
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:03,810
It's been a while.

399
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,180
This is the best resolution.

400
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,250
That's it.

401
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:12,380
Mr. Han, Ms. Zhu,

402
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:13,770
I found the info

403
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,010
on the art competition

404
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:15,810
Ruan mentioned.

405
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:16,810
Portfolio.

406
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:17,810
Registration.

407
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:19,570
It hasn't

408
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:20,530
been held for years.

409
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:21,730
Oh,

410
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,810
this is Hu Jie's Silver Award.

411
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:25,810
Gold Award.

412
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,180
Did you get the file on the guy

413
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:30,730
who won gold?

414
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:31,570
Yes.

415
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,460
Right, it's him.

416
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:35,980
Chen Chuchuan?

417
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:40,860
Chen Chuchuan?

418
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,620
He's a friend of Qi Sizhe

419
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,700
from the university.

420
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:18,140
He wasn't

421
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:20,460
doing well mentally then.

422
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:22,420
Kind of strange.

423
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:38,980
Maggie.

424
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,530
Mr. Qi,

425
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,620
why are you here?

426
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:44,380
Is Dr. Chen not in?

427
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,530
I haven't

428
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:46,620
seen him for days.

429
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,380
He just told me to pack up.

430
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:15,460
Hello.

431
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:17,900
Police.

432
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:20,010
We need your cooperation.

433
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:21,980
Fine.

434
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,730
Is Chen Chuchuan here?

435
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:26,050
No.

436
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:26,770
No?

437
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:28,940
Last time you saw him?

438
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,620
What are you doing here?

439
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,460
Chen Chuchuan is the prime suspect

440
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,380
in Hu Jie's case.

441
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,010
He's also linked

442
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:09,250
to Fan Jiangxue's case.

443
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,460
Why look for him?

444
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:15,220
Among Song Weimin's belongings,

445
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:17,490
I found a medicine bag from this clinic.

446
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:19,700
I ran a composition analysis

447
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,330
on the drugs from the bag

448
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:22,530
and Li Shuting's case.

449
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:25,770
They matched.

450
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:30,940
Chen Chuchuan is linked to the new drug?

451
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:35,250
Li Ming is related to Raw Diamond.

452
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:37,090
Chen Chuchuan is linked to the new drug.

453
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,810
One is your senior.

454
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:40,180
The other is your junior.

455
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:41,380
How else

456
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,050
are they linked?

457
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,730
How's Chen Chuchuan linked

458
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:44,490
to Raw Diamond?

459
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:45,810
You said

460
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:47,010
the person you saw in the fire

461
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:47,770
wasn't Li Ming.

462
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:50,250
It was Chen Chuchuan?

463
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:55,900
Tell me.

464
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:59,050
I have nothing to tell you.

465
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,860
Regardless of if it's Chen Chuchuan,

466
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:02,090
we need evidence.

467
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,900
Back off the case.

468
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:08,460
I'll let you know when I find something.

469
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,380
Han Feng!

470
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:13,530
I have to investigate

471
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:14,180
this case.

472
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:16,380
I also need the truth.

473
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:18,050
Your ties to him...

474
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,220
Stay out of it.

475
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,420
What are you worried about?

476
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,490
Worried I'll lose control again?

477
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,220
Or worried

478
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,140
that I'd help Chen Chuchuan?

479
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,220
Han Feng,

480
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,660
we're so close

481
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,420
to the truth.

482
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:44,460
Mr. Han.

483
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:46,090
We're all set for

484
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:47,250
Chen Chuchuan's arrest.

485
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:52,290
Ms. Zhu.

486
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,140
Mr. Qi,

487
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,220
we already know about the drugs.

488
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,620
Please keep investigating.

489
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:14,980
Hi.

490
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,700
Please show me

491
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,770
your driving license.

492
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:17,770
Any lead?

493
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:18,730
No.

494
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:19,770
Keep at it.

495
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:20,660
Yes.

496
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:23,860
Haven't seen him.

497
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:24,860
Sorry.

498
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:26,490
Wan.

499
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:27,570
No.

500
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:38,730
Hello, sir.

501
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,330
Hi.

502
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,730
Have you seen

503
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:41,860
this guy?

504
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:45,900
No.

505
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:46,810
Doesn't ring a bell.

506
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,530
Could we check

507
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,570
your surveillance?

508
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:50,010
Sure.

509
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:50,940
Come in, please.

510
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:52,530
I swear.

511
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:53,290
I...

512
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:55,570
I really know nothing.

513
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:58,180
I didn't do anything, I...

514
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,220
We checked the surveillance

515
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,730
near Chen Chuchuan's clinic.

516
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:10,940
His car

517
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,940
was last seen

518
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,660
on the night of Hu Jie's death.

519
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:15,460
After that, it vanished.

520
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,770
He and his car

521
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:17,730
just vanished

522
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:18,620
without a trace.

523
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:20,140
We set up checkpoints

524
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,180
around the clinic,

525
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:23,660
but found nothing.

526
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:25,330
No sign of the tattooed man.

527
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:27,330
Nearby shops all claim

528
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:29,090
they haven't seen Chen Chuchuan.

529
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,180
So now,

530
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,700
we're not just at a dead end.

531
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:34,620
We're making zero progress.

532
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:37,490
Mr. Qi.

533
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:39,900
The medication from Song Weimin

534
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:42,180
has all been tested.

535
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,490
It's all clear.

536
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:46,700
Song Weimin's tox screen

537
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:48,420
was repeated.

538
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:50,250
Same as before.

539
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,490
No drug traces

540
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:54,660
left for comparison.

541
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,730
The receptionist Maggie

542
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,420
said she hasn't

543
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,220
seen this new drug.

544
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,570
We got nothing out of her.

545
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:03,010
But it's confirmed

546
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:04,940
the packaging

547
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,490
is from their clinic.

548
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,090
Maggie also said

549
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:09,620
Chen Chuchuan met Hu Jie.

550
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,900
When he saw Hu Jie,

551
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:12,860
his face turned pale,

552
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:15,330
and he had Maggie leave immediately.

553
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:16,900
Then,

554
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,380
they two went into his office.

555
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:19,530
No idea

556
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:20,290
what was said.

557
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,490
No way.

558
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:22,810
I didn't see him

559
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:23,810
on the nearby footage.

560
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,940
That was a month ago.

561
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:27,250
It's been deleted.

562
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,730
Why did Hu Jie

563
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:30,250
go see Chen Chuchuan?

564
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:34,140
If we don't find Chen Chuchuan,

565
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:35,420
we can't confirm

566
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:37,090
if the prints on that old painting

567
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:37,980
are his.

568
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,330
Well, keep searching.

569
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:18,220
Coming.

570
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,380
You really

571
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,810
don't know

572
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:54,140
how Fan Jiangxue died?

573
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:56,250
Where were you from 9 PM to 11 PM

574
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:56,940
on October 13th?

575
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:57,570
At the clinic.

576
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,620
To clean up

577
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,570
the scene that fast,

578
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:01,620
the killer must have used

579
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,290
bleach or cleaner.

580
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:04,810
The water was cut off here

581
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:05,660
that night.

582
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:07,140
Someone can vouch for me.

583
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:07,570
Who?

584
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:08,810
Qi Sizhe.

585
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,620
The clinic

586
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,180
was thoroughly checked with luminol.

587
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:13,530
No blood.

588
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,250
Chen,

589
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:15,420
are you really

590
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,460
hiding nothing from me?

591
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:17,660
I need an answer too.

592
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,380
I need the truth.

593
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:18,940
Understand?

594
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:19,810
Chen Chuchuan,

595
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:20,980
Song Weimin's medication

596
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,180
came from you.
