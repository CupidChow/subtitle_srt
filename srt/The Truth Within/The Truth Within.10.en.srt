1
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:28,210
Mr. Qi,

2
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,530
looking for something?

3
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:39,410
Why isn't this cabinet locked?

4
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:43,180
That one was broken long ago.

5
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:44,050
It wouldn't close.

6
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,090
So we didn't use it.

7
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:41,780
So Ding Youmei

8
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,100
is Gao Huilan's daughter.

9
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:44,130
You see,

10
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,540
the photo in uniform is of Liu Yuanyuan.

11
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,690
And Ding Youmei has a mole
between her eyebrows.

12
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,730
The two

13
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,260
look identical,

14
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,570
except for that mole.

15
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,570
Could one have had

16
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:55,890
cosmetic surgery after growing up?

17
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,410
I suspect an exam proxy.

18
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:02,260
Exam proxy?

19
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:03,100
Yes.

20
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,410
Are you saying Liu Yuanyuan was

21
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:06,570
Ding Youmei's exam proxy?

22
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:07,500
Yes.

23
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,410
Wan and I checked on Ding Youmei.

24
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,380
Ding Youmei's grades had been

25
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:13,540
among the lowest.

26
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,980
But she scored exceptionally high

27
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,060
on that year's TOEFL

28
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,730
and went to study abroad.

29
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,170
But Liu Yuanyuan,

30
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,410
who always performed well,

31
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:24,660
missed the exam
she was supposed to take.

32
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,010
There must be a reason

33
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,060
she missed the exam.

34
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,540
Could it be that

35
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,610
she took the TOEFL for Ding Youmei,

36
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,340
which affected her own exam?

37
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:34,940
The exam papers are

38
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,780
probably gone now.

39
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,410
Let's check if that exam

40
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:38,410
provides any other leads.

41
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,260
Okay.

42
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:44,100
Say Liu Yuanyuan had the evidence

43
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,100
of Gao Huilan and her daughter's

44
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,260
exam proxy back then,

45
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,850
and kept using it to threaten them

46
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:49,660
over the years.

47
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,540
And in the end,

48
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,260
having had enough of it,

49
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:53,220
they killed her.

50
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:55,260
But Liu Yuanyuan

51
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,980
was holding the knife at first.

52
00:03:58,590 --> 00:03:59,340
Maybe Liu Yuanyuan

53
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,340
wanted to kill her,

54
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:01,690
but got killed instead.

55
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,260
Xi, play the camera footage.

56
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,820
The footage shows

57
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,890
that Liu Yuanyuan

58
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,260
left Gao Huilan's lab

59
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,660
after staying for 15 minutes.

60
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,660
Any other angles?

61
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:17,730
No.

62
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:19,410
Only one camera in the new lab building.

63
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,410
Xi, rewind it.

64
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:25,170
Okay.

65
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,050
Play it again.

66
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,340
See?

67
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:35,850
A black plastic bag

68
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:36,660
in her hand now.

69
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,730
She went in without concealing herself.

70
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:44,490
But coming out,

71
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:46,050
she kept covering her face

72
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,340
on purpose.

73
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,170
Suspicious.

74
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,170
Ding Youmei works there.

75
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,250
She should know

76
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:53,410
the location of each camera

77
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,490
in the university.

78
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:55,540
The video's so dark.

79
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,340
How can we be sure that

80
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:58,410
the person in the video

81
00:04:58,510 --> 00:04:59,730
is Liu Yuanyuan?

82
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,540
Maybe Ding Youmei disguised

83
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,580
herself as Liu Yuanyuan.

84
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:04,730
If that's the case,

85
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,580
if this person was really

86
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,490
Ding Youmei in disguise,

87
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,170
then the thing in that

88
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:10,100
black plastic bag...

89
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,050
Found the record of Gao Huilan

90
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:20,980
paying Liu Yuanyuan.

91
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,490
No, wait.

92
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:23,170
I checked

93
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,460
Liu Yuanyuan's bank account.

94
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:25,580
Nothing unusual.

95
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:27,580
The bankbook is under

96
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:28,700
her mother's name.

97
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,370
Aside from

98
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:33,580
the recent transactions,

99
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:34,580
do you remember

100
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,170
the old bankbook

101
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,540
we found in her dorm room?

102
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,340
It was also under her mother's name.

103
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:39,490
It shows that

104
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:40,700
the earliest remittance

105
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,660
was eleven years ago.

106
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:45,930
Also, another key info.

107
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,490
That year,

108
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:48,850
the TOEFL and

109
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,050
the college entrance exam were

110
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:50,780
on the same day.

111
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,020
Eleven years ago,

112
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:54,100
when Liu Yuanyuan

113
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:54,930
missed her exam.

114
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:55,490
Yes.

115
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,610
Strangely, however,

116
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,930
Gao Huilan

117
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,410
also transferred a big sum

118
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:02,660
to a person named Luan Fang

119
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:04,290
besides Liu Yuanyuan.

120
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,170
I checked on Luan Fang.

121
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,810
She was Ding Youmei's classmate.

122
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:08,490
Also,

123
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,250
she and Ding Youmei were in the same

124
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,410
exam room back then.

125
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:12,930
Look into Luan Fang.

126
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:13,930
Okay.

127
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,220
Call in Gao Huilan and

128
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:15,980
Ding Huimei, too.

129
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,370
Okay, I'll go.

130
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,140
We already

131
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,490
talked to Luan Fang.

132
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:39,490
She said

133
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:41,780
she saw Ding Youmei back then.

134
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:43,460
Youmei?

135
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,490
Why are you here?

136
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:46,410
Aren't you taking the TOEFL?

137
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,490
Luan Fang recalled Ding Youmei saying

138
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:49,850
she'd take the TOEFL.

139
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,340
So she was surprised to see Ding Youmei

140
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,410
at the college

141
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,020
entrance exam that day.

142
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,730
The college entrance exam that year

143
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,700
and the TOEFL Ding Youmei took

144
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:00,580
were on the same day.

145
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:04,340
How could she

146
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,410
attend two different exams
at the same time?

147
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:09,660
You should know

148
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:12,220
the answer to this question.

149
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:16,930
Did Liu Yuanyuan

150
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:17,930
take the exam for you?

151
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,410
Yes.

152
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:23,850
But it was my mom's arrangement.

153
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:26,900
I was very young back then.

154
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,540
I'd do whatever she said.

155
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,410
That afternoon, six days ago,

156
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:37,810
did Liu Yuanyuan

157
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:39,220
go to the lab for you?

158
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:43,610
She did.

159
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:45,730
Yuan came to the lab for me.

160
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:47,980
Was Ding Youmei also there?

161
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:50,340
They had an argument.

162
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:52,020
What did they argue about?

163
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,850
Even if you don't tell,

164
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,140
we will figure it out.

165
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:02,290
Everything I did

166
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,050
was for

167
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:04,660
my daughter's future.

168
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:09,610
Because of what happened back then...

169
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:12,580
What happened back then?

170
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:17,810
Back then, I gave

171
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:18,780
Yuan's mother

172
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:20,020
free surgery

173
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:21,580
so she would take

174
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:22,730
the exam for Youmei.

175
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,660
I did save Yuan's mother's life.

176
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:27,780
But for these eleven years,

177
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,140
she kept threatening us

178
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,660
with this secret.

179
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:38,770
What about the remittance record?

180
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,650
They kept threatening us

181
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:42,700
with the exam proxy,

182
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,060
blackmailing us for money all the time.

183
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,730
So all these years,

184
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:47,610
your mother's been

185
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:48,650
sending Liu Yuanyuan money

186
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,370
because of the exam proxy.

187
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,370
That's why

188
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:53,100
you killed her,

189
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:54,370
swapped the body,

190
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:55,700
and ditched it.

191
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:59,010
She kept hurting us.

192
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,580
After Yuan's mother died,

193
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,340
she kept contacting me.

194
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,890
But I didn't reply.

195
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:07,940
So she came directly

196
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,130
to the lab for me.

197
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,700
Gao Huilan!

198
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,300
My mom's dead.

199
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,610
You killed her!

200
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,610
Your mom's dead?

201
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:25,250
How? What happened?

202
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,180
You know exactly

203
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,250
what happened.

204
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:28,700
It was your fault!

205
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:29,610
No.

206
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,100
Listen,

207
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,130
why would I harm your mother?

208
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:34,180
I would never do that.

209
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:35,530
You know what condition

210
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:36,770
your mom was in.

211
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,300
If I hadn't save her life with surgery

212
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:40,940
eleven years ago,

213
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,650
she'd have been long gone.

214
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,420
Yes.

215
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,490
You saved her life back then.

216
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,420
But also because of you,

217
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,100
my mom's dead now,

218
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,180
and my life is ruined.

219
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:54,980
It's your fault.

220
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:55,980
It's all your fault!

221
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:56,580
Yuan,

222
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:57,490
listen to me.

223
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:58,130
That's no way...

224
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,060
No way I'd harm your mother!

225
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,580
Stay away!

226
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,580
I'll kill you!

227
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,250
Calm down, Yuan.

228
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,130
I didn't kill your mother!

229
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,530
Calm down!

230
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:08,820
You killed her!

231
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:09,770
That day,

232
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:11,980
I heard my mom was

233
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,250
arguing with Liu Yuanyuan

234
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,130
in the lab.

235
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:16,770
So I ran over in a hurry.

236
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:18,890
When I opened the door,

237
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,610
Liu Yuanyuan charged at my mom

238
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,340
with a knife like crazy.

239
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:23,890
So I rushed over immediately!

240
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,010
Yuan!

241
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:25,850
Yuan!

242
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:26,730
Yuan!

243
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,700
Yuan!

244
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,420
You killed her!

245
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:29,980
Yuan,

246
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:30,980
listen to me now!

247
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,370
No...

248
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:32,250
Yuan!

249
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,980
Liu Yuanyuan! What are you doing?

250
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:56,700
I also fell later.

251
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:58,250
Right,

252
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,220
this bruise

253
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,490
is from when I fell.

254
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:11,940
And then?

255
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:14,940
Yuan's mother passed away.

256
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,060
She felt hurt.

257
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:17,850
I could understand.

258
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,130
For years,

259
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:21,650
she had been miserable

260
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,850
due to her mother's illness.

261
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,130
I can relate.

262
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:26,340
I understand everything Yuan did.

263
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:35,850
Yuan?

264
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:38,610
Yuan, it's fine.

265
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,370
Are you okay?

266
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,490
Though your mom's gone,

267
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,250
you still have me.

268
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:48,060
I'll help you.

269
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,610
You can start fresh now.

270
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,130
No one can help me!

271
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,420
No one can...

272
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,700
No one can help me...

273
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,730
Nobody can help me...

274
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,420
No one can help me...

275
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,250
No one can help me now...

276
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:38,850
It's fine.

277
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:40,530
Don't be afraid.

278
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:42,610
I'll help you.

279
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,650
I'll help you.

280
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:54,180
Later, she left after

281
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,010
crying for a while.

282
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,770
Why didn't you tell us

283
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:58,700
last time?

284
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:02,100
You asked me if I went

285
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:03,730
to the specimen room last time.

286
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,010
I didn't know Yuan's case

287
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:07,610
was related to the specimen room.

288
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,010
I've told you everything I know.

289
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,770
Since that day,

290
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:19,220
I have never seen

291
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:20,300
Liu Yuanyuan again.

292
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,610
If you don't believe me,

293
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:28,890
go check the camera footage.

294
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:30,700
See exactly when

295
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,700
Liu Yuanyuan leaves.

296
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,770
You're familiar with how surveillance

297
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:34,980
cameras work, right?

298
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,490
Officer,

299
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:39,100
I don't know what you mean

300
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:40,100
by that.

301
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,250
Is this person you in the photo?

302
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:53,420
It... It's not me.

303
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:55,250
That's Liu Yuanyuan.

304
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,940
I know we looked alike

305
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,300
when we were kids.

306
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,610
But I had cosmetic surgery
after growing up.

307
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,700
We don't look alike anymore.

308
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:10,490
Are you so sure

309
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,530
she is Liu Yuanyuan?

310
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,770
These clothes and the bag

311
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,530
are exactly the same as those

312
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,610
she had at the lab that day.

313
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,700
It's... It's really Liu Yuanyuan.

314
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:21,730
Did you ask Ding Youmei

315
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:23,650
to leave disguised as Liu Yuanyuan?

316
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,180
It all has to be based on evidence.

317
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,010
Do you have evidence?

318
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,100
Yes,

319
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:35,650
I asked Yuan to take the exam

320
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:36,730
for Youmei back then.

321
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:37,730
But I've been

322
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:39,100
regretting doing that.

323
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:40,370
It was a mistake.

324
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:42,650
But after Yuan left that day,

325
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,490
Youmei and I

326
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:44,980
stayed in the lab.

327
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,890
We only left at noon the next day.

328
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,300
Which body donor did Gao Huilan

329
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,490
borrow that day?

330
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,850
The register form shows No. 4.

331
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,490
Let me check her autopsy

332
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:30,220
record that day.

333
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:31,220
Okay.

334
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,250
An anatomy record.

335
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,730
Routine abdominal anatomy.

336
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:38,820
Demonstration of

337
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,370
rib fracture and lung lesion resection,

338
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,770
and observation of symptoms

339
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:42,820
of mitral valve prolapse.

340
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:43,980
Look.

341
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:49,250
Any problem?

342
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:51,580
Turn him over.

343
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,610
Other camera footage from the university

344
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,370
verified Gao Huilan's claims.

345
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:02,700
They did leave

346
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,850
the building the next day.

347
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:06,220
Only scenes of Gao Huilan and Wu Min

348
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,770
transporting body donors in between.

349
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,340
We don't have any evidence to prove

350
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:37,010
that Ding Youmei

351
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,250
and her mother are

352
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:39,700
related to Liu Yuanyuan's death.

353
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,100
We checked

354
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,010
every camera.

355
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:44,060
Liu Yuanyuan left the lab,

356
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:44,730
walked out

357
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,010
of the university.

358
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:47,820
And then disappeared?

359
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,370
We can't trace

360
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,580
her last whereabouts.

361
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,490
The surveillance cameras

362
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:54,530
in that area are all

363
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,340
from years ago.

364
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,370
The images are very blurry.

365
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:58,650
We can't distinguish

366
00:16:58,670 --> 00:16:59,700
whether it's Liu Yuanyuan

367
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,700
or Ding Youmei.

368
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,220
We must find

369
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,100
more evidence.

370
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:06,420
Liu Yuanyuan bought bleach,

371
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,860
gloves, and black plastic bags

372
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,770
at the nearby grocery store.

373
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:10,730
And also a knife.

374
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:13,420
Back then, I gave

375
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,140
Yuan's mother

376
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,290
free surgery

377
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:16,860
so she would take

378
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,140
the exam for Youmei.

379
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,050
I did save Yuan's mother's life.

380
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,140
But for the past eleven years,

381
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,530
she kept threatening us

382
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:25,980
with this secret.

383
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:29,250
She kept hurting us.

384
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:30,770
That day,

385
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,730
I heard my mom was

386
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:35,250
arguing with Liu Yuanyuan

387
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:36,050
in the lab.

388
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,700
Liu Yuanyuan charged at my mom

389
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,380
with a knife like crazy.

390
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,980
So I rushed over immediately!

391
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:42,090
Maybe

392
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:43,380
Liu Yuanyuan wanted to kill her,

393
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,570
but got killed instead.

394
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,620
The fatal injury was
inflicted by a hammer,

395
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,570
with a contact area

396
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:48,900
of eight square centimeters,

397
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:50,730
striking the right side

398
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:51,810
of the skull.

399
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:53,220
Our preliminary assessment

400
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:55,490
is that the weapon was a medical hammer

401
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:56,090
of this type.

402
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,980
The wire mesh opening

403
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,490
that you and Wan found on the hill

404
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:00,490
behind the lab,

405
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,490
what if it weren't

406
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:04,940
the killer's escape route,

407
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,180
but the way back?

408
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:11,050
Say it was Ding Youmei

409
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,180
who left the lab building

410
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,490
disguised as Liu Yuanyuan.

411
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,620
And she passed by

412
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,290
the cameras

413
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:20,250
at the lab building and
the school gate on purpose

414
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,810
to create the illusion that Liu Yuanyuan

415
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:25,620
had left He City Medical University.

416
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:31,220
After ditching the head,

417
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,940
she could come back through
the wire mesh opening

418
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,290
to return to the university

419
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:38,420
without being captured

420
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:40,010
by the camera at the gate.

421
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:45,810
If that was the case,

422
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,180
that could explain

423
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,010
why the cameras

424
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:49,530
didn't capture her when she returned.

425
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,860
But how did she return to the lab

426
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,250
without being filmed by the camera

427
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:55,420
at the lab's door

428
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,900
and walk out of it

429
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:58,220
the next day?

430
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,660
Keep looking.

431
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,050
See if there's anything that

432
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,180
supports our inference.

433
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:49,570
Gao Yuan.

434
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:51,730
Tweezers and bags.

435
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:52,490
Alright.

436
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:56,490
Any new discovery?

437
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:57,700
Here.

438
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:04,900
It seems to be

439
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,090
some kind of fiber.

440
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:09,730
More here.

441
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:14,940
What is it?

442
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:26,620
Human tissue.

443
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:30,730
But we checked

444
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:31,770
the body donor just now.

445
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,290
No scratch marks were found.

446
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,380
Because they didn't come from him.

447
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:47,570
It's a mortuary cabinet.

448
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,730
What else could it be?

449
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:14,730
There was supposed to be

450
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,490
another person with
Gao Huilan on the day

451
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,290
she went to borrow a body donor.

452
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:20,570
She had a student called Wu Min.

453
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:22,860
Wu Min said Ms. Gao was

454
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,180
afraid she'd fail the test

455
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,980
and called her over alone

456
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:27,050
to give her extra lessons.

457
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,810
Xi and I went to ask

458
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:30,940
the security guard.

459
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,050
Same as Wu Min's story.

460
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,860
In medical schools,

461
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,730
anatomy is taught

462
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,250
in group sessions

463
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:41,050
held in the anatomy lab,

464
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,420
rather than moving

465
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:43,660
body donors between rooms.

466
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,250
Are you saying she moved

467
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:47,090
the body donor on purpose?

468
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:50,490
When moving body donors,

469
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,090
they're usually put in body bags.

470
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:54,140
That's a protection for them.

471
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:55,380
Meanwhile,

472
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:57,010
it's the best disguise.

473
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,570
That means

474
00:21:58,590 --> 00:21:59,570
Liu Yuanyuan's body

475
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,900
was transported

476
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:02,250
into the specimen room

477
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:03,860
along with the body donor.

478
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,940
But if there were two bodies

479
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:08,180
in one body bag,

480
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,700
couldn't the student tell?

481
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,570
Unless the student was an accomplice.

482
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,220
Mr. Qi,

483
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,250
the results are in.

484
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:03,530
Accomplices have been ruled out.

485
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:07,620
Gao Yuan and I

486
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:09,330
went back to the specimen room

487
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:10,290
for another survey.

488
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,290
Clothing fibers and human tissue

489
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,940
from another individual

490
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,900
were found in the mortuary cabinet 4.

491
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:18,050
The fibers have been confirmed

492
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:18,770
to be from

493
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:20,010
Liu Yuanyuan's coat.

494
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:21,730
And the human tissue has matched

495
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,220
the third party's DNA sample

496
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:24,180
extracted from the coat.

497
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:25,860
So it was Ding Youmei wearing

498
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:26,980
Liu Yuanyuan's coat.

499
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:27,940
Exactly.

500
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:29,860
Gao Huilan was lying.

501
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,220
Liu Yuanyuan never

502
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:33,090
left her lab alive.

503
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:20,010
Ding Youmei didn't go right back

504
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,490
to the lab after she

505
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:22,530
buried the head,

506
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,730
because she knew

507
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:25,290
the camera would have

508
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:25,900
captured her.

509
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,290
Therefore,

510
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:29,660
she moved the body donor from cabinet 4

511
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:31,730
to the unused cabinet 5

512
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:32,860
and hid herself

513
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:34,900
in mortuary cabinet 4.

514
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:46,660
When Gao Huilan and Wu Min

515
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,940
came to borrow the body donor,

516
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,940
she could avoid the cameras perfectly

517
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,570
and return to the lab.

518
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,490
So what Gao Huilan transferred

519
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:14,530
wasn't a body donor,

520
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,860
but Ding Youmei.

521
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,140
She also found a student

522
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:18,660
who was scared of the bodies.

523
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:20,420
That's why no one noticed.

524
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,220
Ding Youmei was transported

525
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,620
back to the lab,

526
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:25,010
pretending to be a corpse.

527
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,220
Meanwhile, Gao Huilan

528
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,290
completed dismembering

529
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:28,530
Liu Yuanyuan's body overnight

530
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:30,660
and had Wu Min

531
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:31,570
send the body donor

532
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:33,420
back to the specimen room.

533
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:34,420
Except it wasn't

534
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,730
a body donor

535
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:36,980
this time,

536
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:38,490
but Liu Yuanyuan's

537
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:39,090
body fragments.

538
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:41,330
Everything makes sense now.

539
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:43,860
Gao Huilan returned
to the specimen room,

540
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:45,700
put Liu Yuanyuan's body fragments

541
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,010
into the specimen jar.

542
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,380
She swapped Liu Yuanyuan's
body fragments

543
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,090
and specimen body parts,

544
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:52,810
and further treated

545
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:54,010
the specimen bones,

546
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,700
then ditched the body parts

547
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:57,420
to create the illusion
of multiple victims.

548
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:59,490
But in fact, the body donor in cabinet 4

549
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,940
had never left

550
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:01,530
the building.

551
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,530
It was moved

552
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:03,980
into the unused cabinet 5.

553
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:04,860
After that,

554
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,330
all they needed was to find a chance

555
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:08,460
to put the body donor back in cabinet 4

556
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,530
and complete the
entire criminal process.

557
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:20,460
So all we need to do

558
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,940
is extract Ding Youmei's

559
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:22,420
DNA sample

560
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,090
and confirm that

561
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:24,860
she was the one in the mortuary cabinet

562
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,460
in Liu Yuanyuan's coat,

563
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:28,050
and we can close the case.

564
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:25,090
We found massive traces

565
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:25,810
of Liu Yuanyuan's

566
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:26,980
blood in your lab.

567
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:29,010
That was the scene of her death.

568
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:30,420
We extracted

569
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:31,380
your daughter's DNA

570
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,530
from both

571
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:33,900
Liu Yuanyuan's coat

572
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,090
and mortuary cabinet No. 4.

573
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,620
The evidence is solid.

574
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,620
Anything else to say?

575
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:43,700
It was all me.

576
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:45,290
My daughter wasn't involved.

577
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:46,980
She only did what I told her to do.

578
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:48,010
Then why did you

579
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:48,940
kill Liu Yuanyuan?

580
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,810
I did it for her own good.

581
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,290
Yuan was a good child.

582
00:28:59,000 --> 00:28:59,730
She took the exam

583
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,490
for Youmei back then.

584
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,050
Yes.

585
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:03,570
She helped Youmei and me.

586
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,380
But we also helped her.

587
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,250
Dr. Gao,

588
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:08,620
the patient in bed 17

589
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,770
is quite stable this morning.

590
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:11,330
But the patient in bed 19

591
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,620
is having chest pain.

592
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:13,660
You'll have to check

593
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,620
on the patient later.

594
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,290
Okay.

595
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:17,860
Dr. Gao!

596
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:19,330
Youmei.

597
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:20,250
Dr. Gao.

598
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:20,620
Youmei?

599
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,700
She's not your daughter.

600
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,860
She does look like her, right?

601
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:25,570
Yes.

602
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:32,980
What's this girl

603
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,250
to the patient in bed 17?

604
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:36,010
She's her daughter,

605
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:37,620
a very filial girl.

606
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,490
I heard she's also a good student,

607
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:40,940
top three of the grade.

608
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,140
She's having it rough,

609
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:45,380
doing her homework here every day.

610
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,290
She's only a child, but she needs

611
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,860
to take care of her mother.

612
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,700
I feed you

613
00:29:58,920 --> 00:29:59,570
and shelter you.

614
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,620
I give you everything you want!

615
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,220
And this is how you repay me?

616
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:05,660
Huh? Answer me!

617
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:07,250
Getting such a score?

618
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:08,490
What a disgrace!

619
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,420
Okay, that's enough.

620
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,700
She'll do better next time.

621
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,330
Calm down now.

622
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:11,980
Next time?

623
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:14,330
Study?

624
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,860
Forget about that!

625
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:18,050
And you!

626
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:19,770
You spoiled her to this!

627
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,180
Let me tell you,

628
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:22,980
you don't deserve to be my daughter!

629
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:30,700
Mom!

630
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,220
What now?

631
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:34,380
Will Dad kick me out?

632
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:37,940
He won't.

633
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:40,010
Don't worry.

634
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:41,330
I'm here.

635
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,090
I'll protect you.

636
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,220
It's fine.

637
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:00,090
But won't others

638
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:01,900
find out about this?

639
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,050
It's okay.

640
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:07,010
As soon as you agree,

641
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:08,730
I'll arrange surgery

642
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:10,010
for your mother immediately.

643
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:12,140
I'll perform the surgery myself

644
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:14,900
and cover all the expenses.

645
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:23,090
Good kid.

646
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:25,660
That time,

647
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,050
I wanted to send Youmei

648
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:28,090
to study abroad.

649
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:31,380
So I asked Yuan to take
the TOEFL for Youmei.

650
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,090
The first year,

651
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:36,530
Yuan took the test for Youmei.

652
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,010
And the next year, she took it herself.

653
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:41,140
Unexpectedly, she didn't

654
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:43,140
perform well the following year.

655
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:47,250
It was my fault.

656
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,490
So Liu Yuanyuan felt

657
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:50,980
you ruined her life

658
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,860
and kept threatening you
for these eleven years.

659
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:54,940
And then you killed her

660
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:55,490
out of anger?

661
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:56,380
It wasn't like that.

662
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:59,250
Yuan was a good kid.

663
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:01,050
She never blamed me.

664
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,010
She just felt

665
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:06,010
very guilty about it.

666
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:06,980
She thought

667
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,530
she messed it up

668
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:10,140
because she was nervous.

669
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,860
So I also wanted to sponsor her

670
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,770
so she could go back to college.

671
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,380
But her mother's illness

672
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:18,380
was dragging her down.

673
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:20,490
It was a bottomless pit.

674
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:25,860
A few days ago,

675
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:27,620
Yuan came again.

676
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:30,140
She said her mom's illness was back,

677
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,940
hoping I could help her again.

678
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:36,180
Her mother's illness kept recurring.

679
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:39,860
I knew she had been suffering.

680
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:42,420
I felt bad about Yuan

681
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,730
being dragged down

682
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:45,700
by her mother.

683
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,490
I wanted to help her badly.

684
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,220
But I knew

685
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,420
the only way to fix this

686
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,770
was to solve the root of it all.

687
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,180
That's why I went to her mother.

688
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:00,220
Huizhen,

689
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:01,700
it's been years.

690
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:03,700
Yeah, Dr. Gao.

691
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:06,250
I don't have much at home.

692
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:07,860
Please don't mind.

693
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:11,860
Yuan mentioned

694
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,620
you haven't been feeling well lately.

695
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:15,250
So I came to visit you.

696
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:18,220
Thank you.

697
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,660
You also know

698
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:23,250
my condition.

699
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:25,490
It's beyond treatment.

700
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,330
If it hadn't been for Yuan,

701
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:32,290
I'd have given up long ago.

702
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:35,250
Yuan is a good girl.

703
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,570
Don't you feel bad

704
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:44,010
about dragging her down for years

705
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,220
with your illness?

706
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:47,140
Do you know that

707
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,220
Yuan could have
gotten into medical school

708
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:50,770
and had a better life than this?

709
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,490
You're the reason why Yuan

710
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:56,620
ended up like this today.

711
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,420
She... She...

712
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:01,380
Why exactly did you do that?

713
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,570
I just wanted her to realize

714
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:07,980
that she should give it up.

715
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:10,090
Give up on herself

716
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:11,820
and set her daughter free.

717
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,340
Yuan's life

718
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:16,420
was ruined because of you.

719
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,340
You said you were holding on for her.

720
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:20,740
But have you ever asked

721
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,530
whether she wanted this kind of life?

722
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,260
I know your condition well.

723
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:27,780
Let me be frank with you.

724
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:29,490
Keep stalling like this,

725
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:31,490
and you're only a burden to her.

726
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:34,090
No...

727
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:39,170
Yuan wouldn't think this way.

728
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:41,130
She wouldn't.

729
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,610
Of course Yuan won't.

730
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,340
She's a good child.

731
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,860
But you?

732
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:51,340
If you were really

733
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,650
a good mother,

734
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:53,380
you should

735
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,740
just give up on yourself

736
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,780
and stop torturing her.

737
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,610
To be honest,

738
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:59,210
you'll eventually die someday.

739
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,010
But she?

740
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,490
She'll still have to pay off

741
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:04,300
the debts owed because of you.

742
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:06,010
You want to stay alive?

743
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,940
You only want her life

744
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,860
to be ruined just like you are!

745
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:19,610
So you killed Liu Yuanyuan's mother

746
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,740
for her own sake?

747
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,260
I've seen too many patients

748
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,340
like her mother.

749
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:28,170
Her illness kept recurring.

750
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,210
When would it even end?

751
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:32,690
If she wanted her daughter

752
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,050
to have a good life,

753
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,690
that was the only way.

754
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:36,690
Besides,

755
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,490
we will all die in the end, right?

756
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,820
I only taught her

757
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:43,490
how to be a good mother.

758
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,340
You're so selfish.

759
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,980
You said you wanted to help Yuan.

760
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:09,860
But why did you kill her?

761
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:11,690
Don't you think this

762
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,780
is contradictory?

763
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:15,940
That day, Yuan came to my lab

764
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,740
and gave me a button

765
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,380
her mom had ripped off

766
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:22,940
from my clothes.

767
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:26,260
Yuan,

768
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,210
listen to me.

769
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:29,490
It's alright.

770
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:32,820
Though your mom's gone,

771
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:34,650
you can start

772
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:35,940
a new life now.

773
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:37,420
I'll help you.

774
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,690
Don't worry.

775
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:49,570
It was you who killed my mom!

776
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:51,380
It was you!

777
00:37:57,630 --> 00:37:58,260
Yuan!

778
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:00,860
Yuan!

779
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:02,420
No...

780
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,380
Yuan, don't be stupid!

781
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:04,940
Yuan!

782
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:06,740
Don't...

783
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:08,490
Yuan!

784
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:09,340
Stop...

785
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,380
Stop it!

786
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:13,340
Yuan!

787
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:14,420
Mom!

788
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:34,210
No...

789
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:38,010
Mom...

790
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:40,170
Mom...

791
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:42,090
She...

792
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:53,530
Mei,

793
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:54,940
listen to me.

794
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:56,170
Put her clothes on you.

795
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:57,780
I'll handle the rest of it.

796
00:38:58,590 --> 00:38:59,340
I've got it.

797
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,050
Don't be afraid.

798
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:10,420
I'm here with you.

799
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:16,490
Just do as I say.

800
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,130
I only did all of this

801
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:23,210
to help my daughter.

802
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,090
And she had

803
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:27,940
nothing to do with this.

804
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:28,860
I hope you can

805
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,380
let my daughter out

806
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,380
and tell her

807
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,650
to live happily.

808
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:56,900
Xi.

809
00:39:58,630 --> 00:39:59,090
What is it?

810
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:00,860
One's missing.

811
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:34,340
My mom...

812
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:36,820
How is she now?

813
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:40,860
She has confessed.

814
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:45,090
She admitted she killed Liu Yuanyuan.

815
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:47,740
You mean

816
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:51,210
my mom confessed?

817
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:55,650
She wouldn't...

818
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:00,980
Please tell me

819
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,010
what will happen to her.

820
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:09,530
According to legal procedures,

821
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,090
the prosecutor may charge your mother

822
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:12,900
with murder.

823
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:16,900
Then?

824
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:20,340
The court will make a judgment.

825
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:35,380
It's my fault...

826
00:42:38,110 --> 00:42:39,170
It's all my fault...

827
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:42,570
If my mom hadn't wanted

828
00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:43,780
to protect me,

829
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:45,490
she wouldn't have

830
00:42:45,510 --> 00:42:47,420
asked Liu Yuanyuan
to take the exam for me.

831
00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:49,300
It's my fault... My fault...

832
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,210
It was me...

833
00:42:53,110 --> 00:42:54,530
All my fault...

834
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,210
And what will happen to me?

835
00:43:00,590 --> 00:43:01,780
You're suspected of harboring.

836
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:04,530
The court will sentence you according

837
00:43:05,110 --> 00:43:06,090
to the severity.

838
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:11,900
Your mother wants you

839
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:13,940
to live a good life in the future.

840
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:14,690
Ding Youmei is

841
00:44:14,710 --> 00:44:15,860
not what we thought she was.

842
00:44:16,030 --> 00:44:18,260
My mom said everything
she did was for my own good.

843
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,650
But was turning me into
the good girl she expected

844
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:22,010
really good for me?

845
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:23,610
Mei made a big mistake.

846
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:24,340
I'm begging you.

847
00:44:24,510 --> 00:44:26,300
Do you realize that your actions

848
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:27,130
are hurting her?

849
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:29,170
Do you study the brain's
reflection of light

850
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:30,860
to help Li Ming develop drugs?

851
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,420
How did you get this information?

852
00:44:32,590 --> 00:44:34,010
I solved the Raw Diamond Case.

853
00:44:34,150 --> 00:44:36,090
I know him better than you do.

854
00:44:36,230 --> 00:44:38,340
Zhai, your daughter fell off!

855
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:39,820
Truth comes after evidence.

856
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,050
But you've got it backwards.

857
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:42,380
Zhai Xixi didn't fall by accident.

858
00:44:42,590 --> 00:44:43,650
Why did you kill her?

859
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:45,090
Why did you kill her?

860
00:44:45,110 --> 00:44:46,050
It's murder.
