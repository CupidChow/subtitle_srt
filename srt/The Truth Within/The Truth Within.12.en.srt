1
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:34,660
Xi.

2
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,260
Doctor.

3
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,610
I'd like to ask,

4
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:38,730
how is Xiaoshan doing?

5
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:40,450
It's subacute

6
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,730
infective endocarditis,

7
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:42,820
complicated by

8
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,290
a bacterial aneurysm.

9
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,690
The surgery is quite complex.

10
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,220
We told the family

11
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,130
when they were here,

12
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:49,980
it'd be costly.

13
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,730
Is he out of danger?

14
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:52,980
For now, yes.

15
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,610
But we need to operate soon,

16
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:55,690
or we can't be sure.

17
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:01,660
By the way, Ms. Zhu.

18
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:03,850
I looked into Xi's records.

19
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,220
Over the years,

20
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,380
her father, Shanjun,

21
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,780
has been struggling financially.

22
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,540
He's been living off

23
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,610
the insurance payout

24
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:11,130
from his late wife's accident.

25
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:13,290
Three months ago,

26
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:14,540
Xi took out

27
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,690
a three-million policy.

28
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,980
The beneficiary is Xiaoshan.

29
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:40,500
Mr. Zhai.

30
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,260
Could we talk

31
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,570
about your family?

32
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,450
We heard that

33
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:47,690
your wife died years ago.

34
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,060
Could you give us more details?

35
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,170
If only...

36
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,260
I hadn't been so impulsive.

37
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,820
My wife would still be alive,

38
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:08,380
and Xi...

39
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,570
wouldn't be mute today.

40
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:11,540
On three,

41
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,410
say "cheese!"

42
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:13,850
One, two, three!

43
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,380
Cheese!

44
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:15,850
Get out!

45
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:16,290
Hey!

46
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:19,290
Robber! Robber!

47
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:20,220
Give my phone back!

48
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:20,980
Robber!

49
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:22,850
Dad!

50
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,140
Daddy!

51
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:26,580
Don't move!

52
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,340
Shanjun!

53
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:31,730
I didn't know they were thugs.

54
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:32,930
Shanjun!

55
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,140
My wife...

56
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:36,780
She died protecting me.

57
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,660
Daddy!

58
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,290
Daddy!

59
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:53,780
Honey!

60
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,540
So that's when

61
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,020
Xiaoshan started resenting you?

62
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,780
Because of that incident?

63
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,810
After my wife died,

64
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:29,730
I was devastated.

65
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,370
I started drinking my sorrows away.

66
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,730
I failed my kids.

67
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,370
Xi was always such a good kid.

68
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,610
Besides school,

69
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,140
she worked odd jobs

70
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,460
to help us get by.

71
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,140
Later,

72
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:07,980
I decided

73
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:09,660
to sober up and move on.

74
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,930
I wanted the kids

75
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,050
to have a better life.

76
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,290
I couldn't be a burden to them.

77
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:20,140
But it was too late.

78
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:21,780
Bring it back!

79
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:22,810
Over here! This way!

80
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:23,490
Right here!

81
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:24,170
Pass it!

82
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:25,020
Kick it back!

83
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:25,850
Kick it!

84
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,100
Kick it back!

85
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:30,780
Pass it back!

86
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,460
He's down?

87
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:32,460
Here!

88
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:33,850
Coach!

89
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,370
Coach, come quick!

90
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:37,700
Xiaoshan!

91
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:38,930
Xiaoshan!

92
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,140
The doctor said

93
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:43,290
Xiaoshan's condition is critical.

94
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,490
If we don't operate soon,

95
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,580
his life will be in danger.

96
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,140
So,

97
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,140
I had to borrow money.

98
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:55,730
Zhang, please help.

99
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,290
I'll pay you back within a year.

100
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:58,490
I'm struggling too, man.

101
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,290
Zhang!

102
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,540
Life was hard,

103
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,930
but we managed.

104
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,370
Until...

105
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,050
Xi's accident happened.

106
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:27,410
So...

107
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,020
did you notice

108
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,700
anything unusual

109
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,780
about Xi lately?

110
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,980
Was she depressed?

111
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,460
Suicidal, maybe?

112
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,170
Suicidal?

113
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,780
No way.

114
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,250
Xi was always an optimist.

115
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,410
No matter how hard it was,

116
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:45,730
she always had a smile

117
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:46,490
for everyone.

118
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:47,580
She'd never

119
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,020
leave us and commit suicide.

120
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,850
Did you know

121
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:54,850
that three months ago,

122
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:56,170
she bought herself

123
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:57,050
an insurance policy?

124
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:58,900
Insurance?

125
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,020
Accident insurance.

126
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:04,100
Beneficiary is Zhai Xiaoshan.

127
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:12,140
No...

128
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:15,290
Ins... insurance?

129
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,020
So she...

130
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,050
Everything is under investigation.

131
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:18,730
No...

132
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:19,930
We'll notify you of any news.

133
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:22,050
Please stay calm.

134
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,610
You mean

135
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,730
Xi wanted to commit fraud

136
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,820
for her brother's surgery?

137
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:51,650
Yes.

138
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:53,850
Because the timing

139
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,060
is just too coincidental.

140
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,530
Three months before she fell,

141
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:58,770
she bought herself

142
00:08:58,790 --> 00:08:59,890
a three-million policy.

143
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,820
But her father never knew.

144
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:04,700
Could Xi have

145
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:06,250
staged a suicide as an accident?

146
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,370
It wasn't a suicide.

147
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,180
When she fell,

148
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:13,700
someone else was in this room,

149
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,180
involved in her fall.

150
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:23,580
From the bloodstains

151
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,530
outside the balcony,

152
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,100
and the broken nails,

153
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:27,730
she must have

154
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:28,940
struggled on the balcony

155
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,340
before she fell.

156
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:31,650
So,

157
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:32,850
she should've

158
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:34,490
fallen almost vertically.

159
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,700
But looking at

160
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,580
the body's position,

161
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:38,940
it was found

162
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,180
away from the building.

163
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:41,890
As you know,

164
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,220
normal impact injuries

165
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,300
usually only leave

166
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,340
one or two bruises.

167
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:46,250
But look,

168
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,300
her foot bruises are circular.

169
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,300
So we suspect

170
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,530
that before hitting the ground,

171
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,940
she was caught

172
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,460
on the drying rack of 601,

173
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:54,610
then fell after struggling.

174
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,340
The bent rack

175
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:57,530
and the loose screws

176
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:58,340
at the scene

177
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:00,340
confirm this theory.

178
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:07,300
Also,

179
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:08,370
we found some

180
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:09,100
rusty burrs on

181
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,490
the bent part of the rack.

182
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,060
Some white fibers

183
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:12,940
were caught on them.

184
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:14,490
Evidence Department confirmed

185
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,130
that these fibers

186
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,370
match the ones on

187
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:18,610
Xi's white canvas shoes.

188
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:19,420
They're identical.

189
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,420
Plus,

190
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,580
the skin on her left foot

191
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,650
showed no tears

192
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:23,730
or rust marks.

193
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:24,770
So we believe

194
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:26,610
she was wearing the left shoe

195
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:27,530
when it got caught.

196
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:28,610
But,

197
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,300
on the body,

198
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:30,890
it's the right.

199
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,730
And that shoe doesn't have

200
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:33,850
any snag marks.

201
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:35,250
The left shoe was found

202
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:36,300
on her own balcony.

203
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:37,460
This left shoe,

204
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:38,700
where was it exactly?

205
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:39,300
Right here.

206
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:42,890
The injury

207
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:44,130
on Xi's left ankle

208
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,300
was caused by hitting

209
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:45,980
the drying rack.

210
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,890
And the fibers on the rack

211
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,490
came from snagging the shoe.

212
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:51,340
So why was the body

213
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:52,530
wearing the right shoe,

214
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:54,010
while the left one

215
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,420
was left on the balcony?

216
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:57,250
Someone else was there

217
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:58,370
when Xi fell.

218
00:10:59,270 --> 00:10:59,980
And,

219
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,820
they moved her body.

220
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:02,940
Correct.

221
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:05,060
Look at these two photos.

222
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,100
The left shoe found

223
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,060
on the balcony,

224
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,980
and the right shoe

225
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,220
taken off her body.

226
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:13,580
The wear on these

227
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,100
is completely different.

228
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:16,700
Also, the left shoe

229
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,580
looks brand new.

230
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:19,820
When I was at her house,

231
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:21,370
I noticed

232
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:22,580
her other shoes.

233
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,370
None had such severe

234
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:25,370
uneven wear

235
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:26,820
or imbalances.

236
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,610
And from what we know,

237
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:29,460
Xi didn't have

238
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,700
any foot problems.

239
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:32,820
So these are not

240
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,580
a pair.

241
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,100
Just the same model.

242
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:37,300
If our theory

243
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,300
is correct...

244
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,180
Someone swapped the left shoe.

245
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:43,700
We found signs that

246
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,420
601's balcony door was opened.

247
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:46,820
But the agent said

248
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,940
no one has viewed

249
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,850
the place for a long time.

250
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:50,890
So I believe

251
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:52,770
when Xi fell,

252
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:54,610
someone was right there.

253
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,100
But the killer didn't expect

254
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,890
the crisscrossing drying racks

255
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:06,650
of the building

256
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,460
to ruin his murder plan.

257
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:13,130
Even so,

258
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,820
he didn't give up.

259
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:18,580
He rushed to the 6th floor

260
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,460
immediately

261
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:20,370
to finish the job.

262
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:32,730
Why

263
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,220
did the killer take the shoe?

264
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:36,420
He must have left

265
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,460
evidence of his identity

266
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,580
at the scene,

267
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,490
so he had to take it.

268
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,300
But then he realized

269
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,730
that a missing shoe

270
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,770
would make the accident

271
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,730
look suspicious.

272
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:50,850
So,

273
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,250
he took the left shoe

274
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,890
from the 6th floor,

275
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,340
went back to Xi's home,

276
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,700
and took the matching right shoe.

277
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:00,730
He left the left shoe

278
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:01,610
on

279
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:03,130
Xi's balcony

280
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:04,580
to mislead us.

281
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:06,820
Following this logic,

282
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,940
when Shanjun heard

283
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,730
about Xi's fall

284
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,650
and rushed out,

285
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:14,300
the door might have been open.

286
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:16,370
This gave the killer

287
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:17,610
a chance to swap them.

288
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,420
While investigating 601,

289
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,850
we found

290
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:25,130
the key to 601

291
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,100
was with the agency.

292
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:27,890
Does anyone else

293
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:29,060
have the keys?

294
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:31,580
We're the only ones.

295
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,300
The landlord left

296
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:33,940
a spare with us.

297
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:35,010
Usually,

298
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:35,940
we show clients the place.

299
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,250
Wan.

300
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:40,940
Let's go back to the agency.

301
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:42,460
Okay.

302
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:14,650
Mr. Han, right?

303
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,420
Please, come in. Let's talk inside.

304
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,060
Officers, have some water.

305
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,300
I heard

306
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:28,730
you've been here before.

307
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,060
Is there anything else

308
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,180
you need to know?

309
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:31,940
I'll cooperate fully.

310
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,850
How do you usually

311
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,940
keep the owners' keys?

312
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:37,370
Shiyi Real Estate

313
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:38,580
is a legitimate company.

314
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,610
All the keys

315
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:40,850
are stored in our

316
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:41,890
common key cabinet.

317
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:42,580
If anyone

318
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,980
wants to show a client,

319
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,180
they must report to me

320
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,250
and record it.

321
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:49,490
Has anyone seen

322
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:50,490
601 recently?

323
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:51,980
601? One moment.

324
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,700
601...

325
00:14:58,960 --> 00:14:59,730
No.

326
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,180
The market's slow lately.

327
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:03,730
Plus, it's an old building.

328
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,770
No one's looking.

329
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,530
Does anyone else have access

330
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:07,300
to the cabinet?

331
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,530
That's impossible.

332
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,250
Only I have the key.

333
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,730
Plus, we have surveillance.

334
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:15,420
What were you doing

335
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,100
at 8:00 last night?

336
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:17,650
8:00 PM?

337
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,180
I was with a client then.

338
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,890
My client can vouch for me.

339
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,940
So, any findings?

340
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,300
When Xi fell,

341
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:40,460
a witness claimed

342
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,250
there were flashes across the way.

343
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,890
You think she's like Li Yiqi

344
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,370
and Li Shuting?

345
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,340
Did Xi's tox screen come back?

346
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,130
Mr. Qi.

347
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:06,340
Xi's body

348
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:07,890
showed no drug reactions.

349
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:14,420
No designer drugs were found.

350
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:15,700
But...

351
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,300
we can't conclude

352
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,060
there's no connection.

353
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:21,420
I think

354
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,180
there's another possibility.

355
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,460
Mr. Qi, I'm ready.

356
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:30,650
Okay, coming.

357
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:54,340
The timing of Xi's fall

358
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:55,890
and the flashes

359
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:57,010
across the street

360
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:58,890
are just too coincidental.

361
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:00,220
If

362
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,300
the two are linked,

363
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:03,340
then

364
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,770
those flashes

365
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,250
were like a prompt,

366
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:09,140
a signal for her to jump.

367
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,700
They just didn't expect

368
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,570
her to get caught on

369
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:15,010
the 6th-floor drying rack.

370
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:22,290
To ensure

371
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,810
she'd actually die,

372
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:24,770
the killer had to

373
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:25,940
run up to help.

374
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:32,180
But inside the building,

375
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:33,620
he realized

376
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:35,330
there were cameras in the elevator.

377
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,050
So he took the stairs.

378
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,620
After spotting where

379
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,700
Xi was hanging,

380
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,660
he entered Room 601.

381
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:10,860
He saw Xi

382
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:12,810
hanging on the rack.

383
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:39,940
By then,

384
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:42,090
news of the jump

385
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,010
had spread through the building.

386
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,860
But he still

387
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:51,460
had one more thing to do.

388
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:52,660
Get rid of

389
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,900
Xi's left shoe.

390
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:56,980
Meanwhile,

391
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,330
neighbors were filling

392
00:18:58,350 --> 00:18:59,900
the hallway to check.

393
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,980
The killer tried to go up.

394
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:05,490
But he ran right into

395
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:07,140
the neighbor and Zhai Shanjun.

396
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,900
He avoided them

397
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:14,940
and entered Xi's home

398
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:16,250
to swap the shoes.

399
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:22,010
After leaving

400
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:22,810
Xi's home,

401
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:24,050
he tried to flee downstairs.

402
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,700
But in the 6th-floor stairwell,

403
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:28,620
he ran into some rowdy teens.

404
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,730
What an unlucky day.

405
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,380
First, someone falls,

406
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:33,810
and now some punks

407
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:34,980
are fighting in the stairwell.

408
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,180
He couldn't risk

409
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,700
being seen by the teens

410
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,250
while holding the shoe.

411
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:41,460
So,

412
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:43,380
he had to head back up.

413
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,940
But just then,

414
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:46,860
he ran into

415
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,530
a neighbor leaving the elevator

416
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:50,140
to get a phone from Xi's

417
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,810
and notify Zhai Xiaoshan.

418
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,050
He was trapped

419
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:57,180
in the 7th-floor stairwell.

420
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,140
So,

421
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,570
what did he do then?

422
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:05,900
He had to find another way out.

423
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:14,770
Mr. Han.

424
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:17,620
Room 1006 is also empty.

425
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:56,660
Mr. Han, Mr. Qi.

426
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:00,220
Found them.

427
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:17,460
Xi was wearing these

428
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,180
when she fell.

429
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,050
Yes.

430
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,900
Any fingerprints?

431
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:23,490
Right here.

432
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,140
Su, take Wan

433
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,220
to Shiyi Real Estate

434
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:29,620
and get everyone's prints.

435
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,730
Whoever accessed those rooms

436
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:33,180
must be an agent.

437
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:34,220
Okay.

438
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,140
Wait.

439
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:37,730
Going in like that

440
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:38,700
for fingerprints

441
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:40,570
will tip them off.

442
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,090
Meaning?

443
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:43,700
When you checked

444
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:44,900
the agency,

445
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,250
their keys

446
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,090
hadn't been touched, right?

447
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:49,570
Xi checked the footage.

448
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:50,380
It's fine.

449
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:51,730
That means

450
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:54,420
whoever entered

451
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,180
room 601 and 1006

452
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,620
already had

453
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,530
spare keys on them.

454
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,220
Just as we

455
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,700
went to Room 1006,

456
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,420
the place was empty

457
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:06,010
and looked abandoned.

458
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:07,770
But actually,

459
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:08,900
there were signs

460
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,860
that someone lived there.

461
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:13,010
He's hiding out

462
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:14,180
in Room 1006

463
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:15,770
and hid the shoes

464
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:17,090
inside.

465
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,290
He must know

466
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:19,700
that for a while,

467
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:21,730
no one would visit Room 1006.

468
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:24,460
He's lying in wait.

469
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:26,730
He's so confident.

470
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,380
He's waiting for

471
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,730
things to blow over

472
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:30,700
before retrieving

473
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,090
the shoes.

474
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,860
But what if

475
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,380
someone wants to see the place?

476
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,900
Let's see who bites.

477
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,250
Hello, Miss.

478
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,180
Buying or renting?

479
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,140
Buying.

480
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,620
Please, sit down.

481
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:53,250
Let me show you

482
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:53,900
this place.

483
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,090
Look, four units per floor...

484
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:55,810
Don't bother.

485
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:57,330
I want one in the building

486
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:58,380
where the girl fell.

487
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:00,420
A relative said

488
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,180
there's a vacancy nearby.

489
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:05,250
That place has issues.

490
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:05,620
Miss,

491
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:05,980
this...

492
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,140
I want the accident unit.

493
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,010
It's a murder house,

494
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,380
so it's cheaper.

495
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:14,860
I see.

496
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,250
You're an expert.

497
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,010
Well,

498
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,180
I'll get the keys

499
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:18,980
and we'll go now.

500
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:19,730
Don't bother.

501
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,570
My relative's on the way.

502
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:22,940
In half an hour,

503
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,090
let's meet downstairs.

504
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:24,730
Okay.

505
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:25,700
No problem.

506
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:26,570
One moment.

507
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:46,530
Wan.

508
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:47,570
He's going up.

509
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,050
Who are you?

510
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:09,980
Zhang Chunmin?

511
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,220
Yes.

512
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:13,810
Move.

513
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:27,730
Talk.

514
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,140
What were you doing in 1006?

515
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,180
Listen.

516
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,460
This is the CID.

517
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,290
Our day-to-day job

518
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:42,250
is dealing with

519
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:43,730
major cases and homicides.

520
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,940
If we didn't have

521
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,570
solid evidence,

522
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:47,420
we wouldn't bring you

523
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,140
all the way here

524
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,050
to cooperate.

525
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:51,620
Asking you to talk now

526
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:52,900
is giving you a chance

527
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:53,900
to come clean.

528
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:55,770
I hope you value it.

529
00:24:59,480 --> 00:24:59,770
I...

530
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:00,770
As far as we know,

531
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,730
you don't handle

532
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:03,730
the keys at your agency.

533
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:05,660
How did you get them?

534
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:10,940
Officers,

535
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:11,980
you know

536
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:13,140
I'm just an agent.

537
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:15,290
I rent these places out.

538
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:17,700
Is it weird I have keys?

539
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:19,570
A client comes in,

540
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:20,730
and you show up.

541
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:22,090
Quite the coincidence.

542
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,180
And 1006 that day

543
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,480
wasn't your job, right?

544
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:28,770
I...

545
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,900
What do you mean?

546
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,810
A client wanted to see it.

547
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:34,420
So I went to tidy up.

548
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:35,660
Tidy up?

549
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:38,860
When I walked in,

550
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,530
you were

551
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:40,810
rummaging through things.

552
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:43,140
Did you leave

553
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:43,940
something behind?

554
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:45,490
What's your link

555
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:46,490
to Zhai Xi's death?

556
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:49,660
None at all!

557
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:50,700
I don't even know her.

558
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:57,940
Really.

559
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:03,460
Zhu, look.

560
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,620
He doesn't want to talk.

561
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:06,420
That's fine.

562
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:08,700
About the prints,

563
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,490
I already had Su

564
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:10,620
send them up for testing.

565
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:11,620
The results

566
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,290
will be out soon.

567
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:14,980
Once we get a match,

568
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,530
we'll follow procedure.

569
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:17,770
Don't worry.

570
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,380
Listen, Zhang Chunmin.

571
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,620
When we handle cases,

572
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,180
as long as

573
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,220
the evidence chain

574
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,180
is solid and complete,

575
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,140
we don't need

576
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:26,380
a confession to convict you.

577
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:26,940
Okay.

578
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:28,900
Let's stop here for now.

579
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:29,620
Alright.

580
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:32,090
Wait!

581
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:34,810
I know nothing

582
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:35,460
about a murder!

583
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:39,250
I made a copy of the key.

584
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,220
I'm staying in that unit.

585
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:44,220
You made a key and moved in?

586
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:45,700
Yes.

587
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:47,330
It's the off-season,

588
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,460
so there aren't many renters.

589
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,010
I had a fight with my wife.

590
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:51,730
Hold on.

591
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:53,860
Ready to talk now?

592
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:55,290
Go ahead.

593
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:56,810
Take your time.

594
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:58,660
Tell us about that fight.

595
00:26:58,960 --> 00:26:59,380
Okay?

596
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,290
I'll have some water first.

597
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,180
I fought with my wife,

598
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,730
so I needed some space.

599
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,330
In that building,

600
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,620
Room 1006 was the best.

601
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:20,770
When did you move in?

602
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:22,090
Yesterday.

603
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,220
I don't know Zhai Xixi.

604
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,180
I know nothing.

605
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:00,770
Before you moved in,

606
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:01,940
did anyone else stay there?

607
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:05,380
Answer her.

608
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:10,570
I did lend the place

609
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:11,660
to a fellow townsman.

610
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,420
But he's clean.

611
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:14,530
He's renting

612
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:15,900
several units from me.

613
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,220
Plus,

614
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,460
he only stayed

615
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:20,090
the night before last.

616
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:21,050
That before last?

617
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:24,460
That's the night

618
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,380
Zhai Xixi died.

619
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,330
What's his name?

620
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:29,940
Wang Chen.

621
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:32,490
Wang Chen?

622
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:34,810
That name rings a bell.

623
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:44,380
Mr. Han, look.

624
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:47,570
This is Zhai Xixi's policy.

625
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:49,980
Wang Chen is her agent.

626
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:57,660
Which room?

627
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:59,290
Unit 517, 5th floor, Officer.

628
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:36,980
Police.

629
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,700
Where were you the night before last?

630
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,090
What were you doing?

631
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,090
That night...

632
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,860
I... I don't really remember.

633
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:54,860
Looks familiar?

634
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,050
Ever seen this girl?

635
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,810
You sold her a policy.

636
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:18,730
Three million coverage.

637
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:20,330
A disabled girl

638
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:22,180
with that much coverage?

639
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:23,730
Did your company

640
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,570
even vet her?

641
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:29,220
Insurance is always

642
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:30,570
risk versus reward.

643
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:32,530
Business is business.

644
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,220
But your policyholder

645
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,380
died in under three months.

646
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:39,490
Isn't that a coincidence?

647
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:53,420
This shoe...

648
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:54,940
Looks familiar?

649
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:06,660
Xi's gone.

650
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:09,860
I'm devastated too.

651
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:15,700
I was referred to her

652
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,700
by a client.

653
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:19,090
For those three months,

654
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:20,420
whenever she was free

655
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:21,620
or off the clock,

656
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,250
I'd visit her

657
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:24,700
at the cafe where she worked.

658
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:26,770
I showed her

659
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:28,050
our insurance policies.

660
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,330
I also tried evaluating

661
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:31,770
her work status,

662
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,730
salary, benefits,

663
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,730
and other details.

664
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,490
After a few visits,

665
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:39,420
we bonded.

666
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:41,460
I realized

667
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,330
Xi was a hard worker.

668
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:45,810
Never complained about anything.

669
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,460
I guess you could say

670
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:50,660
we were friends.

671
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:53,770
So you became friends.

672
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:55,810
A young girl

673
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:57,460
taking out such huge coverage,

674
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:58,490
and you,

675
00:31:58,510 --> 00:31:59,290
a senior agent,

676
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,490
didn't find it suspicious?

677
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,860
I live on commissions.

678
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,250
Why turn down business?

679
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:09,140
As for

680
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,570
why she bought that policy

681
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:12,090
or what she planned,

682
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,380
I had no idea.

683
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:18,530
After the contract was signed,

684
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:21,420
why use Zhang Chunmin

685
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,090
to get into Room 1006?

686
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,330
It was a coincidence.

687
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,010
I rented units

688
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,730
through Zhang at a discount.

689
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:29,770
They were for

690
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:31,180
company training.

691
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,180
I didn't know then

692
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,420
that Zhai Xixi lived

693
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,010
in that building.

694
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:37,490
Not until...

695
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:40,860
our training ended.

696
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:42,620
Chunmin asked

697
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,900
for the key to 1006.

698
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,180
He wanted to move in,

699
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:46,380
so I went to return it.

700
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:50,220
That night, I had just arrived

701
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:51,530
when I saw...

702
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,220
I saw Xi

703
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,490
on the 7th-floor balcony.

704
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:01,090
She was

705
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,090
about to jump.

706
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,090
I panicked.

707
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,900
But I feared shouting

708
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:09,050
would trigger her.

709
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:10,810
I rushed upstairs.

710
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,380
I remember that I reached

711
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:21,530
the 3rd floor

712
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:23,530
when I saw her

713
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:26,940
jump.

714
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:39,330
Then I remembered

715
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,460
I had the key

716
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,700
to the 6th floor.

717
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,770
I ran up

718
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:45,250
to save her.

719
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,010
I never expected

720
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:07,570
that she

721
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:12,860
tried to undo the shoe herself.

722
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,570
She tried to undo it?

723
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,490
I really wanted to save her.

724
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,130
I just couldn't grab her.

725
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:51,340
I...

726
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:52,650
I just watched her

727
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,340
fall down

728
00:34:58,030 --> 00:34:58,740
before my eyes.

729
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:07,610
After she fell,

730
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:07,980
I realized

731
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,380
I still had her shoe.

732
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:10,820
I was afraid I couldn't explain.

733
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,490
Only then

734
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:19,570
did I realize

735
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:22,170
that when Xi bought it,

736
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:24,460
she planned to trade

737
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:26,940
her life for the money.

738
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:29,980
So, she committed fraud?

739
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,170
Except

740
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:33,210
you only found out then?

741
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,130
I knew about her family.

742
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,010
If my company knew

743
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:45,460
she committed suicide for the money,

744
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,780
her family wouldn't get

745
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,610
a single cent.

746
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:48,940
Then her death

747
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:50,690
would be in vain.

748
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,460
I didn't want her to die

749
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,570
and leave them with nothing.

750
00:35:58,110 --> 00:35:58,940
Then I remembered

751
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:00,210
the cafe where she worked.

752
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:01,420
They give every employee

753
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,170
two identical pairs of shoes.

754
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:06,900
So I thought

755
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:08,650
I'd go to her home,

756
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,210
take a matching shoe,

757
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,010
and leave the other on the balcony.

758
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,260
I made it look like

759
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:16,780
she only had one shoe on

760
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:17,420
when she fell.

761
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:19,460
That way,

762
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,170
no one would know

763
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:20,980
I was there,

764
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:21,570
or that

765
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:22,740
I touched the shoe.

766
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:26,170
It would prove

767
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:27,980
she died by accident.

768
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,340
Xi's father left the door open

769
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:33,340
when he ran out.

770
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:47,610
After leaving the shoe,

771
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:48,780
I was heading down

772
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,380
when I heard people

773
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:51,940
fighting in the stairwell.

774
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:52,780
They blocked it.

775
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:54,820
Carrying the shoe,

776
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:55,610
I was too conspicuous.

777
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:56,530
I didn't dare go down.

778
00:36:58,070 --> 00:36:58,940
Back on the 7th floor,

779
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:00,210
it was busy there too.

780
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:01,130
I had to head back up.

781
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,170
Then it hit me.

782
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,050
I still had

783
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:13,090
the key to Room 1006.

784
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,530
So I thought

785
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:22,980
I'd hide the shoe there

786
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,090
and retrieve it

787
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:26,260
later on.

788
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:36,460
I admit it.

789
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,300
I faked the evidence

790
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,690
of Xi's accidental death.

791
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:47,690
But I felt sorry for her.

792
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,650
I was afraid they wouldn't get paid.

793
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,300
I didn't want her death

794
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,650
to be for nothing.

795
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:02,820
But I didn't kill her.

796
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:05,690
I'd never kill her.

797
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:06,570
I had

798
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:07,980
no reason to.

799
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,170
You say she

800
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:23,740
unfastened the shoe herself?

801
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,420
And let go

802
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,860
of the bedsheet herself?

803
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:30,090
Yes.

804
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:33,170
Then how do you

805
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,300
explain the bedsheet

806
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:35,940
found next to her?

807
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:46,010
I... I don't know.

808
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:51,530
Maybe she pulled it down

809
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:53,130
as she fell.

810
00:38:54,110 --> 00:38:54,900
It was late,

811
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:56,170
and things were chaotic.

812
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,010
I panicked.

813
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:58,130
I can't remember

814
00:38:58,190 --> 00:38:59,130
every single detail.

815
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,090
You can't frame me

816
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:01,980
because of a bedsheet.

817
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,610
Lies always leave flaws.

818
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:29,090
Wang Chen's fingerprints

819
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,300
match the ones on

820
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:32,570
Zhai Xixi's left shoe.

821
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,860
But the blood on the laces

822
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,740
only belongs to Xi.

823
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:40,260
It's possible that

824
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,380
Xi tried to untie her laces.

825
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,820
When Wang Chen grabbed the shoe,

826
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:47,050
Xi's foot

827
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,530
had already slipped

828
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:49,210
out of it.

829
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:50,460
And she fell.

830
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,340
Fingerprints alone

831
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,260
don't prove whether

832
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:57,260
it was Wang Chen

833
00:39:57,510 --> 00:39:58,860
or Xi herself

834
00:39:58,920 --> 00:39:59,780
who untied the laces.

835
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:02,780
He's lying.

836
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,860
In extreme situations,

837
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:17,860
memories

838
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,210
can be inaccurate.

839
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:39,820
Since you knew

840
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,090
it was insurance fraud,

841
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:43,780
weren't you afraid?

842
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:49,340
Issuing that policy

843
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:52,900
was a professional lapse.

844
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,780
But that's my own problem.

845
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:00,420
As long as that shoe stays hidden,

846
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,130
no one but me and Xi

847
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:06,210
would know

848
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:07,420
the truth.

849
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:11,650
Then, her family

850
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:12,380
could at least get

851
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,170
the insurance payout.

852
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:15,380
And her brother

853
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,980
could afford his treatment.

854
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:23,420
Okay, you can go.

855
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:27,340
But for now

856
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,260
you can't leave the city.

857
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:30,740
Aiding insurance fraud

858
00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:32,170
is a criminal offense.

859
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:33,940
You must cooperate with us.

860
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,290
Got it.

861
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,460
You always think truth matters.

862
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:54,900
But I think you're wrong.

863
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:56,940
Sometimes,

864
00:41:58,110 --> 00:41:59,690
truth is meaningless.

865
00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:13,530
There's no truth in the world.

866
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:14,860
Only perspectives.

867
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:55,210
Mr. Qi.

868
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:56,780
Look at this.

869
00:42:58,110 --> 00:42:59,210
In Zhai Xixi's

870
00:42:59,230 --> 00:42:59,570
drawer,

871
00:42:59,590 --> 00:43:00,490
we found a pill bottle.

872
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:02,130
I analyzed the drugs.

873
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:03,940
They're the same as

874
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:04,820
the antidepressants

875
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:05,460
Li Shuting had.

876
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:10,210
And the bottle has similar imprints.

877
00:43:37,710 --> 00:43:39,420
Do antidepressants

878
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:41,170
attract people to light?

879
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,380
I checked Zhai Xixi's socials

880
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:44,820
and found a deleted chat group.

881
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:45,460
Xi?

882
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:46,820
Why was she in it?

883
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:49,570
I'm so glad we could all meet today.

884
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:50,780
The members here

885
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,130
are all suicidal.

886
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:53,530
She's the one who really cares.

887
00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:55,570
She wants us to live with meaning.

888
00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:57,740
This flower is used in anesthetics.

889
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:58,650
Used well, it's medicine.

890
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:00,300
Used wrong, it's poison.

891
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,010
Found a policy.

892
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:04,820
Coverage is also three million.

893
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,170
She might be next.
