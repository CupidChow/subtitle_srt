1
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:12,940
Aren't you a forensic?

2
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:14,810
What brings you to our squad?

3
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,330
What's your connections to
the Raw Diamond case?

4
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:23,580
None.

5
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,810
Then why'd you show up
at the trading spot?

6
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:31,900
Answer me!

7
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:33,300
Why did you come here?

8
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:17,950
Not just me.

9
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:19,790
Anyone here,

10
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:21,600
and even anyone Lanzi might

11
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:22,760
have met after she left,

12
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,600
could be the killer.

13
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:28,720
We're gonna check

14
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:29,950
every suspect.

15
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,790
But right now, you're our prime suspect.

16
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:38,840
In the autopsy report,

17
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:40,280
was there any

18
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:41,950
erosive bleeding?

19
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:50,630
Or any foreign objects
in Lanzi's stomach?

20
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:55,760
Please go ahead.

21
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:59,630
You've got a person
dead from cyanide poisoning,

22
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,070
but you can't

23
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:02,560
figure out when or where

24
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:05,070
the poison got slipped to her?

25
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:07,000
It means

26
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,950
the poison was already in her body.

27
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:15,230
You mean there's no killer?

28
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,600
Qiu Lanzi poisoned and killed herself?

29
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:23,510
You found my fingerprints

30
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,880
on that bottle of water.

31
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:26,840
But it's because

32
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,190
that one wasn't for Lanzi.

33
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:33,720
Ms. Zhu!

34
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:35,110
Ms. Zhu,

35
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,070
what did Mr. Qi say?

36
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:39,000
He thinks the cyanide

37
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:40,910
was already in Qiu Lanzi's body.

38
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:42,480
How did he know?

39
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:44,600
The report was turned in just now.

40
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:47,950
Have you heard of

41
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:48,950
remote case-solving?

42
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:50,840
It's to find out the truth

43
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:52,230
by analyzing crime scenes

44
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:53,880
and examining bodies
without physical presence.

45
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,760
Only a few forensic doctors can do this,

46
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,600
and Qi Sizhe is one of them.

47
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,230
Gao Yuan.

48
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:05,880
Check the stuff he used in the lab.

49
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,190
Then compare them
with that bottle of water.

50
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:09,110
Okay.

51
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,000
I go with you.

52
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,400
Did you transfer here

53
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:19,960
because of what happened before?

54
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:24,960
You followed Jiang Fei,

55
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:26,870
went to the bar,

56
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,230
and visited Li Yiqi in the hospital.

57
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:30,870
What do you wanna do?

58
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:33,720
I've told you.

59
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:35,670
That's not truth.

60
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:42,910
Han Feng.

61
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:44,960
You really think

62
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:47,480
I'd kill a forensic intern

63
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,280
I just met?

64
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,200
You know very well

65
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:56,670
it couldn't be me.

66
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,040
What I think matters not.

67
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:00,990
Figuring out the truth matters.

68
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:20,670
Since he's helping with the case,

69
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,720
maybe you could clue him in

70
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,480
on some of the stuff we've dug up,

71
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:27,520
just enough to

72
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:28,910
speed things along

73
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:30,670
and catch the killer faster.

74
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:33,350
Okay.

75
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:36,870
Mr. Gao.

76
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,310
Please test Mr. Qi's water

77
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:40,790
and effervescent tablets.

78
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:42,720
Tell us what you find out.

79
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:43,350
Okay.

80
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:44,160
Thank you.

81
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,230
Mr. Han. Ms. Zhu.

82
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:01,280
The results come out.

83
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:03,430
The report shows

84
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:04,520
each of their saliva

85
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:06,080
in the other's water.

86
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:09,310
So Qiu Lanzi took his water by mistake.

87
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:10,280
Yes.

88
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:12,840
The water Lanzi drank

89
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:14,350
should be Mr. Qi's soda water.

90
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:15,640
And in Mr. Qi's bag

91
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:16,870
was just mineral water.

92
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:21,230
Okay.

93
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:22,280
Gotta go.

94
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:31,110
Mr. Han. Ms. Zhu.

95
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:40,720
I've sure you've known why

96
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,720
my fingerprints were on
that bottle of water.

97
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:48,230
I wanna know why you said

98
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:50,040
the cyanide was already

99
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:50,960
in Qiu Lanzi's body.

100
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:54,990
I think Lanzi was usually on meds.

101
00:06:57,570 --> 00:06:59,430
We did find some
stomach meds in her bag.

102
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:01,200
What meds?

103
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:02,080
Omeprazole.

104
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,400
What else did the autopsy find?

105
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:07,670
Found two drug capsules in her stomach.

106
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,870
The shells looked melted,

107
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:11,350
and one of them had cracked open.

108
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:15,720
Last question.

109
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,310
How many pills are left
in her medicine bottle?

110
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:20,550
Just one.

111
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:36,720
I think I know

112
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:37,910
how Lanzi was murdered.

113
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,160
Lanzi's stomach med,

114
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,480
omeprazole, is an
enteric-coated capsule.

115
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:44,550
It's designed to pass through

116
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,840
the stomach without
breaking down in the acid,

117
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,400
then get absorbed

118
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,870
in the intestines
where things are more alkaline.

119
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:52,040
However,

120
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,720
it was found in her stomach.

121
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:56,280
Why?

122
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:59,600
Qiu Lanzi took your water by mistake.

123
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:01,310
It was soda water,

124
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,750
making the capsule dissolve quicker.

125
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:07,110
The coating on the capsules
is slow-release,

126
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,840
so they should start working within

127
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:09,480
4 to 12 hours.

128
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,080
But she drank soda,

129
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,350
and that cut the time

130
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:13,960
way short.

131
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,430
So the cyanide

132
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,110
was hidden in Lanzi's

133
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:18,670
stomach med capsules.

134
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:22,640
One of the two capsules in her stomach

135
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,400
had cracked open.

136
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,200
The killer must've noticed it too

137
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,350
when slipping cyanide

138
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:30,670
into the capsules.

139
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,030
Once the capsule coating

140
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:34,150
gets partly dissolved by the soda,

141
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:35,350
the cyanide inside

142
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:36,990
comes into contact with
the stomach lining.

143
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:39,600
The corrosive poison will definitely

144
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,480
cause erosive bleeding in there.

145
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:45,630
How to prove it?

146
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:50,680
There's still one pill left
in her medicine bottle.

147
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:51,990
Su.

148
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:06,680
I'm sorry, Ms. Zhao.

149
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:08,630
The cooperation with
He City is about to end,

150
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:09,680
and you're going abroad.

151
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,080
Sorry we have to call you back.

152
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,030
It's fine.

153
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:14,110
I'll be there if you need me.

154
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:15,600
So what happened?

155
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:16,600
What do you want me to check?

156
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:19,840
Mr. Qi figured

157
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:20,920
the victim might take

158
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,680
omeprazole capsules laced with cyanide,

159
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,200
but then drank soda by accident.

160
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:24,920
That made

161
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,200
the capsule dissolve in the stomach

162
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:27,200
instead of the intestines.

163
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:28,440
We've found

164
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:29,840
the capsules in her stomach.

165
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,630
So we need you here

166
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:33,870
to test one last pill

167
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:34,680
in the victim's

168
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:36,110
medicine bottle.

169
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:38,870
I got this.

170
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:39,840
Thank you.

171
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:10,510
How is it?

172
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,480
Ms. Zhao is testing the pill.

173
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,030
It needs some time.

174
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:18,320
Cross-check all the evidence

175
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:19,270
and don't miss any details.

176
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:20,600
I'll wait here.

177
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:21,230
Okay.

178
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:32,630
The dosage of omeprazole is

179
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:33,920
three pills a day,

180
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,750
one in the morning
and two in the evening.

181
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,840
If the killer wanted to

182
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:39,560
make sure Lanzi died

183
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:41,080
that very night,

184
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,840
he must've made certain

185
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:43,990
at least

186
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,600
one of the two pills

187
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:48,080
she took was poisoned.

188
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:50,510
If he only poisoned one pill,

189
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,630
Lanzi might not take it

190
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:54,320
until the second morning.

191
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:55,680
That's a one-in-three chance.

192
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:57,870
But if he poisoned three pills,

193
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,150
then there'd always be

194
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:01,840
one poisoned pill left

195
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:02,870
as evidence.

196
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:04,630
So,

197
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:05,870
poisoning exactly

198
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:07,720
two pills

199
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:09,270
was the sweet spot.

200
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,510
But if Qiu Lanzi

201
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,320
took both the poisoned ones,

202
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,110
we couldn't find anything

203
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,990
in the left one as evidence.

204
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,150
She's got a one-in-three chance of

205
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:22,440
swallowing both poisoned pills,

206
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:23,920
which means

207
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:26,030
the killer only has that same shot at

208
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:27,990
not leaving evidence in the medicine.

209
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,320
So we're just gambling on the last one.

210
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:44,350
We've got the result.

211
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,440
The pill indeed contains cyanide,

212
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,440
same as Mr. Qi supposed.

213
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:03,150
Mr. Qi, you're off the hook for now.

214
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:04,150
You can go.

215
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:09,750
Ms. Zhu.

216
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:11,150
I wanna help with the case

217
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:12,800
and find out Lanzi's murderer.

218
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:14,840
And,

219
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:17,030
something's off with Jiang Fei's

220
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:18,230
autopsy report.

221
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,920
I'm afraid you gotta stay outta

222
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:24,510
Jiang Fei and Qiu Lanzi's case.

223
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,320
I wanna see Jiang Fei's autopsy report.

224
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:31,990
You're not the only forensic here.

225
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:34,600
You don't gotta handle
every single case.

226
00:12:59,290 --> 00:12:59,870
Come in.

227
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:03,560
Mr. Bai.

228
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:10,800
Qi Sizhe is off the hook now?

229
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:11,630
Yes.

230
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:14,960
And he found out how Qiu Lanzi died?

231
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:22,320
Qi Sizhe is a brilliant forensic doctor.

232
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,320
And he's quite reasonable.

233
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:25,440
So he won't

234
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:28,200
blame you for the necessity of

235
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:30,110
your interrogation of him.

236
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:33,560
Mr. Bai.

237
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:35,350
Do you know about his past?

238
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,840
He had a severe car accident.

239
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:43,630
And I thought we'd lose

240
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:44,920
a talented forensic doctor.

241
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:46,840
But I never thought

242
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,510
he'd manage to hit rehab milestones

243
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,150
in just a year that usually

244
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,960
take others three to five years.

245
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:54,630
You can imagine

246
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,840
how much this position means to him.

247
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:02,200
But he's quite stubborn.

248
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,030
So is Han Feng.

249
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:05,990
Among you three,

250
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:08,230
you're the calmest
and most rational one.

251
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,230
So I hope you can

252
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,440
get them together

253
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:12,870
and handle cases.

254
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:23,270
Where's Xi?

255
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:26,230
I had her check 788 Bar's
security footage.

256
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:27,560
I still have some doubts.

257
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:30,320
We found the cyanide

258
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:32,680
in Qiu Lanzi's stomach meds.

259
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:34,720
The killer could

260
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:36,270
get close to her

261
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:37,720
and switch her meds.

262
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:39,350
So it could be someone

263
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:40,320
she knew all along.

264
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:44,920
Qiu Lanzi said something was off

265
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:46,390
with Jiang Fei's body.

266
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:47,870
Ask Mr. Gao to

267
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:50,030
check his autopsy report again.

268
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:51,560
Su.

269
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:53,200
Dig deeper into

270
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:54,840
the social circles around

271
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:55,960
Qiu Lanzi, Jiang Fei, and Li Yiqi,

272
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:57,110
especially Qiu Lanzi's connections.

273
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:57,750
Okay.

274
00:14:58,410 --> 00:14:58,920
Mr. Han.

275
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:00,680
Anything to add?

276
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:03,480
Nothing, for now.

277
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:02,750
Xi, got anything?

278
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,110
Yeah.

279
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:06,630
Half a month before Li Yiqi's case,

280
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:07,870
Mr. Qi showed up

281
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:09,680
at 788 Bar quite a few times.

282
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,720
I cross-checked a few security footages.

283
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:13,030
Every time Mr. Qi showed up,

284
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:13,750
Jiang Fei was there too.

285
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:15,800
Looks like

286
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:17,870
Mr. Qi was following Jiang Fei.

287
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:32,840
Ms. Zhu.

288
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:34,800
Here's Qi Sizhe's info.

289
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:37,960
He had a severe

290
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:38,840
accident two years ago.

291
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:40,320
A woman riding in his car

292
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:41,080
died on the spot.

293
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:46,200
Ms. Zhu.

294
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:47,480
Anything wrong with him?

295
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:49,270
Get back to work.

296
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:50,840
Yes.

297
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:21,990
Why did you come?

298
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:25,400
Why did you follow
Li Yiqi and Jiang Fei?

299
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,230
You know why.

300
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:40,920
'Cause it's related to Fei's death.

301
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,160
Raw Diamond...

302
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:55,750
You came for the Raw Diamond case.

303
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:00,960
Jiang Fei's death isn't an accident.

304
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:02,880
It's a murder.

305
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:11,750
His body was found

306
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:13,310
at 11:30 or so

307
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,030
in the morning.

308
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:16,230
It's the same as room temperature,

309
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:17,440
22 degrees.

310
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:18,550
He's got these

311
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:20,310
little square marks on his chest,

312
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:21,550
bright red.

313
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:24,200
And the lividity on the side of
the body is all patchy,

314
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,120
dark red.

315
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,200
Any problems?

316
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:27,360
The bright red lividity

317
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,830
doesn't match the estimated time

318
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:29,400
of death,

319
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:31,270
and the body's cooling rate is way off.

320
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:32,750
There are two possibilities.

321
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:33,720
First,

322
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:35,640
the killer was trying to mess with

323
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:36,480
the time of death.

324
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:37,590
Second,

325
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,510
the way the murder was done

326
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:41,360
messed with the body's temperature.
(Watch on www.kisskh,id to support Admin)

327
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:42,790
And I think

328
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:44,440
the second one's way more likely.

329
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,480
So my guess is,

330
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:48,720
Jiang Fei probably...

331
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:49,960
Froze to death?

332
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:51,880
At his own home?

333
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:53,360
But his place

334
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:54,510
doesn't have such an environment.

335
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:56,640
There is one.

336
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:06,750
No way.

337
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,030
It's too small.

338
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:14,680
If the killer stuffed Jiang Fei

339
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:15,830
into the fridge,

340
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,030
there gotta be

341
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:19,990
a lot of scratches and marks

342
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:20,880
on Jiang Fei's body.

343
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:22,160
But so far,

344
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:23,510
there aren't any

345
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:24,400
such marks on the body.

346
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:26,790
Only lividity.

347
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:29,790
Lividity is the marks formed by blood

348
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,790
due to gravity at the dripping points.

349
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:33,880
Jiang Fei was lying on his side

350
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:34,680
when he died.

351
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:35,680
So,

352
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:38,200
the lividity should only
have formed on the side.

353
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:39,640
But look here.

354
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:42,750
There are bright red marks

355
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:45,030
on Jiang Fei's chest.

356
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:47,750
Also, when Jiang Fei died,

357
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:50,310
his clothes were all wrinkled.

358
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:52,360
His clothes look like they got wet

359
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,790
and then dried off...

360
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:57,120
His fingers and toes were

361
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:57,880
all wrinkled,

362
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,230
a result of

363
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:00,480
prolonged soaking in water

364
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:01,750
and osmosis.

365
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:03,440
Jiang Fei was

366
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,830
always a slob,

367
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,200
so it's no wonder
his clothes were wrinkled.

368
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:08,830
When we found the body,

369
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,640
there was water
at the bottom of the bathtub.

370
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:12,120
The wrinkles on his skin were

371
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:14,120
probably caused by soaking in the water.

372
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:15,510
Well, going by your logic,

373
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:17,590
his fingers and toes shouldn't

374
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:18,640
have gotten wrinkly

375
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:19,550
since they haven't touched

376
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,160
the water at the bottom of the tub.

377
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:23,070
But turns out that's not what happened.

378
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:32,480
So Jiang Fei didn't

379
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:33,830
freeze to death in a freezer,

380
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:35,720
but in the...

381
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:38,920
In the bathtub.

382
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,360
The window in

383
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:48,510
Jiang Fei's bathroom

384
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:50,200
has always been open.

385
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:10,990
When the body was found,

386
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:12,880
the ice had already melted,

387
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:15,070
but there were frostbite

388
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:16,160
marks on the body.

389
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:17,440
The bright red mark

390
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:19,680
on his chest is

391
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:21,550
the best proof.

392
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:23,720
This is also caused by

393
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,230
the failure of

394
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,880
various organs at low temperatures.

395
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:32,160
Judging from the traces at the scene,

396
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:33,790
everything matches

397
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:35,030
what Mr. Qi said.

398
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:36,720
Got it.

399
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:40,880
Han Feng.

400
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:42,830
Are you buying

401
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,590
that Jiang Fei's
death wasn't an accident

402
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:46,790
but murder now?

403
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,750
If Mr. Qi's reasoning

404
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:00,510
holds up,

405
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:02,360
we gotta check this place

406
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:03,720
for any signs of

407
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:05,160
a second person.

408
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:07,160
Search more thoroughly.

409
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:06,160
I wanna learn more from you

410
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:07,920
and become a great
forensic doctor like you!

411
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:27,400
Ms. Zhu.

412
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:30,720
Any progress

413
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:31,880
in Jiang Fei's case?

414
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:34,960
You've been cleared of suspicion.

415
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:36,440
So why still look into Jiang Fei?

416
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,830
I know you're really
concerned about Jiang Fei's case

417
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:41,400
and Li Yiqi's case.

418
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:43,440
I also know

419
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:45,440
you can lead us closer to the truth.

420
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:47,360
But so far,

421
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:49,960
you haven't explained

422
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:51,590
the coincidences of your appearance

423
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:52,830
in these two cases.

424
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:55,790
And this time,

425
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:59,120
why did you go to
investigate Jiang Fei alone?

426
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:04,400
I want you to answer my question.

427
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:07,160
And I'm not gonna answer any questions

428
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:08,790
related to this case

429
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:10,230
until I trust you.

430
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:13,440
Ms. Zhu.

431
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,120
I'm a forensic doctor.

432
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:18,310
When someone dies,

433
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:22,200
only forensic doctors can tell what they

434
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:25,160
went through before they died.

435
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:27,590
And I believe

436
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:29,030
whoever it is,

437
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,720
even drug dealers like Jiang Fei,

438
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,790
they all deserve the truth.

439
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:36,790
I saw the possibility

440
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,920
of homicide in Jiang Fei's case.

441
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:43,230
So I gotta figure out the truth.

442
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:47,720
But he's quite stubborn.

443
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,590
So is Han Feng.

444
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:51,360
So I hope you can

445
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:53,030
get them together

446
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:54,480
and handle cases.

447
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,990
So Jiang Fei died

448
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:02,310
a little after 4 am?

449
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:03,830
Yes.

450
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:05,990
If he froze to death,

451
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,200
his body temperature

452
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:08,400
was lower than normal.

453
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:09,720
So the time it takes to cool down

454
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:10,440
would be shorter.

455
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:15,070
Mr. Han.

456
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:16,880
Mr. Qi inferred

457
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:18,070
that Jiang Fei froze to death.

458
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:20,030
Let him tell us about it.

459
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:31,360
All we know is

460
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:32,590
that Jiang Fei

461
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:34,680
was frozen to death by the killer,

462
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:36,070
but there aren't any clues

463
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:36,960
to find the killer.

464
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:42,030
The killer made Jiang Fei

465
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:43,270
take cephalosporin

466
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:44,960
when he was drunk,

467
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:46,720
causing a disulfiram-like reaction.

468
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,750
Then, when he was unconscious,

469
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:50,830
the killer froze his body with ice,

470
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:53,120
which led to the failure of all his

471
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:55,400
internal organs,
especially his heart, and he died.

472
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:57,640
It shows that the killer
has some knowledge

473
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:58,640
human physiology.

474
00:26:59,220 --> 00:26:59,880
Mr. Gao,

475
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:02,200
after the first autopsy and test,

476
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:03,510
what was in his stomach

477
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:04,510
as food residue?

478
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:07,790
Wine and sausage,

479
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:08,720
no cephalosporin.

480
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:10,640
But the cephalosporin on his table

481
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:11,550
was already opened,

482
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:13,310
and the pharmacological
test detected it.

483
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:16,270
The sausage wasn't digested,

484
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:18,550
which means the last thing

485
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:19,880
the victim ate was

486
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:20,550
the sausage.

487
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:31,230
Have you found a knife there?

488
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:33,120
No.

489
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,120
There are cuts on the sausage

490
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:37,310
but no knife around.

491
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:39,310
Could someone have taken it?

492
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:41,590
Jiang Fei's body didn't have

493
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,510
a scratch on it.

494
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:44,310
The knife couldn't be the murder weapon.

495
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:45,830
So why'd the killer take it away?

496
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,230
Did you guys do luminol

497
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:50,920
at the scene?

498
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:00,550
There are no cuts on the body,

499
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,510
but the killer had to take the knife

500
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:03,590
from the scene.

501
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:04,750
That means...

502
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:06,990
The knife wasn't used on the victim.

503
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:07,960
But on the killer.

504
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:46,790
If this isn't Jiang Fei's blood,

505
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:48,830
then it gotta be the killer's.

506
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,030
Why didn't you ask Mr. Qi to

507
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:00,120
do the bloodstain comparison?

508
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:04,230
The results are out.

509
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:06,120
No records matching in the database.

510
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:08,030
Thank you.

511
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:22,920
So here's the timeline of these cases.

512
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:24,400
On the evening of the 7th,

513
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:26,400
Qiu Lanzi joined us investigating

514
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:29,030
the 788 Bar assault case.

515
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:31,830
Then she teamed up
with Mr. Gao and Mr. Qi

516
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:32,790
for the Li Yiqi's

517
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:35,030
blood sample analysis

518
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:36,030
until the next day.

519
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:36,830
We found

520
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:38,880
Jiang Fei's body at noon the next day,

521
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:40,680
and Qiu Lanzi showed up later.

522
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:42,880
That night, she, Mr. Qi and Mr. Gao

523
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:44,830
dissected Jiang Fei's body.

524
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,160
We found the remains of stomach meds

525
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:49,680
in Qiu Lanzi's stomach.

526
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:51,830
Based on the dissolution
rate of the meds

527
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:53,400
and the timeline,

528
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:55,830
Qiu Lanzi should've
taken the stomach meds

529
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,030
between the time

530
00:29:57,050 --> 00:29:59,030
after the dissection of Jiang Fei's body

531
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:01,120
and her death.

532
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,270
The first time
Qiu Lanzi left the station

533
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:04,310
and met me

534
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:05,720
was around 9 pm.

535
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:07,070
Two hours later,

536
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:08,750
I got a call from Qiu Lanzi.

537
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:09,920
She said she'd

538
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:11,750
found a lead on Jiang Fei's body.

539
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:13,480
Ten minutes later,

540
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:15,590
when Mr. Han and I
got to the forensic office,

541
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:16,880
we found her body.

542
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:20,030
The stomach medicine was found among

543
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:20,550
her belongings.

544
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:21,680
She usually kept her stuff

545
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,640
in the locker in the changing room.

546
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:25,790
Got anything from
the surveillance over there?

547
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:27,680
No cameras on the floor.

548
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:29,720
There are just people
going to and from work there.

549
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,120
And Mr. Bai means we shouldn't

550
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:33,790
expand the investigation for now.

551
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:35,960
He wants us to narrow down
the suspects first.

552
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:43,830
So the most likely time

553
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:46,480
for Qiu Lanzi to take the pills is

554
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:47,960
between the time

555
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:49,920
she left the station and came back.

556
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:51,640
We just don't know

557
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:52,920
where she went and who she met.

558
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:02,160
What about Jiang Fei?

559
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:04,790
Don't forget

560
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:06,480
Qiu Lanzi said she had info about

561
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:09,120
Jiang Fei's cause of death
before she died.

562
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:12,400
Jiang Fei went home after getting drunk.

563
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:13,790
Where did he drink

564
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:14,830
and who did he drink with?

565
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:15,590
Have you found out?

566
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:17,360
He didn't use mobile payment or cards.

567
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,400
He always used cash,

568
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:20,830
so it's hard to find
his consumption records.

569
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:22,960
People like him are always

570
00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:24,990
afraid of leaving any clues.

571
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:28,160
Wan,

572
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,310
let's go to the bar to check

573
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:32,230
Jiang Fei's movements before he drank.

574
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:33,440
Xi,

575
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:34,830
go and find out

576
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:36,510
who Qiu Lanzi met

577
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:37,680
after she left the station.

578
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:38,510
Let's split up.

579
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:39,680
Okay.

580
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:45,030
Do as Mr. Han says.

581
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:02,830
It's here, Mr. Han.

582
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,750
No, Mr. Han...

583
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:43,640
You're in charge here?

584
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:45,640
This is legit business.

585
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:47,030
Legit business?

586
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:48,310
Then why so serious,

587
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:49,640
needing a guide to find here?

588
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:51,030
Oh, come on!

589
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:52,120
This is a gimmick.

590
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:54,960
More people will wanna come in

591
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:56,990
if they need someone to bring them in.

592
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:57,880
That's smart.

593
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:00,960
Since it's so complicated to get here,

594
00:33:01,090 --> 00:33:02,830
you should know who came here

595
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:03,990
the day before yesterday, right?

596
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:05,070
Sir.

597
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:06,880
How the heck can I remember

598
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:08,310
all these guests every day?

599
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,480
Take us to the security room.

600
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:10,920
Sir.

601
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:12,790
You need a warrant to do so.

602
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:15,310
A warrant, huh?

603
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:17,120
I'm gonna call my buddies

604
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:18,550
from Public Security Brigade

605
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:20,120
and let them check it out.

606
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:25,440
Sir.

607
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:27,550
You can check whatever you want.

608
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:33,480
We checked Jiang Fei's social circles.

609
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:34,480
Super complicated.

610
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:36,360
He's lived in cities
all over the country.

611
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:37,790
A drug dealer like him's gonna

612
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:38,990
have a lot of enemies.

613
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:41,440
If we just look at
the motives for murder,

614
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:42,640
there are a bunch of suspects.

615
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:43,880
Here's

616
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,230
his hidden ledger we found.

617
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:47,480
There are up to
40 drug addicts listed in it,

618
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:49,070
not to mention those

619
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,830
who bought imitation guns,
plasma, and illegal drugs.

620
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:53,360
Ms. Zhu.

621
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:54,990
This is Qiu Lanzi's phone.

622
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:57,270
Got anything?

623
00:33:57,810 --> 00:33:59,640
I checked Qiu Lanzi's call records.

624
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,830
After she left at 9 o'clock,

625
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:03,960
she made four consecutive calls
within five minutes,

626
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:05,680
and they were all to the same person.

627
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:07,030
Who?

628
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,360
It's a chemical factory's lab.

629
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:10,990
But it was off-work time then,

630
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:12,240
and she called the switchboard,

631
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:14,440
so we still can't find out
who she contacted.

632
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:16,480
We gotta find out what relationship

633
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:18,760
this factory has with Qiu Lanzi.

634
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:19,400
Okay.

635
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:20,190
Ms. Zhu.

636
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:23,630
Have you checked Qiu Lanzi's phone?

637
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:25,710
Xi just gave it to me.

638
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:26,990
I watched the videos

639
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:28,800
of Qiu Lanzi before
and after she left here.

640
00:34:29,090 --> 00:34:30,320
She never stopped checking her phone.

641
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:34,400
I remembered that Mr. Han told me

642
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:37,110
when he saw Qiu Lanzi that day,

643
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:38,880
she was also anxiously
checking her phone.

644
00:34:40,170 --> 00:34:42,150
There must be some clues on her phone.

645
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,110
She just didn't

646
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:45,280
have time to tell us then.

647
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:51,400
Stop.

648
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:54,880
Who's the girl drinking

649
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:55,400
with Jiang Fei?

650
00:34:58,010 --> 00:34:59,590
Jiang Fei had introduced her to us.

651
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:01,320
Zhang Lu, I remember.

652
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:02,590
She's into Lolita fashion,

653
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,360
close to Jiang Fei.

654
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:07,400
She took photos of Jiang Fei's body?

655
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:09,550
But phones are forbidden
in the dissection room...

656
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:12,840
Maybe she had some reason.

657
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:16,320
Check out these last three photos.

658
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:17,710
The first two

659
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:20,240
are of the tattoo on Jiang Fei's arm,

660
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:22,280
one taken without a black light,

661
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:23,920
and the other with a black light.

662
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:25,480
And the last one

663
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:27,480
is of the skin on his wrist.

664
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:30,760
Also, the first two
were taken at the same time.

665
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:34,510
But there's a gap of
over 20 minutes before the last one.

666
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:37,320
Why did she wait over 20 minutes to

667
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:40,030
take a photo of the skin on the wrist

668
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:41,880
without a black light?

669
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:45,320
What did she find out?

670
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:48,960
I saw some illegal stuff

671
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,070
in the bar near Ruixi Building.

672
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:53,240
I just saw it when working.

673
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:55,030
It's fine. You're welcome.

674
00:35:55,130 --> 00:35:55,880
Treat me to dinner then.

675
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:02,030
Wan.

676
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:03,670
Thank you.

677
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:06,550
It's nothing.

678
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:08,840
Ms. Zhu asked me

679
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:10,240
to investigate with you.

680
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:11,510
No need to say that.

681
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:22,480
I saw Qiu Lanzi taking

682
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,240
those photos,

683
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,880
but I just glanced and left.

684
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:28,320
I was in the next room with Ms. Zhao

685
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:29,510
taking samples

686
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:31,190
for toxicology testing.

687
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,550
If you also left,

688
00:36:34,090 --> 00:36:35,960
then Lanzi was the only one
left in the autopsy room.

689
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,030
But when she was taking the photos,

690
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:42,760
she asked me what this was.

691
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:44,800
What is this?

692
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:47,800
It should be an old injury

693
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:49,760
or a mark left after
having a tattoo removed.

694
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:51,440
No.

695
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:53,550
It seems to be a fluorescent tattoo.

696
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:09,920
There are two photos of
the tattoo on the left forearm,

697
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:11,070
one in natural color

698
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:12,150
and the other under a black light.

699
00:37:14,050 --> 00:37:16,030
If we follow the logic of
the previous two photos,

700
00:37:16,090 --> 00:37:16,880
there should be

701
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:18,960
another black-light photo.

702
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:26,070
There are lots of group photos

703
00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:27,840
of Jiang Fei with
different girls on his phone,

704
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:28,960
and one of them is

705
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,800
Zhang Lu, the girl
we've been looking for.

706
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:32,800
Zhang Lu, 24 years old,

707
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:34,590
living in Xinhua Road, He City,

708
00:37:34,610 --> 00:37:36,760
an intern researcher at
an inorganic chemistry institute,

709
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:37,960
majored in chemistry.

710
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:39,760
She knows Qiu Lanzi.

711
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,030
They were high school classmates,

712
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:42,710
so they rented an room

713
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:43,880
and were roommates shortly.

714
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:46,550
In the call records we retrieved,

715
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,510
the last call Qiu Lanzi made

716
00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:50,280
was to Zhang Lu's workplace.

717
00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:06,280
You said you saw Zhang Lu

718
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:08,110
and Qiu Lanzi arguing that day, right?

719
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:08,880
Yeah.

720
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,590
I did see them arguing.

721
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:16,150
But I didn't catch what

722
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:17,480
they were arguing about.

723
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:23,320
When I left,

724
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:25,320
I saw that girl wasn't feeling well

725
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:27,480
and took some medicine.

726
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:31,110
Are you sure Qiu Lanzi
took medicine at that time?

727
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:32,150
I'm sure.

728
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:43,630
Where's Zhang Lu?

729
00:38:44,570 --> 00:38:45,070
Mr. Han.

730
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:46,880
We've been searching for her

731
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:47,920
with your info.

732
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:57,800
Excuse me.

733
00:38:58,380 --> 00:38:59,880
Your ID card and driving license please.

734
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:01,070
Please open your trunk.

735
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:09,320
You're Zhang Lu, right?

736
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:12,110
Zhang Lu.

737
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:14,030
Please cooperate with us.

738
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:33,190
Zhang Lu, 24 years old.

739
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:34,920
A researcher of the chemistry institute

740
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:35,710
in He City.

741
00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:37,400
Were you at the basement bar

742
00:39:37,690 --> 00:39:38,710
in Yunjin Building with Jiang Fei

743
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:39,710
on the evening of

744
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:40,840
August 7th?

745
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:42,800
Yeah.

746
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:45,670
Then did you go home with him?

747
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:46,840
No.

748
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:48,320
I just had a few drinks

749
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:49,400
and went back to my own place.

750
00:39:49,610 --> 00:39:50,630
Is there anyone who can prove it?

751
00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:53,760
Prove it? Why?

752
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:55,320
I live alone.

753
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:56,590
How can there be a witness?

754
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:57,920
So no one can prove

755
00:39:58,010 --> 00:39:59,240
you stayed at

756
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:00,590
your own place that night.

757
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:07,190
What was Jiang Fei's state when you

758
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:09,320
saw him for the last time?

759
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:10,590
He...

760
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:15,760
He seemed to catch cold.

761
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:18,590
You're out

762
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:19,760
drinking with a cold?

763
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:25,550
Do you even know that
mixing antibiotics with alcohol

764
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:26,630
could kill you?

765
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:30,240
But I just really wanted to

766
00:40:30,730 --> 00:40:31,550
have a drink with you.

767
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:38,840
How'd you hurt your finger?

768
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:40,240
Cut it during

769
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:42,710
an experiment.

770
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:44,280
What did Qiu Lanzi say

771
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:45,190
when she came to the lab?

772
00:40:47,090 --> 00:40:48,240
What'd she tell you guys?

773
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:50,190
Isn't she interning here?

774
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:51,440
Call her over!

775
00:40:51,610 --> 00:40:52,480
I'll confront her!

776
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:53,590
Qiu Lanzi's dead.

777
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:56,840
Did you kill her?

778
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:58,800
Dead...

779
00:41:00,050 --> 00:41:01,630
How... How come...

780
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:09,480
Zhang Lu,

781
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:10,670
now we suspect

782
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:12,480
you're the prime suspect
in the murder cases

783
00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:13,320
of Qiu Lanzi and Jiang Fei.

784
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:14,760
Got anything to say?

785
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:17,710
If Zhang Lu's blood sample

786
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:18,880
matches the one we took

787
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:20,070
from Jiang Fei's place,

788
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:22,030
she's most likely

789
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,630
the killer.

790
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:26,110
I didn't!

791
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:27,440
I never killed anyone!

792
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:28,960
I didn't... I really didn't!

793
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:29,840
Then just answer

794
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:30,590
our questions!

795
00:41:31,170 --> 00:41:32,240
What did she say to you?

796
00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:34,110
She...

797
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:36,070
She told me

798
00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:39,150
Jiang Fei was dead,

799
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:41,920
and she saw my name

800
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:44,590
on the body...

801
00:41:56,090 --> 00:41:56,590
How is it?

802
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:57,880
Wait a moment.

803
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:14,150
Ms. Zhu.

804
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:15,840
The result is out.

805
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:20,990
Mr. Han.

806
00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:25,030
It matches.

807
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:27,800
Su.

808
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:28,590
Arrest her.

809
00:42:30,610 --> 00:42:31,550
Xi, untie her.

810
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:32,400
It's her.

811
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:33,400
No...

812
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:35,070
Not me!

813
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:37,280
I didn't kill them!

814
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:38,590
I didn't!

815
00:42:38,650 --> 00:42:39,440
It's not me!

816
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:40,510
It's really not me!

817
00:42:40,610 --> 00:42:42,240
I never killed anyone!

818
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:43,240
It's not me!

819
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:44,110
I didn't!

820
00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:44,760
Don't arrest me!

821
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:45,280
Please!

822
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:45,880
It's not me!

823
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:46,590
You got

824
00:42:46,610 --> 00:42:47,280
the wrong person!

825
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:48,190
It's not me!

826
00:42:48,530 --> 00:42:49,320
Not me!

827
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:49,960
Really not!

828
00:42:50,090 --> 00:42:50,960
I didn't kill them!

829
00:42:51,010 --> 00:42:51,880
You got the wrong person!

830
00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:53,150
It's not me!

831
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:54,440
Not me!

832
00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:03,510
We got the wrong person.

833
00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:07,550
It's not her.

834
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:31,800
Raw Diamond case is over!

835
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:33,590
You just can't deal with reality!

836
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:35,710
You never figured out Fei's death!

837
00:43:36,050 --> 00:43:37,030
Li Yiqi. Jiang Fei.

838
00:43:37,170 --> 00:43:38,670
They're the clue from the case!

839
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:40,240
Hey! Stop!

840
00:43:42,130 --> 00:43:42,990
There's an opening here.

841
00:43:43,050 --> 00:43:44,110
The kidnapped girl was

842
00:43:44,210 --> 00:43:45,240
probably taken inside.

843
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:48,480
The killer set this up

844
00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:49,510
to throw us off

845
00:43:49,610 --> 00:43:51,440
about the cause of death.

846
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:53,030
He knows way too much about

847
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:53,800
forensic,

848
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:55,590
autopsies, even our

849
00:43:55,610 --> 00:43:56,590
police procedures.

850
00:43:56,690 --> 00:43:57,880
Wait, are you saying...

851
00:43:58,130 --> 00:43:59,190
The killer is one of us?
