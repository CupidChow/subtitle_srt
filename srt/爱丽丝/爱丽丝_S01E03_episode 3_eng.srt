1
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,850
 There is no coincidence in fate.

2
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:37,450
 A man makes fate himself...

3
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:40,440
 before he meets it.

4
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,910

5
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,870
The notion of time and space

6
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:48,120
is like a series of snapshots

7
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,180
that record the changes in space as time progresses.

8
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:54,070
Therefore, speed

9
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:56,920
is defined by the distance over time,

10
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,500
and in order for the speed of light to be consistent,

11
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,620
the time has to slow down.

12
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:05,140
In 1908, Minkowski said

13
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:08,200
in the lecture that is still famous today...

14
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:16,000

15
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:24,160
This...

16
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,840
is a diagram that was created 100 years ago.

17
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:30,300
It was created in a time where there were no cellphones and internet.

18
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:35,010
But you're struggling to understand something that's a century old.

19
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:38,350
As students who study physics and aspire to become scientists,

20
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:40,270
aren't you ashamed?

21
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:41,890
100 years from now...

22
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:45,510
Do you want to learn theories that are centuries old?

23
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:52,540
Hey!

24
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:54,880
Can't you guys understand this?

25
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,100
If you can't even understand this, how do you have the guts to be physics majors?

26
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,610
You're all idiots!

27
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,560
Who are you?

28
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,900
What are you doing?

29
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,130
What is this?

30
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:09,030
You pervert! Where do you think you are?

31
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:12,610
Hey! Lock the back doors! Call the cops!

32
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,590
You've got the wrong person!

33
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:21,970
Harassing someone in this day and age? And in a lecture hall of all places?

34
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:23,610
Hello?

35
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:25,430
Yes! Is this the police station?

36
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:26,790
Take pictures!

37
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:28,960

38
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,310
Are you really a cop?

39
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:35,480
This isn't a fake?

40
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,670
It's not.

41
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:40,620
Then, did you confuse me with someone else?

42
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,820
I wasn't confused.

43
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,900
Then, why did you do that?

44
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:52,050
Do you know who I am and what my name is?

45
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:55,150
You're Park Jin Gyeom.

46
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:57,990
How... did you know?

47
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:01,140

48
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,490
Do they pick random people to be police officers these days?

49
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:05,710
Don't you have to take an exam?

50
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:16,330
May I ask... what your age is?

51
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:18,640
Why are you asking something like that?

52
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,410
Are you over 50?

53
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:27,560
What are you saying?

54
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,250
Were you born in 1968?

55
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:31,580
Can't you tell by looking at me?

56
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,640
Did you ever give birth to a son?

57
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,370
Seriously!

58
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:39,240
You're a cop, then you should know. Even if I hit you right now, I'd still be innocent!

59
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,930
If you don't want me to hit you, get out of here immediately! Immediately!

60
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,570
She's a genius who graduated high school early, at the age of 15

61
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:49,150
and got accepted as Hanguk University's physics major at the top of her class.

62
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:50,930
She got her Ph.D. at 23,

63
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:54,290
and worked at the Advanced Science Research Center as a researcher.

64
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:57,200
She even published a book,

65
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,140
but she got into a big argument with the chief and quit.

66
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,520
What kind of research was it?

67
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,520
I was trying to find that out, too.

68
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,590
But no one knows what kind of research she did.

69
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:11,190
Even her parents didn't know what their daughter was researching.

70
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:12,440
What about her family relations?

71
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,950
She has parents and a younger sister. Her parents own a Chinese restaurant.

72
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,460
Their restaurant...

73
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:20,700
is on the corner right across the street from our station.

74
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:29,350
Here.

75
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:37,070
Enjoy.

76
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,830
Thank you.

77
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:42,380
Should we have dinner, too?

78
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:46,300
I told you it's a misunderstanding. All I did was sing!

79
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:49,220
The only thing I held was the karaoke mic!

80
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,930
Goodness.

81
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:58,040
Would you like some more radish?

82
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,870
That's okay.

83
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:10,340
- Why are you here again? 
 - Mom, just this once...

84
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:12,190
I need to pay the downpayment by tomorrow.

85
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:13,820
I can't...

86
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:16,060
I don't even have any money to choke on and die...

87
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:17,780
Mom!

88
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:20,530
Why don't you just help her?

89
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:24,620
Oh right... We don't have any money. Youngest, we don't have any money.

90
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:27,350
You be quiet, Dad.

91
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:30,180
Mom, please help me become independent.

92
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,970
Are you an independence army soldier? Why are you always trying to be independent?

93
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:34,980
I really can't live with Tae Yi anymore!

94
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,660
She's eating me alive.

95
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:40,190
If you find my dead body one day, Tae Yi is the killer.

96
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:43,420
Listen to this girl talk.

97
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:46,900
Look at the way you're dressed! If I was the manager, I would fire you!

98
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,920
I wear a uniform at the bank.

99
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,110
Also, our branch can't get anything done without me.

100
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:54,220
Hey, hey, hey. If you can't live with your sister, come live at home. Come, come, come!

101
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:56,210
Why do you always play favorites?

102
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:59,120
You do everything that Sis asks for, so why don't you do anything for me?

103
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,410
What have you done for me? You haven't done anything for me, either!

104
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:06,100
You spent all the money you made on your trips.

105
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,670
What kind of mom are you?

106
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:10,180
What kind of daughter are you?

107
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:13,330
Oh, why are you leaving without finishing your food?

108
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:15,370
I finished.

109
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:22,070
Thank you. Come again.

110
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,380
He's handsome. Is he a regular?

111
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:45,070
What?

112
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:49,880
Why are the police investigating my sister?

113
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,200
Did she get in some kind of trouble?

114
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,650
Or... is she in danger?

115
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:58,400
It's not a big problem, so you don't have to worry.

116
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,770
I have a few things that I'd like to ask about the professor...

117
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:05,480
Didn't something special happen to the professor in 2010?

118
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:09,390
In 2010... she was 22...

119
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:12,320
That's when she was attending grad school. There was nothing special.

120
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,970
Didn't she act like a completely different person?

121
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:20,230
No, she was always consistently full of herself.

122
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:22,840
What do you...

123
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,070
You said you met her.

124
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:27,770
You can tell how full of herself she is just from one meeting.

125
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:31,800
I know her to have a great personality.

126
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,800
- Is this not true? 
 - It's not true.

127
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:37,660
Is she not someone who is kind, warm,

128
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:41,040
and loves children? Is that not right?

129
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:44,020
My sister?

130
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:46,540
Tae Yoon, beer!

131
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:59,650
Don't you think you're a bit much?

132
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:02,830
Am I your maid? Do you think you own me?

133
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:04,540
So?

134
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:11,460
So, I plan to go grocery shopping. Do you want some food to eat with the beer?

135
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,860
Go.

136
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:19,400
That's right. A cop came to see me.

137
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,640
Who is he? He was hot.

138
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,390
Do you think that's the right question?

139
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:30,290
You're the one who met that cop. Why are you asking me who he is?

140
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:32,800
How could a brainless moron like you work at a bank?

141
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,670
That's more mysterious than the mysteries of outer space.

142
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:38,810
Park Jin Gyeom from Seoul Nambu Police Station. Don't you know him?

143
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:40,960
Why did that pervert come to see you?

144
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:44,500
Is he a pervert? Wait. How do you know he's a pervert?

145
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:48,050
Right? That is an unknown to me as well.

146
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:49,830
An unknown value.

147
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:53,390
Is Kaprekar's constant the answer? Hold on. 
  (T/N: 6174 is known as Kaprekar's constant)

148
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:56,550
1981 is 98 plus 01.

149
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:58,370
But that cop...

150
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:00,480
knew you very well.

151
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,660
He was saying this and that about you...

152
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:05,090
It was all right, except about your personality.

153
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:06,010
What?

154
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:09,340
He knows that you don't eat ramen, you drink a lot of water when you eat,

155
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:13,180
and that you like spicy seafood noodle soup and cold noodles.

156
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,690
How?

157
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:18,630

158
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:32,130
Mom,

159
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:39,260
please explain... what's going on.

160
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:55,400
The time card wasn't submitted to the police as evidence.

161
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,600
Thankfully, it appears that Park Jin Gyeom has it.

162
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,230
Did you look into him?

163
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:01,740
Yes.

164
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:07,520
According to the data received, they were unable to find out who his father is

165
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,600
and his mother died in 2010.

166
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,990
He entered the Police Academy and is currently a lieutenant at the Seoul Nambu Police Station.

167
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:18,750
One thing stands out.  He was diagnosed with Alexithymia when he was six.

168
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:21,140
Alexithymia? The inability to feel emotions?

169
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,970
Yes, that's correct.

170
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:24,440
Who are these people?

171
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,890
That's the captain of his team and his wife.

172
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:30,870
Park Jin Gyeom has lived with them since he was 20 until last year.

173
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:32,690
- Are they related? 
 - No, Sir.

174
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:34,910
His mother was an orphan, so he had no relatives.

175
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:37,400
Then, why did they live together?

176
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:41,010
It was a very long time ago, so we're still investigating.

177
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:43,350
Okay, that's enough.

178
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:45,540
Let's retrieve the time card tonight.

179
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:48,710
Can we? He's a police officer.

180
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:51,670
It doesn't matter what he is.

181
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:56,080
So? Where is Park Jin Gyeom now?

182
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:07,650

183
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:12,810

184
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:17,050

185
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:54,180
Mr. Park Jin Gyeom, please return the card.

186
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:05,050
What card?

187
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:07,780
We know you have it.

188
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,320
This?

189
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,330
Yes, that one. You shouldn't have that thing with you.

190
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:19,230
Try taking it away.

191
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:45,860
Who are you people?

192
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:55,170
Retrieve the time card first.

193
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,090
You guys get to the car first.

194
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,090
I guess you guys call that the time card.

195
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:26,140
I shouldn't keep you alive.

196
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:38,120
 I think it's the same gun as the one that was used to kill your mother.

197
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:05,280
Mr. Yoo, the police heard the gunshots and are on their way here.

198
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,670
We need to leave immediately.

199
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:12,220
Don't ever think about trying to find us.

200
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:15,500
Since luck won't be on your side like it was today.

201
00:17:56,380 --> 00:18:01,110

202
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:03,220
Hello.

203
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:06,590
Aigoo, Professor Yoon, welcome!

204
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,880
Have you had a good weekend?

205
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,120
Why are you curious about that?

206
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,390
- Sit down, sit. 
 - Okay.

207
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:16,090
Ah, I was just wondering as to if something happened to you.

208
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:18,460
Will you solve my problem, if I have one?

209
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:21,960
No, it's not that.

210
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:27,300
I have a favor to ask of you.

211
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:31,390
I heard a student fell through in your joint research project recently?

212
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:32,920
What about that?

213
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:36,320
So... a professor I know has a nephew.

214
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,450
He majors in something similar.

215
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:46,070
You understand what I'm saying, right?

216
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:47,810
No, I don't understand at all.

217
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:50,520
I do hear words, but I don't understand what you're saying.

218
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:54,620
So what I'm saying is, when you publish the thesis,

219
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:58,570
could you include just the professor's nephew's name?

220
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:03,370
- That was what you were talking about... 
 - That's right!

221
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:07,600
- Do that for me, okay? 
 - I don't want to.

222
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,140
Ah, what a surprise! Why not?

223
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:18,500
When you vacuum the laboratory, there's something more abundant than even dust.

224
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,610
Hair.

225
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:23,720
The hairs of my students who have done research for the past three years.

226
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:28,570
Don't make that loss worthless, especially since you barely have any hair yourself.

227
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:36,650
Goodness!

228
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,900
- Excuse me, Ma'am. 
 - Yes?

229
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,510
- Please drink this. 
 - This is too kind of you.

230
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:50,230
This is from the dean.

231
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:52,520
Thank you.

232
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:07,920
By any chance, do you like me?

233
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,450
Are you a stalker?

234
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:10,470
It's nothing like that.

235
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:14,360
But why are you chasing down even my family members and bothering them?

236
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,740
I'm sorry if you were upset by it.

237
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,950
I have a favor to ask of you.

238
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:23,830
But it's just a card.

239
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:26,060
It's not an ordinary card.

240
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:30,240
The shape is a bit peculiar, but it's still just an ordinary card.

241
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,140
I have a favor to ask you.

242
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:35,260
Please find out what this card is.

243
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:37,950
There's a person I really need to catch.

244
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:40,430
Do you see that?

245
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:42,940
Those are papers I have to finish reading by this weekend.

246
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:45,130
But do you know what the bigger problem is?

247
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:47,890
Those are all written in different languages.

248
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:51,800
Do you think I'd have the time to analyze what this card does?

249
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,140
It's not like you're gonna pay me either.

250
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:58,530
Do you believe in time travel?

251
00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:01,590
Do you think this flow of conversation makes sense?

252
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:03,410
Don't you think it's a bit all over the place?

253
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:07,820
When I grabbed this card, all the things around me started floating.

254
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:09,640
Maybe you were drunk.

255
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,610
I'm serious.

256
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:15,900
Recently, I saw a drone without a propeller.

257
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:20,230
You don't believe it, do you? That's how I feel right now.

258
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:24,900
What?

259
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:29,670
That day... were you following the drone?

260
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:36,420
I witnessed the drone that day, too. And saw you, too.

261
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:48,800
Be careful for the time being. Park Jin Gyeom likely will remember your faces.

262
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,720
I wouldn't worry about a measly cop.

263
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:56,590
They may be from 30 years ago, but they're still police officers. There's no need to cause trouble.

264
00:21:56,590 --> 00:22:00,730
Then you shouldn't have built Alice here in the first place.

265
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:05,480
It was a given that problems would arise from your building Alice at this location,

266
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:10,810
and that's the reason you called me here. To solve those problems.

267
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:18,730
I know what you want, but we need to be more aggressive to achieve those things.

268
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:23,010
We have to be stronger to protect what is precious to us.

269
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:27,950
So, did you protect those things?

270
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:29,900
Since you were strong,

271
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:33,560
did you protect the things that were precious to you?

272
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:53,920
There are three main ways to overcome the force of your own weight.

273
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:57,790
Rotational force, a rocket, or anti-gravity.

274
00:22:57,790 --> 00:23:02,740
But the drone I saw that day didn't have a rocket or any rotational forces.

275
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:04,900
That's why I followed it.

276
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:11,070
Do you think that kind of drone can't be developed with today's technology?

277
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:15,220
To be honest, that's not an easy question to answer.

278
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:20,400
Throughout history, human progress has been led by a few geniuses.

279
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:25,250
Those kinds of people are capable of making things that we can't even imagine.

280
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:30,530
Even now, there must be someone creating an incredible thing.

281
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:35,580
Then, do you think they can develop a time machine?

282
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,450
Of course!

283
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:40,010
So many geniuses of the past

284
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:44,040
have developed science up until this point. The geniuses of the future

285
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:47,490
have to make a time machine. That's the least they could do.

286
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:51,660
But why do you keep asking me about time travel?

287
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:05,720
I think this card... is related to a time traveler.

288
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:10,440
There are no such things as time travelers.

289
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:14,090
What kind of police officer has such abundant imagination?

290
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:19,200
- Earlier– 
 - I was just saying that as a physics professor.

291
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,370
Truth be told, no one knows whether time travel is possible or not.

292
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:30,580
But still, please look into this.

293
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:32,570
Where did you find this card anyway?

294
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:35,390
I can't tell you right now.

295
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:40,980
If you can't say where it was found, I can't say anything, too. Ask me when you can tell me about it.

296
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:45,400
It belonged to my mother.

297
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,010
Oh, then...

298
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:51,830
Are you saying that your mother had something to do with time travel?

299
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:57,200
That's not the case, but I believe someone who holds a similar card to be a time traveler.

300
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,850
Is there a reason you believe that person to be a time traveler?

301
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:03,200
I am asking you to analyze the card to find evidence.

302
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,070
Are you messing around with me right now?

303
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:13,710
I think it'll be pointless, but okay.

304
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:15,430
I'll try it.

305
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:17,620
Thank you.

306
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:20,750
Do you not drink?

307
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:23,720
Do you have to drive? Just call a driver.

308
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:26,720
I'm all right. You should just drink alone.

309
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,620
As you say, then.

310
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:50,650
It's a habit, because of the seniors in my research lab.

311
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:59,250
Stop looking at me. It's embarrassing.

312
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:08,230
Can I also get a glass?

313
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:10,430
You're craving it a bit, huh?

314
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:15,170
Here you go. Cheers.

315
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:30,910
Are you good at drinking?

316
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:33,760
No. It's my first time today.

317
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,270
Why? Have you been sick?

318
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:39,110
That's not it.

319
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:41,480
Then, why did you drink today?

320
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,410
I've always...

321
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:48,510
wanted to try it once.

322
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:52,760
Here.

323
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,920
Have another.

324
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,050
You're quite good at drinking.

325
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:17,070
It's not too bad, and it makes me happy.

326
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:19,140
Are you sure you're happy?

327
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,640
Yes.

328
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:26,980
I wasn't quite sure, but it is Professor Yoon.

329
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:31,190
You always declined when I asked you for drinks.

330
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:32,360
Who is this?

331
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:36,200
Whoever he is, what does that matter to you?

332
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:41,520
This is why I like you. When I'm with you, there's tension in the air.

333
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,670
Are you crazy?!

334
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:50,600
Who are you to speak to her informally?

335
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,830
This person is over 50 years old!

336
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:54,200
I mean–

337
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,500
This little!

338
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,950
Don't worry about a drunk person and just be on your way.

339
00:27:57,950 --> 00:27:59,410
Okay then.

340
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,660
Excuse me. Let me hear the reason.

341
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:10,690
Why do you keep saying I'm over 50? Do you have some problems with your vision?

342
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:18,680
If my mother were alive, she would be that age.

343
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:22,470
What does your mother have to do with me?

344
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:26,520
Do you really... not know who I am?

345
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:31,090
I do know! Lieutenant Park Jin Gyeom of the Seoul Nambu Police Station!

346
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:32,870
Are you a time traveler?

347
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:37,740
Goodness... I have no patience, so cut it out.

348
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:43,740
Can you explain how you're in front of me right now?

349
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:48,780
I wonder. I don't know why I'm still in front of you.

350
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:51,270
I'll be going. Get home safe.

351
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,440
What are you doing?

352
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,880
Seriously?

353
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:09,360

354
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:21,570

355
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:26,760
 Hello?

356
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:31,170
Isn't this Park Jin Gyeom's phone?

357
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:35,900
It is! Are you close to Park Jin Gyeom?

358
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:38,390
We're friends. Who is this?

359
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:40,150
You don't need to know.

360
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:43,610
We're at the restaurant street in Haengwoon neighborhood. Could you come and pick him up?

361
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:45,850
 He's completely passed out drunk.

362
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:47,700
Jin Gyeom is drunk?

363
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,280
Yes, the building number is–

364
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,650
 Who are you?!

365
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:52,820
What did you do to Jin Gyeom?

366
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:55,590
Why are you yelling at me? Do you know me?

367
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:58,360
What did you do to Jin Gyeom? He never drinks!

368
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:01,190
I didn't force him!

369
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:05,330
I'll be there right away, so wait right there. Okay?

370
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,980
Dammit...

371
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:25,120
Park Jin Gyeom. Jin Gyeom!

372
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,810
Did you really drink?

373
00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:29,730
Seriously?

374
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:34,170
I stayed right here without moving. Are you happy now?

375
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:36,830
I can leave now, right?

376
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,160
Excuse me.

377
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,320
What's your name?

378
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,100
Goodness...

379
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:15,430
What's going on?

380
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:48,900
I never imagined I would be cooking you hangover stew.

381
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:51,680
How did I get home?

382
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:54,900
You're really too much.

383
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:01,940
Eat up.

384
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,640
Thanks.

385
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:13,050
Why? Do you not feel very good?

386
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:14,900
It doesn't taste good.

387
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,100
Would you like for me to throw it at you?

388
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:22,830
They look very much alike.

389
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:26,630
I can see why you drank last night.

390
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:29,510
It may not just be their faces that are similar.

391
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,700
I can't explain either.

392
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:37,000
Because I know it doesn't make any sense.

393
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,400
That's why it's more frustrating.

394
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,300
What are you thinking about now?

395
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:47,200
Mrs. Park Sun Young's son, Mr. Park Jin Gyeom...

396
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,600
Please come to your senses.

397
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,600
Professor Yoon Tae Yi has no connection whatsoever to your mother.

398
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,400
Their faces just look similar.  That's all.

399
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:57,600
This is very possible for us Asians, since our faces have diminished three-dimensionality.

400
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:01,100
Sure, let's say that they are doppelgängers.

401
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:03,200
Even then, she's still not your mother.

402
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:07,200
If what I said was on paper, it'd be in Times New Roman.

403
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,200
That means that I am serious.

404
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:15,500
What? Are you starting to have feelings for her because she looks like your mother?

405
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:18,190
Don't think absurd things.

406
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:21,000
You are the one thinking absurd things.

407
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,100
I am sorry to say this, but she is a Physics professor.

408
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:29,300
But your mother was an ordinary mom.

409
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:33,600
And that woman, she is really rude and annoying.

410
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:37,930
Choose your words carefully.

411
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,600
What are you doing now?

412
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,000
- Leave. 
 - Hey, Park Jin Gyeom!

413
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,200
Leave.

414
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:09,100
Do you know the secret to taking good photos?

415
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,700
It is love for the subject.

416
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:15,800
Because you try hard to make them look even slightly better...

417
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,400
and you know what angles they look pretty in.

418
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:21,300
You probably would take a terrible picture of me.

419
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,200
So annoying!

420
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:48,000
I am not saying it to you, Department Manager.  I was talking to myself.

421
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,200
It doesn't seem that way.

422
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:53,600
Who speaks that clearly when talking to themselves?

423
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:19,200
Police officers in Korea must really have nothing to do.

424
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,600
What's the secret to keeping our streets safe?

425
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:26,000
Did you get home safely yesterday?

426
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,700
If it weren't for you, I would have been safer.

427
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:34,600
Your girlfriend has a fiery temper.  I thought she was going to hit me.

428
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:37,000
She is a friend who cares a lot about me.

429
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,200
Don't think badly.

430
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:43,180
I was curious as to whether you found out anything about the card.

431
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:47,400
I said I was busy until the end of this week.  I will call you so please wait.

432
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:06,600
 For solving this type of problem, you need to compare the given values.

433
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:10,000
 R1, T1, and M1 are the initial values.

434
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,400
 R2, T2, and M2 are the variables.

435
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:18,100
 What?  Is it strange because Mom is solving these problems?

436
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:23,800
 When Mom was going to school, I probably did better than you.

437
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,600
 Let's go together, Son.

438
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:40,600
 It's okay. You go by yourself and come back.

439
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:43,400
 Okay.  I will be back soon.

440
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,800
Why does a police officer come to the school cafeteria to eat?

441
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,400
If being a police officer doesn't suit you, find yourself a different career.

442
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,000
I heard the food here was good.

443
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,400
How come you didn't eat any then?

444
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,600
I lost my appetite.

445
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:18,400
You really have many ways to bother people!

446
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,000
All I have to do is analyze the card, right?

447
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,400
- And... 
 - And what?!

448
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,600
May I take a look at the back of your neck?

449
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:31,630
I'm about to break your neck, so stay clear of me.

450
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:51,200
- Hi guys. 
 - Hello. 
 - Hello, Sir.

451
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,800
Where did Jin Gyeom go?

452
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,400
I haven't seen him today.

453
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,600
What is he up to nowadays?

454
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,600
He is investigating some professor.

455
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,200
Professor who?

456
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,800
Yoon Tae Yi, a Physics professor.

457
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,500
Yoon Tae Yi?

458
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,800
No matter which way I look, it is just a card...

459
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:51,480
Unnie, can I use your lab?

460
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:57,500
It's still daytime. You're drinking too much.

461
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,300
Nothing's wrong, right?

462
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:11,000
Team Leader, is anything going on?

463
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:16,100
Ah, maybe I shouldn't have let you move out.

464
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:19,300
When you were at my house, I felt more at ease.

465
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:22,900
Mister told me to move out.  I had no intention to move out.

466
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:25,100
I didn't want you to move either.

467
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:29,100
Do Yeon pestered me to let you move out.

468
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:34,700
I let you move out and she couldn't even take advantage of you... like a fool.

469
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,700
What are you talking about?

470
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,700
You are the bigger problem.

471
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,100
You, pour.

472
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:56,900
If you need advice, talk to me first.

473
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:59,100
I've always done that.

474
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:01,700
Do it this time, too.

475
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:03,200
Yes.

476
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,500
Ah, that Eun Soo's kidnapping case...

477
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:17,700
Don't dig any deeper.  Eun Soo's parents want us to close the case.

478
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:20,470
I understand.

479
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:24,000
Since when has it been like this?

480
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,700
While I was on a business trip... Is it eczema?

481
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:32,800
It's not eczema.  It looks like a rash or a skin infection.

482
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:37,500
It didn't spread throughout her body so she should get better soon with medication.

483
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:41,100
You are afraid because you might have to get a shot, right?

484
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:43,100
Do I have to get a shot?

485
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:47,100
I'm not sure. Let me think about it.

486
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:53,700
It got all better now, Eun Soo.

487
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:56,600
My pretty girl.

488
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:30,100
Why is client 1011 still here?

489
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:33,300
1011?  Are you talking about Eun Soo's mother?

490
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:35,900
According to the schedule, wasn't her departure supposed to be last week?

491
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:38,300
She wasn't feeling well so she postponed the departure.

492
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:41,300
She's just giving excuses because she doesn't want to leave her daughter.

493
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:45,100
It's not like this is the first time dealing with this kind of client.  Why do you keep caving in?

494
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:49,500
She wants to stay a little longer by her daughter who died.  Is that so hard to understand?

495
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:52,600
I do understand.  I understand but...

496
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:56,700
You should also know to cut off when necessary.

497
00:42:56,700 --> 00:43:01,600
It must be easy for you, Min Hyeok.  It's hard for me.

498
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:05,300
Uncontrolled emotions are the most dangerous.

499
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:07,500
I will take care of it.

500
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:28,500

Eun Soo.  Eun Soo, mom's here.

501
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:32,400
Why is our Eun Soo so cold!

502
00:43:43,530 --> 00:43:46,330
I'm Yoo Min Hyeok, the guide team leader.

503
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:50,380
Preparations for your departure are finished. Let's go.

504
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:54,720
I've asked Team Leader Oh for a few more days...

505
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:58,590
I apologize, but we cannot postpone your departure anymore.

506
00:44:01,350 --> 00:44:03,410
Please escort her to immigration.

507
00:44:55,590 --> 00:44:59,450
We'll be arriving soon. Please get ready.

508
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:06,060
Ma'am?

509
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:09,390
I'm sorry.

510
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:11,330
Excuse me?

511
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:54,300
Are you hurt at all?

512
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:56,560
You're safe now.

513
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:58,030
Okay.

514
00:45:58,030 --> 00:46:01,260
I'll escort you to your destination.

515
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:04,280
All right.

516
00:46:06,170 --> 00:46:08,320
Thank you.

517
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:20,250
I'll catch that bastard right away.

518
00:46:20,850 --> 00:46:24,120
For now, check her whereabouts and just keep an eye on her.

519
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:30,260
She hired a broker to stay here illegally. They must be arrested immediately.

520
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:35,130
That's why I'm telling you to just watch them for now.

521
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:45,580
 The mother who passed through the doors of time in order to save her daughter

522
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:50,630
 overturned the past, and is trying to alter the future.

523
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:24,270
- Did you remember your passport? 
 - Of course.

524
00:47:25,030 --> 00:47:26,510
When are you coming back?

525
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:31,690
Maybe... in two days? I'll only know for certain once I've arrived.

526
00:47:31,690 --> 00:47:32,650
I'll message you when I get there.

527
00:47:32,650 --> 00:47:35,040
Have a safe trip.

528
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:42,200
Be safe, bye.

529
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:15,030
Am I mistaken?

530
00:48:58,150 --> 00:49:00,150
My daughter...

531
00:49:00,850 --> 00:49:03,260
She's so beautiful.

532
00:49:05,450 --> 00:49:07,450
The way you sleep

533
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:11,920
is like an angel.

534
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:23,100
But you...

535
00:49:24,050 --> 00:49:26,710
did not protect my daughter.

536
00:49:32,130 --> 00:49:35,830
Move! That's where I should be.

537
00:49:39,330 --> 00:49:43,830
More, more. Okay stop! All good.

538
00:49:45,790 --> 00:49:48,260
Hey, stop, stop!

539
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:15,830
Jin Gyeom.

540
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:36,270
Goodness...

541
00:50:36,270 --> 00:50:37,750
What should we say?

542
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:39,130
You should do it. I can't...

543
00:50:39,130 --> 00:50:41,590
You should do things like this.

544
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:50,400
Hello.

545
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,510
Oh!

546
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:55,330
How can I help you?

547
00:50:55,330 --> 00:50:58,970
Mommy!

548
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:03,650
Who are these people, Mommy?

549
00:51:04,530 --> 00:51:06,530
They're the police.

550
00:51:08,290 --> 00:51:10,690
What's going on?

551
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:26,850

552
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:28,630
It's all done now.

553
00:51:29,830 --> 00:51:32,230
Is there anything else you need?

554
00:51:32,230 --> 00:51:35,240
No. Thank you for your cooperation.

555
00:51:40,910 --> 00:51:45,410
- Eun Soo. 
 - Mom, are you all done now?

556
00:51:45,410 --> 00:51:49,150
Let's eat something delicious on the way home.

557
00:51:49,150 --> 00:51:51,590
- Meat. 
 - Meat?

558
00:51:52,230 --> 00:51:53,610
Meat.

559
00:52:07,890 --> 00:52:11,700
We've compared the fingerprints and it perfectly matches the corpse's.

560
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:13,040
How did this happen?

561
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:16,490
She was first strangled by the perpetrator's hands, then stabbed in the neck.

562
00:52:16,490 --> 00:52:19,990
But the thing is, there are multiple cuts around the stab wound.

563
00:52:19,990 --> 00:52:22,600
It means the killer hesitated many times before administering the fatal wound.

564
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:26,670
Is there any evidence that would help us narrow down the location of the murder?

565
00:52:26,670 --> 00:52:28,410
No.

566
00:52:40,030 --> 00:52:42,630
That's a sign that the victim struggled.

567
00:52:42,630 --> 00:52:46,950
Usually, the culprit's DNA would be found underneath the victim's fingernails;

568
00:52:46,950 --> 00:52:52,340
but in this case, only the victim's DNA was found, which is strange.

569
00:53:18,950 --> 00:53:22,380
Eun Soo? Eun Soo.

570
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:24,800
Eun Soo, let's eat.

571
00:53:47,150 --> 00:53:51,200
You gathered my fingerprints and blood sample yesterday.

572
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:55,780
I'm not sure what happened, but it has nothing to do with me.

573
00:54:01,210 --> 00:54:03,640
It's time for me to help my daughter get up.

574
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:08,170
If you don't have anything to ask, could you please leave?

575
00:54:08,170 --> 00:54:11,570
We still haven't caught the culprit that kidnapped Eun Soo.

576
00:54:11,570 --> 00:54:14,540
That doesn't matter now, since Eun Soo is safe.

577
00:54:14,540 --> 00:54:17,380
That's not the case for us.

578
00:54:17,380 --> 00:54:19,490
I'll ask a few questions.

579
00:54:19,490 --> 00:54:26,290
You mentioned during your questioning that the only person who knew about both your business trip and Eun Soo's preschool schedule

580
00:54:26,290 --> 00:54:29,180
was your husband, right?

581
00:54:36,220 --> 00:54:38,140
 Two.

582
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:42,780
 My husband and the housekeeper.

583
00:54:48,870 --> 00:54:54,000
I don't really remember. I was so shocked then.

584
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:59,780
I wanted to ask it's possible the housekeeper could have known.

585
00:54:59,780 --> 00:55:04,530
Oh, well. I guess she must also have known.

586
00:55:05,290 --> 00:55:07,680
Is she not here today?

587
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:11,360
She quit once I started my leave of absence.

588
00:55:12,410 --> 00:55:16,300
I heard Eun Soo was quite close to your housekeeper.

589
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:18,280
She must have been upset.

590
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:25,400
 No.

591
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:30,190
 Eun Soo used to be scared of her, since she only recently started working.

592
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:40,090
Yes. Eun Soo and I both

593
00:55:40,110 --> 00:55:44,090
were a bit upset, since she worked for us for a while.

594
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:22,310
So, based on what justification are you suggesting we surveil Eun Soo's mother 24/7?

595
00:56:22,310 --> 00:56:24,440
She is definitely a different mother of Eun Soo.

596
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:26,760
What are you saying?

597
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:30,160
Do you know something that I don't?

598
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:31,540
I'm not yet certain.

599
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:35,200
But if we investigate her, we'll be able to find something.

600
00:56:37,090 --> 00:56:39,900
Then let me meet her first.

601
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:42,200
I'll make the decision after that.

602
00:56:43,970 --> 00:56:46,050
Listen to me.

603
00:56:47,410 --> 00:56:49,240
I understand.

604
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:35,020
Eun Soo! Eun Soo! Shall we go on a trip?

605
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:38,910
Eun Soo, wake up. Eun Soo–

606
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:52,540
Eun Soo. Eun Soo?

607
00:58:12,230 --> 00:58:14,290
Eun Soo...

608
00:58:14,290 --> 00:58:15,960
Eun Soo, Eun Soo, Eun Soo...

609
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:18,820
Oh no, our Eun Soo. What should I do?

610
00:58:35,770 --> 00:58:37,960
May I come in?

611
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:39,910
What is it this time?

612
00:58:39,910 --> 00:58:42,780
I just have a few things to ask you.

613
00:58:45,090 --> 00:58:47,480
My daughter is sick right now. Could you please return at another time?

614
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:49,670
It'll only take a moment.

615
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:19,370
Are you going somewhere?

616
00:59:19,370 --> 00:59:21,970
That's not something you should worry about.

617
00:59:21,970 --> 00:59:25,130
If you have something to ask, please do so quickly, then leave.

618
00:59:25,130 --> 00:59:27,520
I don't have anything I want to ask you.

619
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:30,460
I have a few things to ask Eun Soo.

620
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:33,780
Where is Eun Soo?

621
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:35,920
She's at kindergarten.

622
00:59:37,450 --> 00:59:39,910
Didn't you say she was sick earlier?

623
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:12,630
Eun Soo!

624
01:00:39,350 --> 01:00:41,880
I'm sorry.

625
01:00:44,860 --> 01:00:46,610
I'm so sorry.

626
01:01:04,390 --> 01:01:08,470

627
01:01:09,620 --> 01:01:11,820
Jin Gyeom!

628
01:01:14,470 --> 01:01:16,320
Where's Mister?

629
01:01:16,910 --> 01:01:21,310
Jin Gyeom, he...

630
01:01:37,170 --> 01:01:39,860
- Gauze. 
 - Gauze.

631
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:02,520
Hello?

632
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:07,550
Yes, I'll go into hiding somewhere in secret, so please gather some medication.

633
01:02:07,550 --> 01:02:10,880
I think she got it from me.

634
01:02:19,190 --> 01:02:21,650

635
01:02:21,650 --> 01:02:23,900
What is this?

636
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:26,130
Did you make this?

637
01:02:26,130 --> 01:02:28,660
I wish that were the case.

638
01:02:29,510 --> 01:02:31,730
What the hell is this?

639
01:02:31,730 --> 01:02:34,120
I have no idea.

640
01:02:35,510 --> 01:02:39,930
Unnie, do you believe in time travel?

641
01:02:39,930 --> 01:02:41,240
Why that, all of a sudden?

642
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:42,750
I'm asking if you believe in it.

643
01:02:42,750 --> 01:02:45,320
I want to believe in it. I'm a scientist, after all.

644
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:48,800
But theory and reality are two different things.

645
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:58,590
Jin Gyeom... Mister will get better.

646
01:02:58,590 --> 01:03:00,850
Don't think just negative thoughts.

647
01:03:00,850 --> 01:03:03,500
He was a healthy man.

648
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:05,910
He'll get up soon.

649
01:03:10,390 --> 01:03:13,020
There must be something wrong with me.

650
01:03:14,910 --> 01:03:21,510
The person who has raised me as a father figure is in critical condition,

651
01:03:23,370 --> 01:03:26,030
but I don't know

652
01:03:28,270 --> 01:03:30,390
what I'm feeling right now.

653
01:03:32,150 --> 01:03:35,220
I don't know whether I'm sad or in pain...

654
01:03:36,570 --> 01:03:39,290
Perhaps, I don't even feel anything.

655
01:03:39,290 --> 01:03:41,090
When I'm shocked, I feel the same way.

656
01:03:41,090 --> 01:03:44,720
Everyone feels that way. You're not strange, don't worry.

657
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:50,270
You haven't eaten yet, right? There's a food court downstairs.

658
01:03:50,270 --> 01:03:53,050
I'm fine. I'm not hungry.

659
01:03:53,050 --> 01:03:55,230
You should still eat something.

660
01:03:55,230 --> 01:03:58,010
Should I grab something from the convenience store?

661
01:03:58,980 --> 01:04:01,790
I'll be back shortly. Just wait here.

662
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:13,220
Why didn't you pick up your phone?

663
01:04:13,220 --> 01:04:15,770
Do you know how much I called you?

664
01:04:15,770 --> 01:04:17,500

665
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:21,240
I even went to the precinct to look for you.

666
01:04:23,530 --> 01:04:27,190
I have a lot of things to say, are you free?

667
01:04:29,350 --> 01:04:36,260

668
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:42,480
Why do you keep crying when you see me?

669
01:04:44,300 --> 01:04:52,320
♫  Whenever, wherever, whatever, with you  ♫

670
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:59,740
♫  One day and somewhere, I'll be with you  ♫

671
01:04:59,740 --> 01:05:08,550
♫  Whenever, wherever, whatever, stay with you  ♫

672
01:05:08,550 --> 01:05:14,280
♫  No matter how far we go  ♫

673
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:16,560
♫  We'll see each other again  ♫

674
01:05:16,560 --> 01:05:19,970
♫  Again, promise me again  ♫

675
01:05:19,970 --> 01:05:23,530
♫  By the time that passed  ♫

676
01:05:23,530 --> 01:05:30,480
♫  I'll be here with a light smile  ♫

677
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:31,810

678
01:05:31,810 --> 01:05:33,160
 You're Lieutenant Park Jin Gyeom, correct?

679
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:35,620
 Do you research drones here, too?

680
01:05:35,620 --> 01:05:37,330
 It looks like you still see me as a criminal.

681
01:05:37,330 --> 01:05:40,020
 There's a witness who saw that man with your mother.

682
01:05:40,020 --> 01:05:42,630
 Whether it be a ghost or a monster, I'm going to get him.

683
01:05:42,630 --> 01:05:43,740
 Don't do anything you'll end up regretting.

684
01:05:43,740 --> 01:05:47,200
 The prophecy begins the moment the child becomes a time traveler

685
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:50,730
 Your mother... was definitely not an ordinary person.

686
01:05:50,730 --> 01:05:53,510
 Professor, I don't think you should get involved in this anymore.

687
01:05:53,510 --> 01:05:56,570
 You must think of me as an emotionless person.

688
01:05:56,570 --> 01:06:00,150
 There's a drone in front of my window.
