1
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:34,690
 Science is like a sharp tool.

2
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:40,460
 You might cut your fingers while playing with it like a child.

3
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:51,010

4
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,770
Jin Gyeom.

5
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:00,850
 One day,

6
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:05,040
 if we meet again,

7
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:10,690
 you must act as if you don't know me.

8
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:16,250
 You must avoid me at any cost!

9
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,880
Mom.

10
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:55,810
Hey, are you okay? Hey!

11
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,400
Call 9-1-1!

12
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,910
9-1-1! Are you okay??

13
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:06,590
Someone hurry and call the ambulance!

14
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:10,840
Hello? Is this the police department?

15
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,580
Someone got hurt!

16
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:39,010

17
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:40,580
Are you really a lieutenant?

18
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:45,680
How could a cop violate traffic laws and run into the street
without looking?

19
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,180
From now on, raise your arm whenever you cross the street. Understood?

20
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:53,890
You have a fractured rib. Lie back down.

21
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:57,070
What are you doing?

22
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:59,900
Hey, Park Jin Gyeom!

23
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,260
Hey!

24
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,600
What's the matter?

25
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:15,350
I saw Mom.

26
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:17,200
Whose mom?

27
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,950
My mom.

28
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:21,610
I need to check the CCTV and find her.

29
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:24,030
You must have injured your head, too.

30
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,930
Hurry and lie down right now.

31
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:27,290
I'm positive it was my mom.

32
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,840
Lie down!

33
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,550
I...

34
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:34,820
Do you think I wouldn't even recognize my own mom?

35
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:42,380
Fine, go and try to find her!

36
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:46,590
It must be true that the living can't win over the dead.

37
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:50,240
I really like alcohol.

38
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:55,170
But after a hangover, I get nauseous just by seeing something green.

39
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:58,470
For the time being, I don't want to see your face so don't contact me.

40
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:44,320
 Hong Eun Soo. 7 year old female. While on a trip to a farm with her kindergarten class, was kidnapped on 9/19. Returned home on 9/22 and reports that she was with her mom during that time.

41
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,150
Let's think about this again logically.

42
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:53,630
On the day of the incident, she was on a trip with her mom.

43
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:56,910
Hey! You're getting on my nerves!

44
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:01,120
I'm sorry. I keep losing muscle these days if I don't exercise.

45
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,740
Focus!

46
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:07,690
Eun Soo really said it was a time machine?

47
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:08,500
Yes.

48
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,610
It must be like a defense mechanism.

49
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:14,050
You know, when children experience something big, they show two responses.

50
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:18,190
They either close their mouth completely or deny what they experienced.

51
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:21,700
Do you think she imagined her kidnapper to be her mom from the future?

52
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:25,840
Did you check the CCTV for the places Eun Soo visited while she was kidnapped?

53
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:31,320
I think that was also a lie. I checked it but there was no record of the child.

54
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,420
Where are you going?

55
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:40,550
My goodness.

56
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:44,570
Take care of your husband. I think he's having an affair these days.

57
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:46,130
Team leader,

58
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:49,910
I usually don't ask for these favors,

59
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:52,340
but can I hit Jin Gyeom just once?

60
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:55,350
I'll knock him out in one go, so he won't even know he was hit!

61
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:00,150
You're going to Eun Soo, right?

62
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:02,340
Don't aggravate the kid or the parent.

63
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:05,440
No matter the situation, it's the victim and the victim's family.

64
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:11,480
Can you at least act like you're listening when someone's talking?

65
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:19,710
Hey, even if you have a higher position, I'm still older than you!

66
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:36,980
Eun Soo, I'll come back after taking this call.

67
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,090
Yes, Director.

68
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,220
Eun Soo.

69
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:54,940
Oh?

70
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:58,720
Mom, did you change your clothes?

71
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:05,840
Mom has to go now.

72
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:10,140
I wanted to see you for the last time.

73
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:14,020
Where are you going? A business trip?

74
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:18,020
Somewhere far.

75
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,350
Somewhere Eun Soo can't go.

76
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:22,880
Don't go!

77
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,500
Please accept my resignation.

78
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,650
I think I'll need to stay with Eun Soo.

79
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:35,250
My Eun Soo, you didn't forget your promise with me. Right?

80
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,530
You must not go to America.

81
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:40,070
Remember that.

82
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:41,160
Okay.

83
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,990
Don't forget it.

84
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:45,480
I understand.  Thank you.

85
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:55,080
Yes.

86
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:02,640
I'll call you back.

87
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:13,820
Eun Soo.

88
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,610
Eun Soo's mom.

89
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:50,280
I apologize, I mistook you for someone I know.

90
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:18,330
Please look up a car for me.

91
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:23,300
124LA 5025. Thank you.

92
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,750
Why did your mom come see you? What did she say?

93
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:42,790
She said not to forget our promise.

94
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:43,810
What promise?

95
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:46,440
I promised her not to go to America.

96
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,340
America?

97
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:52,820
She told me I will go and study abroad when I turn seventeen.

98
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:55,250
In ten years?

99
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,380
Yes.

100
00:09:56,380 --> 00:10:01,010
She told me not to go. That I'll be very sick if I do.

101
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,170

102
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:47,270
Eun Soo! Mom is here!

103
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:52,190
Why is my Eun Soo so cold?!

104
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:59,990
Mom is so sorry! I'm so sorry! Can you hear me?

105
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:19,370
I'm sorry for talking freely to you before.

106
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:23,560
Even so! How can you... do that...

107
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:29,300
Like men, let's make peace.

108
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:34,200
What do you keep looking at?

109
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:38,910
Do you know much about drones?

110
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:40,930
Drones?

111
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:45,260
That's my specialty. I'm a drone master.

112
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:52,310
What's his problem?

113
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:56,450
The drones we usually talk about are the RC multi-copters.

114
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:58,810
It means it has multiple propellers.

115
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:01,320
Of course, there are also single-rotors,

116
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,460
but I've never seen one with no propellers.

117
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:07,890
Maybe you were mistaken because the propeller was so fast?

118
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:11,760
Then, was this popular during 2010 as well?

119
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,800
No.

120
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:18,510
RC multi-copters became more popular in 2015.

121
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:52,510

122
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:05,200
Hey, do you think they will even blink with this news?

123
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,460
Declaring war on them won't make them change their commander.

124
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:11,390
If you want to light a big fire, you need to light a small one first.

125
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,540
I'm saying the wind is going to blow in your direction!

126
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:17,150
If you write that, you're going to burn to death in this field.

127
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:21,760
They said they'll come up with a punishment, so wait a bit.

128
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,330
I didn't know

129
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:27,730
that you see the world as full of hope and dreams.

130
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:29,560
I know you're putting on a show to bury this.

131
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:33,330
I'm saying let's just take this fire down a notch!

132
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:37,980
I'll give you this instead, so put that one on hold.

133
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,780
What's this?

134
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:42,180
A seven-year-old girl was kidnapped,

135
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:44,640
but who do you think the kidnapper was?

136
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:47,360
You. Why'd you do it?

137
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,380
Geez.

138
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,690
It was the kid's mom.

139
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:54,740
It's surprising, right?

140
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:57,410
But it doesn't make sense.

141
00:13:57,410 --> 00:14:02,290
The mom was in Europe on a business trip when the child was kidnapped.

142
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:07,500
How about it? Interesting, right?

143
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:20,510
Yeah, she really was overseas.

144
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:22,290
Okay.

145
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:27,260
Our daughter-in-law's here!

146
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:29,500
I told you not to call me that!

147
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:33,320
That's why I told you to hurry and confess. Why are you wasting your youth?

148
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,800
I told you Jin Gyeom can't meet any women other than you.

149
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:39,100
I know that, too!

150
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,610
Did you come to see Jin Gyeom?

151
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:42,140
No.

152
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:44,870
I came to see you, Father-in-Law.

153
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,890
Ah, how refreshing!

154
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:51,740
You must be tired because of Hong Eun Soo's kidnapping case.

155
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:55,180
Why are you like this all of a sudden, Reporter Kim?

156
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,880
Father-in-Law!

157
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,510
Who is a father-in-law? It won't work this time.

158
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:01,850
I have nothing to share with you.

159
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:04,710
We've lost the path right now anyway.

160
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:13,080
You must find the path by asking people.

161
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:16,890
Let's look for the path together. I'll carry your stuff! Don't you trust me?

162
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:18,560
How can I trust you?

163
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,980
You said you'd help last time, too, but you stabbed me in the back instead.

164
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,310
Go on your way.

165
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:44,170
When did you get here?

166
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:46,820

167
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,710
You put a password on your laptop?

168
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:51,220
Because you keep looking through it.

169
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,820
I see.

170
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:57,640
I felt so hurt I almost broke the laptop.

171
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:00,700
- Yesterday... 
 - Forget it. What's the password?

172
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:03,300
Just ask me. I'll tell you.

173
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,040
Hong Eun Soo's kidnapping case.

174
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,980
That one is off-limits for now.

175
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:11,640
Nothing in the world is off-limits.

176
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,490
You've never heard of this?

177
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:18,370
"No pessimist ever discovered the secret of the stars,

178
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:20,680
or sailed to an uncharted land,

179
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:24,830
or opened a new doorway for the human spirit."

180
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:30,350
Think positively, Jin Gyeom. Then a new path will open.

181
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:33,050
Got it?

182
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:44,240
There's no new beer.

183
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,870
You're out of beer.

184
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:49,050
You know I don't drink.

185
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:52,290
Well, I drink. Hurry and go buy some.

186
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:55,640
Can't you leave for today? I'm tired.

187
00:16:55,640 --> 00:17:00,780
If you answer three of my questions, I'll go quietly.

188
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:08,010
First. Eun Soo's whereabouts during the three days she was kidnapped.

189
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:12,830
Second. CCTV footage of the hotel Eun Soo's mom was staying at during her business trip.

190
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:18,190
Lastly, Eun Soo saw a drone.

191
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:20,310
Why the drone?

192
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:22,210
Did she see it?

193
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:35,930

194
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,710
Is this real?

195
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:40,150
Why are you looking down on me?

196
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:43,610
I'm no longer the kid that threw rocks at your window.

197
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,700
There have been strange things happening all over the country since last year.

198
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,900
All the cases don't make sense like this kidnapping case.

199
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,180
But there's one thing in common.

200
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:56,610
The drone that was witnessed nearby the incident scenes.

201
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:58,810
Weird, isn't it?

202
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:01,220

203
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:11,650
Email me this file.

204
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:16,030
Tell me what you think is the most crucial evidence in this kidnapping case.

205
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:17,930
Then I'll give this to you.

206
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:24,210
Eun Soo's testimony.

207
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:25,600
What did she say?

208
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:30,700
She said the kidnapper was her mom who time traveled.

209
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,500
What?

210
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:13,360
Please, let me live!

211
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,720
What's this?

212
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,380
You're surrendering already?

213
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:24,040
I was beaten up by you every day.

214
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,770
When did I?

215
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,910
You don't know me?

216
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:33,190
Look at my face.

217
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:38,890
Look at me!

218
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:44,640
You really don't recognize me?

219
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,550
I don't know you.

220
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:50,500
I'm your younger brother.

221
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,380
But you're younger than me now.

222
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:15,870
 "Chapter One.

223
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:20,910
 The door of time opens and those that seek revenge

224
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:23,150
 become stained with blood."

225
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:34,650
- Has the victim been identified? 
 - We're looking into it.

226
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:37,050
Was he staying here alone? Who booked the room?

227
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:39,650
Because it was reserved through the internet, we're not sure.

228
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:43,350
How did Lieutenant Park find him?

229
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:49,250
I don't know the reason.

230
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:52,850
None of the cameras in the hallway and elevators were working.

231
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:54,850
Has this ever happened before?

232
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:56,850
No, never.

233
00:21:56,850 --> 00:22:00,050
We checked the CCTVs this week, too.

234
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:06,250
 - Oh my gosh, what happened? 
 - There was a murder?

235
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:08,850
 - Oh my, oh my! A student died? 
 - That's what I heard.

236
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:11,050
  - Unbelievable. 
 - Someone was murdered here?

237
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:13,150
 - Oh my gosh! 
 - That's terrible.

238
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:16,350
 - He looked pretty young. 
 - What happened?

239
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:31,040

240
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:40,850
Is this a recorded video?

241
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:42,550
No.

242
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:08,550
I'm the police.

243
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:10,650
Is this your vehicle?

244
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:13,550
Why do I need to answer you?

245
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:18,450
I'm going to ask one last time.

246
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:20,350
Is this your vehicle?

247
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:23,350
No, it's my guide's car.

248
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:26,450
My guide must have gone up to look for me, but he'll show up if we wait.

249
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:28,850
Can you show me your ID card?

250
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:32,150
I don't have such a thing.

251
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:34,850
What's your name and personal identification number?

252
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:38,450
Yang Hong Seob.

253
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:43,350
160614-3017447.

254
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:46,250
Do you think this is funny?

255
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:51,450
Why? Don't I look like I'm five? I look old, huh?
 (T/N: the first six numbers of a Korean ID are their birthdates)

256
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:58,250
Tell me. Who are you?

257
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:01,250
You're dead when the guide gets here.

258
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:05,950
What guide are you talking about?

259
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:26,250

260
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:41,950
Get in the car.

261
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:49,050
I told you you're dead when the guide gets here.

262
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:53,550
Does it hurt? Huh? Hurt?

263
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:37,050
Client 1012's car is being chased by the police.

264
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:39,050
Requesting assistance.

265
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:43,050
We have verified the target.

266
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:44,850
Seung Pyo. Hye Soo. Assist them.

267
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:46,950
Got it. We verified it.

268
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:09,050
Where are you?

269
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:12,050
We're right behind.

270
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:32,350
Hurry up!

271
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:33,650
Got it.

272
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:45,310
Mission accomplished.

273
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:48,550
Recover the response system... and Watch Team, please continue monitoring.

274
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:50,550
 - Yes, Ma'am. 
 - Yes, Ma'am.

275
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:40,350
This way.

276
00:30:57,850 --> 00:31:01,650
Client 1012 has returned. I'll escort him to his room.

277
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:03,450
Yes, Sir.

278
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:12,650

279
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:22,050
Are you okay?

280
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:25,150
Do I look okay to you?

281
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:30,850
What are you going to do with that policeman?

282
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:33,750
The policeman simply did his duty. He did nothing wrong.

283
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:36,850
He hit your client! And you're saying he did nothing wrong?

284
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:39,850
Why do I need to be hit by a lowly person from the past?

285
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:42,450
You broke the rule first.

286
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:43,450
What rule?

287
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:47,850
Murder is not allowed under any circumstance.

288
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:51,350
I didn't mean to actually kill him! It was an accident!

289
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:56,250
I mean, it's not that big of a deal though. Right?

290
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:58,850
It doesn't really affect the future, so simply just bury the case.

291
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:01,250
Upon violating any rule regarding time traveling,

292
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:04,650
you may be liable to pay a penalty, expelled, and banned from all future time travel.

293
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:07,650
You were notified of the terms.

294
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:10,450
I will request your expulsion with headquarters as per the rule.

295
00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:14,250
I got it. I understand, so

296
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:17,050
make sure to punish that policeman.

297
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:20,250
It's not that hard to punish someone from the past, isn't it?

298
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:26,750
Shut up and listen. Our company, Alice, was made to heal wounds from the past.

299
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:30,850
Every staff member works here with pride and fulfillment.

300
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:33,650
We don't work for people like you.

301
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:38,050
So shut your trap and get lost.

302
00:32:59,050 --> 00:33:00,650
Have a seat.

303
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:11,650
You worked hard today.

304
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:15,450
Hyung, isn't the system to accept travelers too flawed?

305
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:19,250
We shouldn't have accepted travelers that would cause trouble in the first place.

306
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:23,450
We informed headquarters about this issue as well, so things should improve.

307
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:27,650
No, instead of just filing a complaint, we must definitely change this.

308
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:31,450
There are people that gave up a lot for Alice.

309
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:33,450
Are you talking about yourself?

310
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:36,550
Did you give up Tae Yi for Alice?

311
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:39,050
Let's not talk about that.

312
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:42,350
If it's not that, why don't you go and look for her?

313
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:44,450
Didn't you hear from Manager Oh?

314
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:47,050
I know that she is married and living well.

315
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:48,750
Then?

316
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:55,050
You two separated in 1992, and that maybe 29 years ago for Tae Yi.

317
00:33:55,050 --> 00:33:57,650
But for you, it's only a matter of one year ago.

318
00:33:57,650 --> 00:34:00,450
And you and Tae Yi's child...

319
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:03,350
One year is a long time.

320
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:32,150
 Dear Min Hyeok,

321
00:34:33,450 --> 00:34:38,050
 I have another heart inside me now.

322
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:40,250
 It's smaller and weaker than mine,

323
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:44,850
 but I feel it. Our child's heartbeat.

324
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:47,450
 Similar to how you chose Alice,

325
00:34:47,450 --> 00:34:51,250
  I decided to choose my child's future.

326
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:54,950
 I'll take good care of him. Since I'm a mother now.

327
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:00,540
Tae Yi.

328
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:08,850
Min Sung!

329
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:22,250
What time did your son leave the house?

330
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:27,150
Same as usual, he left around 7:30 a.m.

331
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:30,750
We found out he didn't go to school after his teacher called us.

332
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:34,850
Did he have any friends that live near the apartment?

333
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:38,050
No. I didn't hear anything like that.

334
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:39,950
Min Sung's mom!

335
00:35:40,850 --> 00:35:42,950
Please excuse me.

336
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:47,330
They say she's not his birth mom.

337
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:53,050
The father remarried one year ago and she has her own son.

338
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:58,260
By law, he was her son. She should at least pretend to be sad.

339
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:05,050
Hong Seob, let's stay a bit longer and then go home.

340
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:06,350
Okay.

341
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:12,850
 Yang Hong Seob.

342
00:36:12,850 --> 00:36:17,650
 160614-3017447

343
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:22,850
  Why? Don't I look five? I look old, huh?

344
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:30,450
The youngest son's name is Yang Hong Seob.

345
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:33,650
His identity number is 160614.

346
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:38,350
3017447.

347
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:42,890

348
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:03,050
Who did this to you?

349
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:07,050
I'm a policeman, so you can tell me.

350
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:08,650
Big brother did.

351
00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:09,850
The big brother that died?

352
00:37:09,850 --> 00:37:12,250
Yeah. I'm glad he died.

353
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:26,550
What about Yang Hong Seob's expulsion request?

354
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:28,750
It was approved.

355
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:30,650
Then proceed.

356
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:33,850
Why? Do you have something to say?

357
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:36,750
I was wondering if you must do this.

358
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:39,850
It won't be good if people find out a client was expelled.

359
00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:43,850
It'd be better than people finding out that we covered for a client
who committed murder.

360
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:45,850
That's best for Alice.

361
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:48,580
Understood.

362
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:01,950
Your departure has been set.

363
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:13,030
Where does that cop Park Jin Gyeom work?

364
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:16,050
I want to meet him when I go back.

365
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:19,050
I heard he's part of Seoul's Nambu Division Investigation Team Number Two.

366
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:20,450
Let's go.

367
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:21,850
I got it.

368
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:06,850
Are you okay? I heard there was an accident! Are you hurt?

369
00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:08,550
Why didn't you tell me?

370
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:10,050
Why should I tell you?

371
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:12,350
Because I'm your friend!

372
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,250
And why don't you answer your phone?

373
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:17,850
If you don't answer your phone one more time, I'm going to put a tracker on your body.

374
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:20,850
I'm not saying empty words, I mean it!

375
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:24,250
Where are you going?

376
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:25,650
I need to investigate something.

377
00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:28,250
I heard your car got into an accident. I'll take you.

378
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:30,050
It's okay.

379
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:47,150
Our Jin Gyeom. When did he buy this beer?

380
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:56,250
What is it? Did you forget something?

381
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,730
Who are you?

382
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:13,480

383
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:16,450
Hello?

384
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,520
Have you met my five-year-old self?

385
00:40:54,490 --> 00:40:56,350

386
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,620
So, why do you mess with me?

387
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:18,100
You can't beat me no matter what crazy things you do.

388
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:20,970
Why?

389
00:41:20,970 --> 00:41:24,700
No matter what you do, you guys can't catch us.

390
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:28,790
There is nothing as fair and unfair like time.

391
00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:33,840
Stop talking nonsense.  What did you do with Do Yeon?

392
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,640
I killed her.

393
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:48,030
How dare you shoot me?

394
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:51,760
I can't really figure out who you are yet.

395
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:56,360
But if you came to kill me, you should have found out more about me.

396
00:41:57,310 --> 00:42:00,140
I don't treat just anyone like a human.

397
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:06,340
You crazy bastard!

398
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:17,470
I just knocked her out, that's all.

399
00:42:17,470 --> 00:42:20,170
She is at home.

400
00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:28,200
It's the truth!

401
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,070
Please save me!

402
00:42:30,070 --> 00:42:33,710
I am not interested in who you are or where you came from.

403
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:37,240
If there is even a scratch on Do Yeon's body,

404
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:40,030
you will die at my hands for sure.

405
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:53,730
Noona.

406
00:42:55,170 --> 00:42:58,000
Do Yeon!  Do Yeon!

407
00:43:05,830 --> 00:43:08,730
Yes, Sergeant. Please send an ambulance to my house.

408
00:43:08,730 --> 00:43:11,550
And I arrested the suspect.

409
00:43:24,010 --> 00:43:28,030
I heard police officers' families sometimes receive threats,

410
00:43:28,030 --> 00:43:31,010
but I didn't expect something like this to happen.

411
00:43:34,370 --> 00:43:35,740
Why do you smile?

412
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:39,050
Just.

413
00:43:39,090 --> 00:43:41,130
It is just interesting.

414
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,870
Weren't you scared?

415
00:43:44,870 --> 00:43:49,480
Would I have become friends with you if I were the kind of girl who would be scared about something like this?

416
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:51,850
Are you okay?

417
00:43:53,870 --> 00:43:56,840
I am okay.  It's just a small cut.

418
00:43:56,840 --> 00:44:00,710
But why did that man say he was five years old?

419
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:07,090
He is... just a crazy bastard.

420
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:26,840
Even though he had a knife, how could you shoot twice?

421
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:29,310
What would have happened if he died?

422
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:33,270
Is it because of Reporter Kim?

423
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:37,200
You like Reporter Kim, don't you?

424
00:44:38,030 --> 00:44:41,460
It's not like that.  We are just friends.

425
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:47,970
Why do you laugh?

426
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:53,110
- I asked why do you laugh? 
 - Can't I even laugh?

427
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:58,170
When is it possible to visit?

428
00:44:58,170 --> 00:45:01,040
Tomorrow at the earliest.

429
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:02,710
Do you want something to drink?

430
00:45:02,710 --> 00:45:05,240
I am fine.  You go ahead and drink.

431
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:10,420
I want to drink this cola.

432
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:14,770
But every time I press cola, I get a rice drink. I've already had three cans of rice drink.

433
00:45:16,110 --> 00:45:19,720
Press the rice drink, then cola will probably come out.

434
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:24,490
Oh!

435
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:33,720

436
00:45:37,710 --> 00:45:39,710
- Would you like to have a  rice drink? 
 - No.

437
00:45:42,570 --> 00:45:44,480
It's the fourth can.

438
00:45:47,810 --> 00:45:50,900
Oh, that's right.  This belongs to the suspect.

439
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:54,730
There is quite a bit of cash and a few credit cards.  Nothing much.

440
00:46:03,790 --> 00:46:07,270
What is that?  Is it something you've seen before?

441
00:46:11,950 --> 00:46:13,770
Where are you going?

442
00:46:21,490 --> 00:46:24,230
I am going in.  Get the car ready.

443
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:27,210
Yes, Sir.

444
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:23,180
Just one more shot.

445
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:25,910
Ah, it's nice so one more.

446
00:47:27,150 --> 00:47:28,610
Jin Gyeom!

447
00:47:28,610 --> 00:47:32,470
Jin Gyeom! Oh my!

448
00:47:32,470 --> 00:47:35,030
Why haven't you come by for so long?

449
00:47:35,030 --> 00:47:36,570
I am sorry.  Have you been well?

450
00:47:36,570 --> 00:47:39,510
- Of course.  Did you eat? 
 - I ate.

451
00:47:39,510 --> 00:47:43,030
Come by often.  After you moved out, she only bothers me.

452
00:47:43,030 --> 00:47:45,050
Or call at least.

453
00:47:45,050 --> 00:47:46,780
Look at this.

454
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:51,160
So, why did you come?  I heard you caught him.

455
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:55,080
Yes.  There is something I need to find.

456
00:48:49,770 --> 00:48:52,040
Why are you looking at your mom's stuff?

457
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:57,450
Yes?

458
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:00,270
What did you say?

459
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:04,090
Why did Dong Ho get shot?

460
00:49:35,810 --> 00:49:38,090
You didn't have to shoot him.

461
00:49:38,090 --> 00:49:40,860
Besides, he's a police officer.

462
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:43,320
Hyung,

463
00:49:44,730 --> 00:49:49,640
once a precedent is set, things become harder for those who work in the field.

464
00:49:52,230 --> 00:49:56,670
Though it won't matter to you once you return to the highest position in headquarters.

465
00:49:56,670 --> 00:50:01,130
I chose what is best for Alice.

466
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:08,650
The client's time card disappeared.

467
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:12,010
I think it's in the hands of the police.

468
00:50:12,010 --> 00:50:15,240
The police? Who?

469
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:19,650
Park Jin Gyeom, he's a lieutenant in the police department.

470
00:50:21,290 --> 00:50:23,840
We need to take care of this quietly.

471
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:26,520
The people of the past are the same people as us.

472
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:28,800
I'll take care of things myself.

473
00:50:32,270 --> 00:50:35,970
Now, listen up. Find out everything you can about Park Jin Gyeom.

474
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,610
We are already looking into it.

475
00:50:37,620 --> 00:50:39,840
We'll submit the files to you once they're ready.

476
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:41,040
Good job.

477
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:43,380
Hye Soo, bring Yang Hong Seob back.

478
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:45,590
Okay, understood.

479
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:52,890
Are you okay?

480
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:56,800
Of course. My nickname is Man of Steel.

481
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:58,130
It suits you.

482
00:50:58,130 --> 00:51:00,420
Did you see his face?

483
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:02,060
No, I didn't see it.

484
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:05,090
I was suddenly blinded.

485
00:51:05,090 --> 00:51:07,310
I think it's the same person.

486
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:09,360
The same person?

487
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:10,810
Yes.

488
00:51:10,810 --> 00:51:12,030
Did you check the CCTV?

489
00:51:12,030 --> 00:51:15,230
I did, but nothing was recorded.

490
00:51:15,230 --> 00:51:17,980
- Again? 
 - You didn't see the gun either?

491
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:21,630
The doctor said it didn't seem like an ordinary gun.

492
00:51:21,630 --> 00:51:22,610
What are you saying?

493
00:51:22,610 --> 00:51:26,920
He said the bullet is so small it isn't visible with the naked eye.

494
00:51:36,530 --> 00:51:38,860
Hey, are you guys shooting a movie?

495
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:42,620
You guys used a gun to get him, but you got shot instead
and missed him?

496
00:51:42,620 --> 00:51:44,410
Stop it.

497
00:51:44,410 --> 00:51:46,250
Do you think we feel good about it?

498
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:48,500
That's why I'm saying!  Hurry up and capture him!

499
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:50,690
What kind of guy is he?

500
00:51:51,290 --> 00:51:54,640
- I don't know. 
 - The suspect was in the hospital.

501
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:57,290
You didn't check his identity?

502
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:01,060
His fingerprints are not in the database.

503
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:02,580
What?

504
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:07,270
I have no idea where he came from.

505
00:52:07,930 --> 00:52:12,130
Give us a couple more days. We'll figure it out somehow.

506
00:52:21,410 --> 00:52:23,330

507
00:52:23,330 --> 00:52:25,730

508
00:52:25,730 --> 00:52:28,380

509
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:40,510
 You said the cause of death was by gunshot.

510
00:52:40,510 --> 00:52:42,550
 It's not an ordinary bullet.

511
00:52:42,550 --> 00:52:47,240
 All the bullets are so small, we can't even identify them with our eyes.

512
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:49,500

513
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:57,700

514
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:04,950
Where are you?

515
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,450
I think he's faking it.

516
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:21,690
You didn't actually get shot, did you?

517
00:53:21,690 --> 00:53:24,700
How could you say that? Ah!

518
00:53:33,590 --> 00:53:35,360
Hello!

519
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:38,220
Wow! You get treated to meat by getting shot.

520
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,650
One more soju glass, please.

521
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:41,620
Are you okay?

522
00:53:41,620 --> 00:53:43,320
Yes. I'm okay.

523
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:46,730
He didn't get shot. He's faking it.

524
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:52,740
Let's toast. Everyone worked well!

525
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:55,100
I don't even expect Jin Gyeom to join in,

526
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:57,130
but why aren't you drinking?

527
00:53:57,130 --> 00:53:59,230
I don't want to lose muscle.

528
00:53:59,230 --> 00:54:01,870
It'd be fine if you lost some. You look like a freak.

529
00:54:01,870 --> 00:54:04,420
Why? I think he looks great.

530
00:54:06,210 --> 00:54:07,510
Cheers!

531
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:19,110

532
00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:22,310
The gun that killed your mom...

533
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:25,450
I think it's the same one.

534
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:30,360
I think so, too.

535
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:32,370
What are you going to do?

536
00:54:32,370 --> 00:54:34,690
I'm going to catch him.

537
00:54:34,690 --> 00:54:36,740
Do you have any leads?

538
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:55,180

539
00:55:57,780 --> 00:56:00,600
Don't you have anything to do? I told you I'd give you a call.

540
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:02,310
Did you find anything?

541
00:56:02,310 --> 00:56:05,970
I investigated it but couldn't find anything special.

542
00:56:05,970 --> 00:56:09,160
Oh, both of these are regular cards.

543
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:11,710
Aren't you mistaken?

544
00:56:11,710 --> 00:56:15,110
Is there an expert that I can talk to on this?

545
00:56:15,110 --> 00:56:19,020
I don't know. I'm not too familiar with that field.

546
00:56:19,020 --> 00:56:22,410
Then I'll look into it myself. Thank you.

547
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:49,370
I don't have the time card. Where is Park Jin Gyeom right now?

548
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:51,980
At a college.

549
00:56:51,980 --> 00:56:54,050
I'm not sure why he's here though.

550
00:56:54,050 --> 00:56:56,100
Wait a moment.

551
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:02,170
There is one professor, but she's in a lecture now.

552
00:57:02,170 --> 00:57:04,420
Where is the lecture hall?

553
00:57:22,650 --> 00:57:26,100
 Hey! You don't understand this?

554
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:29,930
 How can you be majoring in Physics when you don't even get this?

555
00:57:29,930 --> 00:57:32,410
 Are you all idiots?

556
00:57:34,150 --> 00:57:42,010

557
00:58:06,590 --> 00:58:08,390
What is it?

558
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:16,540
♫  ...and if you're going through this messy life  ♫

559
00:58:16,540 --> 00:58:23,660
♫  When there is no end in sight,  ♫

560
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:25,950
I said, who are you?

561
00:58:26,490 --> 00:58:32,510
♫  I'll trust every moment of you  ♫

562
00:58:32,510 --> 00:58:38,960
♫  From the beginning, I'll follow my chosen fate  ♫

563
00:58:40,860 --> 00:58:43,110
What is it?

564
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:54,320
♫  Whenever, wherever, whatever, with you  ♫

565
00:58:54,320 --> 00:59:01,730
♫  One day and somewhere, I'll be with you  ♫

566
00:59:01,730 --> 00:59:10,310
♫  Whenever, wherever, whatever, stay with you  ♫

567
00:59:10,310 --> 00:59:16,160
♫  No matter how far we go  ♫

568
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:18,550
♫  We'll see each other again  ♫

569
00:59:18,550 --> 00:59:21,800
♫  Again, promise me again  ♫

570
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:25,420
♫  By the time that passed  ♫

571
00:59:25,420 --> 00:59:29,790
♫  I'll be here with a light smile  ♫

572
00:59:29,790 --> 00:59:32,750
 Yoon Tae Yi and your mother are completely irrelevant.

573
00:59:32,750 --> 00:59:34,370
 Did you mistake me for someone else?

574
00:59:34,370 --> 00:59:35,670
 Are you a time traveler?

575
00:59:35,670 --> 00:59:37,500
 Why do you keep asking about time travel?

576
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:38,660
 I have someone I must catch.

577
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:39,960
 What's the matter now?

578
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:41,620
 I have a couple things to ask you.

579
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:43,100
 Get out of here. This is my place!

580
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:44,220
 Can you find out more about this card?

581
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:46,110
 It belonged to my deceased mother.

582
00:59:46,110 --> 00:59:48,680
 Is there a connection between your mom and time travel?

583
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:51,670
 Let's get back the time card tonight. Where is Park Jin Gyeom?

584
00:59:51,670 --> 00:59:55,520
 Is that what they call a time card? I guess we can't let you live.

585
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:58,000
 Who are you people?
