1
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:34,100
 "Unpredictable time

2
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:37,900
 will give you more time." 
 - Horace  -

3
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,000

4
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,900

5
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,400
Mom!

6
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
You became a mochi cake!

7
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,400
Ah, I am hungry.

8
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,000
What is this?

9
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,800
Oh my! So devoted!  Are you worried that he might be alone?

10
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,600
What are you talking about?  Our Madam Gong is getting imaginative again.

11
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,200
Why?  Is someone alone?

12
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,000
No, no.  There isn't.

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
There is.  The coolest and the most pitiful...

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,800
The chicest...

15
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,000
Ah, Mom!

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000

17
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:39,400
I knew you would be alone looking pathetic like this.

18
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,200
Why did you come here?

19
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,200
I'm not here to congratulate you for graduating. I came to congratulate you for getting in!

20
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,000
Why are bouquets so expensive?

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,600
That's why I didn't buy one.

22
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,400
I'll buy you pork belly and soju, instead.

23
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,100
Let's go. My junior.

24
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,200

25
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,400
Jin Gyeom,

26
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,800
just try one shot. You graduated, now!

27
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,900
It's not even good for your body. I don't know why I have to drink it.

28
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,800
Don't drink! Don't drink it!

29
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,400
Live until you write on the walls with poop.

30
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:26,000
You don't understand... You don't drink alcohol for the flavor.

31
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,600
Thank you.

32
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,200
A call came from my wife.

33
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:46,700
I'm not scared of gangsters, but I'm scared of my wife.

34
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,100
Don't you have any children?

35
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,000
I used to have a son.

36
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,060
You said that you're going to a dorm?

37
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,600
What are you going to do with your stuff?

38
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:16,100
You should sell it or rent it. It's a waste leaving it empty.

39
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,100
How did he die?

40
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:29,400
He had an abnormality with his heart from birth.

41
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,200
I want to just leave the house I used to live in with my mom as is.

42
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,900
Jin Gyeom,

43
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm telling you this because I know you well. You shouldn't ask those things so freely.

44
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,200
And if you heard the response you should say, "Is that so?"

45
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,600
"I'm sorry." Got it?

46
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:56,700
I didn't force you to tell me. Why should I apologize?

47
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,300
Because you made me remember what I didn't want to remember.

48
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:03,200
Even if you don't want to remember, you should still... since he's family.

49
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,980
Okay.

50
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:11,990
Let's just stop.

51
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,200
Get home safe.

52
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:22,500
- Thank you for coming today. I enjoyed the food. 
 - Sure thing.

53
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Madam!

54
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,400
- Did you eat well? 
 - Yes.

55
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,400
Thank you.

56
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,800
Detective Do,

57
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,600
have you been well?

58
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,300
Do I know you?

59
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,800
Are you out of your mind, jerk?

60
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:52,400
Yeah, I'm crazy. How could I not be? I went to jail because of you!

61
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,400
Mister, are you okay?

62
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,100
B-Behind you...

63
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,700
Mister. Mister!

64
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,200

65
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,200
Police Academy's top graduate, Park Jin Gyeom.

66
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:29,200
The above mentioned is receiving this award for completing the Bachelor of Laws at the Police Academy with top marks.

67
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,800
Presented by the Police Academy's Dean, Jeong Eun Il.

68
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,400
Hey! Smile a bit!

69
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:01,000
Yeah, smile a bit. The pictures are coming out all dark because of you.

70
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,200
They're coming out dark because of you, not Jin Gyeom!

71
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,000
Jin Gyeom is so handsome even if he just stands there.

72
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,600
Oh, for goodness sake! I'm just going to take it whether it comes out nice or not!

73
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,300
One, two, three!

74
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,400
Hey, Jin Gyeom.

75
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:51,030
I must really be a weirdo.

76
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:58,200
The person who took care of me like a father all this time is in critical condition,

77
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,800
but I don't really know

78
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,700
how I feel.

79
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,250
If it's sadness or distress...

80
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,000
Or if I really don't feel anything at all.

81
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,500
I feel that way when I get scared, too. Everyone is like that. You're not weird.

82
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,100
Don't worry.

83
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:27,000
You didn't eat, right? There's a cafeteria on the bottom floor.

84
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
It's okay. I don't feel like eating.

85
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
You should still eat something.

86
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,600
Should I go get something at the convenience store?

87
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,400
I'll be right back. Wait here.

88
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,600
Why didn't you answer your phone? Do you know how many times I called you?

89
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:56,860
I went all the way to the police station looking for you.

90
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:03,220
I have a lot of things to discuss with you. Do you have time?

91
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,300
Why do you keep crying every time you see me?

92
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:23,520

93
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,180
You seem to be the sentimental type.

94
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,000
Are you the type to cry when you watch dramas?

95
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,100
How did someone with that personality become a policeman?

96
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:45,320
I've never seen a man cry, but I've seen you cry twice.

97
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,100
I'm sorry I keep showing you weird sides of me.

98
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:54,400
Why are you so stoic normally, though?

99
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,600
- Have you always been that way? 
 - Yes.

100
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,000
What was your nickname when you were in school?

101
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,800
I didn't have a set nickname.

102
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,900
A few kids used to call me a psychopath.

103
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:16,400
Did that have a dual meaning?

104
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,200
No.

105
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,800
Is it because you have no expression?

106
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,400
Oh, uh, never mind. I don't care.

107
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:37,400
Was this really left by your deceased mother?

108
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,800
Yes.

109
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,200
What year was she born?

110
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,600
She was born in '68.

111
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,800
What was her job?

112
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,400
She was an ordinary housewife.

113
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:51,200
You weren't that close to your mom, huh? And you didn't talk to her much?

114
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:57,200
Your mother was definitely not an ordinary housewife.

115
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,700
What do you mean?

116
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:05,800
To be honest, I don't know what this card is either.

117
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,700
But I know one thing for sure.

118
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:13,600
This is something that couldn't have been made with today's scientific technology.

119
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,200
I've never seen a chip made with this kind of process before.

120
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,800
And you're telling me that she was an ordinary housewife?

121
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,200
Someone who owned an item that can't be made with current technology

122
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,000
ten years ago in 2010?

123
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,800
How did your mother pass away?

124
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,200
If it's hard for you to say, you don't have to.

125
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,100
She was killed.

126
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,800
I'm sorry.

127
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:02,210
You shouldn't have told me if it was something like that...

128
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,900
It's okay.

129
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:13,400
Would it be all right if I saw other things your mother left behind?

130
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:19,200
There might be more clues about your mother.

131
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:40,260
Did you live in this house since you were 20 years old?

132
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,290
Yes.

133
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:44,950
Then you definitely were a family.

134
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:48,460
Come this way, please.

135
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:03,250
Wow, this is cool!

136
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:40,920
Please stop now.

137
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,140
What?

138
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,380
I think I must have been crazy for a little while.

139
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:50,920
Knowing that it wasn't true, I was hoping for it to be true.

140
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,100
What are you saying?

141
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:55,590
My mother might not be an ordinary housewife.

142
00:12:55,590 --> 00:13:01,030
But she was not this rude of a person, either.

143
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,770
I will ask someone else to analyze the card.

144
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:16,030
Why are you like this all of a sudden?

145
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:21,290
You don't know since your mother is alive.

146
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,790
- Please leave. 
 - Lieutenant.

147
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,840
Did something happen again?

148
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,280
Did you have a fight with someone?

149
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:16,350
Why are both of you spewing out crap?   How do you see your daughter?

150
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:19,590
I did have a fight but he really was a strange one.

151
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:23,700
He gave me a hard time then chased me out.

152
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,600
Do you want to go to church with mom?

153
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,740
Then, wouldn't you be more at peace?

154
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:30,650
Or maybe date someone.

155
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:32,820
Don't you have anyone you are seeing?

156
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:37,940
I came to eat Jjamppong, not your sermon.

157
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:42,560
I only had two spoonfuls of Jjamppong but I am so full I could die.

158
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:52,850

159
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:56,770
You should sleepover.

160
00:14:56,770 --> 00:15:00,050
It's been a while... I am going to visit Director Mom.

161
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:02,130
Sister Director?  Why?

162
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:05,820
Just.  I miss her.

163
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:10,280
- I am going, Dad.
 - Okay.

164
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,880
Go back in.

165
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,260

166
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:12,360

167
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:15,980
- Sister! 
 - Sister!

168
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:19,600
Shall we play with Sister?

169
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,630
 Rock, Paper, Scissors.

170
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:34,790
 Why?  Are you going to climb up and fall again?

171
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:36,720
Mother!

172
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:43,690
Have you been well?

173
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,340
Here.

174
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,620
Do you still remember?

175
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:00,710
How could I forget 2, 2, 3? 
  (T/N: A ratio for coffee, cream, and sugar.)

176
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:05,130
Aren't you hurting anywhere?  Any rascals giving you a hard time?

177
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:08,020
There is no oddball quite like you.

178
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:13,450
Of course!  Is there anyone else among your children who got into Hanguk University?

179
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:17,880
How many levels did I raise the status for the Hope Orphanage?

180
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,430
I am sorry for being ungrateful, Professor.

181
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:23,670
All thanks to you, Mother.

182
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:27,860

183
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:30,010
Yes, Senior.

184
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:31,840
We found Eun Soo's mom.

185
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:35,250
She went into her residence in Jamshil 20 minutes ago.

186
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:55,720

187
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,390
Eun Soo...

188
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,170
Yes.

189
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:10,220
We are waiting in Room 712.  When are you coming?

190
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:15,150
No.  I haven't met anyone from Alice yet.

191
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:21,060
My baby is very sick.  Please hurry.

192
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:38,120

193
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:01,840
Eun Soo!  Eun Soo!

194
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:15,790
Please send an ambulance here.

195
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:19,210
Eun Soo has a skin reaction and is unconscious.

196
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:27,100
If we were a little late, you would have been arrested by the police.

197
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,920
Don't worry about your child.

198
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,750
She was given medication so she will get better soon.

199
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,190
I see.

200
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,130
Eun Soo, are you all right?

201
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:54,900
You should have come earlier to catch me.

202
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,480
We wanted to catch the body.

203
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:01,850
Was it because of the illegal stay that you contacted the illegal broker?

204
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:07,220
You were supposed to meet him here, were you not?  Where is your cellphone?

205
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:22,260

206
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:25,570

207
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:38,430
Excuse me.

208
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:40,870

209
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:44,410
Excuse me.

210
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:49,210
Police. May I see your phone?

211
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:52,210
Shouldn't you at least explain why?

212
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:54,540
Please show me.

213
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:56,560
Fine.

214
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:07,710
Where's Eun Soo's mother?

215
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:09,840
Mom.

216
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:14,120
Oh, Eun Soo.

217
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:20,260
It's all right. Your mom will be back soon.

218
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:33,180
He arrived. He's on the emergency staircase.

219
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,620
Okay.

220
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:36,130
You take the client and return to Alice.

221
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:37,630
Okay.

222
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:40,280
This way, please.

223
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:19,470
It's you again, Little rat.

224
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:22,690
Tell me where your body is.

225
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,710
Tell me where it is.

226
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:45,320
Seriously, who are you guys?

227
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,190
What are you doing here?

228
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:48,950
Is this your dying statement?

229
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:31,990
Hey.

230
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:40,800
How do you get knocked out with one blow?

231
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:44,010
Do some personal training with this big brother sometime.

232
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:45,710
Are you okay?

233
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:47,220
When did you get discharged from the hospital?

234
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:50,930
How could I stay still after I heard about what happened to Team Leader?

235
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:55,910
Who's this? Was he sent by Eun Soo's mom?

236
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,670
Don't do anything you'll regret.

237
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:12,310
Stop saying useless things and stay quiet.

238
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:16,850
Watch him. I'll go find Eun Soo's mother.

239
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:18,730
I'll go with you.

240
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:22,210
He can't get away.

241
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:25,600
He's important. Stay with him.

242
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:31,360
Jeez...

243
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:13,370
Why did you come up here?

244
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:16,520
Well, that's because...

245
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:28,700
He just disappeared into thin air with this still locked.

246
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:48,570
 - Is it all better? 
 - Yeah.

247
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:38,220
There's something interesting about time travel.

248
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:42,670
It's that we can freely control the duration of the trip.

249
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:47,290
That means ten years in 2020

250
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:52,240
can be just one day in 2050.

251
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:56,540
To clarify...

252
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:04,140
I can trap you here by my authority.

253
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:07,480
Whether it's ten years or one hundred years.

254
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:16,190
Are you... threatening me right now?

255
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:19,830
I'm letting you know to prevent any more tragedies.

256
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:24,900
Please tell me everything you know about the broker.

257
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:34,300
 You can relax now.

258
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:37,010
 I will take you to your destination.

259
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:39,260
 Thank you.

260
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:45,630
 If you are to get caught,

261
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:49,560
 don't tell them anything about us.

262
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:52,200
 I have a bad temper,

263
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:57,110
 so I might do something bad to your daughter here.

264
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:04,230
Did you love your daughter so much that you chose illegal immigration?

265
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:11,600
Because of you, your daughter will now grow up without a mother.

266
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:33,310
Honey!

267
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:35,990
Honey!

268
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:03,120
Mister,

269
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:08,270
is my mom in there?

270
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:10,810
When is she coming out?

271
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,410
I'm sure I locked the handcuffs.

272
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:36,010
How did he disappear without even unlocking the cuffs? Is he a ghost?

273
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:40,710
Whether he's a ghost or a monster, we just need to recapture him.

274
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:49,660
Eun Soo's mother won't talk.

275
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:52,260
I think she's really scared.

276
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:54,580
I'll try to make her talk.

277
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:59,340
She even killed herself to save her daughter.

278
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:01,530
Our staff died.

279
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:03,950
And Alice got exposed to the police here.

280
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:05,810
Don't bother her.

281
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:09,500
Just let her go quietly. She's still a client.

282
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:15,770
You think I don't have any feelings or emotions, right?

283
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:20,010
I didn't look for Tae Yi.

284
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:23,330
I didn't even get sad at the news that the baby died.

285
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:36,040
I'll follow your judgment for now.

286
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:40,860
But if you really want to protect Alice,

287
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:44,380
you should rethink this.

288
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:12,390
Why don't you leave this to another staff and take a break?

289
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:16,880
I'm comfortable here. Did you need something?

290
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,120
Let Eun Soo's mom go.

291
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,470
Understood.

292
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:25,780
Also, Lee Se Hoon is getting released from prison soon.

293
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:26,900
Who?

294
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:30,930
The man who got his ankle cut by Team Leader Yoo.

295
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:33,150
I'll bring him.

296
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:36,100
We need to find Yeon Seo.

297
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:38,480
Isn't that Team Leader Yoo's job?

298
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:45,790
Seeing that man is going to remind Team Leader Yoo of Tae Yi and he's going to have a hard time.

299
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:43,900
Unnie, you didn't sleep?

300
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:46,430
I slept. Three days ago.

301
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:50,430
You're going to destroy your skin. Get some sleep.

302
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:54,120
Do you think my skin is important right now?

303
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:04,780
My face feels tight.

304
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:09,090
Are you writing another dissertation? Why are you staying up so much?

305
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:10,780
It's because of the card.

306
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:13,560
No matter how much I think about it, I think I need the card.

307
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:16,180
Why? Did your card get blocked?

308
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:18,980
Do you think I'm like you?

309
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:22,670
I'm getting more pissed off the more I think about it. Who is he to kick me out?

310
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:25,870
How can there be someone with such a weird personality and be so unlikeable?

311
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:28,620
- Are you talking about yourself? 
 - Park Jin Gyeom.

312
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:30,730
What? Do you still see that guy?

313
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:31,990
I thought he was a pervert.

314
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:35,000
He is. And he's a crybaby.

315
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:39,310
I should just forget about it.

316
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:51,910
I don't know.

317
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:54,690
I really don't know.

318
00:33:56,850 --> 00:33:58,770
I can't figure it out.

319
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,040
I need the card!

320
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,190
The card!

321
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:09,690
Card!

322
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:18,730
The doctor said he's all right.

323
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:21,950
He's at an age where he needed some tuning up, anyway.

324
00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:26,010
He can get a physical and everything while he's here. It's a good thing.

325
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,570
You little...

326
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:31,750
Learn to speak nicely!

327
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:33,580
Okay.

328
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:35,830
Where's Jin Gyeom?

329
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:39,900
Mister! Why do you always look for Jin Gyeom only?

330
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:42,610
I'm the one who always looks out for you on holidays and your birthdays.

331
00:34:42,610 --> 00:34:45,510
Jin Gyeom doesn't do any of those!

332
00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:13,270
He's one of the suspects I saw when I rescued Eun Soo.

333
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:14,480
Are you sure?

334
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,590
Yes. What happened?

335
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:20,580
An employee who manages the parking lot discovered him and reported it.

336
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:22,970
We haven't found out the cause and time of death.

337
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:25,770
They found the last number he called on his cell phone.

338
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:27,990
I'll go.

339
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:31,700
So, where's the card?

340
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:33,700
He said he's going to ask someone else for an analysis.

341
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:37,180
- Why? 
 - I don't know.

342
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:41,070
Did you pick a fight with the card owner?

343
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:47,410
Why are you like that? Do you want to go church with me?

344
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:50,940
Why are people trying to force religion on me these days?

345
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:53,320
I'm sure there's a good reason.

346
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,990
If we don't have the card, we can't analyze it anymore.

347
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,330
Look over there.

348
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:05,740
The front of the card. No matter how I think about it, I think it's a screen.

349
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:06,990
That makes no sense.

350
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:10,120
That. Doesn't it look like an intermediate product?

351
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:13,390
Even if that's the case, how does it glow?

352
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:14,670
It doesn't have any fluorescent material.

353
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:15,690

354
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:17,150
There's something we're missing.

355
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:21,640
We need the card to find what we're missing. Try persuading the card owner again.

356
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:22,870
Are you crazy?

357
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:26,560
Why should I? He should be the one asking me!

358
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:29,490
Should I just steal it?

359
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:30,690
He's a cop.

360
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:32,960
What should I do?

361
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:39,130
Didn't you say he cries a lot? Maybe try appealing to his emotions.

362
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:41,810
What do I say?

363
00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:43,620
I don't know.

364
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:54,720

365
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,570
You can enter.

366
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:04,040
Lieutenant!

367
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:08,550
Why are you here?

368
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:11,150
I have something to investigate.

369
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:12,910
You're so weird.

370
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:16,060
Don't you feel like there's something missing in our conversation?

371
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:19,990
Shouldn't you ask, "Why are you here, Professor?" when we're running into each other at such a random place?

372
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:23,190
Isn't that only natural?

373
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:25,240
I wasn't curious.

374
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:27,070
Why do you lack so much curiosity?

375
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:29,300
I'm curious. Why are you here?

376
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,720
I told you I'm here because I have something to investigate.

377
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:34,590
Yeah, so what are you investigating?

378
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:38,530
Are you here to commission an analysis on the card?

379
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:40,670
No.

380
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:42,400
Where's the card, then?

381
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,760
In my wallet.

382
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,440
If you're not even going to commission it, why are you carrying it around?

383
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:49,480
That's not something for you to worry about.

384
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:03,040
If you wait here, the manager will come down.

385
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,970
Okay.

386
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:42,410
You have quick wits.

387
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:44,810
What are you doing?

388
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:48,690
Leave the card to me.

389
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:52,300
I really don't ask for favors from others.

390
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:57,420
But I'm going crazy out of curiosity of what that card is.

391
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:13,430
Didn't you say you were busy because of your dissertations?

392
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:15,560
I'm busy.

393
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,700
Then, why aren't you leaving?

394
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:22,530
I'm not staying because of you.

395
00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:26,100
I'm waiting to say hello to the manager. It's been a while.

396
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:28,350
Did you work here?

397
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:30,210
I thought you weren't curious.

398
00:39:30,210 --> 00:39:35,290
Is everyone that works here a scientist like you?

399
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:39,120
Of course. Who do you think works at a research lab?

400
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:42,330
Are you mad at me?

401
00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:44,560
No.

402
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,470
That's a relief.

403
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:52,690
I think I'm going to get anger issues talking to you.

404
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:58,340
Are you still mad about the incident with the item your mother left?

405
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:00,820
Let's not talk about that anymore.

406
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:06,350
I apologize for that time.

407
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:13,540
I did that because I thought you might be able to find out more about your mother.

408
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:17,420
It's all right, so don't worry about it.

409
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:21,620
What about the criminal?

410
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:23,950
We're still investigating.

411
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:26,620
I hope you catch him soon.

412
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:31,350
Sir, have you been well?

413
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:33,760
Dr. Yoon, it's been such a long time.

414
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,240
What brings you here?

415
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:41,430
I came for some personal business, then came to see you for even more personal business.

416
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:45,340
You're Lieutenant Park Jin Gyeom, right?

417
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:47,390
I'm Seok Oh Won.

418
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:52,860
What are you doing?

419
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:02,100

420
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,770
What are you doing?

421
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:20,840

422
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:26,940
There is a witness who saw this man with your mother right before she was killed.

423
00:41:36,850 --> 00:41:39,920
What nonsense are you saying now?

424
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:43,090
Why would Director kill a person?

425
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:47,940
Director, call an attorney and file a lawsuit for assault.

426
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:52,520
This is an attempted murder!  How do you strangle someone just because of a montage from 10 years ago?!

427
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:54,290
Please stop, Lieutenant.

428
00:41:54,290 --> 00:41:59,060
I saw the montage.  Even I think I look very similar.  It is understandable how you might have misunderstood.

429
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:03,950
They say legally,  it is innocent until proven guilty; but when it's personal, it's guilty until proven innocent.

430
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:07,390
Lieutenant.

431
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:19,170
The arrest warrant got rejected.  It's a 10-year-old case.  It's a push, just with a montage.

432
00:42:20,930 --> 00:42:22,900
I understand.

433
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:32,040
Did the misunderstanding get cleared a bit now?

434
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,940
You can't just let it pass.

435
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:35,880
It was about his mother.

436
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:40,110
If you end it here, I will understand and let it pass, too.

437
00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:44,890
How do you know each other?

438
00:42:44,890 --> 00:42:48,680
Are you calling that a question after strangling someone?

439
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:01,830
If I were you, I would also have done exactly the same.

440
00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:05,490
No, I would have shot a gun first.

441
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:10,420
But I don't think it's him.

442
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:13,840
It may be related to the deceased Jeong Ki Hoon but...

443
00:43:14,610 --> 00:43:19,030
it doesn't seem to be related to your deceased mother's case.

444
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:22,940
Why are so many strange things happening?

445
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:27,770
How is it that the two of them are together?

446
00:43:29,770 --> 00:43:32,750
 You have heard of the Butterfly Effect, haven't you?

447
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:34,870
Yes.

448
00:43:34,870 --> 00:43:37,810
The term "Butterfly Effect" became widely known

449
00:43:37,810 --> 00:43:41,280
because of Lorentz the meteorologist's assertion.

450
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:44,790
It was an assertion that even with a small change on the other side of the earth,

451
00:43:44,790 --> 00:43:49,300
the weather can be changed entirely.

452
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:51,240
But...

453
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:55,490
Why the term "Butterfly Effect?"

454
00:43:55,490 --> 00:44:00,890
If we are talking about things that fly, eagles can fly so can mosquitos.

455
00:44:04,190 --> 00:44:05,930
​

456
00:44:05,930 --> 00:44:08,960
It's because of a certain Sci-Fi fiction.

457
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:12,860
It is a short story published in 1952 titled "A Sound of Thunder."

458
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:17,110
Because of one regenerated butterfly, the outcome of a future presidential election changed and

459
00:44:17,110 --> 00:44:23,320
a totalitarian radical like Hitler will get elected.  That's what the story is about.

460
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:28,510
But have you thought about this?

461
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:35,080
If the past changes, will the future really change as well?

462
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:41,680
Let's suppose that I, the one in present year 2020, got into an accident and

463
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:45,280
my leg became disabled.

464
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,300
So...

465
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:53,000
I travel in a time machine to the past and warn my past self of 10 years ago.

466
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:57,760
You are going to get into an accident in 2020 so... be careful.

467
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:05,200
Thanks to that warning, I, of the past, avoided the accident in 2020.

468
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,020
Then...

469
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:13,170
the leg that traveled in a time machine to the 10 years past...

470
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:19,980
What condition would it be in?

471
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:27,010
The one who avoided the accident in the year 2020,

472
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:31,510
is not me of the present but rather the future me.  Isn't that right?

473
00:45:31,510 --> 00:45:36,590
Therefore, I think that I get divided into me, the one who got into an accident, and another me who avoided the accident.

474
00:45:36,590 --> 00:45:41,990
This is called the parallel universe.

475
00:45:43,970 --> 00:45:46,830
What you often call multiverse is a similar idea.

476
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:48,500

477
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:50,760
Are there any questions?

478
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:02,380
Did you come to apologize?

479
00:46:03,450 --> 00:46:07,040
Do you know someone named Jeong Ki Hoon?

480
00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:13,610
I was expecting an apology.  I am a bit disappointed.

481
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:16,880
No, it's my first time hearing that name.

482
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:21,860
Someone named Jeong Ki Hoon, a suspect I was chasing, had been here.

483
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:26,450
That's not possible.  You should verify it with him.

484
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:28,340
He is dead.

485
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:30,970
That's unfortunate.

486
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:35,950
Okay.  I will try to confirm it.

487
00:46:43,870 --> 00:46:49,270
Yes, Department Manager. By any chance, is there someone named Jeong Ki Hoon among our lab employees or researchers?

488
00:46:49,270 --> 00:46:54,770
Oh, please check the visitor's log as well.

489
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:58,670
Yes, I understand.

490
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:07,340
According to the computer record, there is no such person.

491
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:16,780
Why do I get the feeling that Jeong Ki Hoon is just an excuse and that you are actually here to see me?

492
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:30,380
By any chance, do you also conduct research on drones at this lab?

493
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:33,100
It's confidential so I can't tell you.

494
00:47:37,530 --> 00:47:42,850
Your gaze... You still seem to be looking at me like a suspect.

495
00:47:43,590 --> 00:47:49,000
I let it go because it involved your mother but you should stop now.

496
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,210
One last question.

497
00:47:57,730 --> 00:48:00,050
About time travel...

498
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:03,740
What do you think of it?

499
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,500
Detective, what do you think?

500
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:18,560
I think it is impossible.

501
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:19,620
Why?

502
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:22,940
Because I didn't personally witness it.

503
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:24,990
Does that mean you would believe it if you witness it?

504
00:48:24,990 --> 00:48:27,450
I would like to hear your opinion.

505
00:48:27,450 --> 00:48:32,730
Of course, it is possible, but

506
00:48:32,730 --> 00:48:35,750
I don't think humans should do it.

507
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:37,420
What do you mean by that?

508
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:43,000
Just because it is possible to do something does not mean it is all right to do.  Same goes for cloning humans.

509
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,030
Life. Time.

510
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:51,800
Because these all belong in the divine realm.

511
00:48:58,100 --> 00:49:00,610
I don't understand the point of your question.

512
00:49:00,610 --> 00:49:06,280
Has Director Seok Oh Won ever told you that you look like someone or talk about some complete stranger?

513
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:10,490
So... I don't understand what that means.

514
00:49:11,070 --> 00:49:13,760
What do you want to know about?

515
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:16,530
You, Professor.

516
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:20,090
I don't know who you are.

517
00:49:21,470 --> 00:49:26,530
Do you have amnesia?  Why is it that you don't know when we've met so many times?

518
00:49:27,370 --> 00:49:32,310
Just in case, please don't meet with Director Seok Oh Won for the time being.

519
00:49:32,310 --> 00:49:34,040
Why not?

520
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:38,700
Do you still think that the director is a killer?

521
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:41,730
He is not that kind of person.

522
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:46,990
But what does it have to do with me?

523
00:49:48,690 --> 00:49:53,840
Okay. I'll do as you say, so give me back the card.

524
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:59,030
No, I think it's better that you don't get involved anymore.

525
00:49:59,030 --> 00:50:01,700
I said to give me the card.

526
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:12,340
Lieutenant.

527
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:14,440
Lieutenant!

528
00:50:16,830 --> 00:50:20,090
Then sell it to me! I'll buy it.

529
00:50:20,090 --> 00:50:21,390
It was my deceased mother's.

530
00:50:21,390 --> 00:50:23,860
Then rental, I'll give you a rental fee!

531
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:25,870
Please stop.

532
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:32,060
Don't be like that! Let's talk about it while eating!

533
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:35,460
I'll buy you a meal, okay?

534
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:38,700
You startled me. What is it?

535
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:41,240
Why is this woman here?

536
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:44,740
Isn't it rude to say "this woman" in front of the person?

537
00:50:44,740 --> 00:50:48,360
Oh, my bad. I thought you wouldn't have the faintest idea of what a rude attitude was.

538
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:51,480
Why are you treating me this way? What wrong have I ever done to you?

539
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:53,060
I'm probably acting like this because you have?

540
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:55,800
- What? ​
  - Your looks.

541
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:58,570
You're picking a fight with me.

542
00:50:58,570 --> 00:51:00,850
Why would I fight against a professor?

543
00:51:00,850 --> 00:51:04,540
I really wonder how someone so immature became a professor.

544
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:07,120
- Hey! ​
 - What?!

545
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:20,290
I feel like I'm going to act rashly if I stay with this woman, so let's hurry and go eat.

546
00:51:20,290 --> 00:51:21,600
I'm hungry.

547
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:24,200
Why are you cutting in line? He's supposed to eat with me!

548
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:26,650
Why should Jin Gyeom eat with you?

549
00:51:26,650 --> 00:51:28,330
Hurry and come!

550
00:51:28,330 --> 00:51:30,650
Lieutenant, you promised to eat with me. Right?

551
00:51:30,650 --> 00:51:32,700
Don't you dare to eat with this woman.

552
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:35,170
You promised to eat with me.

553
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:41,890
I won't have lunch.

554
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:46,080
You both seem very hungry, why don't the two of you eat together?

555
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,770
What's your relationship with him?

556
00:51:59,770 --> 00:52:00,800
Isn't it obvious?

557
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:05,150
I'm asking because I don't know. Am I a fortune teller that I'd know everything by just looking?

558
00:52:05,150 --> 00:52:08,100
We are friends, but we are not ordinary friends.

559
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:09,670
And here I thought you might be someone special.

560
00:52:09,670 --> 00:52:12,130
"And here I thought you might be someone special?!"

561
00:52:17,750 --> 00:52:21,340
Calm down. That side is a fixed door.

562
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:37,360
So annoying. Why the hell is the universe so unfair?

563
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:41,830
I finally found the reason why I dislike Lieutenant Park.

564
00:52:43,540 --> 00:52:45,860
I wonder why I even exercise.

565
00:52:56,100 --> 00:53:00,630

566
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:05,080
We didn't have a chance to greet each other properly last time.

567
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:10,310
Pardon? Ah, at the police station?

568
00:53:10,310 --> 00:53:13,440
How do you know Lieutenant Park?

569
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:19,820
It's complicated to explain, but he came to see me about a card.

570
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:21,880
A card?

571
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:23,790
What kind of card?

572
00:53:23,790 --> 00:53:26,950
On the outside, it looks like an ordinary card, but there is an interlayer in it

573
00:53:26,950 --> 00:53:30,450
and a liquid crystal as well. There's no fluorescent material.

574
00:53:30,450 --> 00:53:34,640
I can't figure out for what purpose the card was made.

575
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:38,350
I can't even get an idea of where it might have been manufactured.

576
00:53:40,210 --> 00:53:41,660
I would like to see it as well.

577
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:43,500
I don't have it.

578
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:46,200
He ended up taking it back.

579
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:47,950
I see.

580
00:54:32,410 --> 00:54:35,410
​

581
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:41,090
​ Lieutenant, it's me.​

582
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:45,540
You are more tenacious than you look.

583
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:48,700
And I'm also even weirder than you think.

584
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:52,660
What is it that you want? What can I do for you to give me back the card?

585
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:56,780
I have no intention of giving it to you. Just forget about it altogether.

586
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:02,920
How can I forget it? I saw it with my own two eyes!

587
00:55:21,140 --> 00:55:22,970
What is it?

588
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:31,840
What's the matter?

589
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:36,050
There's a drone flying in front of my window.

590
00:55:49,470 --> 00:55:50,890
Hello?

591
00:55:50,890 --> 00:55:53,630

592
00:55:54,390 --> 00:55:56,200
Professor.

593
00:56:02,260 --> 00:56:03,850
I'll be there right away.

594
00:56:03,850 --> 00:56:07,940
Don't hang up and stay at the university until I arrive.

595
00:56:27,630 --> 00:56:30,100
Hello, Professor?

596
00:56:54,150 --> 00:56:56,060
Lieutenant.

597
00:56:56,060 --> 00:56:58,810
Lieutenant!

598
00:56:58,810 --> 00:57:01,350
Hey, there's been an accident here!

599
00:57:04,730 --> 00:57:06,870
What happened?

600
00:57:09,330 --> 00:57:10,770
- Shouldn't we report this? 
 - Call 911!

601
00:57:10,770 --> 00:57:11,760
Call 911!

602
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:14,220
There's no one inside!

603
00:57:15,910 --> 00:57:16,860
I'll call.

604
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:19,210
There's no one behind either!

605
00:57:19,210 --> 00:57:21,310
What about the trunk?

606
00:57:23,050 --> 00:57:26,270
​ The moment the child becomes a time traveler... ​

607
00:57:26,270 --> 00:57:29,100
 the prophecy will start.

608
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:34,530
​ But the moment of fate has not arrived yet.

609
00:58:31,110 --> 00:58:34,450

610
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:55,320
​ The moment she reunites with her child... ​

611
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:59,510
 the child will get to command time.

612
00:58:59,510 --> 00:59:01,750
Professor.

613
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:04,830
♬   My love will bring us back  ♬

614
00:59:04,830 --> 00:59:08,920
♬   Ain't nobody holding me back  ♬

615
00:59:08,950 --> 00:59:11,080
♬   We be like Bonnie and Clyde  ♬

616
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:12,460
♬   We ride or die   ♬

617
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:15,530
♬   We tight   ♬

618
00:59:15,530 --> 00:59:18,560
♬   My love will bring us back  ♬

619
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:22,610
♬   Ain't nobody holding me back  ♬

620
00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:24,680
♬   We be like Bonnie and Clyde  ♬

621
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:26,520
♬   We ride or die   ♬

622
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:28,970

623
00:59:28,970 --> 00:59:31,030
 You've never tried to find your father, so why now?

624
00:59:31,030 --> 00:59:34,310
​  ​He's the only person who knows about my mother's past that I don't know about.

625
00:59:34,310 --> 00:59:36,870
 They'll suspect our existence even more and keep investigating.

626
00:59:36,870 --> 00:59:40,490
 You knew that my mom would die on the night of the red moon.

627
00:59:40,490 --> 00:59:41,290
​ Father.​

628
00:59:41,290 --> 00:59:44,370
 I'll be the one to ask you this time. Is time travel possible?

629
00:59:44,370 --> 00:59:45,580
​  ​What year is it now?

630
00:59:45,580 --> 00:59:47,190
​  ​It's 2010. ​

631
00:59:47,190 --> 00:59:49,200
 Hello?

632
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:52,520
 Where are you?

633
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:53,600
 Jin Gyeom.

634
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:57,090
 I'll go home, so you mustn't go outside no matter what.

635
00:59:57,090 --> 01:00:01,740
