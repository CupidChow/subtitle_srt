1
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:35,090
 With Time all things are revealed;

2
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:38,960
 Time is the father of truth. 
 - Francois Rebelais -

3
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:41,570

4
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,840
Professor. Professor!

5
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:05,960

6
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:14,220
Did Professor Yoon time travel?

7
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:17,970
If she doesn't take this right now, it'll be dangerous.

8
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:52,990
The professor will wake up soon. Stay by her side.

9
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:02,550
What's the reason you're helping her?

10
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:10,890
It's the same as yours.

11
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,010
Your mother and I were together in 1992.

12
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:19,000
We tried to leave after completing our mission,

13
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,480
but your mother remained here.

14
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,380
Why?

15
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,660
For you.

16
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:25,930
What does that mean?

17
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:29,040
She found out a bit late that she was pregnant.

18
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:32,270
That's why she stayed behind.

19
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,740
To give birth to you.

20
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:40,020
She gave up everything for you.

21
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:45,260
So, at least for your mom, stop doing dangerous things.

22
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:48,960
What right do you have?

23
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,270
I was her friend.

24
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:59,230
I'm sorry. I didn't know your mother died

25
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,990
or that she had a son.

26
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:07,720
I'm sorry I couldn't protect her.

27
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:13,930
But I'll be sure to catch the culprit.

28
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:15,960
Stop speaking nonsense.

29
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,780
You're also a suspect. You all killed my mother.

30
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:24,040
If I get arrested,

31
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:30,050
all of our staff will come here. That puts the professor in danger.

32
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:24,780
It's my fault. I should've looked into Park Jin Gyeom more.

33
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:28,080
Shi Young knew from the start.

34
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,930
There's no reason that'd be true. She was friends with Tae Yi.

35
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:36,830
Shi Young said she met Tae Yi in 2011.

36
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,020
However, Tae Yi died in 2010, the year before.

37
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:46,000
She's definitely hiding something.

38
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,360
Hyung,

39
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,410
please leave me out of missions for the time being. I need to look into Shi Young a bit more.

40
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:57,610
What will you do if she finds out?

41
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:02,520
Why? Do you think I might take revenge on her or something?

42
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,200
What right do I have to do that?

43
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,380
I abandoned Tae Yi, who was pregnant at the time, in an unfamiliar place.

44
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:13,160
To be honest, if only I wanted to, I could have gone to look for her.

45
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,050
But I didn't.

46
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:18,560
I was upset at Tae Yi at the time.

47
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:24,150
I couldn't forgive Tae Yi, who ran away without a word.

48
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:26,270
Because I was upset at that,

49
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:29,030
I didn't go looking for her.

50
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,960
Would a person like me have any right?

51
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:41,800
She died while raising a baby alone in a strange place.

52
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,020
How could someone like me get revenge?

53
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,890
I'm just going to find the suspect.

54
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:57,490
I just need to figure out who killed Tae Yi

55
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:01,780
and tell Park Jin Gyeom.

56
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:07,570
Stop worrying about Park Jin Gyeom from now on.

57
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:10,960
While I'm here, there's no reason for Park Jin Gyeom to be hurt.

58
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:16,490
If you have anything else you want to ask me for, tell me.

59
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:21,010
If you want to bring him to Alice, I'll look for a way.

60
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,450
But...

61
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:28,030
does Park Jin Gyeom know who you are?

62
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:32,020
Let me find out who killed Tae Yi first.

63
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:38,530
I have to do at least that

64
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,740
before being able to tell him who I am.

65
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:10,940
 How can there be a culprit when Lieutenant Park isn't dead?

66
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:15,980
 Do you know how strong he is? He isn't someone that would die.

67
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,030
It can be changed.

68
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:43,510
I can change it.

69
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,060
When did you come?

70
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:12,940
What about the professor?

71
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:16,090
She just left saying she had to meet someone.

72
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,960
 The person you are trying to call is unavailable.

73
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,640
Did she not say where she was going?

74
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,550
Was it the professor's birthday yesterday?

75
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:34,070
Don't worry about it. It's a coincidence.

76
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:41,410
When Eun Soo first talked about time machines,

77
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:45,100
I thought it was something a kid could do.

78
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:50,690
When she met a little boy who claimed he was 5 years old,

79
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:54,030
I thought there were many crazy people in this world.

80
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:58,120
When the man in the picture from 1992

81
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,960
appeared without having aged at all,

82
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,780
I thought it must be a coincidence.

83
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:10,110
When you knew of SchrÃ¶dinger's case before the incident,

84
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:15,940
I just thought you found evidence beforehand by coincidence.

85
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:23,030
But I really can't understand this. A woman that looks exactly as your mother

86
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,420
even has the same birthday.

87
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:35,150
Don't worry. I'm not asking you.

88
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:38,410
I know you won't tell me anyway.

89
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:40,520
I'll find out myself,

90
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:44,890
what exactly it is that's going on right now.

91
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:56,730
Everyone thinks Director Seok is dead.

92
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:58,510
But it seems you don't.

93
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:02,400
What's the reason you're investigating Director Seok's disappearance?

94
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,830
Will you write an article?

95
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:08,280
Yes. So please cooperate.

96
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:19,760
The thing you said to me a few days ago. What did it mean?

97
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:24,430
About how you and I went to Spain together in a year.

98
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,420
I was just talking nonsense because you were bothering me.

99
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,840
It's called a parallel world, isn't it?

100
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:34,800
A world in another dimension where another version of me exists.

101
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:39,140
Though I don't know how the relationship between you and I may change in a year,

102
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:42,630
I believe there won't be a case where we travel together.

103
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:46,140
But if we did really go on a vacation together,

104
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:49,600
then that must not have been me, but another version of me.

105
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:54,520
You went to the future of another dimension, right?

106
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:58,810
Maybe the you and I that exist in the other dimension went on a pilgrimage together.

107
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:02,990
What's the reason you're suddenly asking me these things?

108
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:04,700
Is it out of your curiosity as a reporter?

109
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:08,630
No. I'm asking this because of Jin Gyeom.

110
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:14,200
Have you ever felt like you've known Jin Gyeom for a long time?

111
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,460
What do you mean?

112
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:18,100
Didn't Jin Gyeom tell you?

113
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,900
That you look like his mother.

114
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,300
What is it that you want to say?

115
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:26,560
Whoever you may be or what kind of person you may be,

116
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,530
I wish you won't stay next to Jin Gyeom.

117
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:36,850
I'm saying this not as a girl who likes him, but as his friend.

118
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:39,530
I'm worried about him.

119
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:44,360
Jin Gyeom has never felt happiness once in his life.

120
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,090
I know. He can't feel emotions.

121
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:50,540
Do you know that because of this fact, he also suffers and blames himself more?

122
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:55,180
Jin Gyeom has changed a lot in the past 10 years.

123
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:57,640
That's why he knows now.

124
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:03,760
How he treated his mother before she passed away.

125
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,180
He's finally realized how much his mother must have suffered because of him.

126
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:13,330
But if you stay with him, he'll keep thinking of his mother again.

127
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:17,260
And for you, he would be willing to put himself in any kind of danger.

128
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:19,870
So, I'm sorry...

129
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:23,660
But I wish you would stay away from Jin Gyeom.

130
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:28,960
Lieutenant Park... has very good friends.

131
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:33,860
I'm not sure whether this is a parallel universe or not,

132
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:37,170
but I think we may actually be able to travel together.

133
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:44,380
I'm also sorry, but I have to stay with Lieutenant Park.

134
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:48,860
Because he needs me now.

135
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:54,390
Though it hurts my heart that he may think of his mother when he's with me,

136
00:13:55,100 --> 00:14:01,830
I... need to do whatever I can do.

137
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:10,910

138
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:19,970
I went to the orphanage to look for Dr. Jang Dong Sik's wife.

139
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:25,050
You already knew Professor Yoon Tae Yi was Dr. Jang's daughter, didn't you?

140
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,450
Yes.

141
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:30,530
Then why didn't you tell me? You should have at least tipped me off.

142
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:35,400
She doesn't know yet either, so I couldn't say anything.

143
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:42,260
Have you found the woman who dropped Professor Yoon off at the orphanage?

144
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:44,370
Was it her mother?

145
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:50,340
No. Dr. Jang's wife, so the Professor Yoon's mother, did indeed pass away.

146
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:52,540
I've even confirmed her grave.

147
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:54,730
In the orphanage documentation, her mother is listed as the person who dropped her off,

148
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:59,510
so it seems like someone stood in her place.

149
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:04,800
 Wasn't this man his only accomplice?

150
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,780
 There was a woman if I remember correctly.

151
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:14,330
Shouldn't we tell Professor Yoon about her father's death?

152
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:18,320
When the time is right, I'll tell her myself.

153
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:27,060
Did you go somewhere?

154
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,280
I met with a friend.

155
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,270
A good friend.

156
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:33,860
What is that?

157
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,320
It's pork belly.

158
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:38,230
On my birthday, we agreed to eat pork belly but didn't get to.

159
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:40,350
And some soju.

160
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:47,400
Why are you eating the burnt ones? Do you know how unhealthy that is?

161
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,300
Here.

162
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:00,170
- I'll eat it myself. 
 - Say ah.

163
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:01,750
It's all right. You should eat it.

164
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,400
Hurry, my arm is about to fall off.

165
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:06,650
Open.

166
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,590
Thank you.

167
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:34,080
Starting tomorrow, I'll cook for you. So eat that before going to work.

168
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,230
Detectives don't get to eat their meals on time.

169
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:38,970
You need to at least eat breakfast.

170
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:40,320
Oh, right.

171
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,970

172
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,600
Take this to the precinct to drink.

173
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,040
It's lactic acid.

174
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,620
It's hard to take care of yourself when you're so busy.

175
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:52,640
You should try it.

176
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,870
I just ordered yours while I ordered mine.

177
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:58,630
Just eat it. It's good for you.

178
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:18,980
Professor Yoon, did something happen?

179
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,730
No.

180
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:26,880
Lieutenant Park, do you have something like a bucket list?

181
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,860
For before you die...

182
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:34,280
I mean, things you want to do before you get older.

183
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:38,470
I've never particularly thought about it.

184
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:40,040
Why the sudden question?

185
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,640
I was just curious.

186
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:47,050
Everyone has things they've always wanted to try.

187
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,170
I don't.

188
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:54,920
Then I'll give you some options that others have put in their bucket list. Let me know what interests you.

189
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,890

190
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:59,260
Traveling the world alone.

191
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:01,540
Master a foreign language.

192
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,730
Love passionately.

193
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:05,530
Travel all around Korea.

194
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:08,220
Read 100 books in a year.

195
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,470
Do you want to do any of them?

196
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:13,370
Read 100 books in a year.

197
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:14,660
Except for that one.

198
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,980
Master a foreign language.

199
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:20,590
Forget it. Just eat.

200
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:25,200
To be honest, there are lots of things I haven't tried.

201
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,090
It's hard for me to pick just one.

202
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:34,380
But... do you not like your necklace?

203
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:40,170
Oh, not at all. I'm saving it to wear on a special day.

204
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,750
Have you been to an amusement park?

205
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:50,430
I'm not asking because I want to go.

206
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:59,210
â«  What is love?  â«

207
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:05,210
â«  Every day, I felt love only in the movies  â«

208
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:08,250
â«  Or in books or dramas  â«

209
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:12,950
â«  Mmm, Iâm so curious, Iâm going crazy  â«

210
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:15,130
â«  Ooh, some day  â«

211
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:18,390
â«  Will these things happen to me, too?  â«

212
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:21,270
You know how to smile. You should smile a bit.

213
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:23,150
Isn't it fun? Aren't you happy?

214
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:24,820
Want to go again?

215
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:28,210
No. I will never ride this again.

216
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:31,890
â«  I wanna know know know know, what is love?  â«

217
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:36,440
â«  What does love feel like?  â«

218
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,680
Goodness...

219
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:50,760
Thank you.

220
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:55,510
Excuse me. Could you please take a picture of us?

221
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:57,100
Sure.

222
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:02,230
I'll take it now.

223
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,730
- Thank you! 
 - Thank you!

224
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,620
Shall we take a picture as well?

225
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:16,010
Lieutenant, do you take pictures?

226
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:18,730
I want to keep it as a souvenir.

227
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:21,250
Sure. Let's take one.

228
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,540
I'll take it.

229
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,890
Let me take a look at it first.

230
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:49,690
If it looks weird, I'm going to delete it.

231
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:05,640
What's wrong?

232
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:10,060
The picture... came out so strange.

233
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,830
Do you want to take another one?

234
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:13,590
No.

235
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,230
From now on...

236
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:19,220
let's not take any pictures.

237
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,790

238
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:23,060

239
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:26,800
Let's go.

240
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:31,040
Something happened, right?

241
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,190
Please, tell me.

242
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:36,010
What did you see when you traveled through time?

243
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:43,360
Do you have to catch the person who killed your mother?

244
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:47,970
I know I shouldn't say this,

245
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:51,360
but can't you just give up?

246
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:57,000
Others say they forgive and forget things as time pass.

247
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,330
Can't you do that?

248
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:03,280
You can, right?

249
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:07,790
Will something happen to me?

250
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:15,280
You must be tired. Let's go home.

251
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:19,710
While trying to find the person who killed your mother,

252
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,610
you'll die.

253
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:41,830
Do you know who the culprit that killed my mother is?

254
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:43,850
Is that even important?

255
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:46,030
You're going to die!

256
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:49,730
You asked me about my bucket list, right?

257
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:54,690
I've always wanted only one thing.

258
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:00,070
To find the culprit that killed my mother.

259
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:04,750
Please, tell me who it is.

260
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:09,850
 Lieutenant Park went to find the last page of "The Book of Prophecy."

261
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:15,200
 If he finds that, he will find out how to stop time travel and who killed his mother.

262
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,790
 However, it is because of that, he was killed.

263
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:23,420
 By the very culprit who killed his mother.

264
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:29,760
Lieutenant, let's go together!

265
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,150
You can go home.

266
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:32,690
Lieutenant!

267
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:36,780
Lieutenant! Hey, Park Jin Gyeom!

268
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:41,390
Look at your surroundings. Can't you see the people who like you?

269
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:45,760
Why do you not care about the people who worry about you?

270
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:52,690
Hey, Park Jin Gyeom!

271
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:02,120
 "The Book of Prophecy?"

272
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,240
I'm not sure what that is.

273
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,430
But if I find that,

274
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:09,510
I think I'll know who it is I'm looking for.

275
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:12,460
First, let's search for Director Seok Oh Wan.

276
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:14,730
He says he had "The Book of Prophecy."

277
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:17,040
I'm sure he's already dead.

278
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,660
Otherwise, how could he disappear into thin air?

279
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:23,710
If Professor Yoon is right, he's still alive.

280
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:27,580

281
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:32,620
Someone sent that text on the morning of Tae Yi's death in 2010.

282
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:34,920
It's one of our phone numbers, isn't it?

283
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:38,270
Who is the staff member that used this number in 2010?

284
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:40,600
You know!

285
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,830
Team Leader Oh.

286
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:49,980
As you said, it's one of our phone numbers. This isn't evidence that she killed Tae Yi.

287
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:52,070
I know.

288
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:58,100
Oh Shi Young went to find Lee Se Hoon in 2011. That's all I wanted to confirm.

289
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:12,590

290
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:47,400

291
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:47,530
Hello?

292
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:50,670
 It's Lee Se Hoon. Remember me?

293
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:53,430
Why your mother died

294
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:55,650
and who killed her?

295
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:59,630
 If you protect me, I'll tell you.

296
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:01,810
I even know who killed her.

297
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:03,880
 Where are you right now?

298
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:09,970
Hello?

299
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,290
 Yes, I've found it.

300
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:23,380
 It's the number of an inn.

301
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:35,930

302
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:06,240
Lee Se Hoon has been murdered.

303
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,970
Hurry up and check the surrounding CCTV's.

304
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,220
What are you trying to hide by killing him?

305
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:25,140
It's a misunderstanding.

306
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:27,420
I'll explain later.

307
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,370
It's you.

308
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:39,190
You're the culprit.

309
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:45,720
I'm not. I'm looking for the person who killed your mother.

310
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,900
Your mother and Iâ

311
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,230
Why did you kill my mom?

312
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:40,220
Check the CCTV's near the area.

313
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:42,290
He was murdered before I arrived.

314
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:46,360
I've searched the CCTV's near the inn, but all the footage has been deleted.

315
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,550
Where's Oh Shi Young right now?

316
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:55,160
 There are 15 clients who are under inspections.

317
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,920
 We'll wrap up the process within a week.

318
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:01,900
Everyone, out.

319
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:05,860
Now!

320
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,980
Lee Se Hoon...

321
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,750
Did you kill him?

322
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:17,330
What the hell are you saying?

323
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:20,010
"It's something you've brought upon yourself."

324
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:24,360
On the day that Tae Yi died in 2010,

325
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:27,990
you texted her.

326
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:30,960
Tell me. What happened that day?

327
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,980
Are you suspecting that I killed Tae Yi?

328
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:34,250
Then why did you lie?

329
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:37,390
Why did you?

330
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:50,620
After visiting Lee Se Hoon, I found out Tae Yi had "The Book of Prophecy."

331
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:55,240
 I wanted to resolve it as quietly as possible, so I went to meet her.

332
00:30:55,970 --> 00:30:57,970
 But Tae Yi...

333
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,100
 wouldn't budge until the end.

334
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:05,730
 You're right. I sent that text.

335
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:10,090
I thought Yoon Tae Yi needed to know

336
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:14,660
what she was doing was dangerous and selfish.

337
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:17,350
So...

338
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,700
So, you killed her?

339
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:24,760
No. I didn't do it.

340
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,530
However, I did wish she would die.

341
00:31:26,530 --> 00:31:29,460
How? Why?

342
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,540
Because of you.

343
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:38,280
About Tae Yi's death

344
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:42,810
and how Yoon Tae Yi of the past was in danger... I meant to tell you, but

345
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,070
I couldn't.

346
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:49,600
No, I didn't.

347
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,480
Because I knew you'd be shaken like this.

348
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,930
You'd try to catch the culprit at whatever the cost.

349
00:31:55,930 --> 00:31:57,220
Stop making excuses.

350
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:59,770
Do you know what the worst part of all this is?

351
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:03,630
That tiresome Yoon Tae Yi has finally disappeared,

352
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:07,390
but another Yoon Tae Yi is back.

353
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:11,390
Right when I thought that I was getting closer to you,

354
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:15,010
you're only looking at Yoon Tae Yi yet again!

355
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:33,060
It's a video I've had since Lee Se Hoon was released from prison.

356
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:36,750
You can choose whether you want to believe me or not.

357
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:57,680
Did you really see the suspect here?

358
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,160
Yes.

359
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,720
I saw him with my own eyes.

360
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,840
That's weird.

361
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:07,690
- What is? 
 - His time of death was 2 hours ago.

362
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:09,880
If he was really the suspect,

363
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:14,250
why did he stay here for 2 hours after killing Lee Se Hoon?

364
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:18,020
 It's you.

365
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:20,960
 I was looking for the person who killed your mother.

366
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,640
I think you'll need to check outside.

367
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:28,610
Hey, check this.

368
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,810
What is it?

369
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:32,450
Nothing.

370
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:37,530
I'm just thinking of when we first met.

371
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:42,480
You were so handsome. You had a lot of hair.

372
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:48,490
On the day of our blind date, do you remember going to Namsan?

373
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:53,500
I can't even remember what I did yesterday.

374
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,920
How can I remember what happened so long ago?

375
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:02,000
There you go again. Stop scratching your ear while eating!

376
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,500
Okay.

377
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:10,070
You know my friend Soo Jin, right?

378
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:12,280
Yes. Her husband runs a big company.

379
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,730
Her husband has cancer.

380
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:16,440
Stage 3.

381
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:19,960
I heard that

382
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:23,220
and realized that happiness is not that grand.

383
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:26,140
Eating the blood sausages that I like with you

384
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:30,040
and living a long life, that's the best.

385
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:35,800
A long life?

386
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,400
My wife...

387
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,700
Your dreams are so aspirational.

388
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:44,860
So, you have to stay healthy.

389
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:47,520

390
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:51,940
Why are you asking for that?

391
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:54,500
When I first came here,

392
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:57,030
- did I bring anything with me? 
  - Like what?

393
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:58,940
A book or...

394
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:00,100
even a slip of paper?

395
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:03,910
You did read a lot of books, but you didn't bring anything with you.

396
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:04,910
Nor any slips of paper.

397
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:06,460
Last time,

398
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:08,800
you know the person who asked about my father?

399
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,540
You said they asked if I brought a book.

400
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:15,070
Yes, even that suspicious man asked about a book.

401
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:17,290
Did you not ask him what book it was?

402
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:19,630
Is something wrong?

403
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:23,640
A detective with a large build came by this morning.

404
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:26,020
A detective with a large build?

405
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,080
This person?

406
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,320
Yes. That's him.

407
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,980
Then don't worry about him.

408
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:42,740
The person who asked about my dad last time. He probably came to ask about that.

409
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:44,770
It's him.

410
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:48,090
The man who came earlier to ask about your father.

411
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:51,530
 Does Ms. Yoon Tae Yi

412
00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:55,640
 remember her father who passed away in 1992?

413
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:58,850
You must have been mistaken.

414
00:36:58,850 --> 00:37:02,060
This person is a detective's captain.

415
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:03,930
Really?

416
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:06,100
Maybe it wasn't him.

417
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:08,690
Anyways, that is confusing.

418
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:21,220
I really don't accept envelopes that aren't full of money. Take it back.

419
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:23,450
It's because I'm tired of this life.

420
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:27,610
No. Being a cop is your path. Also, people like us

421
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:29,200
can't stay quietly at home.

422
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,540
I can't even resign when I want?

423
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:34,280
I won't be coming in starting next month.

424
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,190
You should accept it.

425
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:40,150
Why are you being like this? Is something wrong?

426
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:42,220
Nothing's wrong. I just...

427
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,580
want to sleep peacefully,

428
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:47,590
eat well,

429
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,970
and be loved by my wife.

430
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:54,380
I want to live like that.

431
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,120
Hello.

432
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:06,380
You know me, right?

433
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:08,900
Can we speak for a moment?

434
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:17,270
Thank you.

435
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:23,360
I'm on duty, so if you have something to ask, please say it quickly.

436
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:26,480
How did you get close to Lieutenant Park?

437
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,760
Why do you want to know that?

438
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:31,100
He said you were like family to him.

439
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,910
Did Jin Gyeom not tell you?

440
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:36,310
Lieutenant Park doesn't talk about such things.

441
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:39,200
I heard you lived under the same roof?

442
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:44,280
I'm curious how you and someone like Lieutenant Park came to live together.

443
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:47,590
When Jin Gyeom was in high school,

444
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:51,620
he was wrongly accused because of me.

445
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:54,020
I felt sorry about that.

446
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:56,470
- That's really weird. 
 - What is?

447
00:38:56,470 --> 00:39:00,340
That isn't enough reason to suddenly take after

448
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:04,420
a strange 19-year-old boy under one's own house.

449
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,080
Please don't misunderstand.

450
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,790
I was also adopted,

451
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:14,040
so I'm very interested in non-blood related families.

452
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:17,870
I heard you don't have any children. Is that right?

453
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:22,130
Why did you not adopt?

454
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:24,850
Is adoption for everyone?

455
00:39:24,850 --> 00:39:28,720
Then, why did you go to Hope Orphanage?

456
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:33,120
You've been there.

457
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:36,960
I've never done that.

458
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,920
I think you're done with what you need to say. I'll be leaving.

459
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:43,560
- I'm sorry. 
 - I'm sorry.

460
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:59,120
I've definitely seen it before.

461
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:01,260
What are you talking about?

462
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:04,380
The scar behind Captain Ko's ear.

463
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:08,330
I've definitely seen it before.

464
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:12,620
I'm not sure what scar you're saying you've seen where.

465
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:16,260
I'm certain I've seen it before,

466
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:18,140
but I can't remember.

467
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:23,530
Do you remember the person who came to Hope Orphanage to ask about me?

468
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:25,820
I think that man...

469
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:27,810
was Captain Ko.

470
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:31,760
There's no reason that'd be the case.

471
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,470
Even if that were true,

472
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:35,560
it would be for the investigation.

473
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,400
No, it wasn't for the investigation.

474
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:40,110
He was looking for my father.

475
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:46,020
For now, I think it's best for you to return home and rest.

476
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:48,110
I'll escort you home.

477
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:51,670
No, there's no need. I'll sleep at home today.

478
00:41:13,330 --> 00:41:15,790
We found a capsule in his stomach.

479
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:20,300
It looks like a poisonous substance, but I don't know what it is.

480
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:35,940
Ah, this thing is strange. Do you remember the corpse that disappeared before?

481
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:38,680
Was the name Joo Hae Min?

482
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,590
The killer of the SchrÃ¶dinger's case.

483
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:42,020
Yes.

484
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:44,830
He also had the same scar.

485
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:52,690

486
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:55,990

487
00:41:57,080 --> 00:42:02,980
All the CCTV footage was deleted. I got the black box footage of all the cars parked in the area.

488
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:06,830
I think you'll have to pull an all-nighter to check all of this.

489
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:12,550
I'll do it.

490
00:42:20,310 --> 00:42:22,840

491
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:08,330
 Continue.

492
00:43:08,330 --> 00:43:14,260
He came to visit Lee Se Hoon in 2010 and I found evidence of illegal travel between dimensions.

493
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:16,340
In 2010?

494
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:18,030
Yes.

495
00:43:18,030 --> 00:43:21,740
On top of that, it's suspicious that he's the lead investigator of Tae Yi's case.

496
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:25,770
Then, are you saying he approached Park Jin Gyeom intentionally?

497
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:29,730
I think so, but I don't know why.

498
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:35,660
This case... I don't think it's something for us to resolve alone.

499
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:37,490
We must report to headquarters.

500
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:41,400
Hyung, give me a bit more time.

501
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:47,380
Things will get complicated once headquarters finds out about it. I'll figure it out.

502
00:43:48,770 --> 00:43:50,670
I can't give you too much time.

503
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:52,430
Thanks.

504
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:07,230
It's hot.

505
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:14,350
It tastes good.

506
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:24,030
What brings you here at this hour?

507
00:44:24,030 --> 00:44:27,720
Thank you for taking care of my mother's memorial.

508
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:30,330
You didn't need to bring anything like this.

509
00:44:30,330 --> 00:44:33,830
That's something I should take care of.

510
00:44:33,830 --> 00:44:37,000
I'm actually kind of offended.

511
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,830
This is so big.

512
00:44:38,830 --> 00:44:41,150
I know you like it.

513
00:44:41,150 --> 00:44:46,180
Hey! If you were going to bring something, you should've brought some Korean beef.

514
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:49,100
You need to feed our Jin Gyeom some nutritious foods.

515
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:51,290
Can't you see how haggard he looks?

516
00:44:51,290 --> 00:44:55,020
Tell me... If this man works you too hard.

517
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:56,940
Eat dinner before you leave.

518
00:44:56,940 --> 00:44:59,140
Oh, how heavy this is!

519
00:45:01,090 --> 00:45:05,570
You must've been so unconcerned before, judging from how happy she is.

520
00:45:05,570 --> 00:45:07,840
Come in. Eat before you leave.

521
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:10,680
I have something to tell you outside.

522
00:45:18,830 --> 00:45:22,230

523
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:24,430
Wow, this feels so nice.

524
00:45:31,210 --> 00:45:33,120
What are you looking at?

525
00:45:34,370 --> 00:45:35,850
I just think it's cool.

526
00:45:35,850 --> 00:45:40,210
What's so cool about this? All bathhouses are the same.

527
00:45:40,210 --> 00:45:42,350
I've never been to one before.

528
00:45:44,750 --> 00:45:47,110
Do you not like to wash up?

529
00:45:50,850 --> 00:45:56,230
Well, there wasn't much reason for me to come, or anyone to come with.

530
00:45:57,570 --> 00:46:01,800
You filthy bastard. From now on,

531
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,530
you're coming here with me weekly.

532
00:46:03,530 --> 00:46:04,890
I'll just do it alone.

533
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:08,160
It's because I want to do it for you.

534
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,430
Jin Gyeom,

535
00:46:10,430 --> 00:46:14,350
living as a lieutenant won't be easy.

536
00:46:14,350 --> 00:46:18,620
When things get hard, you can tell me.

537
00:46:19,370 --> 00:46:20,670
Don't worry too much.

538
00:46:20,670 --> 00:46:24,300
How can I not worry about you?

539
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:29,940
I heard children don't tell their parents how they really feel.

540
00:46:31,670 --> 00:46:35,240
Sure. What is there to life?

541
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:40,930
You just need to live with those who you can show your bare back to.

542
00:46:40,930 --> 00:46:43,310
You showed me your bare back, okay?

543
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:48,550
 Dad!

544
00:46:54,430 --> 00:46:56,210
Why?

545
00:47:00,950 --> 00:47:03,080
Call me "Dad."

546
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:08,230
Come on.

547
00:47:08,230 --> 00:47:10,400
It hurts! 
  (T/N: Sounds similar to "Dad" in Korean)

548
00:47:11,130 --> 00:47:12,850
What did you say?

549
00:47:14,710 --> 00:47:16,750
I said it hurts.

550
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,250
Say it.

551
00:47:33,740 --> 00:47:36,050
Can you give me a glass?

552
00:47:36,050 --> 00:47:37,910
You don't drink.

553
00:47:37,910 --> 00:47:41,790
These days, I drink sometimes.

554
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:47,620
With Do Yeon?

555
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:50,280
Sure, then.

556
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:51,890
Life is all about drinking once in a while.

557
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:06,370
Now I'm a bit relieved.

558
00:48:06,370 --> 00:48:08,190
I think you're getting better bit by bit.

559
00:48:08,190 --> 00:48:12,600
When I first met you, you didn't even seem human.

560
00:48:45,570 --> 00:48:48,060
Did you come about Lee Se Hoon's case?

561
00:48:53,090 --> 00:48:55,070
Did you find something?

562
00:48:56,250 --> 00:49:01,000
Jin Gyeom, I...

563
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:03,740
No.

564
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:08,390
I haven't found anything.

565
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:17,610
I really must have gotten a lot better. It's all thanks to you.

566
00:49:17,610 --> 00:49:23,090
So just like right now, for a long time,

567
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:28,010
please stay by my side.

568
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:36,840
What are you doing on the weekend?

569
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:37,700
Why?

570
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:40,900
You know In Sook's son, right? Tall and handsome.

571
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:44,660
Huh? How is he handsome?

572
00:49:44,660 --> 00:49:46,730
But what about him? Is he sick?

573
00:49:46,730 --> 00:49:49,690
He was promoted.

574
00:49:49,690 --> 00:49:53,380
So what? Do you want me to congratulate him?

575
00:49:54,470 --> 00:49:56,510
Are you doing this on purpose?

576
00:49:56,510 --> 00:49:59,040
Instead of complaining, free up some time this weekend. Okay?

577
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:00,400
I can't. I'm busy.

578
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:04,070
I'm worried you'll grow old and die single!

579
00:50:04,070 --> 00:50:06,610
That isn't the case. I have Jin Gyeom.

580
00:50:06,610 --> 00:50:09,870
Why can't you look for someone normal, not like Jin Gyeom?

581
00:50:09,870 --> 00:50:11,960
What's wrong with Jin Gyeom?

582
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:13,180
He's so nice.

583
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:16,040
He doesn't even like girls, so I don't have to worry about him cheating.

584
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:18,340
I'm worried about you.

585
00:50:19,070 --> 00:50:22,060

586
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,560
Mr. Ko!

587
00:50:31,310 --> 00:50:32,410
You called for a taxi, right?

588
00:50:32,410 --> 00:50:34,530
Wow, it must be son and father.

589
00:50:34,530 --> 00:50:38,130
You two are drinking together. How harmonious.

590
00:50:38,130 --> 00:50:41,350
I called her. We drank.

591
00:50:41,350 --> 00:50:43,490
But stop making those jokes.

592
00:50:43,490 --> 00:50:45,710
I don't know how to react.

593
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:48,360
What the heck? So boring.

594
00:50:49,310 --> 00:50:52,910
What's the occasion? Did you drink today?

595
00:50:52,910 --> 00:50:54,370
Nothing's wrong.

596
00:50:54,370 --> 00:50:56,190
Give me the keys.

597
00:50:57,160 --> 00:51:00,000
Mr. Ko, you should get in. I'll drive you home.

598
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,970
Don't worry about it. It's right there.

599
00:51:02,970 --> 00:51:06,070
Drive safe.

600
00:51:06,070 --> 00:51:08,370
Okay!

601
00:51:08,370 --> 00:51:11,370
- I'll head in. 
 - We'll be going!

602
00:51:37,030 --> 00:51:41,690
But... why did you drink with Mr. Ko?

603
00:51:41,690 --> 00:51:44,400
Did something happen?

604
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:48,050
Just because... I wanted to.

605
00:51:48,050 --> 00:51:51,820
You did well. He must've liked it.

606
00:52:20,130 --> 00:52:22,180
Yes, Teacher?

607
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:27,720
I understand.

608
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:38,210
What are you doing here?

609
00:52:38,210 --> 00:52:40,830
I'm looking for Yoon Tae Yi.

610
00:52:40,830 --> 00:52:42,910
Yoon Tae Yi has been here, hasn't she?

611
00:52:42,910 --> 00:52:45,200
Why are you looking for that woman?

612
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:47,090
I have to kill her.

613
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:15,430
Did you drink a lot?

614
00:53:17,430 --> 00:53:18,600
No.

615
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:22,460
Then since you've already had some, do you want to drink some more with me?

616
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:25,020
Okay.

617
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:26,790
Really?

618
00:53:28,210 --> 00:53:30,020
Yes.

619
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:33,350
Where should we go?

620
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:37,870
Yes, Detective Kim?

621
00:53:37,870 --> 00:53:40,220
I think I've figured out where Director Seok is.

622
00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:43,580
I understand. I'll be right there.

623
00:53:47,670 --> 00:53:48,870
 The next story.

624
00:53:48,870 --> 00:53:52,690
 Lee Se Hoon, who was recently released from prison after being accused of murder 19 years ago,

625
00:53:52,690 --> 00:53:56,600
 was found dead in a inn after his release.

626
00:53:56,600 --> 00:54:02,810
 When the police arrived on sight, Mr. Lee was found dead in a pool of his own blood.

627
00:54:02,810 --> 00:54:06,310
 The police suspect poisoning to be the cause of death.

628
00:54:06,310 --> 00:54:08,590
 This was Reporter Kang Hyun Jin.

629
00:54:27,170 --> 00:54:31,410

630
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:44,150
 That was him.

631
00:54:44,150 --> 00:54:47,750
 He's the person who asked about your father last time.

632
00:54:58,110 --> 00:54:59,960
How did you find him?

633
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:04,460
I got a report that a rental car was parked in an amusement park that isn't under operation.

634
00:55:04,460 --> 00:55:07,030
The person who rented it is apparently Joo Hae Min.

635
00:55:07,030 --> 00:55:11,450
But Joo Hae Min says he has never rented a car.

636
00:55:12,230 --> 00:55:16,000
I think... a dead time traveler must have rented it.

637
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:20,270
Inside that car, Seok Oh Wan's DNA was found.

638
00:55:20,270 --> 00:55:22,410
Who's on-site right now?

639
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:35,870

640
00:55:45,490 --> 00:55:47,970
 The person you dialed is unavailable.

641
00:55:47,970 --> 00:55:50,620

642
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:05,290
Yes.

643
00:56:05,290 --> 00:56:07,760
I've arrived, Teacher.

644
00:56:09,650 --> 00:56:13,670
I'll take care of Director Seok Oh Wan.

645
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:39,230
Hello.

646
00:56:39,230 --> 00:56:40,270
Is this the car?

647
00:56:40,270 --> 00:56:44,050
According to residents in the area, the car has been here for about a week.

648
00:56:44,050 --> 00:56:48,140
It's been a while since this amusement park has been open, so not many people come here.

649
00:56:48,140 --> 00:56:51,160
Seok Oh Wan must be in the area, if we inspect it.

650
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:52,510
Let's divide and search.

651
00:56:52,510 --> 00:56:54,920
- Let's go. 
 - Okay.

652
00:57:18,820 --> 00:57:21,950
Since this area is large, we should split up.

653
00:57:21,950 --> 00:57:26,450
I'll take this side, so please take that side.

654
00:57:26,450 --> 00:57:28,450
Yes, I understand.

655
00:59:03,030 --> 00:59:10,010

656
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:14,430
â«  Let me hear your dreams  â«

657
00:59:15,810 --> 00:59:20,650
â«  Dream again. That song I hear.  â«

658
00:59:20,650 --> 00:59:25,570
â«  Someone is around   â«

659
00:59:25,570 --> 00:59:31,160
â«  It's becoming clear, that warm breath  â«

660
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:32,300
â«  Yeah!  â«

661
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:36,850
â«  When nobody bothers to look at me, a smile light shines on me  â«

662
00:59:36,850 --> 00:59:38,500

663
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:40,520
 I'm sorry, Jin Gyeom.

664
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:43,580
 This is the only way to save my wife.

665
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:47,160
 Mr. Ko.

666
00:59:48,230 --> 00:59:49,950
 No...

667
00:59:49,950 --> 00:59:51,790
â«  Yeah!  â«
