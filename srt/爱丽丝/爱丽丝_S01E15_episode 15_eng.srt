1
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:35,250
 "Time past is time lost.

2
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,050
 It is a time of laziness and helplessness.

3
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:43,250
 No matter how many times you swear, you cannot keep  it."
 - Jean-Paul Sartre -

4
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:45,350

5
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:50,950

6
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:54,090
Lieutenant.

7
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:58,250
Did no one stop by?

8
00:00:58,250 --> 00:00:59,850
I know...

9
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:03,350
Who killed your mother,

10
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:05,850
I know who the killer is.

11
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:11,250
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you first while cross-checking.

12
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:15,150
But I had to confirm it.

13
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,450
Confirm what?

14
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,050

15
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:29,050

16
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:32,850
Don't misunderstand. I'm not suspecting you.

17
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:37,550
The you from the other dimension may be the suspect.

18
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,250
Who else knows this?

19
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,850
No one.

20
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:46,450
I didn't reveal your identity to the lab assistant either.

21
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:11,250
Lieutenant.

22
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,250
I told you...

23
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:16,950
that it's your turn this time.

24
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,150
What are you doing?

25
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,050
Lieutenant!

26
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:48,050
Park Jin Gyeom!

27
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:57,250
 Jin Gyeom...

28
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,550
Mom.

29
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:49,260
I'll go after him.

30
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:22,850
The person I've been trying to catch

31
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:28,050
for the past 10 years was you.

32
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,450
How could you do that?

33
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:41,250
She was a mom who lived

34
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:44,550
for you and you only.

35
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:48,750
How could you kill Mom?

36
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:15,850
What are you doing?

37
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,950
I...

38
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:22,050
I didn't do it.

39
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:27,050
It's not me. I'm certain it wasn't me.

40
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:30,550
I know it wasn't you.

41
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,450
Did I try to kill you?

42
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:37,650
It's a side-effect of time travel.

43
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:40,450
It isn't because of you.

44
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:42,850
The lieutenant I know

45
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:48,050
is someone who became a police officer for this mother,

46
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:53,150
and believed Team Leader Go, his father figure, until the very end.

47
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:56,650
To protect me,

48
00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:00,250
he wouldn't avoid even dangerous situations.

49
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:23,750
The lieutenant I know would never kill his own mother.

50
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:12,450
Who the hell are you?

51
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:38,850
Someone is lurking around you.

52
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:43,450
I think he's influencing you. I can help.

53
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:47,450
I'm grateful for yesterday, but you can stop now.

54
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,650
He's not after you.

55
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:55,050
The person who killed your mother is trying to kill the professor

56
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:57,150
using you.

57
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:01,450
If you keep things as is, both you and Professor Yoon will be at risk.

58
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:04,750
The only person that can help you right now is me.

59
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:25,250
I'll continue checking in on you.

60
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:27,050
There's no reason for you to worry.

61
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:31,450
However, please do not meet Park Jin Gyeom for the time being.

62
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:36,850
It's not that I don't trust him, but because he hasn't recovered mentally.

63
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:39,450
That's why I need to stay with him.

64
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:43,850
I... trust him.

65
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:46,880
I understand.

66
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:52,120
It won't be easy for Lieutenant Park to forgive you.

67
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,250
I'm aware.

68
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:00,850
But...

69
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:04,450
he'll come to understand you someday.

70
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:07,850
Thank you.

71
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:18,850
I tried looking for the person you asked for, but he hasn't left a trace.

72
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:23,150
I think it's certain he's a time traveler, but he's not one of us.

73
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:30,050
 To be honest, I know who killed Tae Yi.

74
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:31,650
 Shi Young!

75
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,450
 It's Director Ki.

76
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:41,350
 Be careful of him.

77
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:47,050
Check Director Ki's movements.

78
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:49,250
The director?

79
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:52,450
Find out where he's been and who he's met recently.

80
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:54,250
I understand.

81
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:01,050
Director Ki.

82
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:17,550
Where were you yesterday?

83
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,250
Is something wrong?

84
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:25,450
It's nothing for you to worry about.

85
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:28,350
I'm just worried, as a brother.

86
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:36,820
Someone keeps doing weird things to Park Jin Gyeom and Yoon Tae Yi.

87
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:40,600
That's why I'm looking for him.

88
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:49,050
I'm going to find him,

89
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:51,250
and kill him so he'll stop bothering them.

90
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,450
Whoever that may be.

91
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,190
Lieutenant Park, take a look at this.

92
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:09,450
Seok Oh Won's fingerprints were found here.

93
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:13,450
Time travel Seok Oh Won must have stayed in hiding here.

94
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:16,350
There are a few unidentifiable fingerprints

95
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:19,450
as well as yours.

96
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:23,850
Wouldn't those be the fingerprints left from when I stopped by yesterday?

97
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:28,250
That's what I thought at first, but something seems off.

98
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:32,050
There were too many, as if you had stayed here for a while.

99
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:35,850
For now, I told the forensics team it was because you were here for an investigation,

100
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:37,850
but what's going on?

101
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:54,050
He...

102
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:57,250
was here.

103
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,950
Who?

104
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:05,950

105
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:17,860
 The surprising creation she made?

106
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,290

107
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:31,190
No matter how much I think about it, the word "creation" seems strange.

108
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:35,570
The word creation means that you're making something that didn't exist before.

109
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:38,490
I don't think it's referring to any scientific technology.

110
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:41,490
On top of that, it could also have religious connotations,

111
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:45,450
such as the creation of a god.

112
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,720
You must be really worried about Lieutenant Park.

113
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,380
I can't just do nothing.

114
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:55,400
I also don't know yet what creation this is referring to.

115
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,400
But I'm going to find out.

116
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,450
How?

117
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:04,530
If it's something his mother created, it might be something I can find.

118
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:05,890
You?

119
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:10,650
I can't leave Lieutenant Park in danger, either.

120
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:14,450
What's wrong?

121
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:17,320
It's nothing.

122
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:24,290
I'm curious... as to what you think of Jin Gyeom.

123
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:29,560
I must have asked something useless. Forget it.

124
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:34,390
I'm not sure myself.

125
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:38,160
I'm not sure how I think of him,

126
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,010
or how I'm supposed to think of him.

127
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:55,230
How do you feel? Are you okay?

128
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:59,430
Instead of asking stupid questions, just tell me what you found out.

129
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:02,080
It's going to take some more time because this is a secret investigation.

130
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:05,410
I'm certain he doesn't have anything to do with Alice.

131
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:09,180
Then... what about Seok Oh Won?

132
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:13,200
Seok Oh Won was at the villa.

133
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,670
There's no reason I wouldn't know anyone on our staff.

134
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:20,510
I'm sure he said "us."

135
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:23,930
It also seemed like he knew a lot about my mother.

136
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,290
 To be honest, I didn't understand myself.

137
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:31,110
 Why your mother abandoned us

138
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:34,990
 and tried to destroy the time travel that she created.

139
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:40,070
Okay, I'll look into it.

140
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:46,200
Do you have anything more to say?

141
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:50,180
If not, leave.

142
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:30,300
Yoo Min Hyeok has started to move.

143
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:35,460
Is that so?

144
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:36,910
I'm sorry.

145
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:40,190
I should've taken care of Yoo Min Hyeok while I was taking care of Oh Shi Young.

146
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:42,850
I didn't anticipate this.

147
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:55,760
That's all right.

148
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:00,910
He must be trying to fulfill his role as a father now, and it's not like I can't understand that.

149
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:06,940
What happened to... Park Jin Gyeom?

150
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:10,660
They're currently investigating the villa where you stayed.

151
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:15,340
I'm curious how much Park Jin Gyeom will find out.

152
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:02,780
What are you doing?

153
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:07,020
You scared me. When did you get here?

154
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,120
What were you doing?

155
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,390
I saw the last page of "The Book of Prophecy."

156
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:13,680
I'm trying to look for what the creation may be.

157
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:17,600
I even went to Mister's house, but your mother's belongings aren't anywhere else, are they?

158
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:22,370
It's pointless. I remember all of my mother's belongings.

159
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:24,730
But just in case.

160
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:27,690
Professor Yoon said she had to find it.

161
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:34,340

162
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:37,000
What is it?

163
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:43,920
Why is this in here?

164
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:47,450
I wonder... why that's there.

165
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:51,710
Why are the gloves that I gave you for Christmas stashed away in your storage?

166
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,030
My mother... must have put them there.

167
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:56,910
I gave these to you last year.

168
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:07,590
I don't want any.

169
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:12,380
I think I'll bother you if I get drunk. I'm already so miserable as it is.

170
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:34,100
Are you going to drink?

171
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,620
Why? I've told you thousands of times in the last 10 years that I didn't want to drink alone.

172
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:45,710
Why are you drinking today?

173
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:48,320
You have something you're hiding from me, huh?

174
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:52,140
What is it? Tell me.

175
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:59,840
I've never thought of your actions as bothersome,

176
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:03,310
so just drink comfortably.

177
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:15,760
Jin Gyeom, let me bother you just one more time.

178
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,390
Can't you stop now?

179
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:21,820
Stop what?

180
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:23,700
They are not people

181
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:26,940
you can fight, or win against.

182
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:31,240
Can't we just run away?

183
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,450
Wouldn't it be okay if we just ran away to a place they can't find us?

184
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:37,400
We can run away and live normally.

185
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,530
You can live like before, unfazed by the world.

186
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:43,900
And I'll just bother an unbothered you.

187
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:46,440
Normally, like in the past.

188
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:50,170
It's too late

189
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:54,660
to do that now.

190
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:59,230
I like you.

191
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:06,350
From high school until now,

192
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:09,550
I've liked you every single day.

193
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:12,860
I'm not asking you to like me back.

194
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:18,790
I just... want to keep liking you.

195
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:22,190
That's all I need.

196
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:28,160
It's not too much to ask for.

197
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:31,710
Sorry.

198
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:36,050
I guess I can't promise.

199
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:01,840

200
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,840
You're here? Have you eaten lunch?

201
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,620
Not yet.

202
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:11,270
- What about Dad and Tae Yoon? 
 - They went to the market.

203
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:16,460
What's wrong? Is something going on?

204
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:20,550
No, it's nothing.

205
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:23,860
My daughter, you've become thin.

206
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:25,530
You need to eat some supplementary vitamins.

207
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:28,230

208
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:31,260
Enjoy.

209
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:33,320
Thank you.

210
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:35,940
Try it.

211
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:40,870
Rumor has it that they're generous with the cheese and delicious dishes.

212
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:47,270
Your dad doesn't like it here because business has gone down since they opened,

213
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:50,710
but he won't say anything if I tell him I came with you.

214
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:57,710
It's good. You should have some, too.

215
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:08,220
It looks delicious.

216
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:17,560
It's even better because I'm eating with my daughter.

217
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,860
Mom, when I disappeared, you were worried, right?

218
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:35,390
Of course.

219
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:39,120
Your dad cried and grabbed the detectives by the collar at the station.

220
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,120
He even flipped a table. It was crazy.

221
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:46,600
Really? He usually doesn't express his emotions like that. How touching.

222
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:51,590
"Touching?" What wouldn't a parent do after they've lost their child?

223
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:55,770
Even if it means I must roll in the dirt, I want my child to rise in a carriage.

224
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:59,630
When my heart hurts, I'm still grateful my child is happy.

225
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:04,320
A parent is someone who would lose sleep if the slightest bad thing were to happen to their child.

226
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:08,610
I raised you with this kind of heart.

227
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:15,830
Tae Yi, I may not have given birth to you, but you're still my daughter no matter what.

228
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:19,680
The most precious daughter in the world.

229
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:24,320
I don't think anyone can be a mom.

230
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,210
I don't think I could be a good mother.

231
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:27,960
Why?

232
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:32,680
You'll be an even better mom than me.

233
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:51,400
 It's been twelve weeks, did you really not know?

234
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:07,630
Tae Yi, what's wrong?

235
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:10,880
Mom, I need to check something.

236
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:12,830
I'll get going first.

237
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,920
Goodness...

238
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:37,410
 The surprising creation she made.

239
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:42,830
It was Lieutenant Park.

240
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:47,380
He's the creation.

241
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,190

242
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,260
Yes, Professor?

243
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:58,040
Hello?

244
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:03,130
 I wanted at least you to be free from this fate.

245
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:05,070
 What fate?

246
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:11,580
 The woman who must pay the price of opening the doors of time

247
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:15,110
 doesn't just mean myself.

248
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:33,900
Professor Yoon,

249
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:36,850
what's wrong?

250
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,510
Please be good

251
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,700
to Reporter Kim.

252
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:47,380
 The two of you suit each other.

253
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:51,700
Even when your mother passed away,

254
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:56,740
she was by your side.

255
00:26:56,740 --> 00:27:01,700
If it wasn't for Reporter Kim, you...

256
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:07,720
wouldn't have become the great person you are now.

257
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:12,250
Why are you saying this, all of a sudden?

258
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,980
Professor Yoon.

259
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,590
 Jin Gyeom,

260
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,850
 thank you

261
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:27,510
 for growing up so well.

262
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:22,970
The teacher says he's done with the preparations.

263
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:25,690
Please take care of it tonight.

264
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:27,520
I understand.

265
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,310
What shall I do about Yoo Min Hyeok?

266
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,650
At the time Team Leader Oh Shi Young was killed,

267
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:46,530
the director was near the villa.

268
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:57,830
What are you doing?

269
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:58,920
I apologize.

270
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:01,030
I've received orders from the director.

271
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:02,460
What orders?

272
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,700
People who suspect the existence of time travelers

273
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:07,520
and even those who are in contact with such people

274
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,040
have been ordered to be captured.

275
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:11,680
We've also been told to imprison any staff in the way of this mission.

276
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:15,010
That's something not possible with the director's orders.

277
00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:16,550
Who's making that call for him?

278
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:18,730
I don't know that.

279
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:20,630
Okay.

280
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:36,510
Where's the director?

281
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:41,140
Yeah? I'm going home to change.

282
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:44,890
I just heard. Is Professor Yoon missing?

283
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:47,510
Okay, I'll go right after I change.

284
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:04,520
Are you a time traveler?

285
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,240
Please just follow me.

286
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:08,260
Try me if you can.

287
00:30:55,610 --> 00:30:57,670

288
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,450

289
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:53,040
You're here?

290
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,310
What happened?

291
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:56,540
I came here because I suddenly couldn't reach him,

292
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:59,020
and just... this blood was left.

293
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:03,440
There are no witnesses. His body just disappeared.

294
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,350
Hello?

295
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:14,000
Where are you right now?

296
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,430
Talk to me later.

297
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:18,150
 You must escape.

298
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:22,090
Alice is going around catching all the people of the world who know about time travel.

299
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:24,090
- What? 
  - Go into hiding, for now.

300
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:26,980
You're in the most danger right now.

301
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:34,750
Do Yeon... Do Yeon.

302
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:39,880

303
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:47,080
Why did you call?

304
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:49,120
Do Yeon, where are you right now?

305
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,660
 What do you mean, where?

306
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:53,740
I'm in a mouse-hole because I confessed, but got rejected.

307
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:55,480
Where are you?

308
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,840
In a cafe near my office.

309
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,050
Is something wrong?

310
00:32:59,050 --> 00:33:01,830
How many people are there right now?

311
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:07,540
I'm the only one here.

312
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:09,860
Leave the cafe right now.

313
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:11,190
Right now?

314
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:14,090
Yeah. Right now.

315
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:21,820
I'm out.

316
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:24,610
I'm almost there.

317
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:28,380
Until I get there,

318
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:30,880
go somewhere with a lot of people.

319
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:34,620
Did something happen?

320
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:36,640
No, it's not like that.

321
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,050
Am I in danger?

322
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:39,730
I don't have time to explain.

323
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:41,930
What's going on?

324
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:44,610
I don't know yet

325
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:47,180
how I think of you.

326
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:50,640
But I know this with certainty.

327
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,910
If something were to happen to you,

328
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:56,510
something bad would happen to me, too.

329
00:33:57,210 --> 00:34:00,750
I'll do whatever I can to protect you.

330
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:03,130
Just wait a little bit.

331
00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:06,370
Okay. Come quickly.

332
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:24,640
Jin Gyeom.

333
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,330
What's wrong?

334
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:36,740
I should've confessed to you sooner.

335
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:38,740
I'm asking you, what's wrong?

336
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:41,700
You don't have to come here.

337
00:34:42,450 --> 00:34:45,400
No. Don't come here.

338
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:54,900
 The person you have reached isn't available.

339
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:06,650
Do Yeon, are you okay?

340
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:11,000
I'm sorry I was late.

341
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,770
Jin Gyeom...

342
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:18,150
Why don't you listen to me?

343
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:20,810
I told you not to come.

344
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:23,890
Why would you come here? What if you got hurt?

345
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:29,250
Thank you.

346
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,880
Thank you for being safe.

347
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:40,430
It's okay now.

348
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:00,910
Stay here for today.

349
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:02,870
It'll be safe here.

350
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:05,280
What about you?

351
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,440
Where are you going?

352
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:10,210
I have something left to do.

353
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,720
Do Yeon.

354
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:17,160
I know.

355
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:19,220
I know,

356
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:21,170
so be sure to save her.

357
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:24,900
But don't you dare get hurt.

358
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:30,080
If you get even the slightest scratch, I won't let you be.

359
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,740
Okay?

360
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,810
Okay.

361
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:55,090
Are you not hurt anywhere?

362
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,350
What are you planning right now?

363
00:37:58,350 --> 00:38:00,600
- I'm also trying to find out. 
 - What about the professor?

364
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,700
I'll look for her. Stay in hiding until then.

365
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,910
Nonsense.

366
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:06,830
Where is Alice?

367
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:11,740
No. Going there is the same as going to die.

368
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:14,040
I can't lose her twice.

369
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:17,020
I have to protect her this time.

370
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:32,060
Help me.

371
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:36,340
Since she was the person you loved.

372
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:37,130
How long will it take?

373
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,150
Ten minutes.

374
00:39:56,150 --> 00:40:00,360
- What is it? 
 - I told you it's a place that ordinary people cannot even approach.

375
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:03,080
If you want to enter Alice, you need to take it.

376
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:14,630
Do you have a plan on what you'll do after saving Professor Yoon?

377
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:16,990
The person who killed my mother...

378
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:20,740
I'm going to kill him.

379
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:40,390
Nice to meet you. I'm Seok Oh Won.

380
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:43,580
Even your speech is similar

381
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:46,820
as the Team Leader Seok I knew.

382
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:52,630
You're quite different from the Yoon Tae Yi that I knew.

383
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:56,140
So you knew the lieutenant's mother.

384
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:58,490
We were on the same research team.

385
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:03,380
Though it may be hard to believe, she was a close colleague of mine.

386
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:08,560
That's why Park Jin Gyeom's mother went to find my past self

387
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,450
and suggest they stop time together.

388
00:41:10,450 --> 00:41:13,220
Since she has experience working with me.

389
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:15,200
How does it feel?

390
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:19,110
Killing someone that looks exactly like you,

391
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:21,750
with your own hands.

392
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:29,640
I understand your hostility towards us.

393
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:34,880
I also did not want to harm anyone,

394
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:39,400
but I had no chance, in order to protect and preserve the time travel we worked so hard to create.

395
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:42,770
As colleagues of scientific pursuit,

396
00:41:43,930 --> 00:41:46,720
can't you understand me?

397
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:49,820
Then let me ask you something, as a colleague of scientific pursuit.

398
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:53,140
Do your people believe in "The Book of Prophecy?"

399
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:09,570
After creating such a mighty scientific method like time travel,

400
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:12,920
you believe in a silly prophecy?

401
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:16,460
On top of that, it has contents that cannot be explained with science.

402
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:19,640
Does it make sense to you that if the creator dies at the hands of her son,

403
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:23,310
that the time which was once stopped would flow again?

404
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:27,270
Her son's death has nothing to do with time.

405
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:32,940
Then let me ask you something.

406
00:42:35,290 --> 00:42:38,510
We are from the year 2050.

407
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:47,650
Do you believe that time travel can become so free in just 30 years?

408
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:53,300
There are things that cannot be explained with the functions and intelligence of humans.

409
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:55,220
What is that?

410
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,850
Someone like Park Jin Gyeom.

411
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:06,950
Though I'm sure many things are uncomfortable for you now, many things will end soon.

412
00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:08,860
Please wait for just a while.

413
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:13,500
What's the relationship between the teacher and Lieutenant Park?

414
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:15,810
Are they really the same person?

415
00:43:22,990 --> 00:43:27,300
Have you... heard of this by chance?

416
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:29,920
It's a story about a monster.

417
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:35,400
Long ago, a monster kidnapped a woman's son.

418
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:38,940
The mother begged for it to save her son.

419
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:44,830
The monster said he would let the son go if she could answer his question correctly.

420
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:48,020
The monster's question was very simple.

421
00:43:48,810 --> 00:43:52,880
He wanted her to guess whether he would actually kill her son or let him live.

422
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:58,710
Thankfully, the wise mother reached an answer in which the monster could not wiggle out of.

423
00:43:58,710 --> 00:44:02,130
She answered that the monster would kill her son.

424
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:06,350
Thus, the monster could not kill her son. Why?

425
00:44:06,350 --> 00:44:08,620
If the monster were to kill the son,

426
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:13,310
he would have to let the son go, as the mother answered correctly.

427
00:44:13,310 --> 00:44:18,150
Isn't it a simple paradox, in which the question already contained a contradiction?

428
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:19,700
Why are you telling me this?

429
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:22,860
All questions of this world are filled with paradoxes

430
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:27,360
and contradictions. Still, an answer exists,

431
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:29,520
as do results.

432
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:35,010
So, what decision do you think the monster made?

433
00:44:36,910 --> 00:44:39,030
He killed the mother.

434
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:45,000
The monster kept his promise

435
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,580
and no longer touched the son.

436
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:49,670
Instead,

437
00:44:50,710 --> 00:44:54,350
he turned the son into a monster like him.

438
00:44:54,350 --> 00:44:56,590
The teacher...

439
00:44:57,430 --> 00:45:01,020
knew the contents on the last page of "The Book of Prophecy."

440
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:05,480
Then, why has he not done anything until now?

441
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:07,610
Because it's not important that we know.

442
00:45:07,610 --> 00:45:11,470
It's important that you and Park Jin Gyeom know.

443
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:36,900
If you want to go to Alice, follow me.

444
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:49,610
It's your mother's last wish.

445
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:53,890
She asked me to stop you from going to Alice.

446
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:59,200
It'll be difficult to face them anyway.

447
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:04,100
Just stay here for a few hours. I'll bring Professor Yoon Tae Yi here.

448
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:07,500
When you meet Professor Yoon,

449
00:46:08,570 --> 00:46:10,870
run away as far as you can.

450
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:13,680
There's no time for this.

451
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:15,990
Hurry up and take me to Alice.

452
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:25,150
It's the effect of the medication.

453
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:29,700
 If you want to go to Alice, take this.

454
00:46:33,990 --> 00:46:35,710
I'm sorry.

455
00:46:37,110 --> 00:46:39,350
For the first and last time,

456
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:43,190
let me act like your father just once.

457
00:47:16,630 --> 00:47:20,460
I want to meet and speak with the teacher myself.

458
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:24,430
I'm sorry,

459
00:47:28,730 --> 00:47:31,330
but he is not someone you can meet just because you say you'd like to meet him.

460
00:47:31,330 --> 00:47:34,420
If you have something to say to him, you can tell me.

461
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:38,100
Yoon Tae Yi is here, right? Why did you bring her here?

462
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:41,120
It's because of the last page in "The Book of Prophecy."

463
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:43,470
What do you plan to do?

464
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:50,270
Why... does that concern you?

465
00:47:50,270 --> 00:47:53,400
Yoon Tae Yi is simply a person of the past.

466
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:05,630
Teacher thinks that you, Mr. Yoo Min Hyeok, deserve a lot of credit.

467
00:48:05,630 --> 00:48:11,160
If you just tell us where Park Jin Gyeom is,

468
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:15,040
you'll just be outcasted without any complications.

469
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,990
I don't know where he is.

470
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:31,750
I no longer want to be involved in this business, so please cast me out as soon as possible.

471
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:58,420
We'll make arrangements so you can leave this place within today.

472
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:11,420

473
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:34,750
Are you okay?

474
00:49:34,750 --> 00:49:37,040
Yes. What about Lieutenant Park?

475
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:39,550
He's in a safe place.

476
00:49:41,690 --> 00:49:44,100
I will help you escape.

477
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:48,920
I'll tell you where Park Jin Gyeom is, so please run away as far as you can with him.

478
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:51,820
He'll listen to you.

479
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:54,340
What about you?

480
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:56,700
Alice will come to catch me.

481
00:49:56,700 --> 00:50:02,050
I will try to earn you two some time to run.

482
00:50:03,230 --> 00:50:05,140
Come with us.

483
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:09,400
If you stay here, you'll be in danger.

484
00:50:17,430 --> 00:50:22,350
Hearing you say that is enough reward.

485
00:50:24,210 --> 00:50:26,480
Please just wait a little bit.

486
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:42,960
Park Jin Gyeom is on his way to Alice.

487
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:45,550
Park Jin Gyeom cannot come here.

488
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:49,260
An ordinary person cannot pass through.

489
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:52,310
You must not know yet about Park Jin Gyeom.

490
00:50:52,310 --> 00:50:57,200
He... is a special person.

491
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:02,790
There is no place in this world he cannot go.

492
00:51:41,110 --> 00:51:43,180
I'll beg you.

493
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:46,970
I'll do whatever you tell me to.

494
00:51:49,010 --> 00:51:51,660
Just leave Park Jin Gyeom alone.

495
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:53,220
Why?

496
00:51:54,380 --> 00:51:58,250
Are you trying to act like a father now?

497
00:52:03,930 --> 00:52:06,880
I gave you a chance to leave.

498
00:52:08,650 --> 00:52:10,630
How unfortunate.

499
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:36,920
It seems tragic that you, Mr. Yoo Min Hyeok, won't be able to save anyone.

500
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:39,520
Not even yourself.

501
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:41,580
 Min Hyeok!

502
00:52:50,980 --> 00:52:54,310
You've found the last page that you've been looking for.

503
00:52:54,310 --> 00:52:57,730
So... let Professor Yoon go.

504
00:52:57,730 --> 00:53:03,840
That's why we no longer

505
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:06,100
have a reason to keep Yoon Tae Yi alive.

506
00:53:11,350 --> 00:53:13,300
Min Hyeok!

507
00:53:16,180 --> 00:53:18,450
Min Hyeok.

508
00:53:21,210 --> 00:53:23,790
Tae Yi...

509
00:53:23,790 --> 00:53:27,610
Don't say anything. Don't speak.

510
00:53:43,230 --> 00:53:45,880
Is it because of time travel?

511
00:53:46,610 --> 00:53:51,800
Is time travel worth the death of so many people?

512
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:54,420
Why are you asking that to me?

513
00:53:55,300 --> 00:54:00,830
The person who said we must succeed in creating time travel

514
00:54:00,830 --> 00:54:05,600
was you! It was you!

515
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:44,540
You've finally come.

516
00:54:44,540 --> 00:54:47,280
Why do you go to such lengths?

517
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:53,990
Park Jin Gyeom... For you.

518
00:54:56,670 --> 00:54:58,880
The teacher...

519
00:55:02,350 --> 00:55:06,750
is waiting for you.

520
00:55:58,660 --> 00:56:01,010
Why did you do that?

521
00:56:03,620 --> 00:56:09,060
I... haven't forgiven you yet.

522
00:56:10,530 --> 00:56:13,780
You should've given me the time to forgive you.

523
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:17,050
I'm sorry.

524
00:56:18,970 --> 00:56:20,910
I'm sorry.

525
00:56:31,550 --> 00:56:33,280
Tae Yi...

526
00:56:39,690 --> 00:56:44,850
 You passed through a wormhole full of radiation while pregnant.

527
00:56:45,750 --> 00:56:48,190
 Let's think logically.

528
00:56:48,190 --> 00:56:54,380
 If order to return, we'll have to pass through the wormhole again. If that happens, you could give birth to a really horrific child.

529
00:56:55,630 --> 00:57:00,850
 What if I give birth here?

530
00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:02,400
 Don't think of useless things.

531
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:04,680
 We have things to do when we get back, so erase it.

532
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:07,090
 Things to do?

533
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:09,010
 Tae Yi, what I mean is–

534
00:57:09,010 --> 00:57:11,000
 I'm hungry.

535
00:57:13,710 --> 00:57:18,240
 I'll abort it. I will.

536
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:22,890
 Before I do, I want to feed it a lot of delicious food.

537
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:38,870
 Okay.

538
00:57:38,870 --> 00:57:41,050
 Let's give birth to it here.

539
00:57:45,130 --> 00:57:52,150
 Here, you and I can live, with the child.

540
00:57:54,820 --> 00:58:00,170
 I'll make you two happy.

541
00:58:17,340 --> 00:58:19,520
Min Hyeok...

542
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:51,250
Professor, you should return.

543
00:58:51,250 --> 00:58:53,970
I've parked the car outside.

544
00:58:53,970 --> 00:58:56,150
What about you?

545
00:58:57,460 --> 00:58:59,780
No.

546
00:58:59,780 --> 00:59:03,600
I know what you're thinking, but no.

547
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:06,180
We need to escape.

548
00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:08,450
You're the creation.

549
00:59:08,450 --> 00:59:13,630
If you die here, there's no hope.

550
00:59:13,630 --> 00:59:18,850
It doesn't matter what I am.

551
00:59:20,150 --> 00:59:23,250
The person who killed my mother is here.

552
00:59:24,690 --> 00:59:26,870
I cannot run away.

553
00:59:26,870 --> 00:59:29,790
Let's just run away together!

554
01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:05,960
We finally meet... after ten years.

555
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,130
What's your reason

556
01:01:14,130 --> 01:01:16,690
for killing my mom?

557
01:01:18,420 --> 01:01:20,160
Tell me.

558
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:22,880
Why did you kill my mom?

559
01:01:31,820 --> 01:01:34,250
A long time ago,

560
01:01:37,300 --> 01:01:43,600
I asked a very old man that very question.

561
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:57,500
- Who... are you? 
 - Who... are you?

562
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:08,260
Like you, I tried to kill that old man.

563
01:03:08,260 --> 01:03:10,380
Stop speaking nonsense.

564
01:03:10,380 --> 01:03:13,670
- I'm not a monster like you! 
 - I'm not a monster like you.

565
01:03:29,470 --> 01:03:33,690
I denied it, like you did.

566
01:03:35,670 --> 01:03:38,860
But I have become that old man,

567
01:03:40,030 --> 01:03:45,710
and now you have come to kill me.

568
01:03:50,950 --> 01:03:53,450
 The monster's question was very simple.

569
01:03:53,450 --> 01:03:57,530
 He wanted her to guess whether he would actually kill her son or let him live.

570
01:03:57,530 --> 01:04:03,580
 Thankfully, the wise mother reached an answer in which the monster could not wiggle out of.

571
01:04:10,070 --> 01:04:11,890
Professor Yoon.

572
01:04:12,570 --> 01:04:14,990
You cannot kill Lieutenant Park.

573
01:04:14,990 --> 01:04:19,580
The creation doesn't mean Lieutenant Park.

574
01:04:19,580 --> 01:04:22,470
You're also the creation.

575
01:04:22,470 --> 01:04:28,600
Even in different dimensions, you two have the same mother.

576
01:04:30,770 --> 01:04:34,120
That's why you cannot kill Lieutenant Park.

577
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:41,890
If you kill Lieutenant Park, the doors of time will close, as prophesied.

578
01:04:58,630 --> 01:05:00,490
Mom...

579
01:05:03,710 --> 01:05:07,970
 What decision do you think the monster made?

580
01:05:11,530 --> 01:05:13,960
 He killed the mother.

581
01:05:17,770 --> 01:05:19,620
Professor Yoon.

582
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:23,670
Professor Yoon!

583
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:26,230
Professor Yoon.

584
01:05:26,230 --> 01:05:27,810
Professor...

585
01:05:27,810 --> 01:05:29,870
Professor.

586
01:05:29,870 --> 01:05:31,780
Professor.

587
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:40,250
I will do what I can

588
01:05:43,750 --> 01:05:46,180
to reverse this.

589
01:05:46,950 --> 01:05:49,180
Don't do that.

590
01:05:49,180 --> 01:05:53,670
Just... run away.

591
01:05:53,670 --> 01:05:56,250
This is the end.

592
01:05:57,910 --> 01:06:00,470
I have to end it now.

593
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:03,840
No,

594
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:08,570
there is no beginning

595
01:06:08,570 --> 01:06:10,940
or end to time.

596
01:06:10,940 --> 01:06:17,690
However, people... have a beginning.

597
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:24,580
You need to stop that beginning.

598
01:06:52,660 --> 01:06:54,410
 Mom...

599
01:07:15,830 --> 01:07:18,800
This woman

600
01:07:19,790 --> 01:07:22,750
always sacrifices her life for you.

601
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:01,400
That's right.

602
01:08:03,310 --> 01:08:05,440
For me.

603
01:08:07,150 --> 01:08:09,990
She's someone who sacrificed her life.

604
01:08:12,010 --> 01:08:14,840
You killed her.

605
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:17,630
Though you despise me now,

606
01:08:18,350 --> 01:08:23,710
someday, you will be grateful to me.

607
01:08:33,330 --> 01:08:36,420
I saved you.

608
01:08:36,420 --> 01:08:42,440
And you have saved me. Look at me.

609
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:46,870
I've got control of time, but I'm

610
01:08:46,870 --> 01:08:51,810
also being chased by time.

611
01:08:56,370 --> 01:08:58,850
I won't become like you.

612
01:09:00,260 --> 01:09:03,270
Stop being so naive.

613
01:09:03,270 --> 01:09:07,860
I am trying to give you the chance to reign over time.

614
01:09:07,860 --> 01:09:10,890
I have no interest in such things.

615
01:09:11,980 --> 01:09:15,110
I'm going to revert all of it.

616
01:09:15,110 --> 01:09:19,040
After saving all the people that died because of you,

617
01:09:20,860 --> 01:09:23,370
I'll kill you.

618
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:28,650
Since you're the start, I'll mark the end.

619
01:09:48,420 --> 01:09:55,330

620
01:09:55,330 --> 01:09:58,340
♫  My love will bring us back  ♫

621
01:09:58,340 --> 01:10:02,400
♫  Ain't nobody holding me back  ♫

622
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:04,450
♫  We'll be like Bonnie and Clyde  ♫

623
01:10:04,450 --> 01:10:05,990
♫  We ride or die  ♫

624
01:10:05,990 --> 01:10:09,120
♫  We tight  ♫

625
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:12,110
♫  My love will bring us back  ♫

626
01:10:12,110 --> 01:10:16,250
♫  Ain't nobody holding me back  ♫

627
01:10:16,250 --> 01:10:18,050
♫  We'll be like Bonnie and Clyde  ♫

628
01:10:18,050 --> 01:10:20,010
♫  We ride or die  ♫

629
01:10:20,010 --> 01:10:23,050
♫  Like Bonnie and Clyde  ♫

630
01:10:23,050 --> 01:10:24,490

631
01:10:24,490 --> 01:10:26,880
 Do you know where the teacher is? I'll catch him.

632
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:29,410
 No matter what you do here,

633
01:10:29,410 --> 01:10:31,890
 the future will not change.

634
01:10:31,890 --> 01:10:33,490
 He must die.

635
01:10:33,490 --> 01:10:35,040
 Don't touch Jin Gyeom.

636
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:37,720
 I'm going to bring back to life everyone that I love.

637
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:41,720
 I had hoped for "The Book of Prophecy" to be wrong, but you've come.

638
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:45,420
 I was happy to have been born as your son.
