1
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:33,090
 Time...

2
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:37,480
 is the most valuable thing that humans can use. 
- Theophrastus -

3
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:42,350

4
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:45,220
Yes.

5
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:47,530
I've arrived, Teacher.

6
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,340
I'll take care of Director Seok Oh Wan.

7
00:00:55,030 --> 00:01:02,020

8
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,220
Since this area is large, we should split up.

9
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:16,700
I'll take this side, so please take that side.

10
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:18,680
Yes, I understand.

11
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,400
You scared me!

12
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:34,380
I think Chief Seok Oh Won was here.

13
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:37,050
But we were too late.

14
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:39,440
Hurry and search the area.

15
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:55,080

16
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:13,100
Lieutenant!

17
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,810
When did Team Leader get here?

18
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:17,700
Did you call him?

19
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,540
For now...

20
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,960
Let's just hurry and find Seok Oh Won.

21
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:35,160
Excuse me. Did you happen to see someone that looks like him?

22
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,700
No. I haven't.

23
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:39,120
Have you someone like him?

24
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,940
No...

25
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:52,130

26
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:53,530

27
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,820
Based on the investigation, we're certain that Chief Seok Oh Won was held here for a long time.

28
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:02,270
The hair and fingerprints were all Chief Seok's.

29
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:06,130
We didn't find anything that identified the culprits.

30
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:07,450
That's all.

31
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:09,630
Was there no blood?

32
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:13,110
- Yeah. 
 - That would mean he's still alive, right?

33
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:15,620
You know better than that.

34
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:18,950
There's a big chance he's already buried somewhere.

35
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:21,350
We haven't found any leads on the Lee Se Hoon case, either.

36
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:24,520
Oh! Did you check the USB?

37
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,350
The blackbox for Lee Se Hoon's inn.

38
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,580
Yes, I checked it,

39
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,710
but there was no one particularly suspicious.

40
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,420
I have something to show you.

41
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:44,600
What's wrong?

42
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,170
Where did you get that?

43
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:55,450
Where did you get it?

44
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:59,200
You already saw this, didn't you?

45
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,100
Did you show this to anyone else?

46
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:06,240
Is that important? Team Leader is in this!

47
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,160
Team Leader is a suspect for Lee Se Hoon's murder case, right?

48
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,490
I know the clip can cause a misunderstanding.

49
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:14,670
It's not a misunderstanding. Team Leader is really weird!

50
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:19,160
He's been like family for 10 years.

51
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,000
I know better what kind of person he is.

52
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,010
Then, why didn't Team Leader investigate the chief?

53
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:29,430
You choked the chief with just a montage that was made 10 years ago.

54
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:35,720
But the Team Leader who was in charge of your mother's case never investigated the chief in 10 years.

55
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,190
Isn't that weird?

56
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,310
Give me the USB.

57
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:42,160
This was in the items you left behind when you died!

58
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:47,920
This could be related to your death.

59
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:51,730
This is the only clue that I have.

60
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:53,110
I can't give it to you.

61
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:57,800
Even if it's you, I can't give it up.

62
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,630
Why are you asking about Mr. Go all of a sudden?

63
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:35,520
I just want to know what kind of person Chief Go Hyeong Seok is.

64
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,880
I can answer that for you, but why are you asking?

65
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:44,160
I was curious because I heard he's like a father to the lieutenant.

66
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,120
Yes, he's like a father to him.

67
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:49,410
I'm not here to play games.

68
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:54,090
Team Leader and Lieutenant met for the first time in 2010, right?

69
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:57,100
When the lieutenant was in high school, he was falsely accused of something

70
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:00,770
and the person who came to arrest him was the Team Leader, right?

71
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:03,620
It looks like you know everything. What do you want to ask?

72
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:08,870
How long after the false charge did the lieutenant's mother pass away?

73
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:09,910
Why do you ask that?

74
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:13,070
I'm just curious.

75
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:15,110
Three days.

76
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:19,010
She passed away three days after Jin Gyeom was released.

77
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:48,580
What are you doing in someone else's room?

78
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:52,030
I was just stopping by to reminisce about the past.

79
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,800
Do you know who the owner of this room is?

80
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,520
I heard it's the room the lieutenant's mother used to use.

81
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:05,230
But why are you here? Are you looking for something?

82
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:10,440
No, I'm... just here to see Jin Gyeom.

83
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:20,400
Do you have absolutely no memories of when you were little?

84
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:24,020
Yes... for now...

85
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:28,700
If you know anything, can you tell me?

86
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,840
I'd love to, but I don't know anything.

87
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:36,260
Then let me ask you something you do know.

88
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:39,840
When did you first know of the lieutenant?

89
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,400
I told you last time.

90
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:46,490
Jin Gyeom was put under a false accusation because of me.

91
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:49,920
You didn't know him before then?

92
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:54,380
No.

93
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:57,630
Why do you ask?

94
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:00,350
Because I think you're strange.

95
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:03,940
The scar behind your ear is strange, too.

96
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:07,140
When did you get that scar?

97
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:12,400
Why do you want to know that?

98
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,220
Because I think I've seen it before.

99
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,200
Where?

100
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:49,800
What brought you to my house?

101
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,550
I had something to tell you.

102
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:56,960
Why didn't you call?

103
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,050
I turned in my resignation.

104
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,140
Sorry, I couldn't tell you ahead of time.

105
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:08,510
But... you're the first person I'm telling.

106
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:10,520
Why all of a sudden?

107
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:14,590
I'm just tired of life...

108
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:22,090
and I want to travel with my wife.

109
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:26,520
Why? Are you sad?

110
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:32,110
No. You did the right thing.

111
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:34,740
I'm going to quit when we find Chief Seok.

112
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:39,350
Don't tell anyone until then.

113
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:41,370
Chief Seok...

114
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,470
Do you think we'll be able to find him?

115
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:55,250
I have a feeling we won't be able to find him.

116
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,600
Yes, Sergeant.

117
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,970
 Lieutenant, Seok Oh Won has returned.

118
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:18,850

119
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:42,200
I was locked up in a warehouse and barely escaped yesterday.

120
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:47,650
Where is the prophecy you said you would show me?

121
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,670
I think the culprit took it.

122
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:58,890
You said there was something written in The Book of Prophecy that I should know.

123
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:01,270
Please tell me.

124
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:06,000
After this happened to me, I realized how reckless I've been.

125
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:11,100
I give up now. I don't want to be involved in this anymore.

126
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:15,440
I understand you had a difficult experience.

127
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:21,590
But you're someone who tried to stop time travel for 10 years...

128
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:24,740
How can you give up so easily?

129
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:28,760
Anyone can have psychological resistance to a new world.

130
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:31,740
I've only now accepted this.

131
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:34,470
You should rethink this, too, Lieutenant.

132
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:40,940
There is nothing you can do against time travelers.

133
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:48,800
If there's nothing more you have to say, I'll be getting up now.

134
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,310
There are still procedures left.

135
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,430
Is this the right place?

136
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:14,030
Yes... It's right.

137
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:18,710
The culprit murdered his other victims right away.

138
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:21,930
Why did he only keep you in confinement and not kill you?

139
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:23,600
I don't know...

140
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,670
Are you saying there's a problem with me coming back alive?

141
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:29,560
Is there a reason the culprit let you live?

142
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,000
I wouldn't know.

143
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:42,680
How did you escape?

144
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,230
I escaped while the culprit was on the phone two days ago.

145
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:46,750
Did you see the culprit's face?

146
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:49,770
No. My eyes were covered. I only heard his voice.

147
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:51,040
Did you recognize the voice?

148
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,830
I had never heard his voice before.

149
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:58,720
Being here is bringing back bad memories and it's suffocating.

150
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,140
Would it be all right for me to leave now?

151
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,890
Thank you for your cooperation.

152
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:08,610
Let's go. I will take you back.

153
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:39,310
It seems like Park Jin Gyeom suspects you.

154
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:44,040
You just worry about yourself.

155
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,610
Where's Min Hyeok?

156
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:52,940
I don't know what he's up to.

157
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:56,870
It'll take some time for his suspicions to go away.

158
00:15:56,870 --> 00:16:00,170
Don't feel bad. It's natural from Min Hyeok's point of view.

159
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:01,970
I know.

160
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:07,170
I've told him some lies, too. I'm trying to make amends.

161
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:19,370
I'm restoring the CCTV around the inn where Lee Se Hoon was murdered.

162
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:21,640
If we find the person who killed Lee Se Hoon,

163
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:25,460
we should be able to find the person who killed Tae Yi, too.

164
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:27,670
We might find Teacher, too.

165
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:30,560
- Report to me when you get the results. 
 - Okay.

166
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:39,030
How much has been restored?

167
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:41,360
It's not going to be easy.

168
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:44,010
Okay.

169
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:55,240

170
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:01,730
The police have secured proof that Go Hyeong Seok killed Lee Se Hoon.

171
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:06,210
But it seems like Park Jin Gyeom isn't planning on arresting Go Hyeong Seok.

172
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:35,210
Please, don't be scared.

173
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:38,920
I'm here to see Park Jin Gyeom. Where is he now?

174
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,710
What business do you have with the lieutenant?

175
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:42,930
I need to tell him something.

176
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:45,940
Don't worry. I'm trying to help him.

177
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:49,060
Until recently, you were trying to kill him.

178
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:51,590
You want to help him now?

179
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:55,300
There was a misunderstanding then.

180
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,260
What misunderstanding?

181
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:02,240
I don't know what misunderstanding you had and how you overcame this by yourself,

182
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,140
but please don't approach him.

183
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:09,200
You're a time traveler.

184
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:14,750
Once this situation is resolved, I won't be returning again.

185
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:17,070
What situation?

186
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:33,300
What situation is he talking about?

187
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:48,570

188
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:51,070

189
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,920
What? You submitted a resignation?

190
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:14,410
Tomorrow's my last day.

191
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:21,720
Sorry... I made the decision without discussing it with you.

192
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,400
You did good.

193
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:30,630
- I did good? 
 - Yeah.

194
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:35,660
I was so worried I couldn't sleep every time you were dispatched.

195
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:38,770
Now I can sleep in peace.

196
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:41,900
In all the time we were married,

197
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:45,580
this is the best choice you've made.

198
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:49,070
All right. Here's a little something!

199
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:55,190
Here. Today, you can drink as much as you want!

200
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:59,320
Man, my wife is the best.

201
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,390
Of course! Give that here!

202
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:04,000
Cheers!

203
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:11,560
Have some food.

204
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:14,600
What? You guys already started?

205
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,590
You're the one who came late.

206
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:20,400
It's still not fair for you to start without the main guest.

207
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,730
Oh, you were the main guest? Man, I'm sorry.

208
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,240
Eat up.

209
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,790
- Enjoy! 
 - Thank you!

210
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:31,360
Let me know right away if you need anything else.

211
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,210
- Thank you! 
 - Thank you for the food!

212
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:36,650
There are plenty of Chinese restaurants. Why do you guys keep coming here?

213
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:41,290
We're sorry. Starting next time, we'll make sure to go somewhere else.

214
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:46,170
Do you want to get exiled to the kitchen? Come here!

215
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:51,700
Yeah, come in and make some black bean sauce.

216
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:55,310
You guys are even trying to make me do kitchen work, now?

217
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:57,870
There isn't a job you don't make me do.

218
00:20:57,870 --> 00:21:00,000
Does this restaurant even run without me?

219
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,840
You little brat!

220
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,820
Hurry and take that out.

221
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:10,910
Please eat a lot, Team Leader.

222
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:14,470
And even after you retire, please come here to eat from time to time.

223
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:16,400
Thank you.

224
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:24,920
Since we are all here, let's make a toast one more time!

225
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:31,170
Wait!  Let's first hear from our team leader on his retirement.

226
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:35,650
- Yes! 
 - Team Leader!

227
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:43,020
Let's just...

228
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:47,450
eat quietly.

229
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:51,530
- Please, Team Leader!  You should at least say something! 
 - A few words, please!

230
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:52,860
Please!

231
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:56,520
Sir, I am not going to drink until you say a few words.

232
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:10,250
When you get home, call me. Okay?

233
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:11,670
I will.

234
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:13,960
Be careful getting home.

235
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:06,730
You seem to know who I am.

236
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,410
What is your identity?

237
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,020

238
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:20,070
Yes, Ma'am.

239
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:21,620
 Oh, Jin Gyeom.

240
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:23,640
Uncle is still with you, isn't he?

241
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,810
Can you hand the phone to him?

242
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:27,810
 Why doesn't he answer his phone?

243
00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:00,720
For what purpose did you come here?

244
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,370
What is the reason for staying by Park Jin Gyeom's side?

245
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:05,320
Why?

246
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:11,490
Are you trying to act like a father now?

247
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:14,920
How did you know?

248
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,340
I will...

249
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:22,820
for sure make you open your mouth.

250
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:39,330
Hear me out first.  I came here to help you.

251
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:42,820
This punk is an illegal time traveler sent by Teacher.

252
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,990
You were also suspecting him, weren't you?

253
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:50,630
Believe me.

254
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:55,590
I came to catch the bastard who killed your mom and is also trying to kill you.

255
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:59,530
I will go to Alice and try to investigate.

256
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:03,070
Why would you?

257
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,240
Who are you to do that?

258
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:09,560
With what right?

259
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:14,900
Don't ever touch Uncle again.

260
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:19,600
Uncle is like a father to me.

261
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:25,680
This is the last warning.

262
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,660
Jin Gyeom!

263
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,340
Why are you—

264
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:01,480
You are awake?

265
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:05,520
How much did you drink that you rolled down the stairs?

266
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,690
What would you have done if it weren't for Jin Gyeom?

267
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,760
I will be leaving now.  Please don't come out.

268
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:31,650

269
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:42,200

270
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,410
What do you plan on doing now?

271
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:00,520
I don't know, either.

272
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:04,240
I am worried that Park Jin Gyeom is too dependent on

273
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:08,520
someone who killed Tae Yi and also is trying to kill him.

274
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:12,010
Are you certain that he killed Tae Yi?

275
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:14,140
It doesn't seem for sure.  That's why.

276
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:18,600
Hyung, Teacher is looking for The Book of Prophecy.

277
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:22,640
That's why he sent Lee Se Hoon and killed Tae Yi.

278
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,840
Now, he is even targeting Park Jin Gyeom.

279
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:57,390
Why did Tae Yi run away with "The Book of Prophecy?"  What could be written in "The Book of Prophecy?"

280
00:27:57,390 --> 00:28:01,800
We don't know who wrote "The Book of Prophecy" and no one has ever seen it until now.

281
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:06,730
I don't understand either why headquarters is so obsessed with mere paper.

282
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:10,490
Still, there must be a reason why headquarters is looking for it, isn't there?

283
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:13,700
I heard that it talks about the end of time travel.

284
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:18,340
Supposedly, it is about the one who can control time at will and how he stops time travel.

285
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:21,540
Rather absurd, right?

286
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:26,280
What's wrong?

287
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:29,180
Park Jin Gyeom.

288
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:36,140
The wormhole had opened and closed with no reason near Park Jin Gyeom.  Not just once, but twice at that.

289
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:41,480
I will look into it more so don't tell headquarters about it yet.

290
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,300
Okay.

291
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:06,940
 This is Lee Se Hoon.  You want to know why your mom died, don't you?

292
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:11,670
 If you can protect me, I will tell you everything.

293
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:39,940
 Teacher!

294
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:56,060
 Please take it.

295
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:58,540
 What is this?

296
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:01,350
 I am trying to give you a chance.

297
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:18,660
 This is an antidote.

298
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:23,550
 As long as it is given within 5 minutes, there should not be any aftereffect.

299
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:32,390
 Please forgive me, Teacher!  Please spare my life!

300
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:35,270
 Teacher!

301
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:37,920
 The last page of "The Book of Prophecy,"

302
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,430
 where is it?

303
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:43,050
 I didn't hide it, really!

304
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:46,300
 It wasn't there from the first time I saw the book.

305
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:49,560
 Please!  Please believe me!

306
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,170
 I will believe you.

307
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,960
You're late.

308
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:12,490
I leave the rest to you.

309
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:53,110
 The child that was born after crossing the door of time,

310
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:57,010
 was born with the destiny to close the door of time.

311
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:09,220

312
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:17,610

313
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,920

314
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,150

315
00:33:55,210 --> 00:33:57,040

316
00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:00,300
What are you doing?

317
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:03,580
Well...

318
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:09,400
I was just... just...

319
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:15,870
Don't misunderstand.

320
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:19,280
Can we get an app together?

321
00:34:20,170 --> 00:34:25,990
I was up all night developing a location tracking app. Let's download it and share each other's location.

322
00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:28,390
Why do you want to know my location?

323
00:34:28,390 --> 00:34:34,080
So I can help if something were to happen to you.

324
00:34:34,910 --> 00:34:39,450
And you can come running if something happens to me.

325
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:42,750
Okay.

326
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:48,510
Okay, look. This is where we are now.

327
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:53,870
From now on, I'm going to keep track of where you go, so don't go anywhere weird.

328
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:55,530
I don't go to those places.

329
00:34:55,530 --> 00:35:00,860
What places are you talking about? I meant don't go anywhere dangerous.

330
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:03,480
Don't worry.

331
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:07,510
I won't go anywhere weird or dangerous.

332
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:12,240
 It seems like Park Jin Gyeom's abilities have started to get stronger since his time travel.

333
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:16,180
 Once he starts to control time,

334
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:18,860
 we will all be in danger.

335
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:22,650
 We need to kill Park Jin Gyeom.

336
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:27,030
 But...

337
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:31,930
 we haven't found the last page of the prophecy, yet.

338
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:35,620
 We don't know what's written there.

339
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:40,530
 We're going to find the last page, but we don't have time.

340
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:46,040
 If Park Jin Gyeom closes the door of time before we find it, we don't know what will happen.

341
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,260
 Alice can go extinct and

342
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:52,280
 all the time travelers here now can be stranded here.

343
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,280
 Kill Park Jin Gyeom.

344
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:03,680
What's wrong?

345
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,350
Does it taste bad?

346
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:11,180
No. My wife made it.

347
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:13,070
Of course, it's good.

348
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:27,100
I was thinking about what we'll eat once I quit my job.

349
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:32,690
Why are you worrying about that? Don't worry! We're both healthy. We won't starve to death.

350
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:38,960
For now, rest up for a few months. We can travel, too. We can worry after that.

351
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,730
Cheer up, Husband. Honey!

352
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:45,140
Fighting!

353
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:50,820
Try this, too. It's really fresh! Hurry!

354
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,270
Lieutenant.

355
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:12,440
Aren't you going to pick up?

356
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:17,030

357
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:23,830
Yes, Mister.

358
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,730
 Mister?

359
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,300
Are you busy today?

360
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:33,180
No.

361
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:35,520
Then...

362
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:40,490
Do you want to go night fishing?

363
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:42,840
Okay.

364
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,740
I'll pick you up.

365
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,970
 Kill Park Jin Gyeom.

366
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:12,910
 You may loose your wife again.

367
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:18,440
 There's no reason to keep you here if you don't obey my command, right?

368
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,830
 I will forcibly deport you.

369
00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:26,800
 Then I will get rid of all traces of you.

370
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:30,520
 We'd have to start with your wife.

371
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,910
 Make your decision quick.

372
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:36,570
 Will you kill Park Jin Gyeom or

373
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:39,940
 will you be separated from your wife forever?

374
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:00,730
Nice.

375
00:40:11,850 --> 00:40:13,200

376
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:19,550
 This call cannot be completed as dialed...

377
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:28,000
Just the two of them?

378
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,010
Yes. They do that occasionally.

379
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:32,820
What's wrong?

380
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:42,390
Detective, I need your help.

381
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:45,430
What is this?

382
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:49,200
Team Leader is a suspect for murder.

383
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:22,310
Are you hungry?

384
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:25,800
Do you want to eat?

385
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:15,660
I'm sorry, Jin Gyeom.

386
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:35,820
This is the only way to save my wife.

387
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:54,380

388
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:56,180
In Sook.

389
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:03,340
I'm sorry.

390
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:15,850
Are you Go Hyeong Seok?

391
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:21,260
Who are you?

392
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:24,590
I'm here to give you a chance.

393
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,830
What chance?

394
00:43:27,830 --> 00:43:33,950
I can help you see your wife again.

395
00:43:36,450 --> 00:43:39,450
She's already dead. How can I see her again?

396
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:42,560
Through time travel.

397
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:53,900
I will help you meet your living wife through time travel.

398
00:43:54,730 --> 00:43:58,450
But I need you to do something in 2010 for me first.

399
00:44:02,570 --> 00:44:09,360

400
00:44:39,690 --> 00:44:41,560

401
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:45,130

402
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,590
Welcome.

403
00:45:03,590 --> 00:45:05,860
- I'll take this. 
 - Is that all?

404
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:07,860
 2,000 won. Thank you.

405
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:10,520
Come again!

406
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:18,630
- Hello! 
 - Oh, welcome!

407
00:45:18,630 --> 00:45:21,170
 4,000 won per pound.

408
00:45:21,170 --> 00:45:22,410
It's expensive.

409
00:45:22,410 --> 00:45:23,390
It's fresh.

410
00:45:23,390 --> 00:45:25,580
- Give me one pound. 
 - Anything else? Garlic?

411
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:27,260
 Garlic... is 2,000 won.

412
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:29,260
- So expensive! 
 - It's good quality.

413
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:30,860
It's good.

414
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:42,850
Honey!

415
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:48,590
Are you coming from the market? How nice!

416
00:45:48,590 --> 00:45:50,320
I'm really hungry!

417
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:52,350
Who are you?

418
00:45:53,430 --> 00:45:55,500
Oh, you're my husband.

419
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:58,700
I forgot you because you didn't call or stop by for a whole week.

420
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:00,630
I told you.

421
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:04,070
I was staking out to catch an arsonist.

422
00:46:04,070 --> 00:46:06,040
What is this smell?

423
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:08,940
I couldn't wash up for a week.

424
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:10,510
You didn't even brush your teeth?

425
00:46:10,510 --> 00:46:11,560
 I did.

426
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:12,810
 - Are you sure you brushed? 
 - I did!

427
00:46:12,810 --> 00:46:14,930
 Gosh, really!

428
00:46:14,930 --> 00:46:15,850
 Let's go.

429
00:46:15,850 --> 00:46:18,130
 Don't get close.

430
00:46:18,130 --> 00:46:19,840
 Let's go.

431
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:32,830
Yes.

432
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:36,600
What? You found him?

433
00:46:37,970 --> 00:46:41,170
No, no, no way!  Why would I not take a part in it?  I chased him for so long.

434
00:46:41,170 --> 00:46:44,070
I'll be there. I'll be right there.

435
00:46:44,070 --> 00:46:45,270
I have to go.

436
00:46:45,270 --> 00:46:47,970
- Why? 
 -  They found the arsonist.

437
00:46:47,970 --> 00:46:50,860
Don't go at it alone and get hurt again!

438
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:52,450
Always be careful!

439
00:46:52,450 --> 00:46:54,500
Don't worry. I've been doing this for years.

440
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:58,490
They have lifeguards at the pool even when Park Tae Hwan swims!

441
00:47:12,950 --> 00:47:15,760
What are you talking about? I'm working right now.

442
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:17,210
Where are you now?

443
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:20,870
Where?  I am working, of course.

444
00:47:20,870 --> 00:47:23,460
I can't talk anymore, so don't call.

445
00:47:24,990 --> 00:47:26,410
What...

446
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:49,060

447
00:47:49,830 --> 00:47:51,580
Yes, Sir.

448
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:55,920
I've located Yoon Tae Yi. And my wife, too.

449
00:47:55,920 --> 00:48:00,480
  Yes, Sir. I will return as soon as I take care of Yoon Tae Yi.

450
00:48:01,530 --> 00:48:06,140
No, there is already someone decent by my wife's side.

451
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:09,140
I saw her happy so that's enough for me.

452
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:10,830
Yes.

453
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:25,560
 Why aren't you answering your phone?

454
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:30,510
 I need to tell you something, so call even if you are busy, okay?

455
00:48:42,950 --> 00:48:46,730

456
00:48:48,130 --> 00:48:51,650

457
00:48:53,690 --> 00:48:59,120

458
00:49:13,290 --> 00:49:15,030
What are you doing here?

459
00:49:15,030 --> 00:49:17,960
I'm sure I stabbed you.

460
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:25,200
Where did you stab him?

461
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,860
Where did you stab him?

462
00:49:31,370 --> 00:49:33,940
Please save me.

463
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:43,320
Are you okay?

464
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:50,970
I will explain later, so please just get on my back for now.

465
00:49:50,970 --> 00:49:53,060
Let's go to the hospital first.

466
00:49:58,420 --> 00:49:59,950
Who are you?

467
00:49:59,950 --> 00:50:02,510
I'm someone that came to help you.

468
00:50:02,510 --> 00:50:04,970
Otherwise, you'll die.

469
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,290
Who are you?

470
00:50:07,290 --> 00:50:12,710
Your wife, you met her as a victim in one of your cases, right?

471
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:15,800
Your son died of heart disease when he was five years old, didn't he?

472
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:18,570
I am you.

473
00:50:18,570 --> 00:50:22,290
My son also died when he was five years old, from heart disease.

474
00:50:23,450 --> 00:50:25,400
What kind of bullshit is this?

475
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:31,870
After my kid died, I hated being home so I worked like crazy.

476
00:50:31,870 --> 00:50:35,630
I thought if I went home my kid would come running out calling "dad."

477
00:50:35,630 --> 00:50:40,860
At the front door of the house, I would always turn around and go back to the police department.

478
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:43,140
That's why I didn't know...

479
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:46,030
that Mi Sook was sick.

480
00:50:46,030 --> 00:50:48,880
That she was dying.

481
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:50,840
Who dies?

482
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:53,100
Mi Sook dies.

483
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:54,620
Why does Mi Sook?

484
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:56,890
She dies because of me.

485
00:50:56,890 --> 00:50:59,720
She dies because I can't do anything for her.

486
00:51:03,450 --> 00:51:08,360
Mi Sook can't die.

487
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:17,910
Mi Sook...

488
00:51:18,790 --> 00:51:20,780
So, come to your senses.

489
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:23,940
Come to your senses and stay by Mi Sook's side.

490
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:26,220
No, you can't!

491
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:29,440
What about Mi Sook if you are not around?!

492
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:31,620
How am I suppose to go back?

493
00:51:32,330 --> 00:51:34,340
Don't go.

494
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:39,490
Can I ask you to take care of Mi Sook?

495
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:43,920
I only gave her a hard life.

496
00:51:45,930 --> 00:51:48,460
I have to make her happy...

497
00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:59,120
Hey.

498
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:01,620
Hey.

499
00:52:10,530 --> 00:52:13,020

500
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:17,820
Okay then. Our wife...

501
00:52:19,450 --> 00:52:21,800
I'll make her happy.

502
00:52:25,230 --> 00:52:27,320
Rest in peace.

503
00:52:50,620 --> 00:52:52,380
What happened to you?

504
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:56,830
How many times do I have to tell you?  I was at a hospital and woke up only yesterday.

505
00:52:56,830 --> 00:52:59,740
Yes. We'll be there right away. Okay.

506
00:52:59,740 --> 00:53:02,310
Captain, a call came in from the school to report an incident.

507
00:53:02,310 --> 00:53:04,930
A girl fell from the roof.

508
00:53:04,930 --> 00:53:05,990
I'll go.

509
00:53:05,990 --> 00:53:06,870
Hey.

510
00:53:06,870 --> 00:53:08,810
Let's go together.

511
00:53:14,890 --> 00:53:17,560
Do you know the student who committed suicide?

512
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:20,690
Yes, we were in the same theater class.

513
00:53:20,690 --> 00:53:23,650
Theater class? Do you want to become an actor?

514
00:53:23,650 --> 00:53:26,140
No, my mom made me join.

515
00:53:26,140 --> 00:53:28,330
She said it would help.

516
00:53:33,550 --> 00:53:36,550
Give me that. I'll do it.

517
00:53:41,980 --> 00:53:43,530
I don't need to fish.

518
00:53:43,530 --> 00:53:45,890
If you weren't going to do it, why did you come along?

519
00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:48,900
You made me come with you.

520
00:53:57,340 --> 00:54:01,780
Hunting is a man's instinct.

521
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:06,530
You might be tall but you are far from being a man.

522
00:54:06,530 --> 00:54:11,270
Today, you have to catch 10 fish. Otherwise, you can't go home, okay?

523
00:54:12,070 --> 00:54:13,730
Okay.

524
00:54:36,710 --> 00:54:38,920
Do you want some?

525
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:40,660
No!

526
00:54:42,220 --> 00:54:45,930
Tell me the truth. You've fished before, right?

527
00:54:45,930 --> 00:54:47,530
How come you are so good at fishing?

528
00:54:47,530 --> 00:54:51,750
Hunting is a man's instinct, isn't it?

529
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:56,190
Isn't fishing fun?

530
00:54:56,190 --> 00:54:58,510
Let's come back after your college entrance exam.

531
00:54:58,510 --> 00:55:00,850
Okay.

532
00:55:00,850 --> 00:55:06,280
But you... applying to the police academy...

533
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:08,220
Don't you regret it?

534
00:55:10,790 --> 00:55:13,890
Your life is at stake, so you should think carefully.

535
00:55:14,910 --> 00:55:18,690
The way I see it, your personality isn't really suited for it.

536
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:21,870
I can endure it...

537
00:55:21,870 --> 00:55:24,280
Until I catch the killer.

538
00:55:25,180 --> 00:55:28,240
I told you to trust Uncle.

539
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:33,130
I'll catch the killer no matter what. Just wait a bit more.

540
00:55:34,370 --> 00:55:36,520
I'll catch him for sure.

541
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:45,810
I'm sorry, Jin Gyeom.

542
00:56:03,570 --> 00:56:05,550
You...

543
00:56:06,450 --> 00:56:09,400
Why don't you have a cop's sixth sense?

544
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:11,290
I brought you here to kill you.

545
00:56:11,290 --> 00:56:15,280
Why are you not doing anything?!  Why aren't you doing anything when I am pointing a gun at you?

546
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:20,560
Because it's you.

547
00:56:23,450 --> 00:56:25,670
You're not the culprit.

548
00:56:28,090 --> 00:56:30,870
You can't be the culprit.

549
00:56:32,570 --> 00:56:37,850
You told me...

550
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:40,950
you would catch the culprit for me.

551
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:53,890
Mister.

552
00:56:57,560 --> 00:56:59,960
Mister!

553
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:02,530
I'm sorry I made you wait so long.

554
00:57:02,530 --> 00:57:05,670
I'll keep the promise I made 10 years ago.

555
00:57:05,670 --> 00:57:09,620
I'll catch the culprit who killed your mom no matter what.

556
00:57:09,620 --> 00:57:10,490
Mister.

557
00:57:10,490 --> 00:57:14,900
Please take care of my wife while I am gone.

558
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:16,500
What are you thinking?

559
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:19,070
Stay here like this until tomorrow morning.

560
00:57:19,070 --> 00:57:22,000
Mister. Mister!

561
00:57:25,170 --> 00:57:27,290
Mister!

562
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:35,920
No.

563
00:57:47,170 --> 00:57:51,490
Yes. I got rid of Park Jin Gyeom.

564
00:57:53,250 --> 00:57:57,210
I found out something new about Park Jin Gyeom.

565
00:57:57,210 --> 00:57:59,500
I would like to meet you right now, Sir.

566
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:03,510
Yes, I'll see you there.

567
00:58:22,820 --> 00:58:25,500
 The call cannot be completed...

568
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:28,140
Why isn't he picking up?

569
00:59:31,310 --> 00:59:33,300
How come you are here?

570
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:36,320
Where is the lieutenant?

571
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:40,800
What did you do to the lieutenant?  What have you done to him?

572
00:59:42,230 --> 00:59:45,820
Hurry up and leave. If you stay here, you'll die.

573
00:59:45,820 --> 00:59:48,020
The lieutenant trusted you.

574
00:59:48,020 --> 00:59:52,590
He trusted you even when he knew what kind of person you are.  How can you think about killing him?

575
00:59:52,590 --> 00:59:57,060
Jin Gyeom is like a son to me. Why would I kill him?

576
01:00:02,550 --> 01:00:05,340
If you want Jin Gyeom to live, keep quiet.

577
01:00:07,350 --> 01:00:10,060
Yes, I've arrived.

578
01:00:10,060 --> 01:00:11,700
But why are you still not here?

579
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:16,470
  Did you think you could save Park Jin Gyeom by doing this?

580
01:00:19,490 --> 01:00:22,720
 This matter is out of my hands now.

581
01:00:31,540 --> 01:00:33,360
Teacher.

582
01:00:44,530 --> 01:00:47,730
Because of the choice you made today,

583
01:00:47,730 --> 01:00:52,130
you will lose both your wife and Park Jin Gyeom.

584
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:34,260
What are you doing here?

585
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:45,890
I didn't know that Mr. Go Hyeong Seok had this much affection for you.

586
01:01:46,690 --> 01:01:48,780
It was you.

587
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:52,600
From what point was it?

588
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:55,790
Since when were you lying?

589
01:01:57,860 --> 01:02:01,160
Your mother asked me exactly the same question.

590
01:02:30,450 --> 01:02:37,430

591
01:02:38,810 --> 01:02:43,760
♫  At the end of the road  ♫

592
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:48,550
♫  At the end of the voyage until the day we meet again  ♫

593
01:02:48,550 --> 01:02:53,420
♫  Can't keep it inside  ♫

594
01:02:53,420 --> 01:02:59,010
♫  The heat entangled inside me is rising  ♫

595
01:02:59,010 --> 01:03:00,260
♫  Yeah  ♫

596
01:03:00,260 --> 01:03:05,220
♫  When the rainstorm blocks my path, a small light protects me  ♫

597
01:03:05,230 --> 01:03:07,330

♫  That light slowly grows  ♫

598
01:03:07,330 --> 01:03:09,700
 Someone is trying to kill Park Jin Gyeom.

599
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:11,900
 Yoon Tae Yi's memories have started to come back.

600
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:14,040
  I've met your mother here.

601
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:15,970
  Now we can finally find the last page.

602
01:03:15,970 --> 01:03:19,900
  I'm curious if you can save your son this time, too.

603
01:03:19,900 --> 01:03:24,000
♫  When the rainstorm blocks my path, a small light protects me  ♫
