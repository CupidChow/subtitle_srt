1
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:35,660
 "Do not look mournfully into the past.  For it does not come back.

2
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:40,150
 Wisely improve the present. For it is yours. Go forth to meet the shadowy future. Without fear." - Henry Wadsworth Longfellow -

3
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:46,850
What is "The Book of Prophecy?"

4
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,400
You are her son.

5
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:53,510
Yet, you don't even know that?

6
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:57,130
Did my mother die because of that?

7
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:59,720
What is written in it?

8
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,060
The end.

9
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:04,310
"The end?"

10
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:08,040
That's right.

11
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:11,910
The end of time travel.

12
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:15,020
Please speak in a way I can understand.

13
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:19,060
I didn't see it clearly myself so that's all I know.

14
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:25,000
Because Teacher told me not to look at the contents.

15
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,330

Who is Teacher?

16
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:37,290
Why are you looking for Teacher?

17
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:39,440
Just tell me who he is.

18
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:45,390
Do you think I will tell you?  Besides, you can't find Teacher.

19
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:53,230
Whether Teacher is female or male, or how old he/she is, no one knows.

20
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:58,060
But I know because I met Teacher in person.

21
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:05,380
Did you ask my mother why she was looking for Teacher?

22
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:09,290
She said it was because of her son.

23
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,440

24
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,860
Jin Gyeom!

25
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,900
I told you to just go.

26
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,400
It's not him?

27
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,460
That's such a relief.

28
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:29,990
Then, did you find out why your mother visited him?

29
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:31,440
No.

30
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:36,610
Do you know which police jurisdiction arrested him?

31
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:38,850
It was the Songpa's police jurisdiction.

32
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:40,980

33
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:49,370

34
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:53,340
Why are you investigating this?

35
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,600
I am not sure either but I think it is related to my mom.

36
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:05,370
Do you know him?

37
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:11,100
 It looks like we can't let you live.

38
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,880
Isn't this that punk?

39
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,270
Why is he in the picture from 1992?

40
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,730
Are you sure this picture is from 1992?

41
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:27,930
It doesn't make any sense.

42
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:31,080
If we catch him,  the cases we were unable to solve...

43
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:35,830
Yang Hong Seop murder case, Hong Eun Soo kidnapping case, and Jung Gi Hoon's murder,

44
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:40,030
we might be able to solve them all.

45
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:42,680
And...  my mother's murder as well.

46
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,050

47
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:55,920
Why is Park Jin Gyeom investigating 1992 cases all of a sudden?

48
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,960
Is there a possibility that someone provided information to Park Jin Gyeom?

49
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:04,460
There are only a few people who know about the 1992 cases.  Who would provide the information?

50
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:11,370
It wouldn't be related to Tae Yi, would it?

51
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:14,980
Like you said, only a few people know, but Tae Yi is one of those people.

52
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:17,940
There's no reason Tae Yi would betray us.

53
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:26,760
First, monitor Park Jin Gyeom and find out who he meets.

54
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,960
I understand.

55
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:41,950

56
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:53,980
I must've fallen asleep because I was tired.

57
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:59,840
I slept for just 10 minutes. When did you get here?

58
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,470
It's been an hour and 25 minutes.

59
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,810
Did you find anything?

60
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:10,470
Yes. I did, but

61
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:16,100
did you come empty handed? How could you not bring anything when you know I've been staying in the lab all day?

62
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:19,280
I'm hungry and I want some coffee.

63
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,460
I'll bring some later, so please tell me what you've found.

64
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:25,360
Then I'll tell you later.

65
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,940
I'm so hungry I don't have the strength to explain. Maybe if I had some bread...

66
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,800
What kind of bread should I buy?

67
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:38,600
Just buy anything. I like all breads, except the ones I dislike.

68
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,360
So interesting...

69
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:12,300
How did you pick only the breads that I liked?

70
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:15,870
Thank you. I'll enjoy it!

71
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,110
Now, could you let me know what you've found?

72
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:31,690
Before that, promise me this one thing.

73
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:35,520
Don't tell anyone what I'm about to tell you today.

74
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,870
When I left the laboratory, I signed a confidentiality agreement.

75
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:43,130
If this gets out, I'll be blacklisted.

76
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:52,460
Hawking proved in his hypothesis, "Chronology Protection Conjecture,"

77
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:58,190
that time traveling was impossible. However, there was a condition to this statement.

78
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:02,650
If negative energy exists, then time travel is possible.

79
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:06,990
That is why I was researching the Dirac Sea.

80
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:11,880
Can you tell me what exactly that is?

81
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,100
Hawking's hypothesis?

82
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:17,620
No, the Dirac... Sea?

83
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:24,080
Why don't you know that? Then, do you also not know the Dirac equation?

84
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,990
How could you not know what that is?

85
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:36,270
Then, I'll try to explain it in layman's terms.

86
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:41,240
All masses move in the direction in which energy is exerted.

87
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:46,430
But negative energy moves in the direction opposite to applied force.

88
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:51,520
My research was using negative energy to open a wormhole.

89
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,850
This was the command program I wrote during that research.

90
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:56,300
But...

91
00:07:56,770 --> 00:08:01,460
In the card that you gave me, there was a similar program.

92
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:07,440
Of course, I know this doesn't make sense and it can't explain with logic,

93
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:13,740
but a program similar to the one I was researching is inside this card.

94
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,780
Did you research this alone?

95
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:21,210
No. A team of 5 people researched this together, but Seok Oh Won was the head researcher.

96
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:24,140
At the time, he was a senior researcher.

97
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:27,080
How did you become a part of that team?

98
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:32,250
Director Seok came to my school and asked me to join his research team.

99
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,040
When?

100
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:41,580
Do you know that we had a super blood moon back in 2010?

101
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:44,190
Yes.

102
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:47,340
We met on that day, at an event.

103
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,640
What's the matter?

104
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:06,050
I'm sorry. I don't think I can keep it a secret as I promised.

105
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:10,090
What are you– Lieutenant!

106
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:32,720
How did you come here?

107
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,330
You approached Professor Yoon intentionally. Didn't you?

108
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:39,290
What's the research you did with Professor Yoon?

109
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:44,390
What does it have to do with my mother's death?

110
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:46,540
My apologies.

111
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,920
I cannot tell you yet.

112
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:55,000
You are a very important person to me. But even if I told you now, it'd be difficult for you to believe.

113
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,880
I was the same, 10 years ago.

114
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,530
Ten years ago?

115
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:01,540
Do you like cats, by chance?

116
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:06,890
Research a case involving Schrödinger's cat. Then you'll believe me.

117
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:11,510
Stop playing word games with me and just answer my question.

118
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:14,040
What are you doing?

119
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,290
Lieutenant!

120
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:22,050
Listen to me carefully. I don't know with what purpose you're doing this,

121
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:25,800
but if I find even the slightest suspicious thing,

122
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:29,230
I will arrest you first.

123
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,920
I'm sorry, Director.

124
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,740
It's all right.

125
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:04,930
Why do you always get so angry whenever you see the director?

126
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:06,820
If I didn't stop you, you would have hit him.

127
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:11,090
Are you a thug?  You are a lieutenant.

128
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:14,500
I understand that you want to catch your mother's killer, but—

129
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,140
You can't understand, Professor.

130
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:22,630
I became a lieutenant to catch my mother's killer and I have investigated it for 10 years.

131
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:29,700
But now, I don't know who my mother was anymore, let alone the killer.

132
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,730
The more I dig into my mother's death,

133
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:37,650
the less I seem to know who she was.

134
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,540
That's why I am afraid and

135
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:46,050
I want to know more.

136
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:52,260
Why are you drinking water when you are talking about something like this?

137
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:56,180
Would you like a drink?

138
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:58,310
No, I am fine.

139
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:01,080
And I need to take you home.

140
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:10,720
I'll do whatever it takes to figure out how to use the card, so cheer up.

141
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,890

142
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:28,140

143
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:31,890
Is your audio broken?  Why isn't any music playing?

144
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:34,450
I don't have any music because I don't listen to any.

145
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:35,890
Then, do you listen to the radio?

146
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:38,170
I don't listen to the radio, either.

147
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:40,390
Then, what do you do while you drive?

148
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:42,110
I drive.

149
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:54,230
Here. My teaching assistant gave it to me but I will give it to you as a gift.

150
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:56,640
There are a lot of pop songs.

151
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,240
I really don't listen.  Please keep it, Professor.

152
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:02,660
It's because you don't even listen to music, that you don't have emotions.

153
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:04,950
Even if you have to force yourself, please listen.

154
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:18,010
♫  Far away, I feel you shooting star  ♫

155
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:25,710
♫  I'm looking at you today  ♫

156
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:33,050
♫  It's a blur in my memory  ♫

157
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:36,560
♫  It's just your breath  ♫

158
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:41,830
Based on the record, Lee Se Hoon's legs were completely fine immediately before the crime.

159
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:46,000
But when he got arrested, his ankle was cut off.

160
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,920
What's even more absurd is that the ankle that had been cut

161
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:52,580
had healed cleanly as if it was cut a long time ago.

162
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,630
Isn't that strange?

163
00:13:56,350 --> 00:14:00,920
Then, why don't we meet the detective who was in charge at that time?

164
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,940
Ah, Lee Se Hoon?  Of course, I remember.

165
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:06,930
It's a case you supervised 30 years ago, but you still remember his name.

166
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:10,230
It's because he is the oddest of the ones I arrested.

167
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:13,570
He didn't have any identification card and his fingerprints were not in the database, either.

168
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:15,930
On top of that, he never said anything.

169
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:21,540
That's why we tried to find his accomplices that ran away but we were not successful.

170
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,520
His accomplices?

171
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:29,260
Other than this person, was there someone else?

172
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:32,180
There was a woman.

173
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:41,300
I said I am not having lunch.  I am going out to an interview.

174
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,030
I am ending the call.

175
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:45,720
Ah, really!

176
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:51,010
Jin Gyeom!  What brings you here?

177
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:57,310
Oh my!  Are you finally being nice to me?

178
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:59,830
You've matured.

179
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:02,000
I came because I have a favor to ask.

180
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,700
I need more information on the murder committed by Lee Se Hoon.

181
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,280
Can you search for any news articles?

182
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,840
That's not difficult.

183
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:13,620
And... you know Schrödinger's cat, don't you?

184
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:17,880
Please look for news articles about murder cases that have a similar pattern to Schrödinger's cat.

185
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,050
Why?

186
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:20,910
Just... something's bothering me.

187
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:23,810
I can't do it for free.  Buy me lunch.

188
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:24,920
I already ate.

189
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,130
Then eat tomorrow's lunch today.

190
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:29,380
What are you going to buy me?

191
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:38,250
Where is this music coming from?

192
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,450
It's from my car.

193
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:45,990
Is it related to a case?  Like evidence?

194
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:47,270
No.

195
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:49,410
Then, why are you listening to music?

196
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:51,140
Someone gave it to me.

197
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:52,610
Who?

198
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:54,440
Professor Yoon.

199
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:57,130
Why would that woman give you this?

200
00:15:57,130 --> 00:15:59,730
And... are you still seeing her?

201
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:03,250
We met because I had asked for a favor. It doesn't concern you.

202
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:06,770
Even the fact that you are listening to music makes me concerned.  Don't listen to music.

203
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:10,800
I am going to return this to her, so you can forget it.

204
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,650
You got that?

205
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:20,880
What is a lowly person like you doing at this noble place?

206
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,200
What favor did Jin Gyeom ask you for?

207
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,420
Why would you ask me that?  You should ask Lieutenant Park.

208
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,170
He wouldn't tell me.  That's why I am here.

209
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:30,080
It must be a secret.

210
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,700
Then I can't tell you, either.

211
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:36,130
Why in the world did you give this to Jin Gyeom?

212
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,420
Are you shooting a morning drama now?

213
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:44,480
That's probably why I curse whenever I see you.

214
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:49,110
Be careful what you say.  I am not interested in Lieutenant Park.

215
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:51,530
I really can't understand.

216
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:54,340
Why would you be interested in a man like him?

217
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:59,770
You don't seem to know.  Jin Gyeom is different when we are alone.

218
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:03,980
He is so sweet that I am worried that I might become diabetic.

219
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:08,270

220
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:12,360
Oh!  It's Jin Gyeom!

221
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,560
Hello?

222
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:17,180
 Hey, Reporter Kim! Where are you?

223
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:20,940
What do you think?  I came to return the USB to Professor Yoon, of course.

224
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,450
 What the heck are you saying?

225
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:25,260
I will call you later.

226
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:37,630

227
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:40,330

228
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:43,170
What happened?

229
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:45,690
The time card Park Jin Gyeom has sent a signal.

230
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,340
The location?

231
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:49,410
Hanguk University Joint Research Lab.

232
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:51,350
Send the drone.

233
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:57,380

234
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,860

235
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:15,100
I said I am going.

236
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:19,060
If I get into an accident because I'm rushing around for you, are you going to take responsibility?

237
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:30,830

238
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:38,790
Yeah?

239
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:41,320
Hey, I just saw that man.

240
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,880
- Who? 
 - The man who was in the picture from 1992.

241
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:47,900
Where are you?

242
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:50,630

243
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,940

244
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,830
Yoon Tae Yi!

245
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:48,160
 You are the woman I love the most in the world.

246
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,670
 Yeah?

247
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:59,470
Who are you?

248
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,330
I will go quietly so move.

249
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:39,190
You can't leave until you give back the card.

250
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,860
Professor, please leave.

251
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:10,000
Lieutenant.

252
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,810
It's okay so you go out first!

253
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,340
Are you okay, Mr. Yoo?

254
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:51,190
Let her go.

255
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,480
Let her go!

256
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:21,350
She is not at all related to this.

257
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,500
Just don't mess with Professor.

258
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,810
Let's go.

259
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:55,600
Mr. Yoo!

260
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,810
Professor!

261
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:10,070
Professor, are you all right?

262
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:24,440
 Min Hyeok...

263
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:27,480
 I've gotten a second heart.

264
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:31,630
 It's smaller and weaker than mine, but I can feel it.

265
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:34,010
 The beating of my child's heart.

266
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:37,790
 Like you chose Alice,

267
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:41,240
 I'm choosing the future of my child.

268
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:43,110
 I'm going to raise him well.

269
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:46,510
 I'm a mother now.

270
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:51,990
 Where's "The Book of Prophecy?"

271
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:55,470
 Did Tae Yi take it?

272
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:58,070
 No.

273
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:00,870
 Lee Se Hoon wouldn't give it up.

274
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:03,140
 I see. You should get back.

275
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,970
 I'm going to return after I find Tae Yi.

276
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:09,100
 At least you should return, and report that Tae Yi went missing after a small accident.

277
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,810
 I'll remain here and look for Tae Yi.

278
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:15,300
 Tae Yi, before she's your girlfriend,

279
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:17,370
 she is my friend.

280
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:23,420
 Given that he left after he got the card,

281
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:27,650
it seems like he won't be trying to harm you anymore.

282
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:30,860
Still, in case you see another drone

283
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:33,480
or anything weird happens,

284
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,990
please contact me.

285
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:40,540
What do we do about the card?

286
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:43,130
It's your mother's keepsake.

287
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:45,540
I'm all right.

288
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:47,170
Please don't worry.

289
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:49,940
How could I not worry?

290
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:52,930
You got the card stolen because of me.

291
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:55,490
To be honest, that's true,

292
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:57,060
but it's all right.

293
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,910
Please, don't worry.

294
00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:04,020
Lieutenant, you seem like a quite stoic person.

295
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:07,680
But when I'm with you, I feel strangely comfortable.

296
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,490
Me?

297
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:11,060
Yes.

298
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:14,030
Anyways, thank you so much for today.

299
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:16,020
In many ways.

300
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,470
Please get home safely.

301
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,960

302
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:37,680
It's nothing much.

303
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:41,460
My sister says she'll be late because of a company dinner.

304
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:46,050
 I'm scared of being here alone, so come home quick!

305
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:49,010
I'll get going then.

306
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:57,070
Aren't you hungry?

307
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,570
Would you like some dinner before leaving?

308
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:07,370
Never mind. Bye.

309
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:15,830
If it wouldn't be a burden, could I eat dinner here?

310
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,910
I slept in late today.

311
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:31,230
It's a bit messy, right?

312
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:35,120
Yes. It is messy.

313
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,490
But it's not too messy.

314
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:42,430
Just a little.

315
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:48,220
Do you like spaghetti?

316
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:51,200
I'm really good at making spaghetti.

317
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:00,340
Is this rapokki? 
  (T/N: A combination of 'ramen' and spicy rice cakes.)

318
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:02,600
It looks just like spaghetti!

319
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:06,370
Earlier, didn't you say you were good at cooking?

320
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:08,900
Say that after you try it.

321
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:28,190
Lieutenant, you're a picky eater. Right?

322
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:31,640
For some reason, I feel like you would've complained about your food.

323
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,790
Your mother must've struggled a lot.

324
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:38,210
My mother was a great cook.

325
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:41,440
Like you.

326
00:27:57,430 --> 00:28:00,950
By chance, was that someone you knew?

327
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:02,560
The man who took the card.

328
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:05,170
No. It was my first time seeing him.

329
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:06,190
Why?

330
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:08,780
It seemed like he recognized you.

331
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:11,600
No way.

332
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:15,320
But... who are those people?

333
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:19,330
Now, you shouldn't worry about them.

334
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:21,360
What does that mean?

335
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:26,530
If you keep helping me, events like today may happen again.

336
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,780
Are you worrying about me?

337
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:34,030
Yes, so please forget it all now.

338
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:37,380
Forget about the things related to the time card and time travel.

339
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:41,040
Today's event, as well.

340
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:43,880
Why do you worry about me so much?

341
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:48,450
Earlier, you even gave up your mother's keepsake because of me.

342
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,820
I'm not sure.

343
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:54,430
What do you mean you're not sure?

344
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:59,470
Is it because you have alexithymia?

345
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:02,720
I looked into it,

346
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:06,620
but they said people who lack emotions don't even know if they like someone.

347
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,720
Is that true?

348
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,270
Let's stop talking about me.

349
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:13,640
Then what if, really just what if...

350
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:17,180
Um... that someone has feelings for you.

351
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:20,230
Can you catch on to that?

352
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:23,480
I'm not that dense.

353
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:27,580
But... why are you asking me about that?

354
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:32,250
The fact that you're asking me that means you're dense.

355
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,580
 The person you are trying to call...

356
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:45,530
- Dammit! 
 - The person you are trying to call...

357
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,630
Who is making my daughter-in-law so angry?

358
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:52,060
I'm not going to be your daughter-in-law.

359
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:55,300
- Why not? 
 - I think Jin Gyeom's cheating on me.

360
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,390
Huh!

361
00:29:57,390 --> 00:29:59,130
I'm being serious!

362
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,990
Really?

363
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,400
With who?

364
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,520
Yoon Tae Yi!

365
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:18,270
- So frustrating! 
 - What?

366
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:21,010
Do you really like that person?

367
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:22,800
I don't!

368
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,730
Why would I like someone who has alexithymia?

369
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:27,270
Who has alexithymia? That lieutenant?

370
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:28,630
No, no.

371
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:30,730
That's what you just said! That he has alexithymia.

372
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:32,810
When did I say that?

373
00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:34,540
I said aspermia.
  (T/N: From the previous episode, both aspermia and alexithemia sound similar in Korean)

374
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:37,990
Aspermia? Oh no.

375
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:42,470
I mean, how did you know that?

376
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:45,140
Did you two already go that far?

377
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:47,080
Are you crazy?

378
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:57,320
Did you find out anything about the card?

379
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:00,630
It's hard to explain. But the program inside the card,

380
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:04,000
I made a duplicate without Lieutenant Park knowing.

381
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,940
Something was bothering me about it. Do you want to take a look at it?

382
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:26,130
 I'll be right back.

383
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:43,360
I think the physics professor that was with Park Jin Gyeom

384
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,460
copied the program contents of the time card.

385
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:49,770
I'll look into it. Don't report it for now.

386
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,600
Because that professor...

387
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:55,570
is Tae Yi's past?

388
00:31:55,570 --> 00:31:59,230
- Don't think of anything stupid. 
 - That's what I should be saying to you.

389
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:01,390
That woman is not your girlfriend.

390
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:05,170
- She's a person of the past, that has nothing to do with us. 
 - Even if you don't tell me,

391
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:07,720
I know that better than anyone else.

392
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:11,150
To be honest,

393
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:16,250
I thought it was weird for our clients to time travel for the purpose of meeting people of the past.

394
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:20,380
It's not like I don't understand where they're coming from,

395
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:23,700
but the people they meet here are neither their real family

396
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:26,190
nor their real lovers.

397
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:32,430
So you should also keep that in mind. Alice was created in a parallel universe.

398
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:35,190
The person you met today

399
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:37,990
is just a different woman from another dimension.

400
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:41,140
Since her age and background differ, so will her personality.

401
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:43,410
So just forget her.

402
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:46,380
I'm the one that brought back the card.

403
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,040
You said someone copied it.

404
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,160
That's also my responsibility.

405
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:53,510
Min Hyeok.

406
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:56,760
Going back to the school is dangerous.

407
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:59,460
I'll be careful. Thanks.

408
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,460
Why aren't you going to work?

409
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:16,710
Oh... I took a leave of absence.

410
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:18,000
Why?

411
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,280
About that... I'm considering resigning.

412
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:27,240
I don't think I'm suitable for it. It's so stressful dealing with people in a warehouse.

413
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:33,050
Why aren't you saying anything?

414
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:38,620
It's your work, so you should evaluate the situation and make decisions. What can I say?

415
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:40,330
You just...

416
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:43,960
need to take responsibility for your actions.

417
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:46,850
But if I were to give you my advice as your sister,

418
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:51,040
I think it wouldn't be a bad idea to quit if it really doesn't suit you.

419
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,580
As expected, my sister is so cool.

420
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:56,550
Can you lend me just a bit of money?

421
00:33:56,550 --> 00:34:00,350
I'm worried I'll need the funds for the time after I resign.

422
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:04,090
Hey. Who works these days based on suitability?

423
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:06,290
Everyone just endures it and works to make a living!

424
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:09,690
If you resign, I'm telling Mom.

425
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,730
What are you looking at?

426
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:19,220
Have you never seen someone who doesn't want to lend their younger sister money?

427
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:24,820
Were you dumped? Why are you eating so much?

428
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:26,930
This crazy–

429
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:31,310
Why? Did I get fat?

430
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:40,720
Is the daughter the only family of the victim?

431
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:43,780
Yes, his wife must have passed away while giving birth.

432
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:45,730
Where is this daughter?

433
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:48,600
I heard she went to live with her extended family after her father died.

434
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,860
I'm not sure who that may be.

435
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:59,730
 There are no murder cases with the keyword Schrödinger's cat, Mr. Lieutenant.

436
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:03,210
- Who is that? 
 - Do Yeon.

437
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:05,520
I think she's mad at me.

438
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:09,360
- Why? 
 - I'm not sure.

439
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:14,000
 Thank you, Reporter Kim.

440
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:16,080
How rude!

441
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:21,630
- What? 
 - You just said that to yourself, right?

442
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:23,380
No!

443
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,820
Can we...

444
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,990
speak for a moment?

445
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,490

446
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:23,010
Hello?

447
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,230
Professor?

448
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:29,950

449
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:38,740
Did you copy the time card program?

450
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,020
Please erase it.

451
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:45,990
This is my final warning.

452
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:53,860

453
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:56,050
What... What's your identity?

454
00:36:56,050 --> 00:36:59,730
Don't try to know more and stop meeting with Park Jin Gyeom.

455
00:36:59,730 --> 00:37:03,230
You could be in danger because of him.

456
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:05,650
I came...

457
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,960
to say this.

458
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:18,220
Can you track a location?

459
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:19,960
By chance...

460
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:23,210
have we met before?

461
00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:25,430
You look familiar.

462
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:30,110
No.

463
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:33,050
There's no way that'd be possible.

464
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:37,290
Please, take what I've said seriously.

465
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:40,230
Don't stay close to Park Jin Gyeom.

466
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:43,530
If I've caused you fear,

467
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:46,300
I apologize.

468
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:19,020
I've seen you so often I think I've become fond of you.

469
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:30,720
Are you okay?

470
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:33,090
I...

471
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:35,410
met that person.

472
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:38,330
The person who took the card.

473
00:38:38,330 --> 00:38:40,420
Where did he go?

474
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:29,550
Let him go.

475
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:48,510
I'll just leave. Don't touch me.

476
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:51,020
You must not have a gun today.

477
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:49,610
Why do you look the same as in this picture that was taken 29 years ago?

478
00:40:53,810 --> 00:40:55,550
Are you smiling?

479
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:59,820
Haven't you already caught on to who we are?

480
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:01,820
What's the reason you went to the year 1992?

481
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:03,660
What's the reason you're looking into that?

482
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:08,360
I need to find out what you're doing here.

483
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:14,020
Have you ever lost someone you loved?

484
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:19,830
It's an experience as painful as death.

485
00:41:21,090 --> 00:41:26,420
Crossing over the threshold of time frees a person from that pain.

486
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:32,990
Let's just say... We're just people who help those on their paths to healing from that pain.

487
00:41:38,270 --> 00:41:42,680
Does killing others heal your suffering?

488
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:50,410
We look like criminals to you, don't we?

489
00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:53,900
But like you, I'm just doing what I must.

490
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:59,910
Like you protect your people, I'm protecting those who are like me.

491
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:02,350
I don't protect murderers.

492
00:42:02,350 --> 00:42:08,790
No. If you were in my shoes, you would've acted like me.

493
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:17,630
The person in the interrogation room is the person from the 1992 picture, right?

494
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:20,760
What happened?

495
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:23,510
Who the hell is that?

496
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:25,230
We're still investigating that.

497
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:26,810
Did you not take his fingerprint?

498
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:30,300
I did, but no fingerprint matches his.

499
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:31,940
What?

500
00:42:33,930 --> 00:42:36,440
Are you okay?

501
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:40,230
Oh, of course. This is nothing.

502
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:42,460
It's totally fine!

503
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:44,640
I heard you got beat up.

504
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:45,920
Who said that?

505
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:50,490
Beat up? This was just a man to man battle.

506
00:42:53,310 --> 00:42:55,850

507
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:00,480

508
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:03,470

509
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:14,120
Thank you.

510
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,430
What happened? Did you figure out who he is?

511
00:43:38,430 --> 00:43:41,830
What's the reason he returned?

512
00:43:41,830 --> 00:43:43,970
Maybe because of my copy...

513
00:43:43,970 --> 00:43:46,660
What copy?

514
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:52,820
The program inside the card. I copied it.

515
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:54,820
Professor.

516
00:43:56,250 --> 00:43:57,680
Where is it?

517
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:01,120
I don't have it. I gave it to someone I knew.

518
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:04,060
That person could also be in danger.

519
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:06,410
- Please contact her immediately. 
 - Okay.

520
00:44:12,510 --> 00:44:14,700
 The person you are trying to call...

521
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:17,140
H-Her phone is turned off.

522
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:20,870
She's someone who tends to leave it off when she's focusing on something,

523
00:44:20,870 --> 00:44:23,130
so I'll just leave a message.

524
00:44:30,330 --> 00:44:35,940

525
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:37,860
 Do you like cats, by chance?

526
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:43,380
 Look into a case related to the Schrödinger's cat. Then you'll believe me.

527
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:44,000
Yes, I understand.

528
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,310
They say she left work an hour ago.

529
00:45:47,310 --> 00:45:48,820
Do you know where she lives?

530
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:52,230
Yes. It's near the laboratory.

531
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:02,600
It's here.

532
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:12,850
Stay out here.

533
00:46:12,850 --> 00:46:14,480
Okay.

534
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:39,960
What is that?

535
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:45,940
What is it?

536
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:47,820
Let go.

537
00:47:49,970 --> 00:47:52,410
Let me go!

538
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:56,670
Why?

539
00:47:56,670 --> 00:47:58,390
- Please stop that. 
 - Let go!

540
00:47:58,390 --> 00:47:59,910
Move out of the way!

541
00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:01,180
What is it?

542
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:03,450
Professor, please!

543
00:48:10,310 --> 00:48:12,280
Don't look at it.

544
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:42,000
Who is that? Is he our client?

545
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,580
No. He's not our client.

546
00:48:44,580 --> 00:48:46,320
How did he go there?

547
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:48,640
I'm looking into it.

548
00:48:50,850 --> 00:48:55,050
Bring Min Hyeok back. This is his specialty.

549
00:48:57,450 --> 00:48:59,000
What do you mean?

550
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:03,340
Even after killing a person, you claim you're not criminals?

551
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:04,750
Say it in a way I can understand.

552
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:09,790
Yang Hong Seop, who killed his brother's younger self. The mother who killed herself.

553
00:49:10,470 --> 00:49:12,560
Who's next?

554
00:49:19,610 --> 00:49:25,090
It's not something you guys can handle. We'll take care of it ourselves, so don't worry about it.

555
00:49:26,210 --> 00:49:28,100
Do you think you're above the law?

556
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:31,240
Listen to me. You can't win against us.

557
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:37,830
I'm not sure where you and your people are from, but this is 2020.

558
00:49:41,670 --> 00:49:44,130

559
00:49:44,130 --> 00:49:45,670

560
00:49:45,670 --> 00:49:47,680

561
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:50,280
Cause of death?

562
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:52,520
Asphyxia caused by hydrogen cyanide.

563
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:55,370
Hydrogen cyanide?

564
00:49:55,370 --> 00:49:57,250
- Do you mean prussic acid? 
 - Yes.

565
00:49:57,250 --> 00:50:00,610
We'll try to figure out the specifics by tomorrow.

566
00:50:00,610 --> 00:50:01,970
Have you identified him?

567
00:50:01,970 --> 00:50:06,590
He hasn't left a single thing. No hair or fingerprints.

568
00:50:06,590 --> 00:50:09,030
It's going to be a pain.

569
00:50:17,710 --> 00:50:19,470
What's this?

570
00:50:19,470 --> 00:50:21,150
Let's talk about that later.

571
00:50:21,150 --> 00:50:23,280
Do you know how surprised I was?

572
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:26,240
I thought you were the culprit, after seeing the article.

573
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:30,980
How did you do it? How did you look into it even before the case occurred?

574
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:33,700
Don't investigate this accident.

575
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:36,150
- Why? 
 - You could be in danger.

576
00:50:36,150 --> 00:50:38,510
Then it's okay for you to be in danger?

577
00:50:38,510 --> 00:50:39,420
I'm okay.

578
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:41,330
I'm not okay with it.

579
00:50:41,330 --> 00:50:43,440
If you're in danger, I'm not okay with it.

580
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:46,830
- Do Yeon– 
 - I'm not going to let it go this time.

581
00:50:46,830 --> 00:50:49,390
Explain it to me before I tell Mister about it.

582
00:50:49,390 --> 00:50:51,400
End of discussion.

583
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:10,640

584
00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:23,080

585
00:51:34,550 --> 00:51:37,060
How did you know?

586
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:39,750
Let's talk about this next time.

587
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:42,560
A researcher I held dear has died.

588
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:46,500
Then, why didn't you prevent it? If you held her dear, you should have prevented it.

589
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:52,030
Had I known, I would have prevented it, of course.

590
00:51:52,620 --> 00:51:55,860
But I didn't know either who was going to die.

591
00:51:57,790 --> 00:52:00,750
I've been trying to prevent such tragedies since ten years ago.

592
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:03,390
With your mother's help.

593
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:09,440
Did you see the suspect's face?

594
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:15,450
That person will kill four more people.

595
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:21,860
I know it's difficult to believe.

596
00:52:22,530 --> 00:52:24,090
I do.

597
00:52:24,090 --> 00:52:28,510
Because I also had a hard time believing your mother, at first.

598
00:52:28,510 --> 00:52:31,000
At that time, your mother told me about future events.

599
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:35,920
And as I saw these happen like she had said, I started to trust her.

600
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:38,790
Like you now.

601
00:52:39,610 --> 00:52:45,120
So are you saying that you and my mother knew the future

602
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:49,130
And that is why you know that four more people will die?

603
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:52,950
How?

604
00:52:52,950 --> 00:52:55,410
Because of someone's future...

605
00:52:56,490 --> 00:52:59,210
is someone else's past.

606
00:53:34,670 --> 00:53:37,200
Actually...

607
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:41,400
I don't have any friends.

608
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:47,260
Because I kept skipping grades,

609
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:50,950
around me were only the older students

610
00:53:50,950 --> 00:53:54,460
who were looking at me strangely.

611
00:53:57,350 --> 00:54:03,060
That's why I didn't have anyone

612
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:07,020
to freely pour out my worries to.

613
00:54:10,140 --> 00:54:14,260
Until I met Seo Jin at the research center, that is.

614
00:54:19,270 --> 00:54:21,640
It's my fault. Isn't it?

615
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:25,080
It's because I gave her the copy?

616
00:54:27,170 --> 00:54:31,360
If you're looking for someone to blame, it's mostly me.

617
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:34,980
Do you think whoever murdered her has anything to do...

618
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:37,780
with the man in prison?

619
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:40,010
I don't know yet.

620
00:54:40,010 --> 00:54:43,300
I will look into it some more.

621
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:49,460
Then I will take my leave now.

622
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:20,040
Why aren't you leaving?

623
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:24,260
Because I felt like I shouldn't.

624
00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:31,040
Thank you.

625
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:38,410
I am all right. You can go.

626
00:55:38,410 --> 00:55:42,660
I also have to stop by home for something, anyway.

627
00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:44,700
Then let's go together.

628
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:47,450
I'll take you there.

629
00:56:08,350 --> 00:56:14,100
♫  Far away, I feel you shooting star  ♫

630
00:56:15,490 --> 00:56:21,280
♫  I'm looking at your today  ♫

636
00:56:48,390 --> 00:56:51,020

637
00:56:51,020 --> 00:56:54,510
Thank you for today.

638
00:56:55,550 --> 00:57:01,570
