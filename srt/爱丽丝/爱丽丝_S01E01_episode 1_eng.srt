 "Any sufficiently advanced technology... 
is indistinguishable from magic."  - Arthur Clarke-

2
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:49,950

3
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,030
 We're time travelers.

4
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:33,920
 In 2050, our Alice finally succeeded in traveling through time.

5
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:39,020
 At the thought that we can meet our dead loved ones soon,

6
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:41,650

and the thought...

7
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:44,660
 that we could live a new life by going back in time,

8
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:47,220
 people became overjoyed.

9
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:53,880
 And so, time became fluid, and so did the world,

10
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,000
 and people's lives became that much richer.

11
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:01,040
 That is, until the book was discovered.

12
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,890
 The rumors say...

13
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:10,770
 that the book contains a tragic ending... to time traveling that had just started.

14
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:15,080
 People called the book,

15
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,760
 "The Book of Prophecy."

16
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:24,550
 I must find the book...

17
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:29,010
 in order to keep time traveling going.

18
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:35,300
 And that is why... I've arrived in 1992 today,

19
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:39,290
 to find... the book.

20
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,790

21
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:53,190
Baby, why are you crying?

22
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:56,350
Because the sky just roared.

23
00:03:56,350 --> 00:04:00,700
What a terrible sky that is.

24
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:16,100
Dad, what are you looking at?

25
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,200
Dad?

26
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:25,330
Do you want to play hide and seek?

27
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:28,730
Hide and seek? Are you the seeker?

28
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:31,400
This time, both you and I,

29
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,930
we'll both hide.

30
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:34,980
That sounds like fun.

31
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:38,730
You can go hide now.

32
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:43,070
Don't you come out until I tell you to, okay?

33
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,970
Hold on.

34
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:02,920
You can't lose this, okay?

35
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:07,260
Hold onto it tight, okay?  Promise me.

36
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,770
Dr. Jang Dong Shik. I'm here for the book.

37
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:38,980
So it begins. Did you come from 2050?

38
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:45,430
Shut it and hand over the book.

39
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:54,370
You can't handle it.

40
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,890
Drop the knife.

41
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:54,030
I found it.

42
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,000
Yes.

43
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:59,890
I will not read it.

44
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:03,980
Yes. I'll bring it right over. It's okay.

45
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:53,910
Give me the book.

46
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,080
Who sent you?

47
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,730
I'm Yoo Min Hyeok from Alice.

48
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:01,920
We'll take this book.

49
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:07,660
Just what is this book, that you're all obsessed with it?

50
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,770
Let's go.

51
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:51,560
Hold on.

52
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:58,380

53
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:04,950
I think someone's here.

54
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:07,360
Check upstairs. I'll check down here.

55
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,080
Okay.

56
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:37,590
Where is it? Where's the rest?

57
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:40,750
Tell me. Where's the rest?

58
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:43,020
Tell me!

59
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:00,020
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

60
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,900
It's okay now.

61
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:06,620
- What's your name? 
 - I don't know!

62
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,610
What is it? What are you doing?

63
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:28,720
Let the people of this world punish you for your crimes here.

64
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,320
The police are coming. Let's go.

65
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,210
She's in shock.

66
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:49,570
- We can't just leave her. 
 - But we can't take her.

67
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:52,160
The police here will take good care of her.

68
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,340
Fine.  I get it.

69
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:57,950
But at least until they arrive.

70
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:10,140
- Check over there. 
 - Okay.

71
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:13,740
It's okay.

72
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:19,040
I don't know...

73
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:36,290
You can't check the contents. That's the rule.

74
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:50,000

75
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:53,540
- Does it talk about the baby, too? 
 - Yeah.

76
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:55,220
It says she is recovering in a hospital.

77
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:57,980
Is that right?  That's a relief.

78
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:01,240
Let's hurry and get ready to return.

79
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:07,620
My stomach hasn't been feeling well. It must be because of the wormhole radiation.
  (T/N: A wormhole can be visualized as a tunnel with two ends at separate points in spacetime)

80
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:12,270
I haven't been able to eat anything since yesterday and I've been vomiting.

81
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:16,070
If it's that bad, why don't you take medication.

82
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:22,370
Why don't you at least pretend that you are worried about me?

83
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:34,840
I wanted to complete the mission perfectly, that's why.

84
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:41,570
I am sorry. The wormhole will be active until midnight tonight.

85
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:45,710
Let's go out.  If it's because of the radiation, it will be good to get some fresh air.

86
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:47,390
Don't mind me.

87
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:52,640
How could I not be concerned when you are the woman I love the most in the world?

88
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:57,040
Shall we go out after a shower?

89
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:01,190
Yes.

90
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:40,790
 Where should I begin?

91
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:48,500
 The tragedy... began as she opened the gate to time.

92
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:59,540
 Would nothing have happened if the baby did not go through the time portal?

93
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:05,350
 Would things have been different if the baby wasn't born?

94
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,740
Why?  Is your stomach still not feeling well?

95
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:21,370
Yeah, my stomach is not feeling well.

96
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:35,510
You're 12 weeks pregnant.  Didn't you know?

97
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:39,980
Get a prenatal examination then come back.

98
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,740
Ma'am?

99
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:52,560
You went through a wormhole filled with radiation while you were pregnant.

100
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:58,970
Let's be rational. If we are to return, we need to pass through the wormhole again. Then...

101
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:02,150
You could give birth to a really gruesome baby.

102
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:08,470
What if... What happens if I give birth here?

103
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:12,280
Don't be absurd. We've things to do at home. Get an abortion.

104
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,690
Things to do?

105
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:18,660
- Tae Yi, what I am saying isâ€” 
 - I am hungry.

106
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:25,980
I'll get an abortion. I will.

107
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:30,710
Before I abort, I want to at least feed it something tasty.

108
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:40,140
Yes?

109
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:44,310
I am a police officer.  Step out of the car, please.

110
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,220
I understand.

111
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,650
Requesting backup!

112
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,980
Surrounding the suspect.

113
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:58,050
Oh, no!

114
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:00,510
 What?

115
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,500

116
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:25,180
I will lose them.  Go back to the hotel first.

117
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:27,070
Be careful.

118
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,960
Tae Yi.

119
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:18,320
Yoon Tae Yi.

120
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:21,760
Tae Yi?

121
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:45,320
 Dear Min Hyuk, I now have another heart.

122
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:49,770
 It is smaller and weaker than mine, but I can feel it.

123
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:52,700
 The sound of my baby's heart...

124
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:58,430
 So, how can I abort it?  It's my baby.

125
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:03,000
 My baby that's alive and breathing inside of me.

126
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,990
 This is my choice.

127
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:10,600
 Just as you, Min Hyuk, have chosen Alice,

128
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:14,270
 I have chosen my baby's future.

129
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:21,280
 So, you don't need to worry.

130
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,940
 You don't need to be sorry either.

131
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:28,050
 I am no longer Yoon Tae Yi.

132
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:30,490

133
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:14,600

134
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:23,740
One more time!

135
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:45,400
 I will raise him well because I am... a mom.

136
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:06,650

137
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,740
Jin Gyeom!

138
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:25,070
What are you doing, Jin Gyeom?

139
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:27,120
I am playing with a dragonfly.

140
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,000
- A dragonfly? 
 - Yes.

141
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,970
- Should Mom play too? 
 - Sure.

142
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:49,270
Yes, Teacher.

143
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:55,470
I don't quite understand what you are saying...

144
00:22:55,470 --> 00:23:00,100
Yesterday, the boys played with the rabbits.

145
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:03,970
But Jin Gyeom said it's not fun and...

146
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:08,600
So... he cut a rabbit's ear.

147
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:21,220
When we tell someone not to tear a piece of paper, it's because it'd be a waste,

148
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:23,660
not because we feel sorry for the paper.

149
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:27,570
But Jin Gyeom isn't able to distinguish between these emotions.

150
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:31,090
 I'm certain he's lacking in social emotion.

151
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:34,230
 Fortunately, his cognitive ability is high,

152
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:37,650
 so it may be improved through repetitive learning.

153
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:40,440
What could be the cause?

154
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:43,300
Take a look at this for a moment.

155
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:47,840
His left frontal lobe, which is responsible for the control of emotions,

156
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,000
is smaller in Jin Gyeom than the average size.

157
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,390
We can't tell if this is due to genetics

158
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,830
or because of excessive stress caused on the child

159
00:23:55,830 --> 00:24:00,700
during the process of pregnancy and giving birth.

160
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:03,260
We can't be certain.

161
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:09,970
 While pregnant, you went through a wormhole that is filled with radiation.

162
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:13,720
You need to stay strong.

163
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:18,170
I'm not the only one responsible for Jin Gyeom's treatment. You're part of it, too.

164
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:20,560
No.

165
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,210
I don't need your help.

166
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:27,780
I'll take care of it on my own.

167
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:35,220
Trust me.

168
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:42,910
If it's for my Jin Gyeom, I can do anything.

169
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:52,010

170
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:59,780
Jin Gyeom, an appendectomy isn't anything major.

171
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:03,190
In one week, I can be discharged.

172
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:08,700
Could you go home and bring some books and clothes for tomorrow?

173
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:09,840
Why?

174
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:14,020
How can you stay alone at home? You should stay with me.

175
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:16,110
Just get some painkillers.

176
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:19,040
You said getting an appendectomy isn't a big deal.

177
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:27,310
It's noisy and uncomfortable here.

178
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:41,480
Jin Gyeom, let's eat.

179
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,040
Okay.

180
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:07,710
What are you doing? You should go to the hospital, too. Go and grab a jacket.

181
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:10,110
I have to go to school tomorrow.

182
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:17,010
Let's go. One, two!

183
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,990

184
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,940
Did you find anything?

185
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:14,830
What is there to find?

186
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:17,410
It was probably because of poor grades or a lover.

187
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:18,800
I heard they haven't even found a will yet.

188
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,200
These days, kids don't write suicide notes on paper.

189
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,190
They usually blog about it or something.

190
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:24,760
You don't know the trend.

191
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,350
Let's go.

192
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:34,460
Seong Eun didn't commit suicide.

193
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:37,770
What's your name?

194
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:39,060
Kim Do Yeon.

195
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:40,650
Do Yeon.

196
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:44,100
I'll call you if I need your help,

197
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:46,220
so you should just go study.

198
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:51,560
Seong Eun wasn't alone on the rooftop!

199
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,800
He pushed her off.

200
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,500
Who did that?

201
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:58,120
Jin Gyeom.

202
00:27:58,150 --> 00:28:00,680

203
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:07,880
Do you know the student who committed suicide?

204
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:11,230
Yes, we were in the same theater class.

205
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:12,930
Theater?

206
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:15,910
- Do you want to become an actor? 
 - No.

207
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:19,080
My mom is forcing me to take it, saying it'll be helpful.

208
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:22,940
- Helpful for what? 
 - It hasn't been helpful yet, so I'm not sure.

209
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:25,790
Ever since you were young, you've done a lot of sports.

210
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:28,440
My mom made me do sports.

211
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:36,450
Why were you on the rooftop?

212
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:38,180
Because the classroom was too noisy.

213
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:40,900
You were close to the student that committed suicide, right?

214
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:45,220
We would say hi to each other.

215
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:46,410
Then, why did you push her off?

216
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:47,690
I never pushed her.

217
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:49,200
Then, you must've seen her fall down.

218
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,310
You should be asking more clear questions.

219
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:55,880
I don't know what seeing her fall has to do with pushing her.

220
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:58,480
Where did you go after leaving the rooftop?

221
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,600
To the classroom.

222
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,070
Why?

223
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:04,190
You should've gone to the office and told the teachers.

224
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:08,040
I saw the police car coming, so I didn't think I needed to.

225
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,790
It wasn't because you wanted to hide that you were also on the rooftop?

226
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:13,460
There are kids who saw me coming down from there.

227
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:16,160
Would that be hidden just because I wanted to keep it a secret?

228
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:20,350
That's why I'm here right now.

229
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:33,360

230
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:45,340
Jin Gyeom.

231
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:04,500
I won't trust what other people say.

232
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:07,100
I'll only trust your words.

233
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:10,660
Did you do it?

234
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:14,100
Why does it matter whether or not you believe me?

235
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:17,480
That's the most important thing to me...

236
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,730
Because you are my son.

237
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,760
If you've done something wrong, I'll be punished alongside you;

238
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:31,040
and if you haven't done anything wrong, then I'll be sure to prove your innocence.

239
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:36,750
Did you do it?

240
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:41,510
No.

241
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:47,910
I knew it.

242
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:53,540
I'll definitely make sure that you get out of here.

243
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:43,960
Looking for witnesses!

244
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:46,560
Looking for witnesses!

245
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:50,550
If you know of the events that happened on October 5th, on the rooftop at Sejong High School,

246
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:52,460
please let me know.

247
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:55,240
Looking for witnesses.

248
00:31:55,240 --> 00:32:00,450
If you know of the events that happened on October 5th, on the rooftop at Sejong High School, please let me know!

249
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:04,700
Looking for witnesses!

250
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,560
Our Seong Eun!

251
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:10,070
He killed Seong Eun, but you're asking for what?

252
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:12,680
Bring back my daughter!

253
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:18,000
You think only your son is precious?! Mother of a murderer!

254
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:26,780

255
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:41,810
Hello?

256
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:43,980
I'm on my way.

257
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,930

258
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:49,900

259
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:34,490
- I'll be back! 
 - Wait! Wait! Have this before you leave.

260
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:37,790
Who is that woman?

261
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:40,200
The psycho's mom.

262
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,140
Be careful.

263
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:52,530
Lady! Did you make this mess?

264
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:56,590
I told you not to post that here! Why do you keep putting those flyers everywhere?

265
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:58,760
Goodness.

266
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,910
I'm sorry.

267
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:03,550
I'm going. I'm going.

268
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,060
I'm comingâ€“

269
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:09,400
Oh, wait a moment.

270
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:13,540
Excuse me. I saw it.

271
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:20,560
Over there.

272
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:26,050
From what I could see, the guy didn't push the girl.

273
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:30,810
It looked like he was trying to stop her from committing suicide.

274
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:56,030
I'm sorry, but it's our job to suspect people.

275
00:34:58,350 --> 00:35:03,110
Be good to your mother. She's been through a lot.

276
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,820
Psychopath.

277
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:13,840
He's a total psychopath.

278
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:18,680
You guys! What are you doing at someone else's house?

279
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:21,860
Hey, run, run! It's the psycho! Hurry!

280
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:26,090
What the hell is this? Jin Gyeom isn't like that!

281
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:46,890
I'll erase it, so you should head inside.

282
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:54,050

283
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:07,840
Why did you come back out?

284
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:12,300
That won't erase it. I'll paint over it later.

285
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:16,940
It's okay. I can do it. You should go back in.

286
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,320
Mom.

287
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:23,190
Whatever others think of me,

288
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:24,810
it doesn't bother me.

289
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:27,590
I told you to go back in.

290
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:29,980
But you're not the same.

291
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:35,610
You get hurt and feel pain.

292
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:42,740
I don't want to give you a hard time,

293
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,520
but I'm bad at that.

294
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:49,700
I'm sorry, Mom.

295
00:37:57,030 --> 00:38:01,150
My son is all grown up.

296
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:04,410
You're worrying about me now.

297
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:24,930
I was the one that reported you to the police.

298
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:27,030
So?

299
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:28,860
I wanted to apologize.

300
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,270
Sorry, I suspected you.

301
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:34,180
That's okay. From your perspective, that makes sense.

302
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:39,070
Why did Seong Eun commit suicide?

303
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:42,960
Why are you asking me that?

304
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:46,590
Since you said you talked to her on the rooftop.

305
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:48,560
I didn't hear anything from her.

306
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,340
 Seong Eun.

307
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:02,640
 Let go. Let go!

308
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,810
 Don't do this.

309
00:39:03,810 --> 00:39:06,260
 Let go!

310
00:39:17,370 --> 00:39:19,120
Where are you going?

311
00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:24,880
That's so funny.

312
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,120
Give me a light.

313
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:30,400
Give me a break.

314
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:32,630
Who the hell is he?

315
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:36,280
Is there only one bathroom here? Go to a different floor, you punk.

316
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,700
Leave.

317
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,600
Didn't you hear me telling you to go to another floor?

318
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,190
What the hell are you doing?

319
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:43,800
- Give me your phone. 
 - Why? Do you want my number?

320
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,820
Hey, that psychotic bastard must have a crush on you.

321
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:49,950
Shut up. That's disgusting.

322
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:51,860
I heard you took a video of Seong Eun.

323
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:53,020
Is that what she said?

324
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:57,210
You guys got rid of the suicide note in the backpack, right?

325
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:01,370
This bastard must be crazy.

326
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:03,750
Hey.

327
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:07,540
Hey. Are you asking for troublâ€“

328
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:22,210
- What's happening? 
 - What are they doing?

329
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:23,210
Is he really fighting them?

330
00:40:23,210 --> 00:40:24,570
- Is he crazy? 
 - Hey!

331
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:26,430
He's outnumbered.

332
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:32,390
- Did he win? 
 - What just happened?

333
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:34,120
Did he beat them all?

334
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:39,940
- How is he perfectly fine? 
 - What happened?

335
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:42,320
Give this to the police.

336
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:45,680
The reason Seong Eun commit suicide is in here.

337
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:51,880
- What just happened? 
 - How do we believe him? 
 - He's crazy!

338
00:40:54,490 --> 00:40:57,410
I heard Jin Gyeom is super smart.

339
00:40:57,410 --> 00:41:00,160
Goodness, you must be full even if you don't eat. 
  (T/N: Phrase meaning one must be very pleased.)

340
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:05,540
No, that's not it. But I have been putting on some weight lately.

341
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:10,390
Anyways, is today some special occasion? Why are you buying so much meat?

342
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:13,410
Just because I wanted some.

343
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:16,540
- Here. 
 - Bye.

344
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:18,400
Bye!

345
00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:34,150

346
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:39,380
 Mom, happy birthday.

347
00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:42,520
Mom, you're home?

348
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:45,710
Why are you just leaving?

349
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:47,920
You should light the candles for me.

350
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:07,600
â™ª Happy birthday to you â™ª

351
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:13,190
â™ª Happy birthday to you â™ª

352
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:15,290
â™ª Happy birthday to... â™ª

353
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:20,250
Hurry up and blow them out.

354
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:41,600
How nice.

355
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:48,470
My son cared for my birthday and even sang me a song.

356
00:42:49,490 --> 00:42:52,590
I'm so happy today.

357
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:56,950
Why do you drink things that aren't good for your body?

358
00:42:56,950 --> 00:43:01,060
- If you're curious, do you want a shot? 
 - No.

359
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:06,490
Just try one glass. You're supposed to learn how to drink from your parents.

360
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:09,850
I have to study later.

361
00:43:09,850 --> 00:43:13,420
It's my birthday, but studying is more important to you?

362
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:17,440
You've already finished it anyway.

363
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:21,470
You're right. I wanted to drink while watching the lunar eclipse.

364
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:25,020
The lunar eclipse? Why would you watch that?

365
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:28,690
This time, it'll be the first super blood moon in decades.

366
00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:30,830
It's super special.

367
00:43:30,830 --> 00:43:33,120
If I miss the 2010 Super Blood Moon this year,

368
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:37,080
I probably won't get another chance to see it before I die.

369
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:41,320
I better hurry up and buy some. If I do, you'll try some, right?

370
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:45,280
Just have one glass with me, okay?

371
00:43:46,050 --> 00:43:48,640
- Okay. 
 - You promised, okay?

372
00:43:54,570 --> 00:43:57,590
Do you want to go with me? A little date.

373
00:43:58,180 --> 00:44:01,400
Let's go together, son.

374
00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:07,080
Forget it. You should go alone.

375
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:10,230
Okay. I'll be right back.

376
00:46:35,830 --> 00:46:38,790
 The person you are trying to callâ€“

377
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:42,910

378
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:04,810
Mom!

379
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:13,720
Mom!

380
00:47:21,730 --> 00:47:25,310
Mom... Mom!

381
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:50,370
Mom!

382
00:47:56,870 --> 00:48:02,000
Mom! Mom, what happened? Who did this?

383
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:04,770
Get up quickly.

384
00:48:04,770 --> 00:48:08,930
Mom, just wait a little bit. I'll call 911.

385
00:48:11,850 --> 00:48:16,200
That person... left.

386
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:21,430
My son, you'll be okay.

387
00:48:21,430 --> 00:48:24,710
What do you mean I'll be okay?!

388
00:48:24,710 --> 00:48:26,950
Jin Gyeom...

389
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:30,380
My son...

390
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:37,120
It's all my fault.

391
00:48:41,870 --> 00:48:47,250
You... need to knowâ€“

392
00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:49,710
Stop talking, Mom.

393
00:48:56,210 --> 00:49:00,200
If you see me...

394
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:03,310
Stop talking!

395
00:49:05,270 --> 00:49:07,470
Listen carefully.

396
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:16,330
If you see me some time again,

397
00:49:16,330 --> 00:49:21,870
you mustn't act like you recognize me.

398
00:49:21,870 --> 00:49:26,280
You must... avoid me at all costs.

399
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:29,670
What are you talking about? Why would I avoid you?

400
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:39,780
My son... When did you grow up so much?

401
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:49,040
Thank you for being born as my son.

402
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:59,510
In your next life, be born as my son again.

403
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:03,370
Okay?

404
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:11,890
I don't want to. Mom, you have to give birth to someone better than me.

405
00:50:11,890 --> 00:50:15,010
Have a son that worries about you when you're ill

406
00:50:15,010 --> 00:50:18,890
and can console you when you're sad.

407
00:50:20,330 --> 00:50:25,710
Then, even if you're not my mom,

408
00:50:25,710 --> 00:50:29,420
I'll protect you.

409
00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:31,810
I'll protect you no matter what.

410
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:53,170
Mom... Mom.

411
00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:02,100
Mom. Mom!

412
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:10,750
Mom... Mom...

413
00:51:10,750 --> 00:51:13,230
Mom...

414
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:18,820
Mom!

415
00:52:10,910 --> 00:52:14,200
- I thought it was a gunshot wound. 
 - It is.

416
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:20,460
There is a laceration, and her intestines were injured in the process as well.

417
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:24,020
But it isn't an ordinary gun.

418
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:29,720
Both the entry and exit wounds are so small they are difficult to distinguish with the naked eye.

419
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:52,310
Some cases...

420
00:52:52,310 --> 00:52:57,470
can be solved even after lots of time has passed.

421
00:52:57,470 --> 00:52:59,970
You just need to never give up.

422
00:53:00,650 --> 00:53:04,260
Try trusting in this old man.

423
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:09,090
I heard you're smart.

424
00:53:10,930 --> 00:53:14,490
You should study hard thinking of your mom

425
00:53:14,490 --> 00:53:19,510
and go to a good university. What's your goal?

426
00:53:21,430 --> 00:53:23,510
The police academy.

427
00:54:05,820 --> 00:54:08,260

428
00:54:17,210 --> 00:54:22,600
 Listen well, hostage-taker. I'm Captain Go Hyeong Seok from the Seoul Nambu Police Station.

429
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:26,110
 Come down, instead of causing trouble you'll regret for the rest of your life.

430
00:54:26,110 --> 00:54:31,320
 If you release the hostage now, you could be granted extenuating circumstances.

431
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:35,220
But if the hostage suffers the smallest of injuries,

432
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:37,590
that'll be it for you!

433
00:54:37,590 --> 00:54:39,710
Shut up!

434
00:54:40,670 --> 00:54:42,750
Oh, hey, hey!

435
00:54:42,750 --> 00:54:44,720
Darn it.

436
00:54:46,090 --> 00:54:48,220
What about the door to the rooftop?

437
00:54:48,220 --> 00:54:50,480
We're opening it now.

438
00:54:52,010 --> 00:54:54,420
Gosh.

439
00:54:55,450 --> 00:54:58,280
We're going to have to break in.

440
00:54:59,390 --> 00:55:02,760
Chief, it won't budge.

441
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:06,670
Goodness, that's troublesome.

442
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:09,230
Where's Jin Gyeom?

443
00:55:26,210 --> 00:55:28,710
He's right there.

444
00:55:28,710 --> 00:55:31,150
What is he doing up there?

445
00:55:37,220 --> 00:55:40,380
Damn it. Who are you?

446
00:55:43,890 --> 00:55:45,660
What is he doing there?

447
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:50,310
Stay away! Do you want this woman to die?

448
00:55:50,310 --> 00:55:52,520
Please save me.

449
00:55:56,780 --> 00:55:58,350
Please save me.

450
00:55:58,350 --> 00:56:01,060
Do you realize that you're aiming at her carotid artery right now?

451
00:56:01,060 --> 00:56:02,090
What?

452
00:56:02,090 --> 00:56:06,880
If you press down one millimeter further, blood will gush from the wound at a pace of one liter per minute.

453
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:10,530
She will die from hypovolemic shock within minutes.

454
00:56:10,530 --> 00:56:13,390
If you're unlucky, it could take even less time.

455
00:56:13,390 --> 00:56:17,290
- Please save me... 
 - That's why I asked you to stay away!

456
00:56:17,290 --> 00:56:20,270
Hey. Do you want to see her croak that badly?

457
00:56:20,270 --> 00:56:26,070
You already killed three people and I don't know how many more you might kill.

458
00:56:26,070 --> 00:56:30,520
Do you think I'll just let you get away in order to save this woman?

459
00:57:01,690 --> 00:57:02,950
Are you okay?

460
00:57:02,950 --> 00:57:05,400
Damn you! If you fell, I would have lost my baby!
  (T/N: He almost gave him a heart attack.)

461
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:06,970
Are you okay?

462
00:57:06,970 --> 00:57:08,350
Yes. What about the hostage?

463
00:57:08,350 --> 00:57:10,380
 Captain.

464
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:13,230
We got to the rooftop and the hostage is okay, too.

465
00:57:13,230 --> 00:57:16,390
Oh, what a relief!  They say she's okay.  Oh man, scared me!

466
00:57:16,390 --> 00:57:20,070
Let's go to my house.  My wife told me to make sure to bring you.

467
00:57:20,070 --> 00:57:22,170
I am sorry.  I have a prior engagement.

468
00:57:22,170 --> 00:57:25,200
Please let the Mrs. know.

469
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:26,630
Are you meeting Do Yeon?

470
00:57:26,630 --> 00:57:27,890
How did you know?

471
00:57:27,890 --> 00:57:31,160
Is there anyone other than Do Yeon you have to meet?

472
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:33,480
See you tomorrow.

473
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:36,560

474
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:43,810
Mr. Kim!

475
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:51,550
I'm sorry. Let's talk tomorrow because I'm not feeling well...

476
00:57:51,550 --> 00:57:54,900
It looks that way.  You will have to go to a hospital right now to get an autopsy!

477
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:57,190
Should I do it instead?!

478
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:03,150
Hey!  Even though we might be in different companies, I am still a senior to you in journalism.

479
00:58:03,150 --> 00:58:05,320
Must you stab a senior in the back?

480
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:09,430
I can dismember you in pieces and drink the broth made of your bones, so don't block the story!

481
00:58:09,430 --> 00:58:12,270
Ahh, really!

482
00:58:16,650 --> 00:58:19,910
Everyone must be storing their conscience in an external hard drive and taking it out only when they need it.

483
00:58:19,910 --> 00:58:21,770
Even though he is a journalist senior...

484
00:58:21,770 --> 00:58:24,280
Knowing that bastard is taking interns to a hotel,

485
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:27,190
how could they stay quiet as a group?!

486
00:58:28,070 --> 00:58:29,730
I will write this story no matter what!

487
00:58:29,730 --> 00:58:33,040
If they block it, I will post it on the internet!

488
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:43,120
What aren't you saying anything?

489
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:45,020
You will surely take care of it well.

490
00:58:45,020 --> 00:58:49,810
- That means you worry about, care for, and support me, right? 
 - Yes.

491
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:52,690
Let's drink more somewhere else.

492
00:58:52,690 --> 00:58:55,130
Where shall we go? To your place?

493
00:58:55,130 --> 00:58:57,030
Your parents will worry.

494
00:58:57,030 --> 00:59:01,830
They know we are friends, but a grown woman shouldn't
visit a man's place alone.

495
00:59:04,070 --> 00:59:09,830
Our Jin Gyeom, you finally found out what happens when a grown man and woman are together in the same house?!

496
00:59:10,710 --> 00:59:14,550
You are all grown. This older sister is so proud of you!

497
00:59:14,550 --> 00:59:16,880
You are now watching porn, too. Right?

498
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:19,090
I don't watch it because it's boring.

499
00:59:19,090 --> 00:59:22,650
Hey! What do you mean porn is boring?!

500
00:59:30,540 --> 00:59:33,160
Is it your dream to become a priest?

501
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:35,390
Is there something wrong with your body?

502
00:59:35,390 --> 00:59:36,850
I'm just not interested.

503
00:59:36,850 --> 00:59:39,730
So, why are you not interested?  Why?!

504
00:59:39,730 --> 00:59:44,970
At your age, you should be interested in the real experience, not porn, Jin Gyeom!

505
00:59:44,970 --> 00:59:47,290
How frustrating!

506
00:59:49,910 --> 00:59:52,280
Hello, Sergeant.

507
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:55,630
Yes, I understand. I'll be right there.

508
00:59:55,630 --> 00:59:57,320
I have to go.

509
00:59:57,320 --> 00:59:59,110

510
00:59:59,110 --> 01:00:05,690
Hong Eun Soo: 7 years old. She went missing 2 days ago after a kindergarten field trip to a farm.

511
01:00:05,690 --> 01:00:11,220
 The father was going to pay a ransom but there was no call demanding one. That's why he made the report today.

512
01:00:11,220 --> 01:00:15,980
 The mom is on a business trip abroad.  She will be returning on an afternoon flight tomorrow.

513
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:20,510
 The apartment they are living in and the money indicate that the couple belongs in the upper 5%.

514
01:00:20,510 --> 01:00:25,300
 For now, the possibility for kidnapping is the highest.

515
01:00:25,300 --> 01:00:27,820
- Apple.â€‹ 
 - "Apple."

516
01:00:27,820 --> 01:00:30,080
- Apple.â€‹ 
 - "Apple."

517
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:32,430
Very good.

518
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:38,200
When was the first time you noticed that the child was missing?

519
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:42,340
When we gathered after lunch.  So, around 12:30 p.m.

520
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:44,070
Did everyone eat lunch together?

521
01:00:44,070 --> 01:00:46,540
No, we ate by class.

522
01:00:46,540 --> 01:00:49,790
All teachers had lunch in a different place, didn't they?

523
01:00:49,790 --> 01:00:54,100
Yes. But we were watching the kids the whole time.

524
01:00:56,130 --> 01:00:59,400
First, please send these pictures to the email address on my business card.

525
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:05,630
Well... Would it be possible that Eun Soo's mother took her?

526
01:01:05,630 --> 01:01:08,730
You didn't hear that the mother is on a business trip abroad?

527
01:01:08,730 --> 01:01:11,410
I heard but...

528
01:01:11,410 --> 01:01:15,480
Eun Soo's mother is in the picture.

529
01:01:26,070 --> 01:01:30,740
We analyzed the picture and it is Eun Soo's mother.

530
01:01:32,910 --> 01:01:34,490
She wasn't in Europe on a business trip?

531
01:01:34,490 --> 01:01:40,460
We checked the Immigrations Record and it is also certain that she did go on a business trip.

532
01:01:40,460 --> 01:01:42,380
What are you talking about, you punk?

533
01:01:42,380 --> 01:01:46,250
How could someone who was on a business trip in Europe be caught in a picture?  Have you checked the CCTVs?

534
01:01:46,250 --> 01:01:49,860
Yes, but there is no CCTV at the farm.

535
01:01:49,860 --> 01:01:52,290
She wasn't captured on a nearby road's CCTV.

536
01:01:52,290 --> 01:01:53,220
Where's Jin Gyeom?

537
01:01:53,220 --> 01:01:57,300
He went to the airport to subpoena the mom as soon as she lands.

538
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:19,580
You are saying that I kidnapped my daughter?

539
01:02:19,580 --> 01:02:23,880
Is that why you are not searching for our Eun Soo but came to catch me instead?!

540
01:02:26,830 --> 01:02:29,800
What do I do!

541
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:35,570
What are you all doing, not searching for our Eun Soo?!

542
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:49,430
Eun Soo won't come back just because you are crying like that.

543
01:02:49,430 --> 01:02:53,020
If you want to find the child, please stop wasting time.

544
01:02:53,020 --> 01:02:54,730
Lieutenant.

545
01:02:54,730 --> 01:02:58,780
Your business trip schedule and the kindergarten field trip schedule...

546
01:02:58,780 --> 01:03:01,230
How many know about both?

547
01:03:01,230 --> 01:03:03,450
Two.

548
01:03:03,450 --> 01:03:07,560
Her father and the housemaid.

549
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:10,690
Aren't there any among the moms of Eun Soo's kindergarten friends?

550
01:03:10,690 --> 01:03:14,380
I left the chatroom because I was busy.

551
01:03:16,330 --> 01:03:20,020
Did Eun Soo like the housemaid lady?

552
01:03:20,020 --> 01:03:22,160
No.

553
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:26,370
The lady has not been working for very long so Eun Soo was afraid of her.

554
01:03:26,370 --> 01:03:32,970
Did you ever get the feeling that someone was impersonating you?

555
01:03:32,970 --> 01:03:34,950
No.

556
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:38,910
Wait. The kid is back.

557
01:03:38,910 --> 01:03:40,580
What?

558
01:03:40,580 --> 01:03:43,260
Your daughter has come back home.

559
01:03:51,690 --> 01:03:54,130
I'm sorry, my Eun Soo. I'm sorry.

560
01:03:54,130 --> 01:03:56,630
I'm sorry.

561
01:03:58,700 --> 01:04:00,140
What happened?

562
01:04:00,140 --> 01:04:03,330
They say that the kid came back on her own.

563
01:04:03,330 --> 01:04:05,930
Who did she say she was with for three days?

564
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:09,800
She says that she was with her mom.

565
01:04:18,580 --> 01:04:21,140
Were you really with your mom?

566
01:04:22,060 --> 01:04:25,010
You didn't know your mom went abroad for work?

567
01:04:25,010 --> 01:04:26,880
I knew.

568
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:31,500
So, you were really with your mom?

569
01:04:36,900 --> 01:04:39,980
Mom told me it's a secret.

570
01:04:39,980 --> 01:04:44,520
My mom said she came on a time machine to see me!

571
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:09,700
Mom.

572
01:07:04,870 --> 01:07:06,810
 Jin Gyeom.

573
01:07:07,930 --> 01:07:09,990
 One day,

574
01:07:09,990 --> 01:07:14,360
 if you see me again,

575
01:07:15,430 --> 01:07:19,940
 you must pretend not to know me.

576
01:07:20,900 --> 01:07:25,720
 You must avoid me at all cost.

577
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:42,930
â™¬  Ain't nobody but you, for you I'm fighting every day  â™¬

578
01:07:42,930 --> 01:07:50,610
â™¬   Keeping my sanity. I'm on the edge and I'm falling  â™¬

579
01:07:50,610 --> 01:07:53,270
â™¬  Hold me tight, unfold it  â™¬

580
01:07:53,270 --> 01:07:56,740
â™¬  Tell 'em no distance will tear us apart  â™¬
 - Mom.

581
01:07:56,830 --> 01:08:00,050
â™¬  We are the reason  â™¬

582
01:08:00,050 --> 01:08:05,260
â™¬  You're the secret of my soul  â™¬

583
01:08:05,260 --> 01:08:08,310
â™¬   My love will bring us back  â™¬

584
01:08:08,310 --> 01:08:12,410
â™¬   Ain't nobody holding me back  â™¬

585
01:08:12,490 --> 01:08:14,640
â™¬   We be like Bonnie and Clyde  â™¬

586
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:16,050
â™¬   We ride or die   â™¬

587
01:08:16,050 --> 01:08:19,060
â™¬   We tight   â™¬

588
01:08:19,060 --> 01:08:22,080
â™¬   My love will bring us back  â™¬

589
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:26,040
â™¬    Ain't nobody holding me back  â™¬

590
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:28,150
â™¬   We be like Bonnie and Clyde  â™¬

591
01:08:28,150 --> 01:08:29,860
â™¬   We ride or die   â™¬

592
01:08:29,860 --> 01:08:32,780
â™¬   We tight   â™¬

593
01:08:32,780 --> 01:08:35,680
â™¬   My love will bring us back  â™¬

594
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:37,710
â™¬   Ain't nobody holding me back  â™¬

595
01:08:37,710 --> 01:08:39,490

596
01:08:39,490 --> 01:08:40,680
  I saw my mom.

597
01:08:40,680 --> 01:08:41,900
 You must have hurt your head, too.

598
01:08:41,900 --> 01:08:44,360
 You think I wouldn't even recognize my mom?

599
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:46,590
 Did Eun Soo really mention a time machine?

600
01:08:46,590 --> 01:08:49,570
 She said that the person who kidnapped her was her time traveler mom.

601
01:08:49,570 --> 01:08:53,790
 There have been strange cases since last year but there is one thing in common.

602
01:08:53,790 --> 01:08:56,090
  I have no idea where on earth he came from.

603
01:08:56,090 --> 01:08:57,610
 What have you done to Do Yeon?

604
01:08:57,610 --> 01:08:59,330
 I killed her.

605
01:08:59,330 --> 01:09:01,560
 I think it ended up in the hands of the police.

606
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:04,030
 Find out everything you can about Park Jin Gyeom.

607
01:09:04,030 --> 01:09:07,730
  I don't care who you are and where you are from.

608
01:09:07,730 --> 01:09:09,470
  I'm going to kill you with my own hands!

609
01:09:09,470 --> 01:09:13,000
