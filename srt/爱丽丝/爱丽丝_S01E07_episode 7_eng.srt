00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:52,970

5
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,970
It's ready, Sir.

6
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:13,850
I understand. I'll take care of it right away.

7
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,170
 Who is that?

8
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:28,000
Professor. Professor?

9
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:38,170
Who the hell are you guys? Why are you doing this?

10
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:43,060
That woman must die for the future.

11
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:09,870
Professor. Professor?

12
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:27,390

13
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:46,700

14
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:49,020
Unnie, have some water.

15
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:56,170
- Are you feeling a bit better?
 - Yeah.

16
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:02,930
I need to write something up at the police station, so you should go first.

17
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:06,580
Just tell mom and dad it was a stalker.

18
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:10,110
Otherwise, they'll worry.

19
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:13,160
For the time being, you should also stay at the restaurant.

20
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:16,010
Will you really be okay?

21
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:21,000
I'll call if anything happens. Mom will worry, so hurry home.

22
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,810
Okay. Come back safe.

23
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,450
Have a seat.

24
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:33,990
It's just...because it's a bit too dark.

25
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:41,640
Lieutenant Park, if it wasn't for you, I would've died. Right?

26
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:45,450
Thank you.

27
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:50,830
How did you know the victim, Ms. Moon Seo Jin?

28
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,880
I'd already told you. She was a close senior of mine.

29
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:02,620
I'd appreciate if you provided a bit more details. How did you get to know her?

30
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:05,930
Were you part of the same research group?

31
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:09,460
I must know why the culprit was after you two.

32
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:15,460
Do I look okay to you right now?

33
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:21,790
You could just tell me that it'll be okay, that everything is fine.

34
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:28,880
I apologize. I just wanted to catch the culprit as soon as possible.

35
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:49,250
What are you doing?

36
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,500
I'm playing music.

37
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,170
♫ Every day, I felt love was only in movies ♫

38
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:54,900
Does music suit this situation?

39
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,550
I... for you...

40
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:02,020
There's a time and place for music, too!

41
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:05,570
Music isn't my life.

42
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:09,940
♫  My heart flutters  ♫

43
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:26,910

44
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,760
He didn't leave a single fingerprint.

45
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:40,560
The only evidence we have is this and the fact that Lieutenant Park saw his face.

46
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,440
A man in his 40s?

47
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,670
Yes. We're creating a composite sketch.

48
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:48,010
But why do you think the culprit left something like this?

49
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:53,760
It must be for showing off. Based on both the fancy method of killing as well as leaving this mark.

50
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,730
So what exactly do you think this is?

51
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:58,810
I'm a liberal arts major.

52
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:00,500
Me too.

53
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,720
Me three.

54
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:08,040
You're kidding! I thought you majored in Physical Education.

55
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:18,310
You all seem to be having fun. Did you come here to goof around?

56
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:20,300
Is this for sightseeing?

57
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,640
Who is it this time?

58
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:28,780
Ms. Yoon Tae Yi. You know her, right? The professor that's close to Lieutenant Park.

59
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:32,380
Apparently, she was in the same research group as Moon Seo Jin.

60
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:38,220
- How many people are in that research group? 
 - Five.

61
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:42,380
Identify all the members of that research group and look into what exactly they researched.

62
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:44,370
It was only two...

63
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:49,050
Do you want to be at another funeral? We have to do whatever we can.

64
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,440
Did you find anything else?

65
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,220
Lieutenant Park found the culprit's cellphone on-site.

66
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,160
Cellphone?

67
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:00,600
There was one number in the call history.

68
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,050
Lieutenant Park thinks it may be his accomplice.

69
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:13,000
Where is Jin Gyeom?

70
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:19,540
I have no idea.

71
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:23,230
But why did he write this in my house?

72
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,590
What is it?

73
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:37,940
The suspect's phone.

74
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:42,760
Do you recognize this number, by chance?

75
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,370
No.

76
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:47,950
Why not try calling this number?

77
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:50,340
It doesn't exist.

78
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:57,480
Then why are you asking me?

79
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:05,020
 I've looked through your mom's call history, and I found a strange number.

80
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:07,120
 The number doesn't exist.

81
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,490
 I don't really understand what you mean...

82
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:12,910
 So your mom...

83
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:18,770
 had a phone call with a number that doesn't even exist. On top of that, in the morning before her incident,

84
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:22,110
 she received a text from that number.

85
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:26,090

86
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:27,910
 I was wondering if it was a number you knew.

87
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:31,000
 No, I've never seen it.

88
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:34,910

89
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,720
It could just be a coincidence that they're the same.

90
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:46,880
I'll escort the professor home.

91
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,300
Why would you escort her home yourself?

92
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,600
It's something I must do.

93
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:03,650
I've already requested that patrol be reinforced

94
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:07,540
and the office will be surveilling the CCTVs in the area 24/7.

95
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:10,510
I won't place you in danger again.

96
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:12,930
I will arrest him no matter what.

97
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,840
How?

98
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:19,370
Let me know in detail how you plan on arresting him.

99
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,700
You don't have a plan yet, do you?

100
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:27,290
If the killer appears again, how are you going to arrest him?

101
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:29,350
I'll protect you.

102
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:31,750
I'm grateful for you saying that,

103
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:34,480
but what if he appears while you're not around?

104
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,760
You need to run away.

105
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,150
Do you think I wouldn't get caught just because I ran away?

106
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:40,040
I lack muscle.

107
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:43,400
Do you know how weak my legs are?

108
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,760
Would you like to listen to some music?

109
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,060
Stop listening to music.

110
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:57,090
What are we going to do with you?

111
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:14,460
I dropped off the cellphone at the control center.

112
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:22,240
This is where you were!

113
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,930
I was looking for you for so long.

114
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:28,890
Why did you bring her along?

115
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:32,740
I heard there was almost a second victim. Who was it?

116
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:36,440
I know you want to get a scoop, but this isn't the time for me to be revealing that information.

117
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,220
Can't you just tell me who it was?

118
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,760
No.

119
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,650
Stop eating, and let's go.

120
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:44,240
I-I haven't been able to eat a proper meal all day.

121
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,960
It's perfectly fine to starve for just a day. Get up.

122
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,560
I don't even get endoscopy's because I don't like starving. 
  (T/N: You have to stop eating for 8 hours before the procedure.)

123
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,150
You don't need an endoscopy.

124
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:52,060
I'm sure even your intestines are muscular. Get up.

125
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:57,150
Okay, just eat. Eat, eat.

126
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:16,510
Wow, your arms are so buff.

127
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:21,880
It's honestly a loss to women that a man who has such nice arms doesn't have a girlfriend.

128
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,480
Right?

129
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:27,130
Shall I introduce you to someone?

130
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:31,330
Thanks for the offer, but I'm a bit busy these days.

131
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:34,220
Really? What a shame.

132
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:38,920
I know so many people who are young and pretty, but don't have boyfriends.

133
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,120
I'm really fine.

134
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:44,440
Then do you want to see their pictures, maybe?

135
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:51,670
Sure, maybe the pictures... might be okay.

136
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:57,250
- Why? 
 - Life's all about give and take.

137
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,800
Who's the second victim?

138
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,340
I- I really can't tell you that.

139
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:06,590
All a man needs are tight abs, not tight lips.

140
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:09,310
I really won't write a report on it.

141
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:12,220
Can you at least give me a hint?

142
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:16,360
It's a professor at a university. I really can't say more.

143
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,730
What kind of professor?

144
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:21,690
Just a professor... a sensitive and haggard one.

145
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:23,760
Yoon Tae Yi?

146
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,080
How did you know?

147
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:40,220

148
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,780
Whenever you leave the house, please let me know.

149
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,720
I'll accompany you.

150
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:51,710
It's also really fine by me, so feel free to reach out whenever you need help.

151
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:53,550
Don't worry.

152
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:56,720
My dad dreamed of being a cop.

153
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,020
That's why he named his restaurant "Crime Squad."

154
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,730

155
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:07,010
At times like this, just laugh.

156
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:10,630
I understand. I'll be going then.

157
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:13,170
He's a time traveler, right?

158
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:17,430
The killer.

159
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:21,820
That's the only answer I can think of.

160
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:25,140
The reason he was targeting Seo Jin and me

161
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:28,490
must be because we were researching time travel.

162
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:34,030
I doubt it.

163
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:37,980
There's no reason for them to target a research group that was showing no progress.

164
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:42,770
Are you aware of the cosmological constant?

165
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:47,550
It's a physical constant that Einstein admitted himself was a mistake.

166
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:51,340
Until the beginning of the 90's, it was considered rubbish,

167
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:53,240
but in 1998,

168
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,740
as the theory of the accelerating expansion was proven,

169
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:58,660
the cosmological constant started gaining attention again.

170
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:04,410
Now, it's a constant that is used in all equations regarding the universe.

171
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:07,740
This is how science is.

172
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:13,000
It requires time to be verified and proven as reality.

173
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:19,860
That may be the reason why Chief Seok hasn't given up yet.

174
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:26,810
I believe that he'll be successful one day.

175
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:33,400
He's someone who's dedicated his entire life to studying about time traveling.

176
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,480
 I didn't know myself who would be dying.

177
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,520
 I've been trying to prevent disasters like these for the past 10 years,

178
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:43,040
 along with your mother.

179
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:51,300
Was there someone named Park Sun Young in your research group?

180
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:54,770
Who's Park Sun Young?

181
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:03,530

182
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,790
Ms. Park Sun Young?

183
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,590
Please have a seat.

184
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,720
I heard you were looking for me.

185
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:23,900
Do you believe in time travel?

186
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,540
Excuse me?

187
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,380
What is this?

188
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:40,810
A record of the past that someone from the future has written.

189
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:45,160
We call this "The Book of Prophecy."

190
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,480
Pardon me.

191
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,860
I'm a bit busy,

192
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:00,330
so please leave.

193
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:15,490
Your name is written in this Book of Prophecy.

194
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:20,220
 When the world is overturned by arrogant desires,

195
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:23,510
 those who felt fear, appeared.

196
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:27,150
 Seok Oh Won and his researchers tried to close the doors of time

197
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:30,170
 to restore order.

198
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,650
I'm not sure how you got in here,

199
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:40,590
but please leave before I call security.

200
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:43,880
If I can create negative energy,

201
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,360
would you believe me?

202
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:57,470

203
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:05,980
Fortunately, Professor Yoon is safe.

204
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:09,000
What a relief.

205
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,830
There's no time for you to be here. You must flee.

206
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:15,960

207
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,000
Wait outside for a moment.

208
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:24,730
I've been waiting for your call.

209
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:27,120
What do you know?

210
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,440
What is the reason the researchers are being targeted?

211
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,590
Your mother was the start of everything.

212
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,410
 She came to see me 10 years ago

213
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:41,520
and asked me to work with her to prevent the horrible events predicted.

214
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:45,950
Even after your mother passed away, I put a team together and tried to stop time travel.

215
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:48,640
I think that's why they're being targeted.

216
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:53,730
My mother... was a normal housewife.

217
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:58,730
The Book of Prophecy... is with me.

218
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:01,250
 There are things you must know that are written in this book.

219
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:03,120
There's no time.

220
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,220
Please come quickly.

221
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:23,650

222
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:35,810
If something happens to me,

223
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:41,520
please help that student carry on this research.

224
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:47,900
That student... can stop time travel.

225
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:50,560
I'm confused.

226
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:55,490
In the coming future, you may be in danger.

227
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:29,620
 Your mother was the start to everything.

228
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:33,270
 Your mother... was not an ordinary housewife.

229
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:36,990
 The Book of Prophecy... is with me.

230
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:25,780

231
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:37,800
What happened?

232
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:41,050
We think Seok Oh Won was abducted.

233
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:49,930

234
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,470
How did he come here if he's not one of our clients?

235
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:59,300
It's not an official route, but the same one as used by Lee Se Hoon in 1992.

236
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:03,390
Do you think he's also involved in this case?

237
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:06,220
Who?

238
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:09,210
The person he calls his mentor.

239
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:11,610
Stop speaking nonsense.

240
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:14,910
We don't even know if they even exist.

241
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:18,550
But I'm certain there is someone we don't know the existence of.

242
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:20,150
Who's the victim?

243
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:25,260
All three of them are involved in the research I told you about last time.

244
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:30,840
One unsettling thing about the victims is that one of them is Yoon Tae Yi.

245
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,760
Tae Yi?

246
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:38,430
No, there is also a Yoon Tae Yi in this world.

247
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:40,980
Why didn't you report this to me sooner?

248
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:44,480
I... thought she was an ordinary civilian from the past.

249
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,660
Both figures named Yoon Tae Yi are scientists,

250
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:48,620
but you think that's ordinary?

251
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:55,320
Get Min Hyeok out of there,

252
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:59,340
and analyze in great detail the contents of Yoon Tae Yi's research.

253
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:01,250
Okay.

254
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:16,710

255
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:19,750
Nobody saw him at the time of the abduction.

256
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:22,550
All the CCTVs in the area were turned off because of the power outage.

257
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:24,280
Have you checked his residence?

258
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,960
Yes, but there are no signs of anyone breaking in.

259
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,810
It seems he nearly lived here, in his research lab.

260
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:35,420
First, please pay more attention to patrolling so no more victims arise.

261
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:41,890
How can you eat black bean ramen at a Chinese restaurant? 
  (T/N: a Korean twist on jjajangmyeon)

262
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:44,620
Let her eat whatever she wants.

263
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:48,570
Sell that house and come live with us.

264
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,300
I'll just be here temporarily.

265
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:53,290
Things like this are happening because you two girls are living alone!

266
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:55,050
Why would you say that in this situation?

267
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:57,740
Just listen to mom.

268
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:59,350
I'm going to start exercising today.

269
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:01,040
Dad needs to protect you two.

270
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,990
Hey, my dream was to become a detective.

271
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:07,260
How can you protect anyone when you can't even win against Mom?

272
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:11,590
I'll wash up and head to bed.

273
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:13,710
You'll need to get up early for work, too.

274
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:16,150
Oh, yeah.

275
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:21,040
Are you still considering turning in that letter of resignation?

276
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:25,340
What is this about?

277
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,490
Why... are you thinking of submitting a letter of resignation?

278
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:29,780
She wants to quit.

279
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:33,250
She just doesn't want to work. It's obvious.

280
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:35,790
It's not like that.

281
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,150
Mom! Mom!

282
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:40,040
You need to worry about Sis.

283
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,780
Hey, are you two a relay?

284
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:45,020
How can you bother one person sequentially like this?

285
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,840
Why are you taking your anger out on me?

286
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,490
You're part of the problem!

287
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:57,320
If you hadn't been up to any funny business, why would someone have been stalking you?

288
00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:00,730
Why are you doing this to me? I'm adopted.

289
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:04,050
Why are you hitting me when you're not even my real mother?

290
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:08,110
I'm hitting you because I'm not your real mother.

291
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:17,870
Wow, this is delicious.

292
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:36,540
 Mom!

293
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:39,510
 Mom!

294
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,760
 Let's run.

295
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,730
 You can't come out of here.

296
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:01,320
 Okay.

297
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:40,040

298
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:46,420

299
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:53,440
 Is something the matter?

300
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,260
Were you sleeping, by chance?

301
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:57,420
No.

302
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:59,150
There's something that's been bothering me.

303
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:01,560
Can I go to my house for a minute?

304
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:04,490
We can go together.

305
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:06,790
You just need to come outside.

306
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:08,970
Right now?

307
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:11,120
Where are you right now?

308
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:15,040

309
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:24,300
How were you here at this hour?

310
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:27,810
I was just... passing by.

311
00:28:40,610 --> 00:28:42,010
It's broken.

312
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:44,620
I think the culprit tampered with it.

313
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:55,870

314
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:10,700

315
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,960
Do you know what it is?

316
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,200
Professor?

317
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,460
As expected, it's an equation I've never seen before.

318
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:23,000

319
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,090
One moment.

320
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:27,620
This is the only thing the culprit left behind.

321
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,670
Let me look at it just a bit more.

322
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:36,910

323
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,690
You scared me!

324
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:07,280
What are you doing here? With this woman, on top of that?

325
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,490
What about you?

326
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:11,490
Why are you entering someone's else home without permission? This is my house.

327
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:12,820
What are you doing with her?

328
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:14,440
Why are you pointing your fingers at me?

329
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,730
Shall I use my fists instead?

330
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:20,200
We're here to investigate. Why are you here?

331
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:25,440
I told you not to look into this case.

332
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,090
Do you pay for my salary?

333
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:29,150
Who are you to tell me what to do?

334
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:30,580
I'm just worried about you.

335
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:33,690
Then tell me what's going on.

336
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:38,880
You must also be aware that all the cases you're investigating right now are strange.

337
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,730
Do you know what is the most strange of all?

338
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:43,070
Your attitude.

339
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:45,130
I really don't understand why you're acting this way,

340
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:47,690
or what you're hiding.

341
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:50,160
I said I'd tell you everything later.

342
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,990
It's nothing much and it's nothing for you to worry about.

343
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:57,360
Whether it's nothing or not, how can I ignore smoke coming out of a chimney?

344
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:01,550
Starting from how the person in the holding cell right now was pictured in 1992,

345
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:05,820
to how you know about the Schrodinger's case before it happened. Tell me everything.

346
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:11,650
What was that?

347
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:14,590
Tell me.

348
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:18,300
What happened in 1992 and how did you find out about this case?

349
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:19,700
I must keep confidentiality for all investigations.

350
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,830
I think it must have something to do with me as well.

351
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:24,060
- I have the right to know– 
 - Please stop.

352
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:30,440
Must you really reply so harshly?

353
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:33,050
- When did I? 
 - Even just now.

354
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:38,670
I apologize. I didn't mean to be so cold.

355
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:44,650
What's the use if you think that?

356
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:46,850
Everyone else misunderstands.

357
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:51,460
When people send texts, do you know why they add tildes at the end?

358
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:54,460
Because they don't want to cause misunderstandings.

359
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:58,710
Please try fixing that way of speaking.

360
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:02,810
Okay~

361
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:05,590
What was that?

362
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:08,250
A tilde?

363
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,860
I don't think I'll need to laugh for the rest of the year.

364
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:22,930
I've laughed as much as I need to this year, thanks to you.

365
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:44,480

366
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:49,090
 Please fix that way of speaking.

367
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:51,280
 Okay~

368
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,930

369
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:02,510

370
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:06,560

371
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,570

372
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:22,190
Is Jin Gyeom busy these days?

373
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:24,470
I haven't seen him in so long. I miss him.

374
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:27,900
I don't know. Don't talk to me about Jin Gyeom.

375
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:30,320
Jin Gyeom's giving you a hard time, isn't he?

376
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:33,350
You've been so patient.

377
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:37,960
Hey, Do Yeon. Listen carefully to what I'm about to say.

378
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:41,580
Just do as I say.

379
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:44,480
First, approach Jin Gyeom.

380
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,920
Then, look right into his eyes.

381
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:50,660
Take it off. Everything.

382
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:55,800
Auntie!

383
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,670
Why not? Jin Gyeom is a man!

384
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:00,200
Forget it.

385
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:03,320
Why forget it? Just try as I suggested. I'm 100% certain it'll work.

386
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:06,100
That would never work on Jin Gyeom.

387
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,920
Eat up.

388
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:33,000
You're here at this hour? What's the occasion?

389
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,640
I'm going to shower and try to nap for an hour.

390
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:39,880
Okay, sure. Let me prepare the blankets for you.

391
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:40,990
Hey.

392
00:34:40,990 --> 00:34:42,990
One minute. One minute.

393
00:34:42,990 --> 00:34:45,430
Let's just stay like this for a minute.

394
00:34:45,430 --> 00:34:50,490
- Why are you being like this? 
 - Just for a second, please.

395
00:34:50,490 --> 00:34:53,090
Do Yeon will see us.

396
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:55,350
How would Do Yeon see this?

397
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:57,370
Wow, awesome!

398
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,520
Why are you here?

399
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,760
I really must do as you suggested, Auntie.

400
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:12,330
Thank you.

401
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:19,130
But if you keep staying with me like this, when are you going to arrest the suspect?

402
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:20,690
I'll take care of it.

403
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:23,870
Shouldn't you focus on catching the suspect?

404
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:29,890
Yes, so please get out. I must go investigate.

405
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:32,980
Wait.

406
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:39,740
I brought this just in case. Have you tried using it before?

407
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:41,460
No.

408
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:47,640
You can use it after releasing the safety pin here.

409
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:56,560

410
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:05,960
Please have this.

411
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,780
Thank you.

412
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:13,670
I've heard lots about you.

413
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:17,730
From who? I've never talked about Lieutenant Park to you.

414
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:21,680
Thank you so much for saving our daughter.

415
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,000
You haven't eaten yet, have you?

416
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,380
No, I'm all right.

417
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:29,350
You should still eat. Do you like Chinese food?

418
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:32,150
No. I dislike it.

419
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:43,140
Though I dislike it, I'll eat it well if you give me some.

420
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:49,010
He eats jjajangmyeon. If you give it to him, he'll eat it. Don't mind his words.

421
00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:02,730
Have you caught the stalker who's been bothering my daughter?

422
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:04,720
Oh, about that...

423
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,170
Yes. We've arrested him.

424
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:09,300
You don't need to worry.

425
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:13,360
Oh, thank you. Just wait a minute.

426
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:16,800
Let me get some sweet and sour pork as well.

427
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:31,020
Yes, Sergeant.

428
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:35,990
This is an unregistered phone, so it won't be easy to track.

429
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,610
I think the accomplice's phone number is really odd.

430
00:37:39,610 --> 00:37:44,660
It's definitely a number not registered, but there's a call log.

431
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:46,940
This is the location of the call.

432
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,750

433
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:02,940
I'll go and check  them personally.

434
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:10,080
Is he really just a police officer?

435
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,550
What if he's not just a cop?

436
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:18,090
I mean... I think you guys look good together.

437
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:20,910
If he's a lieutenant at that age, it means he graduated from a police academy.

438
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:24,280
Crime Squad's owner's son-in-law is actually on a crime squad. How cool is that?

439
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,960
What are you two doing?

440
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:28,710
I mean, you're getting old. You need to start meeting men.

441
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:33,870
I don't want to. I'm going to live with you two forever.

442
00:38:36,170 --> 00:38:37,370
Don't say such things.

443
00:38:37,370 --> 00:38:41,070
I don't even want to imagine that.

444
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:44,670
What kind of parents want to get rid of their daughter?

445
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:47,080
I'm tired. I'll go up.

446
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:51,000
Wait a minute. Sister Won Jeong called.

447
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,470
Why?

448
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:56,820
Maybe it was two days ago. Don't you really know?

449
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:59,160
That lieutenant came to ask about you.

450
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,790
Which lieutenant? Park Jin Gyeom?

451
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:03,660
No, that wasn't his name.

452
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:05,220
What did he ask?

453
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:08,520
He asked how you came here in 1992

454
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:11,390
and whether or not you own a book.

455
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:12,700
A book?

456
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:15,500
Are you sure nothing's going on?

457
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:18,010
Did he give you his business card?

458
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:21,000
I didn't even think of questioning him since he said he was a detective.

459
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:25,790
Are you sure he's a real lieutenant? What did he look like?

460
00:39:25,790 --> 00:39:30,050
He just looked... ordinary. Maybe like a man in his 40s.

461
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:33,240
What else did he ask?

462
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:39,060
He asked if you remember your biological father who passed away in 1992.

463
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:42,360
Yes?

464
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:54,130
How did you get here?

465
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:08,030
I think the man who was here is the accomplice.

466
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:12,870
Do you remember how you got here?

467
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:14,550
No.

468
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:17,030
What about your biological parents?

469
00:40:19,370 --> 00:40:24,830
Do you know how most kids who live at an orphanage end up here?

470
00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:30,940
They're not left on the streets, but dropped off here by their biological parents.

471
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:36,450
"Mom will be back soon." We believe those words.

472
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:40,260
I did, too.

473
00:40:40,970 --> 00:40:43,970
I came all the way here, hand-in-hand with my mother.

474
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:47,520
That's all I remember.

475
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:51,430
I just learned today

476
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:55,500
that my father passed away in 1992.

477
00:40:56,250 --> 00:41:01,030
Those people... Why are they treating me this way?

478
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:06,090
From now on, please don't leave the house alone.

479
00:41:06,090 --> 00:41:09,100
I'll escort you home.

480
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:13,870
What's the 1992 case the reporter was talking about?

481
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:16,400
Does that have anything to do with me?

482
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:20,200
No. That's about the man in the holding cell.

483
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:26,750
Let me meet him. He's also a time traveler, but he came searching for me.

484
00:41:28,330 --> 00:41:33,140
In 1992, Dr. Jang Dong Sik was murdered.

485
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:36,010
If you're going to speak nonsense, just leave.

486
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:43,200
The police had three suspects for this incident, but only one was arrested.

487
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,700
He was found with a cut ankle.

488
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:48,660
So what? What do you want?

489
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:55,140
You're the one who cut his ankle, right?

490
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:58,140
You also killed Dr. Jang Dong Sik.

491
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:02,370
Was it for 'The Book of Prophecy?'

492
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:06,880
Did Lee Se Hoon tell you about that?

493
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,980
So it was you who cut his ankle.

494
00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:12,330
Then you must also know Park Sun Young.

495
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:13,460
Do I have to know her?

496
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:15,800
What about Professor Yoon Tae Yi?

497
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:18,210
Why did you go to Professor Yoon Tae Yi?

498
00:42:18,210 --> 00:42:19,930
Then, what about you?

499
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:24,660
Why are you taking such good care of the professor?

500
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:27,060
Follow me.

501
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:43,860
Do you know me?

502
00:42:45,770 --> 00:42:49,840
Why did you come to the park?

503
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:58,220
Can you leave us alone for just a moment? It'll be quick.

504
00:43:08,590 --> 00:43:13,300
You were doing something dangerous, so I simply wanted to warn you.

505
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:18,000
Will things become difficult for you if I'm in danger?

506
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:23,230
Time travel is fun, isn't it?

507
00:43:23,230 --> 00:43:25,150
I envy you.

508
00:43:26,850 --> 00:43:30,790
But why would you time travel to kill me?

509
00:43:30,790 --> 00:43:33,090
What are you talking about?!  Who would— 
  (T/N: Speaking informally)

510
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:41,110
By any chance, were you and I close?

511
00:43:42,790 --> 00:43:45,180
How would I be close to a professor I don't even know? 
  (T/N: speaking formally)

512
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:47,420
I am not talking about now.

513
00:43:48,290 --> 00:43:53,210
I don't know you but you seem to know me.

514
00:43:53,210 --> 00:43:55,880
Then, that's the only explanation. Isn't that right?

515
00:43:57,970 --> 00:44:03,490
Perhaps, in the future... do I cause some trouble?

516
00:44:03,490 --> 00:44:06,070
Is that the reason why you are trying to kill me?

517
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:10,350
I don't know whether you know the answer but you won't tell me,

518
00:44:10,350 --> 00:44:13,750
or you can't answer because you don't know.

519
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:17,140
But know this one thing.

520
00:44:18,130 --> 00:44:21,190
You probably came from a place that is more advanced than here.

521
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:25,610
So, the police may not be able to catch you.

522
00:44:25,610 --> 00:44:32,440
But... I can prove your existence.

523
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:35,610
You just wait for a little while.

524
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:47,170
Don't do anything dangerous. 
  (T/N: Speaking informally)

525
00:44:48,610 --> 00:44:50,140
It's not something you can do.

526
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:52,950
We really must've been close.

527
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:58,300
But we aren't in my book and we'll never be.

528
00:45:07,890 --> 00:45:10,660

529
00:45:11,730 --> 00:45:15,220

530
00:45:23,630 --> 00:45:26,540

531
00:45:30,530 --> 00:45:34,080
He is annoying.  Can't you hit him once for me?

532
00:45:35,470 --> 00:45:37,930
Stay here just for a moment, please.

533
00:45:46,310 --> 00:45:48,640
He is an illegal time traveler.

534
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:52,980
He must have spots all over his body from the radiation.

535
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:56,020
People around him from the past are probably infected as well.

536
00:45:58,770 --> 00:46:03,760
When you deal with someone from the future, you can't just trust what you see.

537
00:46:08,050 --> 00:46:11,470

538
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:14,010
Oh, Lieutenant Kim!

539
00:46:15,890 --> 00:46:20,630
The radiation level from the spots exceeds more than 30 times the standard.

540
00:46:20,630 --> 00:46:22,350
How did you know?

541
00:46:22,350 --> 00:46:26,670
I don't know.  Lieutenant Park told me to confirm it.

542
00:47:12,690 --> 00:47:15,420

543
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:27,170
 There were spots on Moon Seo Jin's body as well.

544
00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:30,510
All right.  I understand.  Thank you for your hard work.

545
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:34,000
It's late so why don't you leave with me, please.

546
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,380
You go ahead first, please.

547
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:38,600
I want to find out more about the equation.

548
00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:41,330
Don't worry about me.

549
00:47:41,330 --> 00:47:44,090
I've three strong officers protecting me.

550
00:47:44,090 --> 00:47:45,880
Please go.

551
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:50,860

552
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:20,230

553
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:28,030
I am sorry.

554
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:30,060
Thank you.

555
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:42,970

556
00:48:42,970 --> 00:48:44,230
 Us?  Yes.

557
00:48:44,230 --> 00:48:46,100
 Yes.  Uh.

558
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:04,700

559
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:28,090

560
00:49:28,970 --> 00:49:30,520
Uhh, what's this?!

561
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:32,520
Hey, where did they go?!

562
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:34,430
Hurry, hurry!

563
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:51,260
Where is Min Hyeok?

564
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:55,660
Team Leader left as soon as he got out of the police station saying that he needs to go somewhere.

565
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:01,590
What in the world is he thinking?

566
00:50:03,130 --> 00:50:04,890
I am not sure.

567
00:50:09,690 --> 00:50:11,950
What is going on?

568
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,130

569
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:18,440
It's nothing.  Please go in.

570
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:24,210

571
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:55,850
 I am sorry.

572
00:50:55,850 --> 00:50:57,930
 Thank you.

573
00:50:57,930 --> 00:51:02,990
 When you deal with someone from the future, you can't just trust what you see.

574
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:13,120

575
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:29,990
Professor Yoon Tae Yi.

576
00:51:29,990 --> 00:51:32,030
Yes, that's me.

577
00:51:32,030 --> 00:51:33,920
Who might you be?

578
00:51:36,690 --> 00:51:39,400
That's an interesting equation.

579
00:51:43,620 --> 00:51:46,050
 The person you have reached is unavailable.

580
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:48,980
I am asking who you are.

581
00:51:53,350 --> 00:51:56,120

582
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:08,770

583
00:52:10,790 --> 00:52:15,230

584
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:46,150
Why are you doing this to me?

585
00:52:46,150 --> 00:52:48,550
It's because you saw something you shouldn't have.

586
00:52:48,550 --> 00:52:51,830
Saw, what?

587
00:52:51,830 --> 00:52:53,650
The Book of Prophecy.

588
00:52:54,310 --> 00:52:56,240
The Book of Prophecy?

589
00:53:10,170 --> 00:53:13,770
Please leave.  Hurry!

590
00:53:29,430 --> 00:53:32,200
What is the reason for trying to kill even someone from the past?

591
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:33,770
It's all because of you.

592
00:53:33,770 --> 00:53:37,550
Because of you, "The Book of Prophecy" fell into the hands of someone from the past.

593
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:52,910
Professor!

594
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,930
Don't worry, please.

595
00:55:08,030 --> 00:55:10,040
It's okay now.

596
00:55:45,380 --> 00:55:49,450

597
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:39,930
 This is the orphanage group picture from 1992 that you requested.

598
00:57:18,870 --> 00:57:21,910
Good going!

599
00:57:22,540 --> 00:57:25,520
How can you let a crime occur in your own turf?!

600
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:27,430
Where is this bastard, Team Leader Ko?

601
00:57:27,430 --> 00:57:29,470
- Ah, it's that—
 - He didn't come to work today, Sir.

602
00:57:29,470 --> 00:57:32,510
It's not that... His wife is apparently very sick...

603
00:57:32,510 --> 00:57:36,910
Are you all trying to protect your captain?!  If this gets out to the media, it's the end.

604
00:57:36,910 --> 00:57:39,880
If you don't want to get fired as a group, you better stop it from getting out no matter what.  Got that?!

605
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:41,430
- Yes, Sir. 
 - Yes, Sir.

606
00:57:41,430 --> 00:57:47,090
Should I do the work?  You bastards, hurry up and go!

607
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:53,230

608
00:57:58,430 --> 00:58:00,040
- What are you doing? 
 - Ah!

609
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:05,000
Ah, you startled me!  Why are you taking a peak at my monitor? Don't you know anything about business ethics?

610
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:09,450
What?!  Business ethics?!  I am your superior!

611
00:58:09,450 --> 00:58:11,550
You are arguing with your superior about business ethics—

612
00:58:11,550 --> 00:58:13,000
- Yes? 
 - Eh!

613
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,780
Team Leader didn't come to work.

614
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:17,020
What are you talking about?

615
00:58:17,020 --> 00:58:20,530
He had perfect attendance for 22 years, but we can't even get in touch with him now.

616
00:58:20,530 --> 00:58:21,590
So, what?

617
00:58:21,590 --> 00:58:23,820
I just hope that he's not thinking of doing anything terrible.

618
00:58:23,820 --> 00:58:26,690
You really don't know Uncle.

619
00:58:26,690 --> 00:58:29,830
Try searching nearby saunas.  I am busy so I am hanging up.

620
00:58:29,830 --> 00:58:31,210
 Ms. Kim!

621
00:58:31,210 --> 00:58:33,510
Your heart is as beautiful as your face, right?

622
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:35,890
I am really hanging up.

623
00:58:35,890 --> 00:58:39,070
Who was that?  What's going on?

624
00:58:39,070 --> 00:58:41,210
I...

625
00:58:41,210 --> 00:58:44,110
have a heart totally as beautiful as my face.

626
00:58:44,110 --> 00:58:46,100
Why talk about something that everyone already knows?

627
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:47,650
Hey, stop fooling around!

628
00:58:47,650 --> 00:58:48,870
I am going out for an interview.

629
00:58:48,870 --> 00:58:50,380
Where?

630
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:34,010
Are you all right?

631
00:59:34,860 --> 00:59:36,950
I don't understand.

632
00:59:38,010 --> 00:59:42,750
He said that I read "The Book of Prophecy."

633
00:59:42,750 --> 00:59:45,100
That's why I need to die.

634
00:59:46,990 --> 00:59:50,020
I don't even know what "The Book of Prophecy" is.

635
00:59:53,510 --> 00:59:57,000
 If you have "The Book of Prophecy," you either die

636
00:59:57,970 --> 00:59:59,900
 or end up like me.

637
01:00:05,340 --> 01:00:08,670
Did he say anything else?

638
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:11,480
That was all.

639
01:00:12,810 --> 01:00:19,040
Don't teach from tomorrow and stay with me at a temporary residence.

640
01:00:20,630 --> 01:00:22,250
What are you saying?

641
01:00:22,250 --> 01:00:27,390
For now, it is safer to stay with me 24 hours.

642
01:00:27,390 --> 01:00:31,230
You are not saying we should live together, are you?

643
01:00:32,050 --> 01:00:36,420
How can an unmarried man and a woman live in the same house?

644
01:00:36,420 --> 01:00:42,200
This no time to argue about such things.  Right now, your safety is of utmost importance.

645
01:00:42,820 --> 01:00:46,190
- Are you like this to others as well? 
 - Sorry?

646
01:00:46,190 --> 01:00:48,990
Why do you worry so much about me?

647
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:54,960
Because you, Professor, are special.

648
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:58,960
Special?  What does that mean?

649
01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:03,710
Does that mean you like me?

650
01:01:06,770 --> 01:01:08,490
No.

651
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:11,330
It's not that I like you.

652
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:15,900
You don't like me, but I am special?

653
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:22,310
I... am not sure

654
01:01:22,310 --> 01:01:24,410
what I am saying, either.

655
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:37,970
So, where is this temporary accommodation?

656
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:49,030

657
01:01:52,850 --> 01:01:58,480
♫  Far away, I feel you shooting star  ♫

658
01:01:59,980 --> 01:02:05,860
♫  I'm looking at your today  ♫

659
01:02:05,860 --> 01:02:07,310
 Here you go.

660
01:02:07,310 --> 01:02:13,690
♫  It's a blur in my memory  ♫

661
01:02:13,690 --> 01:02:17,360
♫  It's just your breath  ♫

662
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:20,360
♫  I just feel you  ♫

663
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:22,590
 Tae Yi!

664
01:02:22,590 --> 01:02:24,410
 Thank you!

665
01:02:24,410 --> 01:02:26,900
♫  And call for you quietly  ♫

666
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:35,780
♫  I"m afraid I'm going to get away  ♫

667
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:41,630
 Jin Gyeom!

668
01:02:41,630 --> 01:02:45,930
♫  From your dazzling, beautiful eyes  ♫

669
01:02:45,930 --> 01:02:54,180
♫  Please just stay with me as much as you remember  ♫

670
01:02:54,180 --> 01:02:59,990
♫  Even a little closer  ♫

671
01:02:59,990 --> 01:03:08,000
♫  Remember me as much as you missed me  ♫

672
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:15,530
♫  Far away, I'm with you shooting star  ♫

673
01:03:16,330 --> 01:03:22,850
♫  The night I still picture you  ♫

674
01:03:23,630 --> 01:03:30,040
♫  It get clearer when I close my eyes  ♫

675
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:38,430
♫  I'm sick and I just miss you again  ♫

676
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:44,600
♫  To draw you even in a dream  ♫

677
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:52,080
♫  I'm afraid I'm going to wake up  ♫

678
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:56,420
♫  We...  ♫

679
01:03:56,460 --> 01:04:02,430
♫  With a dazzling beauty  ♫

680
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:10,620
♫  Please just stay with me as much as you remember  ♫

681
01:04:10,620 --> 01:04:16,290
♫  Even a little closer  ♫

682
01:04:16,290 --> 01:04:20,030
♫  Remember me as much as you missed me  ♫

683
01:04:20,030 --> 01:04:24,580
 The cat in this drama is fake. Any form of animal abuse was not committed.

684
01:04:25,510 --> 01:04:31,720
♫  And even as time goes by  ♫

685
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:39,250
♫  This place to stay for a long time  ♫

686
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:41,110

687
01:04:41,110 --> 01:04:43,760
 Are you sure only the two of us will stay at this house?

688
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:46,510
 I hope that you make yourself comfortable at least while you're staying here.

689
01:04:46,510 --> 01:04:49,310
 If I succeed with time travel, I will make sure to come and visit you.

690
01:04:49,310 --> 01:04:51,700
 I will be sure to wait until you come, Professor.

691
01:04:51,700 --> 01:04:53,940
 This is the fate that I chose for myself.

692
01:04:53,940 --> 01:04:56,960
 The woman who was beside me when my foot was cut off...

693
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:58,520
 What have you done to Tae Yi?!

694
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:00,710
 Tae Yi, don't ever come back.

695
01:05:00,710 --> 01:05:02,440
 Tell me.  What are you hiding?

696
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:04,470
 He definitely is not someone who would die.

697
01:05:04,470 --> 01:05:06,160
 Professor!

698
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:10,930
♫  I miss you even when I'm with you  ♫
