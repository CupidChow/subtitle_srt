1
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:32,940
 "Today...

2
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,480
 only comes once." 
- Dante -

3
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:38,410

4
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:47,980

5
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,090
What is that?

6
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:05,430
What's wrong?

7
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:07,830
There is a drone flying

8
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:10,150
in front of my window.

9
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:20,760

10
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:23,130
Professor!

11
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:34,900
I will be right there!  Don't hang up and stay on campus until I get there.

12
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:56,730
Hello?  Professor?

13
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,990
Lieutenant.

14
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:24,810
Lieutenant!

15
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,820
Hey, there's been an accident here!

16
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,970
My gosh. What happened?

17
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,350
What?

18
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,630
What happened?

19
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:38,660
 - Oh, what happened? 
 - 911, hurry!

20
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:40,380
There is no one here!

21
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,870
Someone, please report it!

22
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:45,660
- I will do it. 
 - There is no one in the back, either!

23
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:48,160
- Maybe they fell? 
 - Check the trunk!

24
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:53,260
 The moment the child becomes a time traveler,

25
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:56,000
 the prophecy will begin.

26
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:58,510
 But the moment of fate...

27
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:01,320
 has not yet arrived.

28
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:28,110

29
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:55,980

30
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:59,850

31
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,510
Excuse me, where is the professor?

32
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:18,460
The professor just went to teach.

33
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:19,850
Where is the lecture hall, please?

34
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:23,080
Lecture Hall 7 at room 318 in the second building.

35
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,140

36
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:41,350

37
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:43,110
Can I help you?

38
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:46,250
I am sorry.  I think I am in the wrong lecture hall.

39
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:49,450

40
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:56,550
Excuse me,  would you happen to know where Professor Yoon Tae Yi is?

41
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:59,510
- Who? 
 - I am looking for Physics Professor Yoon Tae Yi.

42
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:03,070
There is no professor by that name in the Physics Department.

43
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:07,690
Perhaps, are you looking for student Yoon Tae Yi?

44
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:09,970

45
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,350
Are you all right?  What happened to the drone?

46
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:21,760
What?

47
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,430
But why are you sitting here?

48
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:26,960
What are you, Mister?  Do you know me?

49
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:32,190
Excuse me, how about taking your lovers' quarrel outside, please.

50
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,120
Professor, let them be.

51
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,090
That's right.  Hey, keep going!

52
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:41,360
- It looks good! 
  -  Wooo!

53
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:44,300
Student Yoon Tae Yi?

54
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:57,930

55
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,930
If someone who looks exactly like me comes through that door,

56
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:09,550
who can clearly explain the situation?

57
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:10,740
I can!

58
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:14,310
The theory of Parallel Universe based on Erwin Schrödinger wave mechanics?

59
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,610
- B! 
 - Me!

60
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:21,150
The endless repetition and replication of the universe due to the Big Bang Theory.  In other words, the possibility that doppelgängers exist.

61
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:23,880
- B+! 
 - Me! Ant-Man and the Wasp?

62
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,560
Get out.

63
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:33,330
As earlier said, the Big Bang Theory states that the universe is too big so...

64
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:37,120
it's not one but several.  According to quantum mechanics,

65
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,660
more than one of the same object can exist in the same space.

66
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:46,190
However, Quantum Physics, the Big Bang Theory, and the Theory of Parallel Universe...

67
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:48,530
None of them are the answer to my question.

68
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:52,770
Unfortunately, we cannot explain it yet.  This is the correct answer.

69
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:58,440
This is the reason why we need to learn Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle.

70
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:02,530
Do we really need to learn such an uncertain study?

71
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:04,560
- I agree! 
  - Right!

72
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,600
Of course, we must!  We must prove it is uncertain.

73
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:12,850
As a trivia, Heisenberg presented his Uncertainty Principle when he was 26 years old.

74
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:17,940
So, you guys go out right now and discover a new principle.  That's it for today's lecture.

75
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:20,990
 - Yes! 
 - All right!

76
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,580
 Thank you.

77
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:35,240
 Why can't I get in touch with you?  It is worrying me...

78
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:44,930
 Did you travel through time or something?

79
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:52,990
 Call me.

80
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:56,710

81
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:04,550
- Professor! 
 - Why are you doing this?

82
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:08,780
- Don't you know me? 
 - Are you famous?

83
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,970
- No, I am not. 
 - Then, how would I know you?

84
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:15,330
May I ask how old you are?

85
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:17,900
I am 22 years old.  Why?

86
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,560
You are not 32 years old?

87
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:23,550
Are you saying I look old? Are you blind?

88
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:32,580
Yes.  Why?

89
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:37,220
Of course, I know that there will be a super blood moon today.

90
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:40,650
 I was going to drink while watching the lunar eclipse.

91
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:43,960
 "Lunar eclipse?"  Why do you watch that kind of stuff?

92
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:47,740
 This lunar eclipse is the super blood moon and it only happens once every decade.

93
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,920
 It is very special.

94
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:55,970
 If I miss this one this year, in 2010, I'll probably never see another one before I die.

95
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:59,430
 No, that's okay.  I will just see it alone.

96
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:02,890
- What are you doing?! 
 - What year is this?

97
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,510
It's 2010.

98
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:14,920
What was that?  He looks perfectly fine.

99
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:24,740

100
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,490
 Hello?

101
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:38,820
Who is this?

102
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:44,760
Is it you, Mom?

103
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,570
 Son?

104
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:51,350
Aren't you in class?

105
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,680
Is it really you, Mom?

106
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:58,970
 Jin Gyeom, what's wrong?

107
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:01,080
 Is anything wrong?

108
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,650
Where are you?

109
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:09,560
I am home, of course.

110
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:16,700
Jin Gyeom!

111
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,860
 Mom, listen to me carefully.

112
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,600
 I will go there now.

113
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:24,530
I will go home, so

114
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,450
lock all the doors and windows.

115
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:30,380
Don't go outside, no matter what.

116
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:34,170
You must stay at home.  Do you understand?

117
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,780
Mom?

118
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:42,360
Mom!

119
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:14,340
You really didn't call me?

120
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,490
How would I call you when I am in the middle of a class?   It was probably a prank call.

121
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:19,880
Don't worry.

122
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:24,100
I am going back in.

123
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,250
Jin Gyeom.

124
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:31,110
Recently, did anyone come to visit you?

125
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:33,090
Who?

126
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:36,360
Just... anyone.

127
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,130
No.

128
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:42,760
If any stranger comes to visit you, let me know right away.

129
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,530
Okay.

130
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,880

131
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:06,450
 The phone is turned off. Please leave a message after the tone.

132
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:11,260
What is with this guy?

133
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,830
Why are you like this?

134
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:34,210
Do you happen to know where Lieutenant Park Jin Gyeom is?

135
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:36,020
It's all your fault.

136
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:38,570
Jin Gyeom became strange after meeting you!

137
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:41,760
He drank although he never drinks, and he's ignoring my calls!

138
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,070
- What are you talking about? 
 - Where is Jin Gyeom?

139
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:45,370
I asked, where is Jin Gyeom?

140
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:47,460
That's what I mean.  What are you talking about?

141
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:49,330
Jin Gyeom disappeared.

142
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:52,980
He was in an accident, but he disappeared into thin air!

143
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:18,360
 Ah! This is nice.

144
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,380
 Why do you drink when it's not good for your body?

145
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:26,790
If you are curious, would you like some?

146
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:28,030
No.

147
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:31,760
If anyone, your parent should be the one to teach you how to drink.

148
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,640
 I need to study later.

149
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:38,060
 It's your mom's birthday.  Is studying so important?

150
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:40,270
 You finished it anyway.

151
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:44,260
 You are right.  I was going to drink while watching the lunar eclipse.

152
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,660
 "Lunar eclipse?"

153
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:48,690
It's a super blood moon that hasn't happened in 10 years.

154
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:53,130
If I miss this one, I probably will not be able to see another one before I die.

155
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:55,180
 I better hurry and go buy some more.

156
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:58,490
 You'll drink with me, right?

157
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,880
It was you.  I knew it.

158
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,590
You don't have time for this.  Your mom's in danger.

159
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:18,110
- What? 
 - I said your mom's in danger.

160
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,040
Tonight is the night of the blood moon.

161
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:26,490
Mom!

162
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:32,310
If you want to save your mom, hurry up and go.  Hurry, go!

163
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,800
Mom.

164
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,790
My son.

165
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:17,190
You grew up to be handsome.

166
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:19,550
I am sorry, Mom.

167
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:23,620
I wanted to protect you.

168
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:30,020
It's okay.

169
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:33,150
My son.

170
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:36,380
Everything's okay.

171
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:46,450
Jin Gyeom.

172
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:53,800
Time card, where is it?

173
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:59,130
Can you give it to me?

174
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:01,170
Yes.

175
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:28,320
You...

176
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:32,920
shouldn't be here.

177
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:36,640
Mom, what do we do?

178
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,440
I can't leave like this.

179
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:44,020
Who is it?  Who did this to you?

180
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:47,420
You can't get involved in this fight.

181
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:52,800
Who is it?  Who did this to you?

182
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:59,510
To see you all grown up like this,

183
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:04,490
Mom is so happy.

184
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:09,490
Don't ever come back and

185
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:16,180
you have to live happily.

186
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,170
Mom.

187
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:24,270
 Mom!

188
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,840
Mom!

189
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:42,290
Mom, what happened?  Who did this to you?

190
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:50,190
Mom, hang on just for a little while.  I will call 911.

191
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:27,770

192
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:44,030

193
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:54,600
♫  Even as time goes by  ♫

194
00:19:54,600 --> 00:20:02,370
♫  And if you're going through this messy life  ♫

195
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:09,580
♫  When there is no end in sight  ♫

196
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:18,330
♫  I'll trust every moment of you  ♫

197
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:25,550
♫  From the beginning, I'll follow my chosen fate  ♫

198
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:29,170
♫  And tomorrow will be yesterday  ♫

199
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:31,160
The Alcubierre drive proves...

200
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:37,430
that faster than light space travel can be made possible by distorting spacetime.

201
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:40,130
♫  With you  ♫

202
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:43,110
♫  One day and somewhere  ♫

203
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:45,120
One moment.

204
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,590
♫  I'll be with you  ♫

205
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:52,790
♫  Whenever, wherever, whatever  ♫

206
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:56,360
Is it because you're a lieutenant or is it just your personality?

207
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:00,160
How can you not call even once when people are so worried about you?

208
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:04,550
Why don't you call even once when you are alive and well like this?

209
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:07,870
I normally don't worry at all about anyone, but

210
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:12,280
do you even know how worried and nervous I was thinking that you got into an accident while talking to me on the phone?

211
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:18,450
Why aren't you saying anything, after making me feel guilty?

212
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:21,320
Lieutenant Park!

213
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:29,030
♫  Remember, forever don't forget  ♫

214
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:36,550
♫  It's a meaningless moment without you  ♫

215
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:45,390
♫  Whenever, wherever, whatever stay with you   ♫

216
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:55,910
♫  Today and tomorrow, I'll be with you  ♫

217
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:03,860
 I'll be back soon.

218
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:13,500
Drink up.

219
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:26,540
I'm sorry.

220
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:29,650
I've been discourteous again.

221
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:33,590
I didn't have any weird intentions. Please don't misunderstand.

222
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:39,740
Your mother and I must look very similar.

223
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:41,170
How did you know?

224
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:42,910
How could I not?

225
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:46,700
Anyone could tell from the way you've been treating me.

226
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:50,290
Asking if I'm over 50 with a son, then crying while hugging me.

227
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:52,600
How could I not know?

228
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,860
I apologize if I've offended you.

229
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:59,690
Do we really look that similar?

230
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:03,270
Enough for you to be reminded of her when you see me.

231
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:07,150
Yes, but just the appearance.

232
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:09,970
Your personalities are very different.

233
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:14,580
My mother was mild and tender.

234
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:16,750
She's a very good person.

235
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:19,130
How's my personality?

236
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,470
Of course, you also...

237
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:27,440
You...

238
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:31,580
So I mean, you also...

239
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:37,160
I'm sorry. I'm not good at telling lies.

240
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:42,240
Do you have any pictures of your mother?

241
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,280
I want to see.

242
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,640
I don't.

243
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,700
Why not?

244
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,650
Please excuse my recent actions.

245
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:52,340
If you see another drone, please let me know.

246
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:57,090
Where have you been since the accident for all this time?

247
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,940
You don't need to concern yourself with that.

248
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,480
I'm curious.

249
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:04,440
Where have you been for a week?

250
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:11,160
A week?

251
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,880
What do you mean?

252
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,960
Excuse me?

253
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:19,320
Was the accident... a week ago?

254
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,090
Yes.

255
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:28,000
Lieutenant.

256
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:33,600
Lieutenant!

257
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:37,510
Come to your senses, Lieutenant!

258
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:54,230
The reports from a week ago apparently weren't an error.

259
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:56,480
The wormhole opened again an hour ago.

260
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,060
- Who it is? 
 - Park Jin Gyeom.

261
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:02,150
Are you certain?

262
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:19,800
Who was driving the truck during the accident?

263
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,070
I can't figure it out.

264
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:25,060
It was a stolen truck, and the driver intentionally avoided all CCTVs while driving,

265
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:27,120
so there isn't a way to find out.

266
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,380
I think the police are also investigating,

267
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:31,730
but have no idea either.

268
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:34,960
How could Park Jin Gyeom travel through time?

269
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,660
We don't know that, either.

270
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:40,570
Hurry up and find out. Erase all records in the CCTV and dash cam footage.

271
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:42,470
Okay.

272
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:45,510
Where is Park Jin Gyeom right now?

273
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:47,120
In the hospital.

274
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:52,220
He must've been hurt since he didn't go through the departure gate.

275
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:06,760
Are you feeling okay?

276
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,680
Yes, I'm okay.

277
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,660
Do you know how surprised I was?

278
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:24,420
I'm sorry I shocked you.

279
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:27,970
Were you in a power plant for a week?

280
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:30,750
What do you mean?

281
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:33,840
You're curious about what the hospital exam results show, aren't you?

282
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:38,400
You're a patient who suffered a car accident, but there are no signs of a fracture, rupture, nor sprain.

283
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,760
There's something even more strange.

284
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:47,700
Because of this, there was an error in the CT.

285
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:51,980
I thought that was so interesting, I looked into the radioactivity of this card.

286
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:55,390
And it is 6.3 microsieverts.

287
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:58,860
Do you have any idea how high that is?

288
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:04,320
The natural radiation level in this country is 0.3 microsieverts at most.

289
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:09,600
But... this card has more than 20 times the amount of  radiation.

290
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:14,500
Where were you for a week?

291
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:17,890
I'm asking where you were.

292
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:24,260
Where is Seok Oh Won now?

293
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:32,150
Excuse me. Hey!

294
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:34,200
You can't enter!

295
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,460
Excuse me. You may not enter!

296
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:37,880
Please leave.

297
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:42,020
It's all right. Take your leave.

298
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:48,300
Please have a seat.

299
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:59,330
Ten years ago, you came to my house.

300
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:05,070
Talking about that again?

301
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:06,750
How did you know my mom?

302
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:09,030
I've already told you I don't know your mother.

303
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:10,590
No.

304
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:17,190
You knew my mom would die on the night of the blood moon.

305
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:23,870
Why do you act like you know nothing when you're not even the killer?

306
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:32,270
Lieutenant Park Jin Gyeom, I looked into it and found that you have a history of mental illness.

307
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:38,360
You sound like you're in the early stage of reticulosis.

308
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:41,370
Shall I introduce you to a psychiatrist I know?

309
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,530
What do you know?

310
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:51,830
What I know is the frustration of a son who could not catch his mother's killer.

311
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:57,950
If you really want to find the suspect, why not try looking for your father?

312
00:28:57,950 --> 00:29:01,370
Wouldn't your father know something you don't?

313
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:06,240
For example, what she was like before she got married.

314
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,460
Did you look into my family?

315
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:13,180
I've just did a little bit of research because you keep suspecting me.

316
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:18,300
 Park Jin Gyeom time traveled?  How?

317
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,650
He had an unregistered time card.

318
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:24,790
It's also weird that someone tried to kill Park Jin Gyeom.

319
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:28,110
There must be something we don't know about.

320
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:33,010
We can't fully control it, anyway.

321
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:35,080
First, track down the time card.

322
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:37,560
It's not that simple.

323
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,860
He traveled time illegally, without our knowing.

324
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:43,700
He'll continue to suspect and investigate our existence.

325
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,880
We can't just brush this incident aside.

326
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,890
What do you plan on doing?

327
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:52,910
We've to kidnap Park Jin Gyeom and bring him to Alice.

328
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,700
Don't worry too much.

329
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:05,320
He called because he's safe.

330
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:08,010
He may have jumped off the car prior to the accident,

331
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:10,310
and the witnesses might've missed that.

332
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:14,750
How long is the jail time when you're arrested for murder?

333
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:16,020
Why are you asking that?

334
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:21,740
When Jin Gyeom comes back, I might kill him.

335
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:27,860
Let's just compromise with a broken leg.

336
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:30,240
Could it be that someone tried to kill Jin Gyeom?

337
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,180
We're looking into it, so wait just a little bit.

338
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:34,550
You still haven't caught them?

339
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:36,450
Can't you trust me?

340
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:41,520
I know I'm at the corner of the office now, but I used to be quite the detective in the old days.

341
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:46,550
Jin Gyeom was unjustly arrested under a false charge because of you in high school.

342
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:48,590
That's because you, with your eyes wide open...

343
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:53,050
claimed with certainty that Jin Gyeom was the suspect.

344
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,660
That's true.

345
00:30:57,810 --> 00:31:01,750
I just got a call from Lieutenant Park.

346
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:03,500
Where is he?

347
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:27,210
You were in the ER?

348
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:28,660
What did they say?

349
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:30,010
They say I'm fine.

350
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:33,290
Really? You're not hurt at all?

351
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:34,910
No.

352
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:39,060
That's good. I guess I can hit you all I want.

353
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:55,340
How could you not call even once for a week?!

354
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:58,800
Do you know how worried I was thinking that you might be dead?

355
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:01,200
I am sorry for worrying you.

356
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,290
Why didn't you call?

357
00:32:03,290 --> 00:32:04,840
I couldn't get any cellphone reception.

358
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,960
Where were you?

359
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:09,060
Somewhere far away.

360
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:11,340
Far away where?

361
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,850
I will tell you when everything becomes certain.

362
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:20,210
Why did you go to the emergency room with that professor?

363
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:23,460
You still think that she is your mom?

364
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:26,000
Not anymore.

365
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:31,730
I saw it for myself that she is not related at all.

366
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:34,020
What does that mean?

367
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,890
I got it.

368
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:46,910
You look tired so we can talk about the rest tomorrow.  Get some sleep.

369
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:50,160
I am going to sleep here tonight, too.

370
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:56,050
Let's go to the hospital as soon as you get up tomorrow.  I need to see it for myself for certain that you are okay.

371
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:57,880
They said I don't have any injuries.

372
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:00,430
But you were in an accident.

373
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:03,380
Big or small, it's an accident, regardless.

374
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:08,010
Getting shot with a gun softly doesn't mean that it won't hurt, so go with me to the hospital tomorrow.

375
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:10,170
There is someone I need to find.

376
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:13,600
Mister will catch the suspect.

377
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,310
Not the suspect.

378
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:17,270
Then who?

379
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:20,040
My father.

380
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:23,220
Why your father, all of a sudden?

381
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:27,050
Wasn't there anything you learned about my father during the course of investigating my mom's case?

382
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:29,900
There is something I need to confirm when I find him.

383
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,880
Something's up with you, right?

384
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:38,890
Don't you think it's strange that you were gone for a week and suddenly you show up and want to find your father?

385
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:41,380
Explain what's going on first.

386
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:43,890
There is nothing to explain.

387
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:45,850
I just want to find my father, that's all.

388
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:47,710
So, why?

389
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:53,390
You've never once looked for your father before.  You said you hated your father because he abandoned your mom.

390
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:54,810
So, why find him?

391
00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:58,660
I am not looking for him because I am curious about what kind of person he is.

392
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:03,940
I am looking for him because he is the only person who knows about my mom's past that I don't know about.

393
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:12,590
At that time, we also looked into your father, but

394
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:14,260
you know it, too...

395
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:17,950
how many single mothers are out there.

396
00:34:20,430 --> 00:34:22,150
I understand.

397
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:25,330
How is your health?

398
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:27,960
You sure do ask early.

399
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,410
When you didn't even come once for a hospital visit.

400
00:34:29,410 --> 00:34:33,300
I was going to visit you after I caught the punk who did that to you.

401
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:39,050
If you are going to make an excuse, at least be imaginative.  Why do all the ones who didn't visit have the same repertoire?

402
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:03,790
Hello.

403
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:05,100
I am Jin Gyeom.

404
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,320
Who?

405
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,180
I am Park Jin Gyeom.

406
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:12,130
The green gated house.  That kid?

407
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:14,630
Oh, that's right.

408
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:20,090
After your mom died, the police asked me so that's what I told them.

409
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:24,220
How did you know?  Did you hear it directly from my mom?

410
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:28,190
It's not like your mom is the type to talk about herself.

411
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:32,950
I happened to see her talking on the phone over there.

412
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:36,480
 That day your mom came to get some meat.

413
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:43,170
Are you sure that the person my mother was talking to was my father?

414
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:48,070
It's not for certain.  It just felt that way, that's all.

415
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:52,540
Even to the police, I told them that it felt like it was the husband, not that it was for certain.

416
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:57,760
Anyway, your mom's behavior was not normal.

417
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:02,280
She was trembling the whole time she was on the phone.

418
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:12,110
Okay.  Keep monitoring him.  We need to catch him alive tonight.

419
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:13,830
Yes, Team Leader!

420
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:33,120
Do you think Park Jin Gyeom will get caught?

421
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:35,250
We will have to catch him.

422
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,390
Wait.

423
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:41,990
Did you personally collect the information on Park Jin Gyeom?

424
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:44,360
Yeah.  Why?

425
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:47,770
I think we need to re-investigate Park Jin Gyeom.

426
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:51,930
It's not like you can time travel just because you have the time card.

427
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:54,410
Okay.  I will look into it again.

428
00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:56,420
Please take care of it.

429
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,420
Unnie, did the result come out?

430
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:15,750
Yeah, but this is really strange.

431
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:19,060
How did you know?  Did they conduct an experiment there?

432
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:21,330
Don't beat around the bush.  Hurry up and tell me.

433
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:22,910
On the 7th and the 14th,

434
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:28,500
on both days, the radiation readings on the roads spiked by more than 40 times.

435
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:32,400
Okay, got it.  Thanks, Senior.

436
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:51,180

437
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:56,400
What are you investigating?

438
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,420
You don't need to know.

439
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:04,770
Am I even your partner?

440
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,050
Look at this.

441
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:14,700
Ah, look at this.  My clothes are loose because of muscle loss.

442
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:18,010
This is all because I was looking for you, Lieutenant.

443
00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:21,080
I couldn't even work out properly for a week.

444
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:27,220
You were locked up somewhere for a week, weren't you?

445
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:33,190
Don't be embarrassed and just tell me honestly.

446
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:36,040
What kind of punks were they?  I will take care of them.

447
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:39,180
You wouldn't believe me even if I told you.

448
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:44,210
I know you don't say empty words so just tell me.

449
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:50,850
Would you believe me if I told you that I was in Seoul in the Year 2010?

450
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:52,460
Sorry?

451
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:56,620
Is that so hard to believe?

452
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:59,310
I lived in Seoul in 2010, too.

453
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:01,180
I lived in Seoul at that time, too.

454
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:02,730
Me, too.

455
00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:04,800
See? Everyone lived in Seoul.

456
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:21,810
You suddenly disappeared from a car that was involved in an accident, then reappear after a week...

457
00:39:21,810 --> 00:39:24,640
You don't have any noticeable injury.  Instead,

458
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:27,380
the radiation readings went up.

459
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:32,820
This is my theory.  You had become an invisible man or...

460
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:35,430
you time traveled.

461
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:40,330
But nearby CCTVs didn't capture any floating clothes.  So,

462
00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:43,420
that rules out invisible man.

463
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:46,420
That leaves just one, right?

464
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:52,240
It will be best if you don't get yourself involved in this matter.

465
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:56,310
This is not something that you want to approach simply with a scientist's curiosity.

466
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:15,470
Do you know why I became a physicist?

467
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:21,700
In truth, my mom really is a good mom but she is not my biological mom.

468
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:26,370
I was told that my biological mom left me at the orphanage and disappeared.

469
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:28,890
Lieutenant,

470
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:32,360
do you remember when you were 5 years old?

471
00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:37,260
I... remember my mom's smell.

472
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:40,500
Even though it was only for a day,

473
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:44,800
and so, I don't even remember my mom's face, but

474
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:50,440
her warm embrace and her smell,

475
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:53,390
I clearly remember them.

476
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:59,780
When my mom left me at the orphanage and didn't come back,

477
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:03,350
do you know what I thought about?

478
00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:07,440
Time travel.

479
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:13,430
If I travel through time and go back to the day I got separated from Mom,

480
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:16,230
I will not let her go, no matter what.

481
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,970
That's why I decided to become a scientist.

482
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:24,450
I also wanted to go see my mom.

483
00:41:25,490 --> 00:41:28,270
Lieutenant, you always asked me.

484
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:31,230
Is time travel possible?

485
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:33,670
This time, I will ask you.

486
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:38,530
Is time travel possible?

487
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:48,540
I know it doesn't make sense...

488
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:50,880
Yes.

489
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,680
You controlled time using that card.

490
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,980
Can you go again?

491
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:00,030
I'm not sure how it works yet.

492
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:03,470
Where's the card? I'll find out.

493
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:07,390
If we succeed,

494
00:42:07,390 --> 00:42:08,730
you can meet your mother.

495
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:12,630
Even though it doesn't make any sense, we could

496
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:15,680
save your mother.

497
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:20,870
Give me the card.

498
00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:22,670
Where is it?

499
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,980
Goodness.

500
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,690
Does a person really live here?

501
00:42:34,690 --> 00:42:37,790
Even a model house is messier than this.

502
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:44,280
Do you live with a girl?

503
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:46,090
It's Do Yeon's.

504
00:42:46,090 --> 00:42:47,890
Please have a seat.

505
00:42:50,330 --> 00:42:51,460
Would you like some coffee?

506
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:53,730
Yes, black coffee, please.

507
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:16,670
How do you know the reporter?

508
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:19,400
We're just friends. Please don't misunderstand.

509
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:22,740
I think you're a bit too understanding.

510
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:24,510
Reporter Kim is really pretty.

511
00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:26,100
What's the issue?

512
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:27,130
There isn't an issue.

513
00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:30,110
That's the issue, huh.

514
00:43:30,690 --> 00:43:35,070
Do you have someone else that you like?

515
00:43:35,590 --> 00:43:37,850
No, I don't.

516
00:43:37,850 --> 00:43:40,050
I don't like women.

517
00:43:41,130 --> 00:43:45,290
Oh, I think I get it now.

518
00:43:46,930 --> 00:43:49,640
It's all right. I understand.

519
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:54,280
Then... do you have a man that you like?

520
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:57,450
No. I also don't like men.

521
00:43:57,450 --> 00:43:59,300
Then, who do you like?

522
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:01,390
Do I have to like someone?

523
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:04,080
We don't like someone because we want to.

524
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:07,610
We just... are overtaken by emotions of liking someone, even without our knowing.

525
00:44:07,610 --> 00:44:11,400
When we think of them, we're happy and want to be with them.

526
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:14,340
- Have you never had anyone like that? 
 - Nope.

527
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:16,220
Not even once?

528
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:19,610
- Yes. 
 - Is that possible?

529
00:44:19,610 --> 00:44:24,170
It may be because I've alexithymia.

530
00:44:24,170 --> 00:44:25,460
You have aspermia? (mujeongjajeung) 
  (T/N: she mishears and confuses the medical condition which means infertility)

531
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:28,710
No. Alexithymia. (mugamjeongjeung)

532
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:31,020
Okay.

533
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:35,750
Isn't that like a psychopath?

534
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:38,450
My ability to experience emotions is a bit lacking,

535
00:44:38,450 --> 00:44:42,600
but that doesn't mean I break the laws of society or act out in violence.

536
00:44:44,230 --> 00:44:45,920
Please have this.

537
00:44:48,550 --> 00:44:50,990
You didn't drug this, did you?

538
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,750
I didn't.

539
00:44:58,210 --> 00:44:59,760
Why is it so bitter?

540
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,870
It's black coffee.

541
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:04,250
Oh, I see.

542
00:45:07,270 --> 00:45:09,610
But are you allowed

543
00:45:09,610 --> 00:45:12,380
to just be talking about stuff like this?

544
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:15,200
I've never thought of hiding it.

545
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:19,000
I don't care what others think.

546
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,050
You're really interesting.

547
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:24,510
I'm always so shocked every time I meet you,

548
00:45:24,510 --> 00:45:27,320
I think I keep losing weight.

549
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:34,210
Why?

550
00:45:34,210 --> 00:45:36,630
Are you sure you've weighed yourself?

551
00:45:36,630 --> 00:45:39,710
I think if anything, your cheeks have gotten a bit puffier.

552
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:42,390
I apologize.

553
00:45:42,390 --> 00:45:43,750
I was only being honest...

554
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:45,280
Stop being so honest!

555
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:48,850
Even a psychopath is less cruel than you.

556
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:57,940
But what kind of person with alexithymia cries so often?

557
00:45:57,940 --> 00:46:00,560
Maybe that's not what you have.

558
00:46:01,690 --> 00:46:05,180
Thanks to my mom, it's gotten a bit better.

559
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:09,140
Your mother must have struggled a lot.

560
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:14,200
If your mother really was a time traveler–

561
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:18,230
Let's stop talking about that.

562
00:46:20,990 --> 00:46:23,230
I'll bring you the card.

563
00:46:50,530 --> 00:46:51,920
Is it a blackout?

564
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:54,940
I guess things like this can still happen...

565
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:57,450
Do you have a flashlight or candles?

566
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:03,150

567
00:47:16,610 --> 00:47:18,270
What are you doing?

568
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:23,590
Lieutenant!

569
00:47:50,690 --> 00:47:52,650
What's wrong?

570
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:55,990
Stay behind me.

571
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:34,240
Please stay inside.

572
00:48:40,430 --> 00:48:42,270
What was that?

573
00:48:43,770 --> 00:48:45,470
Hye Soo.

574
00:48:45,470 --> 00:48:47,270
Jeong Hye Soo.

575
00:49:09,350 --> 00:49:11,050
Hye Soo!

576
00:49:29,770 --> 00:49:32,360
Hye Soo, what happened?

577
00:49:32,390 --> 00:49:34,010
Min Hyeok...

578
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:35,860
Who did this?

579
00:49:40,390 --> 00:49:41,600
Why did you turn the lights on?

580
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:43,570
We didn't do that.

581
00:49:43,570 --> 00:49:45,840
Get out of there immediately.

582
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:22,470
- Are you okay? 
 - Yes.

583
00:50:22,470 --> 00:50:25,110
I've never seen him before. Is he another broker?

584
00:50:25,110 --> 00:50:26,630
I'm not sure.

585
00:50:26,630 --> 00:50:29,820
He's the man that called the police.

586
00:50:29,830 --> 00:50:31,730
Then he must not be a broker.

587
00:50:31,730 --> 00:50:34,070
Since he would want to keep things low key.

588
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:36,540
Who could he be?

589
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:39,220
Why did he save Park Jin Gyeom?

590
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:50,890
Maybe a couple of kids in the area got into a fight.

591
00:50:50,890 --> 00:50:52,500
What did the caller say?

592
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:54,380
That's what was a bit weird.

593
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:57,090
He said there was a break-in in apartment 305,

594
00:50:57,090 --> 00:50:59,810
but 305 is your unit.

595
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:05,600
Is something wrong?

596
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:08,620
No.

597
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:12,790
Let's go. I'll escort you home.

598
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:27,870
- Good work. 
 - They will keep targeting Park Jin Gyeom.

599
00:51:27,870 --> 00:51:32,700
Park Jin Gyeom... Until he realizes his own fate,

600
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:35,180
we must keep protecting him.

601
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:36,690
Yes, Sir.

602
00:51:37,790 --> 00:51:42,310
You may go. Keep a close watch on him until I instruct you otherwise.

603
00:51:42,310 --> 00:51:43,860
Yes, Sir.

604
00:51:44,730 --> 00:51:47,180
That day is approaching.

605
00:51:48,630 --> 00:51:50,510
Be more careful in the future.

606
00:51:50,510 --> 00:51:52,320
Yes, Sir.

607
00:52:05,050 --> 00:52:08,650
Earlier... why did you draw your gun?

608
00:52:08,650 --> 00:52:11,750
You don't need to worry about that.

609
00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:15,130
Just in case, if anything happens while you're analyzing the contents of the card,

610
00:52:15,130 --> 00:52:17,300
please call me right away.

611
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:20,880
Please make sure Seok Oh Won

612
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:23,060
does not know anything about the card.

613
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:25,280
Are you still suspecting him?

614
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:28,320
I just want to warn you to be careful.

615
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:30,790
Unnie!

616
00:52:30,790 --> 00:52:32,560
Yeah.

617
00:52:33,670 --> 00:52:36,440
What the heck? Why are you with the pervert?

618
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:38,450
Why are you calling him a pervert?

619
00:52:38,450 --> 00:52:41,020
You said he was one.

620
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:42,920
When did I say that?

621
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:46,800
Sorry, my sister is kind but is a bit slow.

622
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,350
What the...

623
00:52:48,350 --> 00:52:50,750
Get home safely.

624
00:53:05,090 --> 00:53:07,750
- Unnie. 
 - Huh?

625
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:09,340
What's your relationship with the Lieutenant?

626
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:10,710
Just an acquaintance.

627
00:53:10,710 --> 00:53:13,250
- Is that all? 
 - Then what else?

628
00:53:13,250 --> 00:53:18,550
Well... I'm amazed to see you talk to a guy for more than a minute.

629
00:53:18,970 --> 00:53:21,440
Of all the things to be amazed by...

630
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:25,460
There are so many things that are fascinating in the world, but that's what you find amazing?

631
00:53:25,460 --> 00:53:28,390
That's why you don't make progress.

632
00:53:32,030 --> 00:53:35,020
Do you think I gained weight?

633
00:53:36,190 --> 00:53:37,820
I can't really tell.

634
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:39,860
Right?

635
00:53:54,390 --> 00:53:58,310

636
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:01,300
Alexithymia...

637
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:04,470

638
00:54:07,130 --> 00:54:07,940
What?

639
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:09,810

640
00:54:09,810 --> 00:54:12,620
Chief! Chief!

641
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:15,150
What is it? What?

642
00:54:15,150 --> 00:54:16,570
Is something the matter?

643
00:54:16,570 --> 00:54:19,130
Did you write this article?

644
00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:21,860
I wonder... Did I?

645
00:54:22,270 --> 00:54:25,520
It says you're the author.

646
00:54:26,290 --> 00:54:27,290

647
00:54:27,290 --> 00:54:29,460
Oh, I did write this!

648
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:31,550
This is my article.

649
00:54:31,550 --> 00:54:33,090
Did you investigate this yourself?

650
00:54:33,090 --> 00:54:36,360
Of course. Hey, back in my day,

651
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:37,960
we never asked others to investigate for us.

652
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:40,740
Do you still have the investigative files from this case?

653
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:44,250
Of course. That's the life of a reporter. I have all of it.

654
00:54:44,250 --> 00:54:45,780
Can you please show that to me.

655
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:47,050
Why?

656
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:51,610
The victim is someone I know, so I want to know if there's any information on the husband.

657
00:54:51,610 --> 00:54:53,200
Okay.

658
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:15,660

659
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:20,100
I'm serious! Our chief was behind that investigation,

660
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:23,600
and he said someone came to your house in the afternoon the day your mother died,

661
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:25,100
while you were at school.

662
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:27,690
- Are you certain? 
 - Yes.

663
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:31,840
Why?

664
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:34,870
I didn't hear about that from the Team Leader.

665
00:55:34,870 --> 00:55:36,680
I didn't see that in the files for that case either.

666
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:38,630
Really?

667
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:42,690
Our chief said that he told him...

668
00:55:42,690 --> 00:55:44,990
Maybe he just forgot.

669
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:47,890
Who was the person who came?

670
00:55:47,890 --> 00:55:52,950
I don't know who it was, but it wasn't your father.

671
00:55:52,950 --> 00:55:57,300
A man in their late 20s to early 30s.

672
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:02,520
Oh right! There's another thing I found out, too.

673
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:07,230
About a month before she was murdered, your mom visited someone in a prison.

674
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:09,480
My mom? Who?

675
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:11,610
Wait a minute.

676
00:56:17,610 --> 00:56:19,080

677
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:21,570
Have you heard of the name?

678
00:56:21,570 --> 00:56:22,970
No.

679
00:56:22,970 --> 00:56:25,550
I'm not sure what his relationship was with your mother,

680
00:56:25,550 --> 00:56:29,380
but this person is still in prison.

681
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:32,150
Which prison?

682
00:56:34,450 --> 00:56:36,280
I'll meet him alone.

683
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:38,590
No, I want to go with you.

684
00:56:38,590 --> 00:56:42,430
It's a personal investigation. I'll be uncomfortable with you there.

685
00:56:42,430 --> 00:56:45,230
Why are you hiding so many things from me lately?

686
00:56:45,230 --> 00:56:46,700
I don't want to worry you.

687
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:50,380
You're allowed to worry for me, but I'm not allowed to worry for you?

688
00:56:50,380 --> 00:56:53,380
Just give me a bit of time. Once I figure things out, I'll–

689
00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:56,450
Do you know why people go missing in the mountains?

690
00:56:56,450 --> 00:57:00,230
It's because they mistakenly think they'll find the way if they just go down the mountain.

691
00:57:00,230 --> 00:57:02,550
When you're lost, you have to ask for help.

692
00:57:02,550 --> 00:57:05,990
Instead of trying to resolve it on your own, you need to shout for help!

693
00:57:05,990 --> 00:57:08,820
This is something I need to solve alone.

694
00:57:09,390 --> 00:57:11,800
I'll drop you off here.

695
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:32,190
Don't misunderstand what I'm about to say.

696
00:57:32,190 --> 00:57:35,750
The person who's in prison right now is around your mother's age,

697
00:57:35,750 --> 00:57:38,020
and began his sentence in the year you were born.

698
00:57:38,020 --> 00:57:40,600
He could be your father.

699
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:44,220
That may be why your mother didn't say anything about him.

700
00:57:44,910 --> 00:57:49,550
So if you get to meet him, don't be rude.

701
00:57:49,550 --> 00:57:53,000
I don't care what kind of person my father is.

702
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,850
The only father I have is Mr. Ko.

703
00:58:00,550 --> 00:58:07,850
Some bastard tried to kill a fellow cop, but you guys haven't found anything about him in the last week? Answer me!

704
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:11,440
I feel like your body got bigger. All you did was work out, huh?

705
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:15,050
It's really not true. I want to find something, but I can't.

706
00:58:15,050 --> 00:58:18,900
To be honest, Lieutenant Park isn't really cooperating either.

707
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:20,820
Where's Jin Gyeom?

708
00:58:20,820 --> 00:58:23,240
He went to visit a prison with Reporter Kim.

709
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:25,490
What is he up to now?

710
00:58:25,490 --> 00:58:27,340
A prison?

711
00:59:07,630 --> 00:59:09,130
- Park Jin Gyeom? 
 - Yes.

712
00:59:09,130 --> 00:59:12,300
He's meeting Lee Se Hoon in prison.

713
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,050
 Let the people of this world punish you for your crimes here.

714
00:59:17,050 --> 00:59:18,880
 Argh!

715
00:59:26,970 --> 00:59:28,750
Who are you?

716
00:59:29,630 --> 00:59:31,430
Why are you here?

717
00:59:42,210 --> 00:59:44,340
Do you know this woman?

718
00:59:48,230 --> 00:59:50,080
 Give me the book.

719
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:55,430
 What the hell is in this book that everyone wants this?

720
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:06,060
Who are you?

721
01:00:06,660 --> 01:00:08,350
I'm this person's son.

722
01:00:08,350 --> 01:00:10,940
Why did you come looking for me?

723
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:13,250
How did you know my mother?

724
01:00:13,250 --> 01:00:15,470
Go ask her yourself.

725
01:00:15,470 --> 01:00:18,330
She passed away 10 years ago.

726
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:33,400
Why are you laughing?

727
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:36,870
It's interesting.

728
01:00:38,180 --> 01:00:41,830
Whoever comes by "The Book of Prophecy" either dies...

729
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:44,900
or ends up like me.

730
01:00:51,620 --> 01:00:53,780
What's "The Book of Prophecy?"

731
01:00:54,940 --> 01:00:57,000
You're her son,

732
01:00:58,460 --> 01:01:00,130
but you don't even know that?

733
01:01:00,130 --> 01:01:02,480
Did my mother

734
01:01:03,830 --> 01:01:06,330
die because of that?

735
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:10,000
What's written in the book?

736
01:01:14,460 --> 01:01:16,370
Are you curious?

737
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:21,920

738
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:28,500
It's the end.

739
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:30,460
The end?

740
01:01:31,170 --> 01:01:34,420
The end of time travel.

741
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:40,750

742
01:01:40,750 --> 01:01:43,840
♫  My love will bring us back  ♫

743
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:47,880
♫  Ain't nobody holding me back  ♫

744
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:49,780
♫  We be like Bonnie and Clyde  ♫

745
01:01:49,780 --> 01:01:51,490
♫  We ride or die  ♫

746
01:01:51,490 --> 01:01:54,510
♫  We tight  ♫

747
01:01:54,510 --> 01:01:57,460
♫  My love will bring us back  ♫

748
01:01:57,460 --> 01:02:01,600
♫  Ain't nobody holding me back  ♫

749
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:03,420
♫  We be like Bonnie and Clyde  ♫

750
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:05,440
♫  We ride or die  ♫

751
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:06,750
♫  Like Bonnie and Clyde  ♫

752
01:02:06,750 --> 01:02:08,510
♫  We ride or die  ♫

753
01:02:08,510 --> 01:02:09,730

754
01:02:09,730 --> 01:02:11,300
 - I saw him. 
 - Who?

755
01:02:11,300 --> 01:02:12,650
 The man from the picture in 1992.

756
01:02:12,650 --> 01:02:15,330
 He's going to kill four more people.

757
01:02:15,330 --> 01:02:18,370
 Did you know there was a super blood moon 10 years ago?

758
01:02:18,370 --> 01:02:20,890
 What does that have to do with my mom's death?

759
01:02:20,890 --> 01:02:23,880
 If you were in my situation, you would've done the same.

760
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:25,090
 Let her go!

761
01:02:25,090 --> 01:02:28,540
 A program similar to the one I'm researching is in this card.

762
01:02:28,540 --> 01:02:30,710
 The card that Park Jin Gyeom was carrying emitted a signal.

763
01:02:30,710 --> 01:02:33,190
 Have you lost someone you've loved before?

764
01:02:33,190 --> 01:02:36,440
 You... What's your identity?
