 "To be able to give birth to a dancing star,

2
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:39,600
 one must have chaos in oneself."
 - Friedrich Nietzche -

3
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:46,430

4
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:53,040

5
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,780
Mom!

6
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:04,530
Mom.

7
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:07,200
Mom.

8
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:17,200
Mom.

9
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:20,540
Mom.

10
00:01:56,830 --> 00:02:02,160
It was really... you?

11
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,100
 She opened the forbidden door of time,

12
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:26,700
 and saw a world she should not have crossed over.

13
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:31,320
 Now the punishment she must take has been sentenced.

14
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,970
 In order to close the door of time,

15
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:38,160
 she must kill her beloved son.

16
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,140
 But as her punishment for opening the door of time,

17
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:44,380
 she shall lose her life in the hands of her son.

18
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,920
 The son will become the killer of all beings and destroyer of all things,

19
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,610
 and shall reign over time.

20
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,480
Lieutenant!

21
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:22,560

22
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:39,010
Tell me!  Did you do it?

23
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:42,380
Tell me it isn't true.

24
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,800
Tell me is isn't true, you bastard!

25
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,510
Professor!  Professor!

26
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,830
Lieutenant!

27
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:23,150

28
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,440
Hey, you!

29
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:42,020
It's been more than 10 days since the incident report,

30
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:46,440
and all you can tell me is that no ashes of a corpse were found in the car?!

31
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:50,090
Hey! If there is nothing, doesn't that mean that she is dead?

32
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:54,590
If she's not dead, you just need to go find her!

33
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:56,950
What do you even mean by "ashes" and "corpse?"

34
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:59,780
Do you really want to kill my child that way?

35
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,440
Dad, that's enough!

36
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,280
Will Sis come back because you are like this?

37
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,570
That's right, Honey.  Stop now.

38
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:08,680
The detective's colleague is missing as well.

39
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:16,310
Tae Yi, where are you now?

40
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:20,700
Honey, get up.

41
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:25,850
Honey, nothing bad could have happened to our Tae Yi, right?

42
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:28,440
Of course not.   It's Tae Yi we are talking about.

43
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:32,270
Nothing happened.  I guarantee it.

44
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:38,480
Please excuse us for the trouble we caused.

45
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,920
I am sorry.

46
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:46,330

47
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,590
Thank you.

48
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:04,900
Are you all right?

49
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,590
I've had worse.

50
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:12,180
It's harder for the professor's family and you than me.

51
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,010
I wonder if they really are time traveling or something.

52
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:20,850
I would prefer that they are.

53
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:24,740
Because that would mean that they can come back at any time.

54
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:28,070
They will come back for sure.

55
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,140
I am sorry about earlier.

56
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:40,390
Keep your chin up. If you didn't do it, I would have raised a ruckus.

57
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:44,870
Aren't you hungry?  Let's eat something.

58
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:48,120
We need to have the energy to look for Tae Yi.

59
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,210

60
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:56,160
Uh? I must've left the lights on.

61
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,280
No. The lights just came on.

62
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,080
You saw it, too. Right?

63
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:07,230
I locked the door, so who couldâ€”

64
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,390

65
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:27,710
Mom!

66
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:30,380
- Tae Yi! 
 - Sis.

67
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:36,200
What happened to you?  Where have you been?

68
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,400
Mom, that's enough.

69
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,000
I asked you where have you been?

70
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,700
Where have you been?

71
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:43,670
Honey.  Honey!

72
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:47,710
Are you hurt anywhere?

73
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:52,410
Dad, I am back. Right?

74
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:56,290
This is our home, right?

75
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:59,340
Unnie, what's wrong?

76
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:03,720
What is this blood?

77
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:08,590
Did you get hurt?  What's wrong?

78
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,140
It's not my blood.

79
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:13,260
Then whose blood is it?

80
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,420
Lieutenant got hurt.

81
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:18,090
We have to find Lieutenant.

82
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:22,450
Mom, I will be right back.  Don't worry.

83
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:24,630
Tae Yi!

84
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:39,280
Where could he have gone?

85
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,360
Park Jin Gyeom, when you come back,

86
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,250
I am not going to let you off the hook this time.

87
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:04,170
But if you don't come back, that's it!  The end!

88
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,210
 Do Yeon.

89
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,640
I must be crazy.

90
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,220
I am now even hearing things.

91
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:31,350
Do Yeon.

92
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:39,050
Jin Gyeom! Jin Gyeom!

93
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:44,120
Park Jin Gyeom!

94
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,250
Hello?

95
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:58,630

96
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:06,420
Lieutenant!

97
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,550
Is Lieutenant all right?

98
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:15,070
Why are you asking me that?  You should let me know.

99
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:16,880
Where have you been?

100
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,100
Who did that to Jin Gyeom?

101
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,470
I don't know either.

102
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:36,480
It's was too dark and I was scared.

103
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:41,150

104
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:42,620
Doctor.

105
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:45,300
Fortunately, the injury missed the organs.

106
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:49,740
The injury is being sutured and he is being given a blood transfusion, so he should be waking up soon.

107
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,590
Thank you.

108
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:57,100

109
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,630
Are you okay?

110
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:34,890
I am glad that you came back with me.

111
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:37,610
Thanks to you.

112
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:41,490
All this time, time travel was possible for us

113
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:44,100
because of you.

114
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,500
I think that the child described in "The Book of Prophecy,"

115
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:51,620
who was born by opening the door of time

116
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:57,590
and reigns over time, is you.

117
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:03,230
The reason why time travelers targeted you until now,

118
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:08,860
and the reason why your mother hid the last page, is all because of your ability.

119
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:26,720
I don't understand everything on the last page.

120
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:31,500
There may be metaphors or symbolism used as well.

121
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:37,310
But it is certain that your mother researched a way to stop time travel.

122
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:42,000
Probably, that's what "creation" means.

123
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:50,430
Please forget this piece of paper.

124
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:52,630
There is an error already.

125
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:58,180
The culprit who murdered my mother is neither me nor the high school student who was there.

126
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:00,020
The punk who attacked you

127
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:03,040
and stabbed me,

128
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,520
he's the culprit.

129
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:08,160
Is he the culprit?

130
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:29,150
He murdered my mother with this sword.

131
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:36,690
But your mother died of a gunshot wound though.

132
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:40,220
I find that strange, too.

133
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:45,980
It was definitely a gunshot ten years ago, but this time it's a stab.

134
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:57,480
Did we go to a different dimension?

135
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,070
It doesn't matter a different dimension or wherever,

136
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:07,560
my mother was murdered at the same place and same time.

137
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:12,200
The killer wouldn't have changed.

138
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:36,750
Excuse me.

139
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:54,630
How is Park Jin Gyeom?

140
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:56,590
He seems to be okay.

141
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:59,240
Were you able to check on which time period he had been in?

142
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,650
Wait just for a little while.

143
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:03,410
What about Shi Young?

144
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:05,030
She won't say anything.

145
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:07,570
We can't just keep her locked up like this.

146
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:10,240
I'll have to notify headquarters and arrange for deportation.

147
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,440
Not until I hear an answer.

148
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,130
I have to know why she tried to kidnap Professor Yoon Tae Yi.

149
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:16,980
Are you asking that because you don't know?

150
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:19,550
You know how Shi Young feels about you.

151
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:23,440
She probably wanted to kill Yoon Tae Yi of the past.

152
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:28,020
No.  If she wanted to kill her, she wouldn't have gone through the trouble of kidnapping her.

153
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,420
There's definitely another reason.

154
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:55,870
I don't want to stay here any longer.

155
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:57,750
I'll go back to headquarters.

156
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,810
First, there is something you need to do for me.

157
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:05,130
After that, I'll let you return to headquarters with Min Hyeok.

158
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:08,260
Min Hyeok will stay here.

159
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:14,010
Because Park Jin Gyeom is here and... Tae Yi's here, too.

160
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:19,460
Staying for the two of them won't happen.

161
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:54,040
Wouldn't it be better to go to the police?

162
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:57,150
If we don't have any sample to compare it with, wouldn't it be meaningless?

163
00:17:57,150 --> 00:18:00,190
The culprit will get caught at some point.

164
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:02,700
When that happens, we need this evidence.

165
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:34,570
 The son, who is the destroyer,

166
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:38,660
 will only die by her creation

167
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:44,010
 and the time that had been stopped will flow again.

168
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:49,100
If you stop time travel, everything resets.

169
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,770
"Reset?"

170
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:54,020
It becomes a world in which time travel never existed,

171
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:56,340
and all time travelers disappear.

172
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:58,310
Isn't that what we want?

173
00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:02,460
No. We can't reset.

174
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:05,220
We've already come too far.

175
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:10,190
Why did she say that we can't reset?

176
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:20,670
Lieutenant!

177
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:22,780
When did you come?

178
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,700
Welcome back.

179
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,830
Wait a moment.

180
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:32,260
I'm sorry.

181
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:34,700
I was so happy to see you, so I wasn't thinking.

182
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:37,910
You are so happy to see me, but you didn't visit me at the hospital?

183
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:40,230
I was going to visit, but they said you'll get dischargedâ€”

184
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:43,840
Uh! You just made a joke, didn't you?

185
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:46,860
Joke!

186
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:55,750
Did you bring this from the year 2010?

187
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,420
And the blood on it is yours?

188
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:59,250
Yes.

189
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:01,910
It doesn't seem manufactured at a factory.

190
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:06,340
Would we be able to find it?  It was a weapon used ten years ago.

191
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:10,830
It's an unusual sword so we should be able to find something.

192
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:17,820
Have you seen this sword?

193
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:20,310
No, I have not seen it before.

194
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:22,030
Thank you.

195
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:28,530
Wait!  Wait!  Let me take a look at the sword.

196
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:33,850
That's right! Right! Try over there.

197
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:35,540
Thank you.

198
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:38,820
Welcome.

199
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:46,960
Is this the sword that you used to own?

200
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,880
Ten years ago, I bought it at an auction because it was so unusual.

201
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,680
Then I sold it to a customer.

202
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,780
Was it also ten years ago when you sold it to a customer?

203
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:58,510
No, it was recent.

204
00:20:58,510 --> 00:20:59,910
"It was recent?"

205
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:03,890
Maybe about ten days?

206
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:06,220
Do you remember the customer's face?

207
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:09,300
How would I remember that?

208
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:14,020
But aren't you acquainted with the customer who bought the sword?

209
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,860
Why would you think that?

210
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:20,330
There is only one such sword, but you have it.

211
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:23,520
Isn't it possible that there is another one exactly like this?

212
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,110
Young fellow, you don't seem to know.

213
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:32,200
A sword like this, you cannot duplicate it even if you wanted to.

214
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:38,260
So you are saying that ten days ago someone bought the sword that was found ten years ago?

215
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:42,650
Yes.  We need to find who that person is quickly.

216
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:44,060
I understand.  I will look into it.

217
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:47,280
Okay. Thank you.

218
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:09,530
It'll be hard to make progress of any kind in your current state.

219
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:11,900
You should stay in the hospital a bit longer.

220
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:14,890
Who are you to come in here?

221
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:19,640
Where did you time travel to? What happened there?

222
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:22,860
I'm trying to help.

223
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:37,740
This sword... Have you seen it?

224
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:41,060
Give it to me. I'll look into it.

225
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:45,720
It's one of you.

226
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:50,320
I know. So give it to me.

227
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:55,970
I've seen my mother die three times.

228
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,940
I'm going to catch him.

229
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,730
Get better first.

230
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:16,080
You...

231
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:22,890
Don't think of yourself as a special person to me.

232
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:44,970

233
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:31,610
 Mr. Lee Min Hyeok, I have something to ask you.

234
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:33,440
 - Yoon Tae Yi -

235
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:06,270
 You're the woman I love most in the world.

236
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:08,890
 Shall we head out right after our shower?

237
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,540
Are you all right?

238
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:20,810
Yes.

239
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:23,410
Why did you ask to see me?

240
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:29,120
When was the last time you saw the Lieutenant's mother?

241
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:33,390
It's for him.

242
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:36,880
I saw her last in 1992.

243
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,430
Why are you asking that?

244
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:41,220
In 2010,

245
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:45,280
when I met her, she was suffering a lot.

246
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:51,230
Because of "The Book of Prophecy," time travel, and the lieutenant.

247
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:56,540
But she wasn't able to share her troubles with anyone

248
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:59,590
since she was a time traveler.

249
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:07,140
If it were me, I would have wanted to lean on someone.

250
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:12,860
If possible, probably someone like the lieutenant's father.

251
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:18,880
Did you really... never receive a call from his mother?

252
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,910
Or even a letter?

253
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:25,680
Never. What is it that you want to know?

254
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:31,220
I want to know what exactly she was struggling with.

255
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:32,650
"Struggling?"

256
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:37,360
She tried to stop time travel.

257
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:44,630
But in the end, for some reason, she gave that up.

258
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:48,330
I want to know the reason.

259
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:51,580
I'm sorry, but I don't know either.

260
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:57,640
I still don't know why she left me.

261
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:05,430
 Tae Yi!

262
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:14,380
 In a pregnant state, you'll be traveling through a wormhole full of radiation.

263
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,500
 Let's think about this logically.

264
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:23,180
 To return, we'll have to pass through the wormhole again. If we do that, a horrific child could be born.

265
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:29,040
 What if I give birth here?

266
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,640
 Don't think about useless things.

267
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,960
 We'll have to get an abortion to complete our tasks once we return.

268
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,430
What's wrong?

269
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,390
It's nothing.

270
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:52,010
After meeting Park Jin Gyeom's mother, are you by chance experiencing signs of dÃ©jÃ  vu?

271
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:53,840
How did you know?

272
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,720
I think you're trapped in quantum entanglement.

273
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:01,600
When two doppelgÃ¤ngers of different worlds meet, their memories or emotionsâ€“

274
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:06,060
You don't have to explain it for me to understand.

275
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,910
Please don't worry too much.

276
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:12,850
It'll get better as time passes.

277
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:19,650
Then the same could happen to the lieutenant.

278
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:25,670
He... met the high school student of that dimension.

279
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:52,810
 Jin Gyeom!

280
00:28:56,810 --> 00:29:00,680

281
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,610
Aren't you coming?

282
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:58,490
What are you doing?

283
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:00,330
Are you crazy?

284
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:02,170
Jin Gyeom!

285
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:09,800
Park Jin Gyeom, what are you doing?

286
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:16,120
Park Jin Gyeom!

287
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:43,980
Lieutenant Park, are you crazy?

288
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:46,520
Detective, are you okay?

289
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,390
When did you get here?

290
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:50,930
Did you come together?

291
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:55,500
You don't remember that?

292
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:29,000
Jin Gyeom!

293
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,720
Are you really okay?

294
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:36,120
I made a mistake.

295
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,110
I thought someone had broken into the officetel.

296
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:40,050
Stop lying.

297
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:43,140
You couldn't even remember your own actions.

298
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:47,440
Let's talk later.

299
00:31:57,450 --> 00:31:59,610
When we were in school,

300
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:01,970
everyone was afraid of Jin Gyeom.

301
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:04,100
Even teachers.

302
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:07,310
Despite that, I've never thought of him as scary

303
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,840
until today.

304
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,660
I'll try to meet with him.

305
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:16,140
Did something happen to him while time traveling?

306
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:18,540
No.

307
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:22,510
It doesn't make sense that Jin Gyeom would act that way if nothing had happened.

308
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:25,230
He was another person.

309
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:28,430
He saw his mother pass away again,

310
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:31,150
so he's likely mentally stressed.

311
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:33,220
Don't worry too much about him.

312
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:35,730
What's with that sword?

313
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:40,200
Is it really a weapon the killer had when murdering his mother?

314
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,480
Yes.

315
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,460
What about other evidence?

316
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:45,390
Was there anything else?

317
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:01,520
I found this.

318
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:04,060
What's this?

319
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:06,560
It's something I coincidentally found at the crime scene.

320
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:09,680
Judging from how it can't be translated literally,

321
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:14,170
the words "her," "son," "cost of sin," and "creation."

322
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:17,230
These words must have a hidden meaning.

323
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:20,070
I can't tell what it means.

324
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:25,700
Nevermind. Forget it.

325
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:29,130
It might just be the contents of a children's book.

326
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:31,050
I'm not sure about anything else,

327
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:34,960
but I think I know what "murderer of all beings and destroyer of all creations" may be.

328
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,760
What is it?

329
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,320
Time.

330
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,630
In old books,

331
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:43,940
time is called the murderer of all beings, and the destroyer of all creations.

332
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:46,140
People die of old age,

333
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:48,330
and the strongest of pillars

334
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:51,100
become sand at the hands of time.

335
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:55,310
But here, I don't know if it's that simple.

336
00:33:55,330 --> 00:34:00,250
In ancient civilizations, time usually symbolizes an absolute being.

337
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:02,670
Though you can't see time,

338
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:06,710
it creates and evolves all things.

339
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:16,750
Lieutenant!

340
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:19,640
Lieutenant!

341
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:27,090

342
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:34,230
Lieutenant, where are you right now?

343
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:38,170
Lieutenant?

344
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:42,380
 How nice to hear your voice.

345
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:47,500

346
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:55,970
 Don't you remember me? We spoke to each other 10 years ago.

347
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,440
Who are you?

348
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:06,780
This time, it's your turn.

349
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:24,940
Professor Yoon, what brings you here?

350
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,900
Are you okay?

351
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:53,310
 The woman who must pay the price of opening the doors of time

352
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:56,360
 does not just refer to me.

353
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:59,140
 When you go back, forget it all.

354
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:03,080
 Don't ever meet Jin Gyeom.

355
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,680
 You could be in danger, too.

356
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:40,750
I'll escort you home.

357
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:44,060
N-No, there's no need.

358
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:46,650
It's too late.

359
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,600
Thank you.

360
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,240
Yes, Detective?

361
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:35,360
It's not you, is it?

362
00:38:45,810 --> 00:38:47,150
What is this?

363
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:50,860
Can you match this with the sample DNA I gave you last time?

364
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:52,810
Did you find the culprit?

365
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:55,640
- Let me know as soon as the results come out. 
 - Okay.

366
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:26,340
I think Yoon Tae Yi has brought the last page with her.

367
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:33,140
Just...

368
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:36,420
take care of them all at once.

369
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:38,240
Yes, Sir.

370
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:50,300
So this...

371
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:53,350
is about Jin Gyeom and his mother?

372
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:56,100
I don't have complete faith in all of this, either.

373
00:39:56,100 --> 00:40:00,420
However, it's because I've seen things happen.

374
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:07,150

375
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:14,000
Professor, I thought I had gotten close to you,

376
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,820
but I'm disappointed. Why are you making this kind of joke?

377
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:19,590
Please don't misunderstand.

378
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:22,380
I'm not saying that Lieutenant Park killed his mother.

379
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:25,950
That's what it sounds like, that Jin Gyeom is the killer.

380
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:30,370
When you first saw me, you were surprised. Weren't you?

381
00:40:30,370 --> 00:40:34,040
I look so similar to Lieutenant Park's mother.

382
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:38,050
It was hard for me to come to terms with, at first.

383
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:41,140
That someone that looked the same as me could exist.

384
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:43,140
Why are you telling me this?

385
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:48,270
As time connected time, and one dimension connected to another,

386
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:52,880
it's possible for the same people to exists in the same dimension.

387
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:59,600
This means the culprit who killed Lieutenant Park's mother could be a version of him from another dimension.

388
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:05,090
Whether it's a Jin Gyeom from another dimension or not, it doesn't make sense that Jin Gyeom would kill his mother.

389
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:07,340
I don't want to believe it,

390
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:12,640
but Lieutenant Park will continue to act strangely.

391
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:18,140
Just like how I'm being influenced by his mother.

392
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:20,330
What do you mean?

393
00:41:20,330 --> 00:41:26,040
In my head right now, his mother's memories are floating around.

394
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:30,080
If the high school version of the Lieutenant we saw is a strange person,

395
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:35,490
then Lieutenant Park could be influenced by that and change.

396
00:41:35,490 --> 00:41:39,640
It's quite possible that he changed already.

397
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:51,300
I need to figure out how his mother was planning to stop time travel.

398
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,550
Please help me.

399
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:55,640
Stop time travel?

400
00:41:55,640 --> 00:42:00,370
Lieutenant Park's mother told me everything could be reset.

401
00:42:00,370 --> 00:42:03,230
And, of course, she knew of that solution.

402
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:07,880
Even so, she ended up giving up.

403
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:12,040
I don't understand that reason.

404
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:16,660
If she did that, it must be because of Jin Gyeom.

405
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:20,710
She's someone who lived only for Jin Gyeom.

406
00:42:21,990 --> 00:42:26,420
Do you know Lieutenant Park's birthday?

407
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:28,740
October 20th.

408
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:31,260
Of 1992?

409
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:33,000
Yes.

410
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:39,160
In the same year, Dr. Jang Dong Sik was killed.

411
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:45,130
Could I find out exactly when that was?

412
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:46,420
Why?

413
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:51,240
That's the day his mother arrived in this world.

414
00:42:57,140 --> 00:42:59,640

415
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:02,410
March 23rd, 1992.

416
00:43:03,570 --> 00:43:10,210
If it was 7 months before the lieutenant was born, it means she was already pregnant.

417
00:43:11,930 --> 00:43:14,480
That's why she gave up.

418
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:18,730
She wasn't aware of it when she was conducting her research.

419
00:43:18,730 --> 00:43:20,400
Wasn't aware of what?

420
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:25,320
If all time travelers disappear, she would also disappear.

421
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:29,300
And the son in her stomach, as well.

422
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:32,570
That's why she gave up on stopping time.

423
00:43:32,570 --> 00:43:37,780
For Lieutenant Park. For her son,

424
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:41,110
who had not yet even been born.

425
00:43:44,090 --> 00:43:46,700
Have you checked if it's the same sword?

426
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:48,900
Yes, it was purchased ten days ago.

427
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:51,190
We've finished checking the recordings, should we ask for backup?

428
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:53,670
No. I'll go.

429
00:43:53,670 --> 00:43:55,750
Then go with me.

430
00:43:55,750 --> 00:43:57,450
I'm worried to death about you.

431
00:43:57,450 --> 00:44:01,940
I'll go alone. I have something I need to check.

432
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:12,510
What brings you here?

433
00:44:12,510 --> 00:44:14,900
Shi Young disappeared.

434
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:17,010
Don't hate me too much.

435
00:45:17,010 --> 00:45:22,300
Even if I don't do this, you and Yoon Tae Yi won't make it out of this alive.

436
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:33,140

437
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:34,590
Are you certain about this?

438
00:45:34,590 --> 00:45:36,900
Yes. It's a total match.

439
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:41,390
Is the owner of the toothbrush the person who choked you?

440
00:45:41,390 --> 00:45:45,410
Who is that? Shouldn't you call the police?

441
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:50,720
Don't tell this to anyone.

442
00:45:56,930 --> 00:45:59,270
Don't touch the professor.

443
00:45:59,270 --> 00:46:01,870
You should worry about yourself.

444
00:46:13,390 --> 00:46:16,040
Go to the professor.

445
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:30,940
What are you up to?

446
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:35,080
Don't do anything you'll regret and put the gun down.

447
00:46:40,670 --> 00:46:45,410
Why? Are you going to kill me?

448
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:54,170
Why would I kill you?

449
00:46:59,710 --> 00:47:01,760
Shi Young,

450
00:47:03,050 --> 00:47:05,950
why did this happen to us?

451
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:11,110
We shouldn't have created time travel from the start.

452
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:15,150
We should've let go of the time that had already passed us by.

453
00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:24,920
Because of our greed, we were ruining not only those in the past, but ourselves as well.

454
00:47:28,310 --> 00:47:33,820
Go back to headquarters. And never return.

455
00:47:35,430 --> 00:47:37,930
If I go, you'll come with me.

456
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:45,630
I have things left to do here.

457
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:52,690
After sending me, you'll remain here with Yoon Tae Yi?

458
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:55,250
I can't let you do that.

459
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:57,630
There's someone I need to catch.

460
00:47:59,810 --> 00:48:02,640
I'll return after I catch him.

461
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:06,890
Shi Young.

462
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:13,080
Of course, the things that happened here won't become nothing.

463
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:17,850
But we can redeem ourselves.

464
00:48:17,850 --> 00:48:20,450
We have time.

465
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:25,620
I don't hate you anymore.

466
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:38,980
Min Hyeok...

467
00:48:40,370 --> 00:48:44,740
Thank you.

468
00:48:46,650 --> 00:48:48,740
And I'm sorry

469
00:48:49,770 --> 00:48:52,040
for only thinking about myself.

470
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:56,670
I really liked you and Tae Yi, both.

471
00:48:58,870 --> 00:49:02,160
I've done too much wrong.

472
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:07,450
To be honest, I...

473
00:49:10,810 --> 00:49:13,540
know who killed Tae Yi.

474
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:16,630
What?

475
00:49:16,630 --> 00:49:18,800
The person that killed Tae Yi...

476
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:23,900
Shi Young!

477
00:49:51,970 --> 00:49:54,220
It's the director.

478
00:49:55,410 --> 00:49:57,830
Be careful of him.

479
00:50:00,810 --> 00:50:02,560
Shi Young...

480
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:04,840
Min Hyeok...

481
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:11,420
I really liked you,

482
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:16,030
but I still made you suffer.

483
00:50:17,290 --> 00:50:19,250
I'm sorry.

484
00:50:27,970 --> 00:50:30,550
I'm sorry, Min Hyeok.

485
00:50:30,550 --> 00:50:33,420
I should've given this to you sooner.

486
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:41,210
It's something Tae Yi gave me before she died.

487
00:50:54,740 --> 00:50:56,650
Shi Young.

488
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:04,000
Shi Young?

489
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:07,450
Shi Young!

490
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:13,570
 It's me, Min Hyeok.

491
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:16,600
 Have you been well?

492
00:52:23,530 --> 00:52:30,650
 I'm not sure if you'll get this message,

493
00:52:30,650 --> 00:52:36,500
 but if you do, can you listen to this one wish of mine?

494
00:52:37,630 --> 00:52:41,290
I have a son.

495
00:52:41,290 --> 00:52:42,810

496
00:52:42,810 --> 00:52:47,650
No, we do.

497
00:52:47,650 --> 00:52:52,790
His name is Jin Gyeom. Park Jin Gyeom.

498
00:52:54,450 --> 00:53:01,320
 I thought of giving him your last name, but thought Jin Gyeom might become curious about his father,

499
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:04,110
 so I couldn't.

500
00:53:04,110 --> 00:53:06,150
 Sorry.

501
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:13,870
Still, I...

502
00:53:13,870 --> 00:53:19,860
I've raised Jin Gyeom well enough for you to be proud.

503
00:53:21,060 --> 00:53:24,290
 He knows right from wrong,

504
00:53:24,290 --> 00:53:29,790
 and will fight until the end for what's right.

505
00:53:31,830 --> 00:53:38,630
He might know that you're his father

506
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:41,860
and fight despite that truth.

507
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:50,430
  Even so, don't hate but protect him.

508
00:53:50,430 --> 00:53:58,080
 Jin Gyeom... has nobody to protect him but you.

509
00:53:59,830 --> 00:54:05,830
Jin Gyeom will try to find a professor.

510
00:54:05,830 --> 00:54:11,360
Our Jin Gyeom must never meet her.

511
00:54:12,470 --> 00:54:18,240
If we can't stop that, the same things will repeat themselves.

512
00:54:20,750 --> 00:54:23,740
I know I ran away as I wished,

513
00:54:25,310 --> 00:54:28,420
so I'm sorry for requesting this now.

514
00:54:30,690 --> 00:54:32,800
But then...

515
00:54:35,150 --> 00:54:38,040
I had no other choice, but to run away.

516
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:42,940
 I couldn't tell you, either.

517
00:54:46,430 --> 00:54:48,850
Can you hear me well?

518
00:54:51,610 --> 00:54:57,400
I... want to hear your voice.

519
00:55:00,510 --> 00:55:03,240
 You've hated me, right?

520
00:55:09,490 --> 00:55:15,420
I also... have been struggling.

521
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:22,080
I'm sorry.

522
00:55:23,090 --> 00:55:25,890
I should've gone to find you.

523
00:55:30,390 --> 00:55:32,900
I miss you so much.

524
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:37,630
I miss you, too.

525
00:55:39,930 --> 00:55:44,660
But if you see me now, you'll be disappointed.

526
00:55:45,670 --> 00:55:48,320
I've gotten so old.

527
00:55:49,140 --> 00:55:50,860
No.

528
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:56,000
You've always been beautiful to me. I'm sure you still are.

529
00:55:58,990 --> 00:56:01,150
Min Hyeok,

530
00:56:04,970 --> 00:56:11,450
our Jin Gyeom... I'll leave him in your care.

531
00:56:16,350 --> 00:56:18,420
Okay.

532
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:21,880
I'll protect him.

533
00:57:01,350 --> 00:57:03,930
Lieutenant Park.

534
00:57:03,930 --> 00:57:07,130
Did someone come looking for you?

535
00:57:07,130 --> 00:57:09,160
I figured it out...

536
00:57:10,740 --> 00:57:15,610
who killed your mother. I figured out who the killer was.

537
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:20,830
I wanted to compare it to something, so sorry I couldn't let you know sooner.

538
00:57:20,830 --> 00:57:24,580
But... I had to confirm.

539
00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:26,870
Confirm what?

540
00:57:33,150 --> 00:57:34,860

541
00:57:34,860 --> 00:57:37,040
Don't misunderstand.

542
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:39,190
I'm not suspecting you.

543
00:57:39,190 --> 00:57:44,090
I think the killer may be you, from another dimension.

544
00:57:45,970 --> 00:57:50,900

545
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:52,970
Who else knows about this?

546
00:57:52,970 --> 00:57:54,480
Only me.

547
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:57,990
I didn't tell the research assistant about your identity.

548
00:58:24,710 --> 00:58:26,630
Lieutenant Park...

549
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:30,420
I told you,

550
00:58:31,410 --> 00:58:33,900
you'd be next.

551
00:58:58,260 --> 00:59:05,280

552
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:08,380
â™«  I will remember  â™«

553
00:59:08,380 --> 00:59:13,710
â™«  no matter where you are, even if I close my eyes  â™«

554
00:59:13,710 --> 00:59:17,640
â™«  I will protect you from your side  â™«

555
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:19,070
â™«  I will protect you from your side  â™«

556
00:59:19,070 --> 00:59:22,040
â™«  I'll ask of you  â™«

557
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:27,420
â™«  even if you become far from time  â™«

558
00:59:27,420 --> 00:59:28,860
â™«  I remember  â™«

559
00:59:28,860 --> 00:59:30,130

â™«  I remember  â™«

560
00:59:30,130 --> 00:59:32,920
 You're not someone who would kill your own mother.

561
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:35,190
 I'll just keep liking you, like I do now.

562
00:59:35,190 --> 00:59:37,450
 I'll protect you no matter what.

563
00:59:37,450 --> 00:59:39,320
 Let's just run away together!

564
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:40,370
 Where is Alice?

565
00:59:40,370 --> 00:59:42,390
 Going there will be the same as walking into your death.

566
00:59:42,390 --> 00:59:44,530
 I'm curious to see how much Park Jin Gyeom knows.

567
00:59:44,530 --> 00:59:47,270
 What's the relationship between this person called Teacher and you?

568
00:59:47,270 --> 00:59:51,030
 We've finally met, in 10 years.

569
00:59:51,030 --> 00:59:53,470
â™«  I'm the one who will protect you  â™«
