00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:34,930
 "Love is patient.

2
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:40,290
 It always trusts, always hopes,

3
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,000
 and always perseveres." 
 - The Bible -

4
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,100
 Stop being so naive.

5
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,930
 I am trying to give you the chance to reign over time.

6
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:54,680
 I have no interest in such things.

7
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:58,900
 I'm going to revert all of it.

8
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:02,840
 After saving all the people that died because of you,

9
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,960
 I'll kill you.

10
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:12,490
 Since you're the start, I'll mark the end.

11
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,090

12
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:25,900
Eat before you go.

13
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:44,460

14
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:03,810
Did she have some seaweed soup?

15
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:07,830
- No.
 - Hey, I told you how to make it.

16
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:11,580
What did you buy for a present?

17
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:12,650
I didn't buy anything.

18
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:13,760
Why not?

19
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,430
I've never bought one before.

20
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:19,280
It's nothing to be proud of.  Wait for me at the school entrance when classes are over.

21
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,160
I will help you pick out a present.  I will buy the cake.

22
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:28,500
Ah, I heard that there is going to be a super blood moon tonight.  Time it, so that you can throw a party for her when that happens.

23
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:31,970
What are you looking at?

24
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:37,380
You were surprised to see such a pretty woman at 8:00 in the morning for the first time, weren't you?

25
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:43,410
That's right.  It really is difficult to be this pretty without any swelling in the face in the morning.

26
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:49,060
Hey, wait for me!

27
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,900

28
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:39,570
Yes, Doctor.

29
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,410
I shouldn't have come to see you.

30
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:46,790
Please forget what you've heard from me until now

31
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:51,420
and the research you conducted with me.

32
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,500
Why suddenly?

33
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,990
It's all because of me.

34
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:59,060
I have to take responsibility.

35
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:05,980
I thought that time travel would make many people happy.

36
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,250
That it would heal wounds and pain,

37
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:13,370
and turn back any regretful memory.

38
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:17,310
But... I was wrong.

39
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:20,950
Wounds and pain,

40
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:24,850
despair and sadness about things in the past as well,

41
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:27,180
they are all necessary.

42
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,910
Time travel that was invented to try to erase the pain

43
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:35,950
resulted in obsession and greed instead.

44
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:37,990
It's not your fault.

45
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:43,340
I don't think that your good intentions to heal others' pain can be a sin.

46
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:48,220
What's more, you realized your wrongdoings and are trying to turn it back.

47
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:50,810
I will help you till the end.

48
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:54,940
No, thank you for your words,

49
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,770
but I have to take care of it myself.

50
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,320
Mom!

51
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:25,300

52
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:38,270
Mister

53
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:40,010
Mister?

54
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:49,960
Who are you?

55
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:53,060
Where did you come from?

56
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:56,110
You are the only one

57
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:58,510
I could think of.

58
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,810
Please help me.

59
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:14,250
Did you come from the future?  Why?

60
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,320
Who sent you?

61
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,400
I am not here because someone sent me.

62
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,880
Are you here because of your mom?

63
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:25,530
Then, you are wrong to come here.  I will never kill your mom.  I won't kill her.

64
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:26,990
I know.

65
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:30,850
You didn't kill her.

66
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:33,430
Then, why are you here?

67
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:35,680
In the end,

68
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,610
Mom was murdered.

69
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:42,390
Not only Mom,

70
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:44,890
but many people die.

71
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:51,310
Mister, you know where Teacher is, don't you?

72
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:54,940
Please tell me.  I will catch him.

73
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:57,410
I don't know.

74
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:02,220
I don't even know who Teacher is

75
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:04,950
or where he is.  I don't know anything.

76
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,910
Misterâ€”

77
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:17,380
Hello?  Ah, Honey...

78
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:21,230
I got it.  I am busy now so I will call you later.

79
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:23,080
Okay.

80
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:35,940
I am sorry.  I think I was wrong to come here.

81
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:38,270
I won't make it difficult for you anymore.

82
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:42,360
You should just take your mom and leave.  I can help you with that.

83
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,540
Mom can't know.

84
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:47,830
Mom doesn't want the world order to change

85
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:52,840
because of me.

86
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,590
I see that this isn't your first time.

87
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:56,720
And if I avoid it,

88
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,850
the people who died

89
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,930
cannot come back.

90
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:06,420
Among those people,

91
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:11,990
am I included?

92
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,340
No.

93
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:26,590
Please don't worry.  You and your wife are safe.

94
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:36,110
Would it be okay for me to

95
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:38,650
hug you once?

96
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,810
I've missed you.

97
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:10,940
Were we...

98
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,040
We're we close there?

99
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:24,860
After mom passed away,

100
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:28,950
it was so hard for me that I wanted to die.

101
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,090
Because you were by my side,

102
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:39,100
I was able to live.

103
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,860
What are you going to do now?

104
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:47,070
I have to be by my mom's side and protect her, too.

105
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:51,440
And all the people I love,

106
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,990
I will save them again.

107
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:12,290
I heard that Jin Gyeom is so smart.

108
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,840
You should feel full even without eating.

109
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:20,370
No, but strangely I am gaining weight lately.

110
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:24,990
 Is today a special day?  Why are you buying so much meat?

111
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:28,220
 I just felt like having some.

112
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,980
  - I will be going.
 - Bye!

113
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,930
- Thank you.
 - Make sure to tell your mother

114
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:48,430
that you have a really pretty friend named Do Yeon and that she's the one who bought it.

115
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:54,250
Ah, also tell her that I am sorry you were falsely accused because of me.

116
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:57,080
She probably understands without me telling her something like that.  Don't worry.

117
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:00,600
But do it still.  That I feel very sorry about it.

118
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,540
You got it?

119
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,110
But are you sure you are not mad anymore?

120
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:09,300
I was never mad at you.

121
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:14,100
Then, at least give me a smile so I can see if you really are not mad.

122
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:24,060
It really is 100 times better for you to not smile.

123
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,800
I am going.

124
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,580
Bye.

125
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:03,320

126
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:08,170
 Mom, happy birthday.

127
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:11,260
 Hi, Mom.

128
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:15,350
Don't just go.  You should light the candles for me.

129
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,750
Go with me.  It will be a date.

130
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:38,730
Go with me, my son.

131
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:43,490
I will pass.  You go by yourself and come back.

132
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:46,700
Okay.  I will be right back.

133
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:36,830
Mr. Park Jin Gyeom!  Please calm down and hear me out.

134
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:39,550
It was because your mom asked me!

135
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:41,880
I am here because she asked me.

136
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,850
If her son comes, she told me to detain him.

137
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:45,940
She said that he won't be able to stop her from dying anyway.

138
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:48,730
Ms. Sun Young was very worried

139
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:51,470
that her son might get hurt because of her.

140
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:54,570
I understand how she feels, but I have to catch that punk.

141
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:58,170
I know how you feel!  I understand very well.

142
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:03,200
But no matter what you do here, the future will not change.

143
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:07,660
You cannot save your mom, of course, nor can you save the others from dying.

144
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:12,600
So, why don't you stop here and go back?

145
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:19,540
How do you know about others dying?

146
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:22,530
That's something that happens 10 years from now.

147
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,600
How would I not know?

148
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:32,430
When I am here now to stop you.

149
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:38,390

150
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:50,540
Jin Gyeom!

151
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,420
Where are you Jin Gyeom?!

152
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:57,060
Jin Gyeom!  Jinâ€”

153
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:15,810
You ended up coming.

154
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:20,800
I was hoping that "The Book of Prophecy" was wrong.

155
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:25,020
Were you looking for me

156
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:29,320
until you looked like this, my son?

157
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:34,150
Son.

158
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,010
That's right.

159
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:42,970
I was once your son.

160
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:51,730
It was my fault for trusting Go Hyeong Seok.

161
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:57,390
How was I to know that he would even give up his wife to save you?

162
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,560
What are you talking about "give up wife?"

163
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,450
Mister.

164
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:13,810
After what I went through to get here, why would I give up my wife?

165
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:18,110
There is a misunderstanding.  I will explain.

166
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:22,580
You hurry up and go to your mom.  It seems I have more to hear from this punk.

167
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,630
Thank you, Mister.

168
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,000
Mom, no.

169
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:43,740
I didn't know this would happen to you.

170
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,550
Did you really not know?

171
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:52,140
You're the one who opened the doors of time.

172
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:54,850
Because of you,

173
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:57,680
I've killed many people.

174
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:00,630
It's all my fault.

175
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:04,370
I'll take the punishment,

176
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:09,300
but... don't touch Jin Gyeom.

177
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,310
Jin Gyeom...

178
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:15,790
can't become like you.

179
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:21,150
The one who turned your son into me

180
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:25,530
is not me, it's you.

181
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:30,020
You've turned your son into a monster.

182
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,180
I'm not the same as you.

183
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,760
No, Jin Gyeom.

184
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,100
What are you doing, Mom? Move.

185
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,910
Jin Gyeom! You can't shoot him.

186
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:45,050
If you do, both of you will die.

187
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:46,300
It doesn't matter.

188
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,440
Listen to me.

189
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:53,010
Don't do this for me.

190
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:57,090
- I told you to move, Mom. 
 - Like you,

191
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:00,490
there was a time I tried to save this woman.

192
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:02,720
Stop speaking nonsense.

193
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:06,820
You're just a monster who came to kill my mom.

194
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:11,280
You don't know her true form.

195
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:19,700
Why did she stay behind, in 1992?

196
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:25,370
In 1992,

197
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:27,740
 she saw "The Book of Prophecy."

198
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,770
 That's when she knew

199
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:33,750
 the power of the baby.

200
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,690
 If the baby were to die,

201
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:38,600
 she knew the doors of time would close

202
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:42,310
 which is why she stayed.

203
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:44,960
The baby had to live

204
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,990
for the doors of time she created to stay intact.

205
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:55,090
- My mother... would never do such a thing. 
 - My mother... would never do such a thing.

206
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:04,260
You will not be able to save this woman today.

207
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:07,980
Looking for a method to find her,

208
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:10,940
you'll roam the worlds for many years.

209
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:14,060
Just like I did.

210
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:16,190
Nonsense.

211
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:20,020
Why did I become a monster?

212
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:24,650
Why will you become a monster?

213
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:33,160
 There's another heart within me.

214
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:37,990
 It's smaller and weaker than mine, but I can feel it.

215
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:40,670
 The heartbeat of my child.

216
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:48,350
 Only after floating around different dimensions

217
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:51,470
 will you realize

218
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:54,410
 that there is only one way

219
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:57,680
 to save this woman.

220
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:00,510
 Go to 1992,

221
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:05,820
 and stop yourself from being born.

222
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:10,540
Who are you?

223
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:24,510
If you don't close the doors of time now,

224
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:27,950
you will die.

225
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:32,070
However, you can stop it.

226
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:35,680
Please return. Return and

227
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:38,290
close the doors of time.

228
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:41,090
Who are you?

229
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:45,870
Tell me who you are.

230
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:54,440
I am someone that shouldn't exist.

231
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:03,850
Abort your baby.

232
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:07,600
If that child is born,

233
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,610
you will lose the opportunity to close the doors of time.

234
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:18,910
That baby... cannot

235
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:22,160
be born.

236
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:27,220
For yourself and for that child,

237
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:33,580
that child must die.

238
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:40,260
I don't know who you are,

239
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:43,540
but nobody can touch my child.

240
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:45,210
Move.

241
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,570
Get out of my way.

242
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:51,170
You...

243
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:55,520
will die...

244
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:59,460
at the hands of that child.

245
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,870
I came here to save you.

246
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:05,210
There's no reason my child would do that.

247
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,510
Even if that were true,

248
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:10,870
I'm this child's mother.

249
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:13,840
I can raise him well.

250
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:20,090
This is my last warning. Get out of my way.

251
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:22,440
I cannot do that.

252
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:25,160
That child is a monster.

253
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:29,120
I cannot let a monster live.

254
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:04,810
Who needs to die is you.

255
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:10,500
That... is the past I experienced,

256
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,210
and the future you will experience.

257
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,880
That's not Mom's fault.

258
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:23,470
At the time, Mom... didn't know who you were.

259
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,620
Did she really... not know?

260
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:35,440
Mom... Mom...

261
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:45,360
Mom...

262
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:49,240
No.

263
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:54,300
There's no way that's true.

264
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:17,750
Mom...

265
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:23,910
This woman... knew we would become a monster,

266
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:26,240
but gave birth to you.

267
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,330
She didn't love you.

268
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:30,820
She pretended to love you.

269
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:37,460
Because of this woman, we... live a life we didn't want

270
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:39,840
and became a monster.

271
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:47,260
The only person who can understand my pain is you.

272
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:52,060
I am giving you the opportunity

273
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:54,760
to escape from the pain I experienced.

274
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:59,150
I'm giving you the opportunity to kill this woman.

275
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,380
We must...

276
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:08,430
kill this woman first.

277
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:14,010
Sure.

278
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:17,810
Just kill me.

279
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:21,660
It's all my fault.

280
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:25,890
Because of me,

281
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:29,500
you two have ended up like this.

282
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:46,200
Even if all of what you say is true,

283
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,220
it doesn't matter to me.

284
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:53,940
I just need to protect my mom. If you and I die,

285
00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:57,310
it'll all end.

286
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,610
Mom.

287
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:05,630
Why?

288
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:09,230
Do you want to kill me again?

289
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:11,770
Then...

290
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:15,290
shoot me here.

291
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:22,600
I've lived my entire life racked with guilt.

292
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:26,720
Every day, all I felt was

293
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:30,170
guilt and fear.

294
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:35,540
I knew I had to do something,

295
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:40,090
but there was nothing I could do.

296
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:44,510
You are my son

297
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:48,900
and if I close the doors of time,

298
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:52,630
you would disappear.

299
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:55,420
Don't make excuses.

300
00:28:55,420 --> 00:29:01,570
You... thought of the world you created as more precious than your own son.

301
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:04,340
That's why you made us like this.

302
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:11,280
To a mother, a child...

303
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:15,790
is the same as her entire world.

304
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:23,880
Even if I don't exist in that world,

305
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:28,570
you just need to be safe.

306
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:40,110
I know it'll be hard to forgive me,

307
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:45,390
but it needs to stop now, Jin Gyeom.

308
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,540
Mom.

309
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:12,590
Son...

310
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:14,560
No...

311
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,480
Mom...

312
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:19,880
No, Mom.

313
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:24,090
Mom, please. It's not your fault, why are you dying?

314
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:26,690
Why you!

315
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,270
I...

316
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,820
I'm sorry.

317
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:42,250
I'm sorry

318
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:46,230
you were born

319
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:50,500
as my son.

320
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:56,360
Because I was born as your son,

321
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,970
I was happy.

322
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:04,690
Next time,

323
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:09,010
I'll be born as your son again.

324
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:48,730
No. This isn't it.

325
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,800
This woman tried to kill us.

326
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:54,970
Why are you dying?

327
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:57,660
Why are you dying instead of me?

328
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,330
Because she's our mother.

329
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:07,230
Remember our mother

330
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:13,740
who has sacrificed everything for us.

331
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:48,970
Take that memory

332
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:53,250
until the ends of hell

333
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:57,420
and live in torment forever.

334
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:01,320

335
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,630
 Mom, happy birthday.

336
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,630
Mom, you're home?

337
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:11,780
Why are you just leaving?

338
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:14,020
You should light the candles for me.

339
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:28,240
â™ª Happy birthday to you â™ª

340
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:33,000
â™ª Happy birthday to you â™ª

341
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:38,890
- â™ª Happy birthday to you â™ª 
 - â™ª Happy birthday to you â™ª

342
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:44,770
â™ª To my lovely Mom, â™ª

343
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:49,910
â™ª Happy Birthday to you â™ª

344
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:58,070
Thank you, Son.

345
00:35:58,070 --> 00:35:59,580
Hurry up and blow them out.

346
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:02,440
After I make a wish.

347
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:12,750
Let's blow it out together.

348
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:31,320
Happy birthday to you.

349
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:34,920
Mom.

350
00:36:57,110 --> 00:36:59,440
You finished the alcohol.

351
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,570
I better go buy some more.

352
00:37:01,570 --> 00:37:04,670
If I buy more, you'll drink it with me. Right?

353
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:05,990
Okay.

354
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:07,940
I'll be back.

355
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,820
Mom,

356
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:14,650
let's go together.

357
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:29,550
What's wrong?

358
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,050
Mom.

359
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:41,400
I... forgot my wallet.

360
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,950
Can you bring it for me?

361
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:45,590
Sure.

362
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:03,490
 I'm sorry it took so long.

363
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:10,220
 Still, the promise I made to protect you. I kept it.

364
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:16,060
 Now, you'll come to my high school graduation.

365
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:20,330
 When I get accepted into college and become a police officer,

366
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:23,520
 you'll be the happiest for me.

367
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:29,870
 When I get hurt during an investigation, you'll worry about me more than anyone else.

368
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:35,130
 When I earn my first paycheck, I'll give you an allowance,

369
00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:40,080
 and on your birthday, I'll sing you the Happy Birthday song.

370
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:55,170
 It won't be me, but it'll happen that way.

371
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:39,570
 So you... don't need to worry about me.

372
00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:43,960
 Just like you are now, live happily.

373
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:47,410
 That's all I need.

374
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:10,530
Your wallet.

375
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:23,930
Thanks, my son.

376
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:38,250
Let's go.

377
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:03,480

378
00:41:14,490 --> 00:41:17,720
You're already up?

379
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,500
How did I get here?

380
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:24,050
How much did you drink yesterday? You can't just use alcohol to fix your jet lag.

381
00:41:24,050 --> 00:41:25,290
What are you talking about?

382
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:28,380
You came back at dawn after going to Germany for a seminar.

383
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:29,600
Seminar?

384
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:34,750
How could you not bring back anything? You should've at least brought back a magnet.

385
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:36,850
That's just the basics.

386
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,960
Lieutenant.

387
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:45,140
Where's my phone?

388
00:41:52,850 --> 00:41:55,850

389
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:01,570
 (T/N: No calls from Park Jin Gyeom.)

390
00:42:01,570 --> 00:42:03,210
Did you touch my phone?

391
00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:06,090
No. Why?

392
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:08,150
Lieutenant Park's phone number is gone.

393
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:09,050
Who?

394
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:11,170
Lieutenant Park Jin Gyeom.

395
00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:13,040
Are you friends with a lieutenant?

396
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:17,660
Don't you know him? Park Jin Gyeom? He's been to our house a few times.

397
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:20,850
Have you brought a man home before?

398
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:37,900
Who are you?

399
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:44,400
This is our house. Are you looking for someone?

400
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:47,640
Isn't this where Park Jin Gyeom lives?

401
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,640
No.

402
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:53,420
He definitely lived here...

403
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:55,020
He was here yesterday.

404
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:58,640
I've lived here for over 7 years!

405
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,540
Lieutenant.

406
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:09,820
Yes, what is it?

407
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:13,960
I'm here to meet Lieutenant Park Jin Gyeom.

408
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:15,190
There isn't anyone here with that name.

409
00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:19,890
What do you mean that there's no one? He uses this desk.

410
00:43:19,890 --> 00:43:23,140
This... is my desk.

411
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:25,820
Hello, Professor Yoon. What brings you here?

412
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:28,940
Detective, you know, right?

413
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:31,920
Where's Lieutenant Park Jin Gyeom?

414
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:36,090
Park Jin Gyeom... Who is that?

415
00:43:36,090 --> 00:43:39,230
Do you really not know?

416
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:41,650
Then... how do you know me?

417
00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:44,540
Why would I not know you? You're the daughter of crime squad owner.

418
00:43:45,510 --> 00:43:48,310
Haven't you seen the team leader at Crime Squad?

419
00:43:48,310 --> 00:43:50,460
Team Leader?

420
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:52,890
Tae Yoon.

421
00:43:52,890 --> 00:43:54,150
Here, take these out.

422
00:43:54,150 --> 00:43:55,620
Two black bean noodles for Table 3.

423
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:58,550
Table 3, two black bean noodles, coming right up!

424
00:43:58,550 --> 00:44:01,160
Enjoy.

425
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:04,330
- Can we get some more radish here? 
 - Radish?

426
00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:09,860
Enjoy.

427
00:44:11,290 --> 00:44:13,600
Until when is he going to keep that up?

428
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:18,020
Just let him be. That's the basics. He should do the work he wants to do.

429
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:21,180
Look at how his face is glowing these days.

430
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:23,420
Team Leader,

431
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:27,690
how did you come back to life?

432
00:44:27,690 --> 00:44:32,440
What about Lieutenant Park? Where's Lieutenant Park Jin Gyeom?

433
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:35,090
Who's Park Jin Gyeom?

434
00:44:35,090 --> 00:44:37,780
Didn't you arrest a high school student 10 years ago?

435
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:39,840
Don't you remember that student?

436
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:41,790
Did I?

437
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,060
I've never arrested a high school student.

438
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:47,260
Why can't you remember?

439
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:50,570
You arrested Lieutenant Park!

440
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:54,670
I'm sorry.

441
00:44:54,670 --> 00:44:55,920
What's wrong with you?

442
00:44:55,920 --> 00:45:01,150
Even if nobody else knows, you should remember him.

443
00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:05,570
It's no just anyone, but Park Jin Gyeom.

444
00:45:22,670 --> 00:45:25,200
Sis.

445
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:29,840
If you're back, you should've called me first.

446
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:32,400
Where's my present?

447
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:42,750
So it's all back to normal.

448
00:45:44,570 --> 00:45:48,590
 If you end time, everything will be reset.

449
00:45:48,590 --> 00:45:49,940
 "Reset?"

450
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:54,170
 All time travelers disappear.

451
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:00,130
It's all come back.

452
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:05,350
Except for him.

453
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:12,820
Everything.

454
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:19,460
â™«  Please just stay with me as much as you remember  â™«

455
00:46:20,990 --> 00:46:26,710
â™«  Even a little closer  â™«

456
00:46:26,710 --> 00:46:33,860
â™«  Remember me as much as you missed me  â™«

457
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:37,350
â™«  Far away  â™«

458
00:46:37,350 --> 00:46:41,170

â™«  I'm waiting shooting star  â™«

459
00:46:43,110 --> 00:46:48,530
â™«  The night I still picture you  â™«

460
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:55,490
â™«  It get clearer when I close my eyes  â™«

461
00:46:56,650 --> 00:47:03,650
â™«  Iâ€™m sick and I just miss you again  â™«

462
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:09,260
â™«  To draw you even in a dream  â™«

463
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:11,430
 I'll stay by your side.

464
00:47:11,430 --> 00:47:18,120
â™«  Iâ€™m afraid Iâ€™m gonna wake up  â™«

465
00:47:18,850 --> 00:47:21,720
â™«  We  â™«

466
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:25,040
Did something happen to you, Unnie?

467
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:29,120
You seem like a different person ever since you got back from your business trip.

468
00:47:31,310 --> 00:47:34,630
I feel like I've come home

469
00:47:34,630 --> 00:47:37,640
after a very long journey.

470
00:47:38,550 --> 00:47:43,360
In that place, I lived a different life, as a different person.

471
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:47,960
Now, I've returned as myself.

472
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:51,460
But... my heart doesn't feel right.

473
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:53,570
Why not?

474
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:55,790
It must be because of the man I met there.

475
00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:59,080
Man? What man?

476
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:01,550
He's someone...

477
00:48:01,550 --> 00:48:04,300
I'll never meet again.

478
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:16,980
 Thanks to you, Lieutenant, we're all living well.

479
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:23,040
 However, nobody can remember you.

480
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:29,040
 Perhaps, one day, I might become like them.

481
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:34,200
 However, I can promise you one thing.

482
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:37,390
In quantum mechanics, the wave function

483
00:48:37,390 --> 00:48:40,830
illustrates the state of the substance material.

484
00:48:40,830 --> 00:48:44,430
Once you find the wave function, you can know all other information.

485
00:48:44,430 --> 00:48:48,540
The SchrÃ¶dinger function you're all aware of...

486
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:52,090
â™«  when Iâ€™m with you  â™«

487
00:48:53,570 --> 00:48:54,920
One minute.
 â™«  Even a little closer  â™«

488
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:59,480
â™«  Even a little closer  â™«

489
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:03,160
â™«  donâ€™t forget me  â™«

490
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:06,490
â™«  Stay with me  â™«

491
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:14,930
 I... will try my best to live a happy life.

492
00:49:14,930 --> 00:49:20,770
 Since this is a day you've protected for me, with your life.

493
00:49:23,590 --> 00:49:24,500
Professor Yoon,

494
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:26,660
you've received a consultation request. What should I do?

495
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:27,870
What consultation?

496
00:49:27,870 --> 00:49:32,090
They want to know if the science they'll be using in a movie is possible in real life.

497
00:49:32,090 --> 00:49:33,550
This is the reporter's business card.

498
00:49:33,550 --> 00:49:36,930

499
00:49:36,930 --> 00:49:39,230
Where's this reporter right now?

500
00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:46,270
Reporter Kim Do Yeon?

501
00:49:46,270 --> 00:49:47,840
Yes?

502
00:49:49,340 --> 00:49:52,260
Are you Professor Yoon Tae Yi?

503
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:53,830
Yes.

504
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:57,620
Is time travel really possible?

505
00:49:58,950 --> 00:50:03,790
I mean, in dramas or movies, it's always as if it'll be developed in the future.

506
00:50:03,790 --> 00:50:07,350
But... I think that's a bit unrealistic.

507
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:10,970
I think it's possible.

508
00:50:10,970 --> 00:50:15,070
However, I also think it shouldn't be made possible.

509
00:50:15,070 --> 00:50:20,200
When I was first introduced to you, I heard you were very interested in time travel.

510
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:21,980
How unexpected.

511
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:24,630
I was, at a time.

512
00:50:24,630 --> 00:50:27,060
But I don't think so anymore.

513
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:35,290
As precious as a past time, I think it must remain as memories to be cherished.

514
00:50:35,290 --> 00:50:41,290
Wanting to turn back time is only the greed of humans.

515
00:50:43,030 --> 00:50:48,710
Listening to you, I'm reminded of an architect I interviewed a few days ago.

516
00:50:48,710 --> 00:50:54,510
He said he started architecture to cherish the memories of the past.

517
00:50:54,510 --> 00:50:59,730
Though emotions and memories of the past are forgotten as time passes,

518
00:50:59,730 --> 00:51:03,900
he said spaces help to stop the passage of time.

519
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:07,330
 Spaces stop the passage of time.

520
00:51:07,330 --> 00:51:14,400
 The moments of laughter, tears, happiness, and pain are all left there.

521
00:51:42,710 --> 00:51:48,370
As I've mentioned before, we've used standard crossbeams and columns.

522
00:51:48,370 --> 00:51:50,970
It did take more than twice as long,

523
00:51:50,970 --> 00:51:55,030
but compared to the memories housed here, that's nothing.

524
00:51:55,030 --> 00:51:57,350
I think my husband will love it.

525
00:51:57,350 --> 00:52:00,790
We had no choice but to remodel for our safety.

526
00:52:00,790 --> 00:52:04,180
But because it was the house he was born and raised, he wasn't fond of it being renovated.

527
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:06,580
I understand.

528
00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:11,100
Space, to anyone, is life itself.

529
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:16,430
Space is life... I like that.

530
00:52:24,510 --> 00:52:27,890
What drawings are these?

531
00:52:30,170 --> 00:52:36,120
I drew some images impromptu before I started building these spaces.

532
00:52:36,890 --> 00:52:40,180
Where do you get this kind of inspiration?

533
00:52:40,180 --> 00:52:42,450
I don't think there's anything special.

534
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:48,170
They're images that just appear in my head, like dÃ©jÃ  vu.

535
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:52,820
Even this image?

536
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,670
Yes.

537
00:53:00,330 --> 00:53:04,750
Excuse me. Do you know Park Jin Gyeom?

538
00:53:04,750 --> 00:53:06,420
I heard he works here.

539
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:09,160
Oh, Team Leader Park?

540
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:11,010
One moment, please.

541
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:14,370
Where's Team Leader?

542
00:53:14,370 --> 00:53:16,550
I'm not sure.

543
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:21,620
I think he went on site.

544
00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:23,640
On site?

545
00:53:28,930 --> 00:53:33,120
And we'll keep these pillars and the guardrail as is.

546
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:35,280
The wood is sturdy so it should be fine.

547
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:37,490
It looks amazing.

548
00:54:18,150 --> 00:54:20,160
Lieutenant.

549
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:29,990
It's me, Yoon Tae Yi.

550
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:32,800
Who are you?

551
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:38,140
â™«  You don't have to be sorry  â™«

552
00:54:39,170 --> 00:54:40,290
â™«  Now you have to forget  â™«

553
00:54:40,290 --> 00:54:42,690
I'm sorry.

554
00:54:42,690 --> 00:54:45,610
I must've been mistaken.

555
00:54:46,350 --> 00:54:50,900
That's all right.

556
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:55,830
â™«  You remain in time  â™«

557
00:54:55,830 --> 00:54:59,790
 Lieutenant Park, I won't be disappointed.

558
00:54:59,790 --> 00:55:01,500
â™«  Memories from far away  â™«

559
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:05,350
 The fact that you can't recognize me

560
00:55:05,350 --> 00:55:09,100
 means that you've forgotten everything.

561
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:15,090
 It means you're living a good, normal life.

562
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:20,390
 Please live happily, as you are now.

563
00:55:20,390 --> 00:55:24,840
â™«  I'll let you go now  â™«

564
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:33,500
â™«  I'll ask you even if you're far from time  â™«

565
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:41,520
â™«  I remember, remember you  â™«

566
00:55:43,310 --> 00:55:50,250

567
00:55:51,310 --> 00:55:58,260

 Thanks to other language moderators and subbers!

573
00:57:04,130 --> 00:57:09,080
 But just in case, don't sell this house. Keep it, okay?

574
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:12,370
 I'll come and visit you here in the future.

575
00:57:12,370 --> 00:57:13,540
 Okay.

576
00:57:13,540 --> 00:57:17,580
 I'll be waiting... until you come.

577
00:57:17,580 --> 00:57:22,640
â™«  Even as time goes by  â™«

578

579
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:38,660
â™«  I'll trust every moment of you  â™«

580
00:57:38,660 --> 00:57:45,720
â™«  From the beginning, I'll follow my chosen fate  â™«

581
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:52,620
â™«  And tomorrow will be yesterday  â™«

582
00:57:52,620 --> 00:58:00,430
Lieutenant! 
 â™«  Whenever, wherever, whatever, with you  â™«

583
00:58:00,430 --> 00:58:08,190
â™«  One day and somewhere, I'll be with you  â™«

584
00:58:08,190 --> 00:58:16,550
Sorry, I made you wait long.

585
00:58:16,550 --> 00:58:22,210
â™«  No matter how far we go  â™«

586
00:58:22,210 --> 00:58:28,180
â™«  We'll see each other again  â™«

587
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:31,930

588
00:58:31,930 --> 00:58:39,340
â™«  With all my heart, I'll keep an eye on you  â™«

589
00:58:39,340 --> 00:58:47,130
â™«  Wherever you are  â™«

â™«  Even if the dark night is covered by a cold sigh  â™«

591
00:58:53,770 --> 00:59:01,060
â™«  I know it's not far away  â™«

00:59:01,060 --> 00:59:08,740
â™«  Whenever, wherever, whatever, with you  â™«

â™«  I'll be here with a light smile  â™«

â™«  Remember forever  â™«

602

â™«  Don't forget  â™«

603
00:59:56,490 --> 01:00:03,970
â™«  Without you, this moment is meaningless  â™«
