00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:37,110
 "There are only two ways to live a life.

2
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:42,690
 One is to live as if nothing is a miracle.

3
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:49,480
 The other is to live as if everything is a miracle."
 - Albert Einstein -

4
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:58,050

5
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:15,180
  Do you want to go with me? It'll be like a date.

6
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,700
  No, I am okay.  Go by yourself.

7
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:23,000
 Okay.  I will be right back.

8
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,670
 Jin Gyeom, are you going somewhere?

9
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:42,760
 Yeah, Mom.

10
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:49,480
 But... I will be sure to come back.

11
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:53,820
 - This is our home after all. 
 - Yes.

12
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:59,100
 Mom will be waiting so be sure to come back.

13
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:03,180
 I will, Mom.

14
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:42,600
 Someone must have been living here.

15
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:47,230
 It's a safe house used by our precinct.

16
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,730
Ah, really!

17
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:00,540
I told you I don't know.  Why do you keep—

18
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,460
Detective!

19
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:08,210
Are you really going to be like this?

20
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:10,290
I even gave up an exclusive for you!

21
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:14,870
I really don't know where Lieutenant Park is, either!

22
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,750
You don't know yet how scary the alphabet letters are, do you?

23
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:22,250
It's been a while, but should I ignore King Sejong's love for people 
  (T/N: Hangul was created under King Sejong)

24
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:25,380
and expose an article about the police?

25
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,480
I am feeling inspired right now, so

26
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,180
you better find out where Jin Gyeom is.

27
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:34,750
 What are you going to do about Reporter Kim?

28
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:38,300
She's not really going to write up a story so please don't worry.

29
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,090
How are the other researchers?

30
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:43,010
We are protecting them with additional reinforcement so they seem to be okay.

31
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:44,500
I understand.

32
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,380
I will focus on protecting the professor for the time being.

33
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:50,640
Please call me if any new clues surface.

34
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,130
Is it not dark for you?  Should I turn the light on?

35
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,970
What's wrong?

36
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:10,970
Nothing.  You can use this room.

37
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:18,080
You want me to use the master bedroom?

38
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:21,980
How did you know that this was the master bedroom?

39
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:24,740
Just... because it's big.

40
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,910
Is that something so surprising?

41
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:32,530
No. It is a big room.

42
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:01,120
I will replace the bedding with a new one.

43
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,460
Okay.

44
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:06,430
I will call mom and ask her to bring some things I might need.

45
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,060

46
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,940
Our location might get exposed.

47
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:16,220
While you are staying here you cannot call anyone, of course.  You cannot go out, either.

48
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:20,890
Even with the internet, you cannot connect to any site that contains your personal information. Please be careful.

49
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:23,770
If it was going to be like this, why bring me here?

50
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:25,750
A holding cell would have been more comfortable.

51
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:30,730
Ah, I hadn't thought about that idea yet.

52
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:33,770
It's a good thing that you didn't think about it.

53
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:36,710
You won't stay here for very long.

54
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:39,630
If you write down the things you need, I will get them right away.

55
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:44,550

56
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,830
Do you plan on living here all your life?

57
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:01,550
You told me to tell you the things I need.

58
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:05,520
I will do my best.

59
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:22,870
But... are we really staying here just by ourselves?

60
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:27,870
Yes. It might be very uncomfortable.

61
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:31,760
But given the situation, please understand.

62
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:38,060
It"ll really be uncomfortable.

63
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,200
 Who is the punk?

64
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,990
What punk dares to mess with my daughter?

65
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:48,420
Sir, please calm down.

66
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,440
How can I calm down now

67
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,880
when you tell me that my daughter could have died?

68
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,270
Tell me who that punk is.  I will go catch him.

69
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:56,540
You don't know who I am, do you?

70
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:59,050
Do you know why our restaurant name is Crime Squad?

71
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:01,270
- Are you a fan of Choi Bool Am? 
 - You punks!

72
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:04,390
Be quiet!  Is that important now?!

73
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:07,900
- So, is our Tae Yi all right? 
 - Yes, Ma'am.

74
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,740
You don't need to worry.

75
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,920
She is at a safe place.

76
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:15,160
If any strange person comes to the restaurant or if you see anyone suspicious,

77
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,950
please call us right away.

78
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:22,760
We had some questions for your younger daughter as well, so we wanted to meet her...

79
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,310
But I guess she quit her job and is doing some other work?

80
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:27,450
What are you talking about?

81
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:30,470
Our daughter is working well at the bank.

82
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:34,330
We even went to the bank to meet her.

83
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,830
I am here.

84
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:47,730
I really think it's the hardest job earning someone else's money.  Japchae rice for me.

85
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:49,200
You.

86
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,700
Why?

87
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,540
Did you hand in your resignation?

88
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:57,770
What are you saying to a person who just got off work?

89
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,700
You wench!

90
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,780
What are you doing?

91
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:04,930
Go arrest her right away!

92
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:06,900
- Yes, Sir. 
 - Yes, Sir.

93
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:09,630
There!

94
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:11,560

95
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:27,510
Why would you quit your work at the bank when other people are dying to get hired?

96
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:29,760
It's because it really doesn't suit me!

97
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:34,390
Okay.  It's because you haven't gotten a beating from me.

98
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:38,520
It hurts!  I am going to file a report for domestic violence!

99
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,470
Go ahead and file a report!  I am going to appeal!

100
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:43,390
- You don't even know what an appeal is. 
 - Ach!

101
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:47,960
Can't you raise your hands properly?!

102
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,190
I got my eye on her.  Don't touch.

103
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:53,490
As your junior, I am advising you to focus on the investigation.

104
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:55,510
Senior, you have to catch this killer

105
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:58,790
in order to meet a woman like her in your next life.

106
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:00,950
Hey, don't you have respect for hierarchy?

107
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:05,950
When it comes to women, all guys maintain the same level.

108
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:22,100
Are you studying?

109
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,010
This is more complicated than it looks.

110
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:26,710
Why do you even need to read the instruction to put this together?

111
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:28,920
You can picture how it should be put together just by looking at it.

112
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,660
Move aside, please.

113
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,070
I could have done it myself.

114
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,260
I am hungry.  Should we eat something?

115
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,550
Should we order something for delivery?

116
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:21,420
We can't have food delivered.

117
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:24,340
Our location might get exposed.

118
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:26,980
I can cook for you.

119
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,750
Are you a good cook, Lieutenant?

120
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:32,030
No, I've never cooked before.

121
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:36,530
You know... You're actually quite worthless.

122
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:40,940
There isn't much you know how to do.  You can't catch the killer, either.

123
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,990
You have kimchi at least, right?

124
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:51,780
I am sorry for making you cook as well.

125
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:54,900
Never mind.  Just taste this, please.

126
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,930
How is it?

127
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:06,700
Should we order some food?

128
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,120
Please don't misunderstand.  I am not saying that it doesn't taste good.

129
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:15,210
When I think about it, I don't think food delivery will expose our location.

130
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:19,470
Your brain can't sense anything, but your tongue must be able to.

131
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:22,010
It's just that it might be hard on you, Professor.

132
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,080
Since it's the moving day, how about jjajangmyeon?

133
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:35,350
Jjamppong for me, please. Also, order sweet and sour pork as well.

134
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:37,440
Then, would it be all right to throw out the stew?

135
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,300
No!

136
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,690
Ah, I ate well!

137
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:49,180
Where do you keep the garbage bags for food?

138
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:51,970
They are in the drawer under the sink.

139
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:55,680
Where are the kitchen towels?

140
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,290
They are in the far-right cabinet, upper part.

141
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:27,820
I will finish up.  Why don't you wash up first?

142
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:30,670
Wash up?  Why?

143
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:34,730
Don't you wash up before going to bed?

144
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,530
Ah, I was about to go wash up.

145
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,460
Okay.

146
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:49,040
Do you have an antacid?

147
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:52,860
I will start.

148
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:16,210
I am going to poke.

149
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:19,780
One, two, three!

150
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:25,490
What is it?

151
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,820
Just go ahead and poke.

152
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:37,580
This is harder than it looks.

153
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:41,500
Don't you see that my thumb is turning blue?  Please hurry up and poke.

154
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,370
I am going to poke.

155
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:48,320
One, two, three!

156
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:53,360
Since home remedies are not proven to work,

157
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,920
I will just go buy medicine.

158
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,510
Ah, really!

159
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,510
All right.  Ah!

160
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:07,430
You worked hard.

161
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:13,230
Do you know how to shoot a gun?

162
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:18,560
Go to sleep, please.

163
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,580
Sleep well, please.

164
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:23,050
Okay.

165
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:32,180
I am sorry. Would it be okay to just leave the living room light on?

166
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:34,540
It's just that I am a little scared.

167
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:42,450
Should I stay in the living room?

168
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:51,840
 I am curious about something.

169
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,800
 What?

170
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,970
Your adoption process.

171
00:14:56,780 --> 00:15:00,810
You don't have to talk about it if it makes you feel uncomfortable.

172
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:06,800
There is not much of a story to tell.

173
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:12,180
My mom couldn't get pregnant, so they adopted me.  That's all.

174
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:18,980
But, miraculously, she became pregnant with my sister after she adopted me.

175
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:22,280
I heard that you were adopted when you were 8 years old.

176
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:26,850
Usually, isn't it hard for a child to be adopted at that age?

177
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:30,350
Doesn't being older make it less likely?

178
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:36,350
My mom was planning on adopting a baby as well.

179
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,750
But she told me that I stood out.

180
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:43,560
All the kids at the orphanage know, too.

181
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:47,550
In order to get adopted, you have to pretend to be good.

182
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:53,220
Pretend to be well-behaved and pretend to smile all the time.

183
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,890
But I guess I was the only one who didn't do that.

184
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:03,720
Mom told me that she couldn't get that off her mind.

185
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,880
That's why she adopted me.

186
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:09,660
Did you not want to get adopted?

187
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,400
No, I didn't.

188
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,480
Even then,

189
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:22,650
I believed that my biological mom would come back for me.

190
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:31,500
Can't I bring my notebook here?

191
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:36,430
If you really need it, you can use mine.

192
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:38,830
Okay.

193
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:41,280
What are you going to do with it?

194
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:46,720
I want to try to solve the mathematical equation left by the culprit.

195
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:49,820
The Forensic Service is analyzing it.

196
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:53,370
You don't need to concern yourself.

197
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:57,370
But... I want to do something, so...

198
00:16:57,370 --> 00:16:59,880
I would like it

199
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,720
if, at least while you are here,

200
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:07,590
you are at ease.

201
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:34,160
♫  Even as time goes by  ♫

202
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:41,830
♫  And if you're going through this messy life  ♫

203
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:49,130
♫  When there's no end in sight   ♫

204
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:57,860
♫  I'll trust every moment of you  ♫

205
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:04,990
♫  From the beginning, I'll follow my chosen fate  ♫

206
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:11,770
♫  And tomorrow will be yesterday  ♫

207
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:19,610
♫  Whenever, wherever,  whatever with you  ♫

208
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:27,000
♫  One day and somewhere, I'll be with you  ♫

209
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:35,780
♫  Whenever, wherever, whatever stay with you  ♫

210
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:46,720
♫  No matter how far we go, we'll see each other again  ♫

211
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:56,890

212
00:18:56,890 --> 00:19:00,020

213
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,310

214
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:05,760
 I will soon catch the culprit for you.

215
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,290
 Thank you.

216
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,560

217
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:58,130
I called you so many times!  Why didn't you wake up?!

218
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:02,260
How can you protect me when you become so hard of hearing when you are asleep?

219
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:27,020
It is done.

220
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:50,800
With only the information we have now, it will be difficult to find it.

221
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,800
Do you feel okay?

222
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,300
I'm fine.

223
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,600
Where are you going?

224
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,400
The doctor told you to rest for the time being.

225
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,800
I know how to take care of myself.

226
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,700
Is it because of Yoon Tae Yi?

227
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,800
It looks like you're all mistaken here.

228
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:25,400
I didn't leave Tae Yi. She left me.

229
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:28,600
Then, why would I worry about her?

230
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,600
Especially her as Yoon Tae Yi from the past.

231
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:51,700
This time as well, it looks like that person called "Teacher" is behind it.

232
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:57,310
The dimensional travel route is the same as Lee Se Hoon's in 1992.

233
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:09,200
 What's the reason you would kill someone from the past?

234
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,800
 It's all because of you.

235
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:14,400
 Because of you, The Book of Prophecy fell into the hand of a person from the past.

236
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:17,400

237
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:22,000
There is a new victim, but it isn't someone from the research team.

238
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,300
So is there no direct relation to Yoon Tae Yi's research in the past?

239
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Is there anything you can think of?

240
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,100
Not yet.

241
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,400
Lee Se Hoon might actually know something.

242
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,800
Since he is the only person who has seen the teacher.

243
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,200
Do you think that teacher really exists?

244
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,200
Both Lee Se Hoon and the illegal time travelers this time

245
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,400
weren't acting on their own.

246
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:48,000
If there is a teacher behind them, their goal may remain the same.

247
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,900
What goal?

248
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:54,400
The Book of Prophecy. I'll try to meet with Lee Se Hoon.

249
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,700
No. I will.

250
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,300
Min Hyeok!

251
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:13,000
Are you certain Lee Se Hoon has "The Book of Prophecy?"

252
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,600
Why? Don't you trust me?

253
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,600
That's not it—

254
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,500
I'll take care of it on my own, so don't worry.

255
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,600
Did the analysis of Park Jin Gyeom's time card come out?

256
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:31,000
Well... The damage is very serious, so I think it'll be difficult.

257
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,800
Okay.

258
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:42,510

259
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,400
 The end?

260
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,200
 The end of time travel.

261
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,800
 You're the one who cut his ankle, aren't you?

262
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,700
 And you killed Dr. Jang Dong Sik, too.

263
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,400
 Was there another accomplice?

264
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,800
 I think there was a woman, too.

265
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:15,000
 I've been trying to prevent such tragedies since ten years ago.

266
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,400
 With your mother's help.

267
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,800
 We must kill that woman for the sake of the future.

268
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,100

269
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,400

270
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,000

271
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,800

272
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,000
This is the list of people whose fingerprints match, according to the Forensic Service.

273
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,200
The suspect is among them.

274
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,400
This is driving me crazy.

275
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:02,200
It's the only solution we have for now.

276
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,800
Right. You haven't found Chief Seok Ho Won yet, have you?

277
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,400
No. We looked into every possible place,

278
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,700
but seeing as we haven't found him, I think he has already been killed.

279
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,800
What about the team leader?

280
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,900
He is still unreachable.

281
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,600
Oh! How—

282
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,400
W-What brings you here?

283
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,800
Are you here because you are worried about your sister?

284
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,000

285
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,400
As of today, Crime Squad also does delivery.

286
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,800
From now on, order from our restaurant when you're getting Chinese food.

287
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,400
Understood. I will order every day.

288
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:40,100
I will order three meals a day there.

289
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:44,000
Are you crazy? I even have to do deliveries because of you now.

290
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Don't order more than once a week!

291
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,600
Yes, yes. We will.

292
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,600
You can deliver the food to us, and I'll bring back the dishes.

293
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,600
I'll order, pick the order up, then bring the dishes

294
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,000
back to you.

295
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,200
In that case, just come and eat at the restaurant.

296
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,100
- Understood. 
 - Ah, yes.

297
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,600
- Ah, wait— 
 - Stop here.

298
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,600
What are you doing?

299
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,200
- Team Leader! 
 - Team Leader!

300
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:23,000
Did something happen?

301
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,600
Your wife told us you went to work, but you didn't answer your phone.

302
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:31,800
Don't make a fuss. I'll be looking into overdue files,

303
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,400
so go have lunch.

304
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,200
Won't you have lunch?

305
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,600
I don't have an appetite.

306
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,600
Well then, we'll go have a quick lunch.

307
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:09,670

308
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,800

309
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,800
Is no one there?

310
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,300
No one...

311
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,500
 If something were to happen to me,

312
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,600
 please make sure that student can continue the research.

313
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,200
 I hope you can help her.

314
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:13,200
She's still so young. Can we really put her in charge of that research?

315
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,600
That student can stop time travel.

316
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,800
This is very confusing.

317
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,400
I know.

318
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:31,790
You might also be in danger in the future.

319
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,400
- Oh, the pears are nice. Please give me 10,000 won worth of pears. 
 - Yes.

320
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,000
Oh, and apples too.

321
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
10,000 won worth of apples, too?

322
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,200
- Yes. 
 - All right.

323
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,800
You scared me! Are you ditching work again?

324
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,000
Why are you buying so much?

325
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Jin Gyeom's mother's death anniversary is coming up.

326
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,200
My wife is so kind!

327
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,600
Will you go out again after eating?

328
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,000
- No, I'm off work for today. 
 - Oh, really?

329
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,400
Should we have a drink somewhere?

330
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,600
If you have time, then make some pancakes.

331
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,800
- Here you go. 
 - Yes, thank you.

332
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,800
Here you go.

333
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:32,400
- Thank you, goodbye! 
 - Wishing you good sales today. 
 - Thank you.

334
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,400
Don't be like this. Let's go grab a drink.

335
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:38,000
What's wrong with you? Did you get scolded by the chief?

336
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,500
Am I some kind of child, that I'd get scolded?

337
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,600
Once this case is over, should we go on vacation abroad?

338
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,600
I thought you said it was nonsense for a detective to go on vacation abroad?

339
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,800
I just want to act as a proper husband from now on, do you have a problem with it?

340
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:36,660

341
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:39,600

342
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:27,540
Lieutenant!

343
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:32,820
Lieutenant!

344
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:36,640
 Lieutenant!

345
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:41,420
 Lieutenant!

346
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:55,890
Professor, what is it?

347
00:31:55,890 --> 00:31:58,420
The door wouldn't open.

348
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:02,200
There is something wrong with the door so you can't open it from the inside.

349
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:09,500
- You brought your cellphone, right? 
 - No.

350
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,780
Why don't you carry it around with you?

351
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:13,680
Then try to break down the door at least.  Hurry.

352
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:17,080
It's made of steel, so I don't think that's going to work.

353
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:20,140
Then scream loud enough so that the neighbor can hear you.

354
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:23,700
No, it might expose your location.

355
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:28,340
Our location needs to be exposed so that we can survive.   Do you want to be found as a corpse?

356
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:30,530
Don't worry, please.

357
00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:34,600
If I don't answer my phone, Detective Kim will come looking for me.

358
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:41,400
I will catch it so please relax.

359
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,910
What are you going to catch it with?!

360
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:45,140
I can just step on it.

361
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:56,070
Over there!

362
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:58,790
I will try to break down the door.

363
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:07,590
It's made of steel, so I don't think it will work.

364
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:28,090
Why are the lights on in Jin Gyeom's house?

365
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:31,550
It seems that Jin Gyeom comes occasionally to clean up the house.

366
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:38,660
Jin Gyeom, that punk, if he came here, he should at least come by our house to say hello.

367
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:40,410
Anyway, I don't care much for him.

368
00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:42,640
What does it matter if you don't care much for him?

369
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,710
Your daughter does.

370
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:49,630
Why does Do Yeon have to like someone like him?

371
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:52,850
Why?

372
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:57,150
- Are they possibly together now? 
 - What?

373
00:33:57,150 --> 00:34:01,600

374
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:10,060

375
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:15,680
Yeah, Mom.

376
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,940
 Where are you?

377
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:19,490
Where do you think?  I am at work.

378
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:23,730
Ah, I see.  Since the lights are on in Jin Gyeom's house, I thought that

379
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:26,970
you were with him.

380
00:34:26,970 --> 00:34:28,850
Which house?

381
00:34:34,470 --> 00:34:37,450
Hey, Kim Do Yeon!  Where are you going?!

382
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,830
What's up with her?

383
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:45,410
What's this?

384
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:52,150

385
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:54,420
 It's finished.

386
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:57,980
Did you catch it?

387
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:59,950
No.

388
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:05,420
It looks like it went outside.

389
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:09,220
How did you know that the door didn't open from the inside?

390
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:10,700
It also happened before.

391
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:14,630
When?  When you were younger?

392
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:18,850
This was your house, right?

393
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:21,270
Yes.

394
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:23,440
Why didn't you tell me?

395
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:27,620
Because I thought you might misunderstand.

396
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:30,930
Why did you keep it empty like this instead of selling it?

397
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:37,490
It's because this is the house that I used to live with my mother.

398
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:51,520
Do you know what I realized while researching time?

399
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:56,780
Memories and feelings get blurred as time passes,

400
00:35:56,780 --> 00:36:00,940
but space stores time.

401
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:03,990
The things that made you laugh, cry, happy,

402
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:08,920
and hurt, all remain.

403
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:12,430
To you, this house must be like that.

404
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,070
I envy you.

405
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:23,390
Once, fellow researchers and I wrote down places we would like to time travel to.

406
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:26,310
Maybe because I don't have any memories,

407
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:29,610
I didn't have many places I wanted to visit.

408
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:35,130
The orphanage where I got separated from my biological mother in 1992,

409
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:39,110
I only had that one place.

410
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:44,330
Now, I am going to add this house.

411
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:48,290
If I am successful with time travel, I will come back to this time, place,

412
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:50,570
and open the door for you.

413
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:03,030
You must have failed.

414
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:08,310
Still, you never know.  So don't sell this house and keep it.

415
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:12,400
In the future, I will come and visit you for sure.

416
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,010
Okay.

417
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:17,180
I will surely wait for you.

418
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:20,600
Until you come.

419
00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:27,690
Are you cold?

420
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:30,170
You don't need to take your clothes off to give it to me.  I am okay.

421
00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:33,150
No, you don't need to do that.

422
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:36,140
Help me here, please.

423
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:38,810
No, really.

424
00:37:38,810 --> 00:37:39,830
Just pull the sleeves, please.

425
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:43,470
I said you don't need to do that.  What do you want me to do?

426
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:44,650
Like this?

427
00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:47,370
Little more, please.

428
00:37:56,370 --> 00:37:58,570
Park Jin Gyeom!

429
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:16,830
I know that it was a situation that you can easily misunderstand, but it was unavoidable.

430
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:20,170
I know.  I fully understand.

431
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:23,360
Thank you for understanding.

432
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:27,490
It's late so I will escort Do Yeon and I will be back.

433
00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:29,300
It's close by so it shouldn't take long.

434
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:30,890
Okay.

435
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:34,150
No. You don't need to, since I am not leaving.

436
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:37,270
I am going to stay here as well while that woman is staying here.

437
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:41,440
Look here, Ms. Reporter,  there are only two rooms here.

438
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:49,010
Excuse me, Professor. Wouldn't I know more about the layout of this house?

439
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:51,720
That's what I am saying.  Where would you sleep?

440
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:54,950
We can just share the room.  We are both women.

441
00:38:54,950 --> 00:38:58,100
Of course, only one will remain alive in the morning.

442
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:04,300
Why is everyone coming here one-by-one?  Is this some sort of a meetup square?

443
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,650
What brings you here?

444
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:08,040
It's because you weren't answering your phone.

445
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:11,590
What is this?  You knew where Jin Gyeom was but you lied?

446
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:14,490
Ah, Ms. Reporter, that's not it—

447
00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:17,550
You really are a fighting cock. There is no one you don't pick a fight with.

448
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:20,160
Would I be any worse than you, Professor?

449
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:45,880
Let's not be like this.  Should we play a game?

450
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:48,560
Game time!  Let's go!  Woo!

451
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,350
This is not even a happy gathering.  Why would we play a game?

452
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:55,430
Are you on a trip?

453
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:05,540
Then, what should we do?

454
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:08,760
Should we sing?

455
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,510
Why would we sing?

456
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:13,610
You really don't seem to know how to grasp the mood.

457
00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:25,650

Detective, please go back. The two of you should go to bed.

467
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:11,230
You need to sing, too! 
  (T/N: Used informal "you.")

468
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:12,100
You?

469
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:15,910
Unnie is telling you to sing. Hurry up and sing!

470

00:43:16,410 --> 00:43:17,790
Good morning.

485
00:43:17,790 --> 00:43:19,480
Yes.

486
00:43:27,070 --> 00:43:29,260
What is this?

487
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:32,580
I drank a bit more than usual yesterday.

488
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:34,720
I need to take care of my figure in healthy ways.

489
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:37,740
It's not easy to stay in shape.

490
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:49,640
Are you feeling okay?

491
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:51,540
No.

492
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,690
It's a relief. At least the two of you are close now.

493
00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:03,750
Who's close?

494
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:08,220
Did you drink yesterday? Why are you speaking nonsense?

495
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,880
You're really something. How could you sleep over here?

496
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:16,370
You wouldn't know it, but I've slept over here so many times.

497
00:44:16,370 --> 00:44:18,200
I've come here a lot in the past 10 years.

498
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:20,400
So do you really intend to live here?

499
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,830
I've been living here since yesterday.

500
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:55,020
What's this?

501
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:56,420
Is this meant for us to eat?

502
00:44:56,420 --> 00:45:00,170
I think he wants us to sober up by throwing up.

503
00:45:00,170 --> 00:45:01,930
Just order me some hangover soup.

504
00:45:01,930 --> 00:45:03,960
Me too.

505
00:45:10,190 --> 00:45:11,430
Traitor.

506
00:45:11,430 --> 00:45:14,030
Are you talking to me right now?

507
00:45:16,210 --> 00:45:20,230
 Is it all right for the police to remain incompetent?

508
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:35,370
I looked into every possible place where Chief Seok might be, but I couldn't find that... What was it again?

509
00:45:35,370 --> 00:45:38,100
Anyway, I couldn't find the box, let alone Chief Seok.

510
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:40,800
Was there no mathematical equations on the walls of that house?

511
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,280
Not at all.

512
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:46,130
What about an analysis of the equations found on Professor Yoon's wall?

513
00:45:46,130 --> 00:45:49,360
It seems to be taking a while since those are quite difficult equations.

514
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:52,590

515
00:45:56,230 --> 00:45:58,370

516
00:45:58,370 --> 00:46:01,220

517
00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:06,500

518
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:07,520

519
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:10,160

520
00:46:14,790 --> 00:46:17,080

521
00:46:46,950 --> 00:46:50,730
 Let the people of this world punish you for your crimes here.

522
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:06,430
They've kept you in there for 30 years. I don't know who made the decision, but how cruel that person was.

523
00:47:06,430 --> 00:47:09,530
What would you know?

524
00:47:09,530 --> 00:47:14,630
Well... I know you've been left in the lurch.

525
00:47:14,630 --> 00:47:19,650
You'll be out in two days. Can you handle it in your condition?

526
00:47:19,650 --> 00:47:24,680
If you cooperate, we can help you. Who is the teacher?

527
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:28,120
Why are you looking for him now?

528
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:32,660
You're the ones who took The Book of Prophecy.

529
00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:35,750
That's why that woman ended up the way she did.

530
00:47:36,790 --> 00:47:38,170
That woman?

531
00:47:38,170 --> 00:47:42,630
The woman that stood next to you while my ankle was cut!

532
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:48,410
What happened to Tae Yi?

533
00:47:48,410 --> 00:47:53,880
If you're curious, ask Oh Shi Young.

534
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:59,190
How do you know Team Leader Oh Shi Young?

535
00:47:59,190 --> 00:48:02,540
She came here a few days ago.

536
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:10,780

537
00:48:13,710 --> 00:48:16,470

538
00:48:16,470 --> 00:48:18,320
Tae Yi.

539
00:48:24,070 --> 00:48:25,900
What's the reason you're doing this?

540
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:28,050
I have a child now.

541
00:48:28,050 --> 00:48:31,520
I'm 12 weeks pregnant. Please congratulate me.

542
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:36,380
You should get an abortion. You must.

543
00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:41,100
No. I'm going to give birth here.

544
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:42,630
Are you crazy?

545
00:48:42,630 --> 00:48:44,930
How can you give birth and raise a child here?

546
00:48:44,930 --> 00:48:48,630
I can do it. You know me.

547
00:48:48,630 --> 00:48:52,390
Don't do anything you'll regret. Return with me.

548
00:48:52,390 --> 00:48:56,860
This... is my own fate that I've chosen.

549
00:48:56,860 --> 00:48:59,020
Do you think Min Hyeok won't look for you?

550
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:02,540
Just tell him that you couldn't find me.

551
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:04,910
Why?

552
00:49:04,910 --> 00:49:07,350
Why must I do that?

553
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:13,930
I wish I could tell you everything.

554
00:49:13,930 --> 00:49:16,500
Why can't you?

555
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:19,020
Aren't we friends?

556
00:49:23,290 --> 00:49:30,530
Fine. If that's what you decided, then do so.

557
00:49:30,530 --> 00:49:34,600
But never return

558
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:36,870
for Min Hyeok's sake.

559
00:49:56,030 --> 00:49:59,540
This is the list of suspects based on the fingerprints and DNA found in the lecture hall.

560
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:02,150
There wasn't anything particularly suspicious about anyone.

561
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:07,020
 Lieutenant!

562
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:16,090

563
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:31,980
 Though the answer may be the same, all mathematicians have ways of getting to that answer.

564
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:33,820
 It's like a signature, of sorts.

565
00:50:33,820 --> 00:50:37,860
 But I can see similarities with the equation the criminal wrote.

566
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:47,380
 I was searching through a site of journal articles and found an article using the same equation.

567
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:50,830
 The author is a man called Ju Hae Min.

568
00:51:18,250 --> 00:51:21,200

569
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:55,400
Oh Shi Young.

570
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:09,510
You know what happened to Tae Yi, don't you?

571
00:53:09,510 --> 00:53:13,020
Tell me. What are you hiding?

572
00:53:18,890 --> 00:53:19,750
What are you talking about?

573
00:53:19,750 --> 00:53:22,280
You went to meet Lee Se Hoon!

574
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:23,030
Min Hyeok–

575
00:53:23,030 --> 00:53:25,750
What did you do to Tae Yi?

576
00:53:31,890 --> 00:53:33,430
 It's a tracking device.

577
00:53:33,430 --> 00:53:36,900
 Just in case, please keep it with you at all times.

578
00:54:01,350 --> 00:54:03,530
Professor!

579
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:24,650
Excuse me. You dropped this.

580
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,890
Lieutenant...

581
00:56:03,370 --> 00:56:05,980
What are you doing here, Professor?

582
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:10,620
Who are you? Do you know me?

583
00:56:12,190 --> 00:56:15,390
Where is Lieutenant Park Jin Gyeom right now?

584
00:56:15,390 --> 00:56:18,590
Who? Lieutenant Park Jin Gyeom?

585
00:56:18,590 --> 00:56:21,910
Yes. Where is he right now?

586
00:56:28,070 --> 00:56:29,940
What's the issue?

587
00:56:31,060 --> 00:56:34,800
Lieutenant Park passed away last year.

588
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:40,570
Passed away?

589
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:45,270
What are you talking about?

590
00:56:51,490 --> 00:56:55,090
Are you telling me that Lieutenant Park is dead?

591
00:56:55,090 --> 00:56:58,700
- Would you like a cup of coff– 
 - Don't change the subject and tell me!

592
00:56:58,700 --> 00:57:01,350
Why did Lieutenant Park die?

593
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:06,350
Stop speaking nonsense and ask him to come.

594
00:57:06,350 --> 00:57:11,210
Oh, what about Detective Ko?

595
00:57:11,210 --> 00:57:14,630
Are Lieutenant Park and Detective Ko together?

596
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:18,510
Where is Lieutenant Park right now?

597
00:57:18,510 --> 00:57:20,260
Please stop.

598
00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:24,110
We'll be sure to catch the culprit.

599
00:57:26,530 --> 00:57:28,510
No.

600
00:57:29,730 --> 00:57:32,110
There's no need.

601
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:39,790
Lieutenant Park isn't dead. A killer doesn't exist.

602
00:57:42,450 --> 00:57:47,560
Even until this morning, we were in the same house.

603
00:57:48,850 --> 00:57:53,870
Just a moment ago, he came to save me.

604
00:57:56,980 --> 00:58:00,120
Why would he be dead?

605
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:05,910
He... doesn't feel emotions.

606
00:58:05,910 --> 00:58:08,460
Do you know how strong he is?

607
00:58:10,310 --> 00:58:13,210
He isn't someone who would die.

608
00:58:15,020 --> 00:58:17,660
Please tell him to come here.

609
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:20,930
Hurry and call him!

610
00:58:20,930 --> 00:58:23,150
Hurry!

611
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:30,370

 No!

615

616
00:58:46,090 --> 00:58:49,250

 Why do you keep getting hurt and making me worry?

626
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:36,910
 Did something happen during your time travel?

627
00:59:36,910 --> 00:59:39,810
 He was murdered by the person who killed his mother.

628
00:59:39,810 --> 00:59:40,920
 Who's the killer?

629
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:42,190
 What's your relationship with my mother?

630
00:59:42,190 --> 00:59:43,340
 This is all your mother's fault.

631
00:59:43,340 --> 00:59:45,030
 Where's the last page of "The Book of Prophecy?"

632
00:59:45,030 --> 00:59:47,180
 How do you know about "The Book of Prophecy?"

633
00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:48,390
 Where is the professor?

634
00:59:48,390 --> 00:59:52,040
 Whether she's my mother or not, I'm going to protect her.
