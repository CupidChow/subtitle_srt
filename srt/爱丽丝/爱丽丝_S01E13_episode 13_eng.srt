1
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:36,420
 "There" is nowhere better than "here." 
 - Chérie Carter Scott -

2
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:39,550

3
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,250
When did you get back home? You should've called when you got here.

4
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:53,520
I told you I came back.

5
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,600
When?

6
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,360
In the living room.

7
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:02,210
I need to study.

8
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:03,500
All right. Sorry.

9
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,520
I'll change and cut some fruit for you.

10
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:17,460

11
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:02,590
Why did you come here?

12
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,310
How did you come here?

13
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,830
Tae Yi.

14
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,140
When I was young,

15
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:17,200
I'd been to this room, hadn't I?

16
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:22,510
Why did you do that?

17
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:25,500
Why did you pretend to be my mom?

18
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,600
Tae Yi, from now on, this is our home. Okay?

19
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,650
Mom and I, the two of us, are going to live together?

20
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:44,480
No, with the baby inside my tummy, the three of us.

21
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:51,160
Come here.

22
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,190
Let's see.

23
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:10,220
What is my Tae Yi doing?

24
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,840
You did this?

25
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,130
Where did you learn this?

26
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:23,590
The doctor.  I asked him to teach me.

27
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:27,400
I even corrected him when he got something wrong.

28
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,270
He told me that I am a genius.

29
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,980
You must take after Mom.  You are so smart.

30
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,230
Can I take a look?

31
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,040

32
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:19,190

33
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:58,680
Tae Yi, this drawing,

34
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:00,760
did you do it?

35
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,470
Yeah, I drew well, didn't I?

36
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,850
There is more on the back.

37
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:22,130
What did you see and draw?

38
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,980
I am sorry. I'm so sorry.

39
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:41,640

40
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:45,930
 She opened the forbidden door of time

41
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:49,430
 and saw a world she should not have crossed over to see.

42
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:54,090
 Now the punishment she must take has been sentenced.

43
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:04,110
Mom, why?

44
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:13,000
Did you read everything?

45
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:18,070
But I don't understand any of it.

46
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,240
It's okay.

47
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,310
You don't need to know.

48
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:28,130
My Tae Yi doesn't need to know.

49
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,020
- Hello.
 - Hello.

50
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:06,240
 - Hello. 
 - Hello.

51
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,570

52
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,040
Mom, look at this big tree.

53
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:39,760
Listen carefully to what I'm about to tell you now.

54
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:44,180
From now, this is Tae Yi's home.

55
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:46,990
- Here? 
 - Yes.

56
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:52,100
So listen carefully to the sisters, okay?

57
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,550
What about you, Mom?

58
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:58,730
We can't live together.  We shouldn't live together.

59
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:03,540
Why not?  Why can't we live together?

60
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:06,060
If you live with Mom,

61
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:09,700
you will be in danger.

62
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:15,270
I don't want to.

63
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:21,530
I am going to live with Mom.  I am going to stay with Mom.

64
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,140
I am sorry.

65
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:33,750
That I came here.

66
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:48,700
I had forgiven you for everything.

67
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:51,350
There must have been a reason for Mom to abandon me.

68
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:54,690
I am sure Mom had no choice.

69
00:09:54,690 --> 00:10:00,030
Still, because you are Mom, I was going to forgive you for everything.

70
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,500
Perhaps,

71
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:05,820
was it because of "The Book of Prophecy?"

72
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:10,790
Was it because of that

73
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:13,290
you pretended to be my mom and abandoned me?

74
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:16,780
No.  At that time,

75
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:21,660
I had no other choice.

76
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:24,090
Where is the last page?

77
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:26,100
I burned it.

78
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:29,050
Because no one should see it.

79
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:34,400
Why did you burn it?  Do you know how much I searched for it?

80
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,700
It was for you.

81
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,830
It was given to me by my father.

82
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:42,830
Your father would have understood me as well.

83
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,710
 Mom.

84
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,830
Are you talking to someone on the phone?

85
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:53,100
I will be out as soon as I am done with the phone call.

86
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:00,340
Jin Gyeom doesn't know anything and he shouldn't know either.

87
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:03,270
I will be right back.

88
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,600
Why?  Did you need something?

89
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,090
Is someone inside your room?

90
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:19,660
Of course not.

91
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:22,070
I will cut some fruit for you.

92
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,160
Jin Gyeom!

93
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,000
Lieutenant!

94
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,050
Jin Gyeom!  Jin Gyeom!

95
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:07,840
Jin Gyeom!  Jin Gyeom.

96
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:31,780

97
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:43,670

98
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:49,080
 Hey, you crazy punk!

99
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,860
What year is this?

100
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,930
I asked you what year this is!

101
00:12:57,930 --> 00:13:00,720
It's year 2010, Sir.

102
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:23,840
We have to go to the hospital right away.

103
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:27,730
Because of time travel, I had the same kind of spots as well.

104
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:42,360
It's no use going to the hospital.  Jin Gyeom has to leave this place.

105
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:46,760
Why didn't you tell me that you came with Jin Gyeom?

106
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,510
Is Lieutenant here, too?

107
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:54,710
We have to find Jin Gyeom first.

108
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:59,000
If Jin Gyeom stays here, both will be in danger.

109
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,610
Yes, hello?

110
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:09,700
 Are you perhaps the mother of student Park Jin Gyeom?

111
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,430
Yes, I am.

112
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:16,390
I'm calling you because Park Jin Gyeom just got transported here to the hospital.

113
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:20,790
My Jin Gyeom was?  But, he is at home—

114
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:24,740
Which hospital is it?

115
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,610
I contacted his guardian.

116
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:29,570
Thank you.

117
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:38,100
 '92.  If he was born in 1992, he is 19 years old...

118
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:41,260
Aren't you coming?

119
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,580
It will be better if I don't meet him.

120
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:48,930
When you see Jin Gyeom, tell him to go back right away.

121
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:51,720
Lieutenant won't just go back.

122
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,370
So, please convince him.

123
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:59,710
That he doesn't have to worry about Mom dying.

124
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:04,430
So do you know what's going to happen?

125
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:08,360
It was on the last page, wasn't it?

126
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:12,310
So you must know who the culprit is as well.

127
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:17,250
My death is not something that Jin Gyeom can stop.

128
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:23,950
If he doesn't give up, he will be in more danger as time passes.

129
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:29,700
Don't you even know your own son?  He even became a cop to catch the culprit who killed his mother.

130
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:32,870
He only thought about that for the last 10 years.

131
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:37,150
That's why... please do something for him.

132
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:41,040
If I see Jin Gyeom,

133
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:44,070
I will waver as well.

134
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:07,920
Excuse me.  I came for Park Jin Gyeom.  I heard he's here.

135
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:13,000
Ah, I see.  He woke up a little while ago,

136
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,960
but he ran away.

137
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:25,440
Could I use the phone, please?

138
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:12,820
Jin Gyeom!

139
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,610
Mom.

140
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:32,430
Mom.

141
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:53,590
Why did you come here?

142
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:56,130
This is a place you should not be in.

143
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:58,280
Why are you like this, Mom?

144
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,290
Let's talk outside.

145
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:14,490
If you are here, everyone will be in danger.  Go back.

146
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:16,620
I can't go now.

147
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:19,550
For you,

148
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:20,730
I still have something left to do.

149
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:24,930
You are going to save me and catch the culprit as well?

150
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:26,320
How do you know that, Mom?

151
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:32,420
Listen carefully.  Nothing will change by you saving me.

152
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:36,640
What will change is not me, but you and the world you live in.

153
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,180
Without missing a day,

154
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:42,110
I thought about it every day.

155
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:45,610
Even just for one day,

156
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:51,020
if I could go back to that day and save Mom, it would be great.

157
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:57,240
Tomorrow is that day.  Your birthday.

158
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:00,190
I will stay here just until tomorrow.

159
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:05,190
Don't you understand?  That's what will put us more in danger.

160
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:08,300
If it's for me,

161
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:10,860
please don't ever come back here again.

162
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:14,450
- Mom. 
 - My son is at home right now.

163
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,940
Hello?

164
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:57,070
You are awake?

165
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,520
Mom?

166
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:03,070
Yeah.

167
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:07,150
How are you feeling? Are you okay?

168
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,930
Where are you?

169
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:14,510
I came out to take care of something for a bit.

170
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:19,810
Did anyone suspicious come to visit by any chance?

171
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:22,150
Who?

172
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:30,630
Don't worry.

173
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:35,370
The police think that Seo Eun died by suicide.

174
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:38,300
What do you mean?

175
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:42,560
Who are you?

176
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:51,080
Now I know.

177
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:55,580
I thought only the faces were same,

178
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:58,060
but even the voices are the same.

179
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,320
We met earlier, didn't we?

180
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,270
At home.

181
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:22,170
When did you get up?

182
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:26,080
A little while ago.

183
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:41,030
You were surprised because I wasn't home, weren't you?

184
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:45,480
You must be hungry.  Wait just a bit.

185
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:53,530

186
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,710
What's wrong?

187
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,920
Some bad news?

188
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:25,320
Lieutenant!

189
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:33,220
Professor, are you all right?

190
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:35,760
I didn't know you were here.

191
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:41,580
Did you meet your mother?

192
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:43,900
Yes.

193
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,700
Are you all right?

194
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:48,120
I don't understand.

195
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:53,200
I don't know why Mom is trying to avoid me.

196
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:58,090
What's wrong?

197
00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:00,860
I have something I want to ask you.

198
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:08,220
When you were in high school, had you ever suddenly fainted after getting a bloody nose?

199
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,190
No. Never.

200
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:15,690
Or have you ever caused an issue due to your alexithymia?

201
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:18,070
Why are you asking me that?

202
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:22,730
I was on the phone with the current you, of this world.

203
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:27,860
Even if it was you from 10 years ago, it didn't seem like the you I knew.

204
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:30,530
Your mother's reaction was weird as well.

205
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:35,390
Maybe something has changed because we came here,

206
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:39,760
or we might have come to a different dimension we're not aware of.

207
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,230
It doesn't matter.

208
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:47,840
Before my mother passes away, I just need to find Seok Oh Wan.

209
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,370
While we're here, please use this phone.

210
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:07,810
What if this past isn't the same one as you remember?

211
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:10,690
And... if the chief is the culprit.

212
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:14,860
There is no reason for your mother to meet him, here.

213
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:17,540
Even here,  I'm certain there will be two versions of Seok Oh Wan.

214
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:19,590
And when my mother was killed,

215
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:23,490
time traveler Seok Oh Wan was there.

216
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:28,100
Even if a different culprit exists, we must first catch Seok Oh wan.

217
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,890
I've booked a hotel across the street.

218
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:37,450
If something happens, please call me immediately.

219
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:49,740
 Jin Gyeom.

220
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:53,760
 Park Jin Gyeom.

221
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:16,320
Okay.

222
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,100
 You haven't gone home?

223
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,780
Thank you.

224
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:31,180
Thanks to you, I found out why Sung Eun died by suicide.

225
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:35,900
If you had told me sooner, I could have found ways to help you.

226
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:38,950
But how did you know?

227
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:42,170
Did Sung Eun tell you before she jumped off?

228
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:44,920
Did she say anything else?

229
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:50,850
I just... want to know, as her friend.

230
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:54,730
She asked me to save her.

231
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:58,470
What do you mean?

232
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:01,720
What do you mean, she asked you to save her?

233
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:33,570
Aren't you... going to ask me?

234
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:37,830
To save you?

235
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:09,020
You're Do Yeon, right?

236
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,370
Who are you?

237
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:12,960
I'm Jin Gyeom's Aunt.

238
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,480
I wanted to ask you something about Jin Gyeom.

239
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,560
Why are you asking me about him?

240
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:21,980
Jin Gyeom told me you're his only friend.

241
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:24,550
Huh? He said that?

242
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:26,760
Crazy bastard.

243
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:30,390
I was wondering...

244
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:33,990
Has Jin Gyeom not been acting strange recently?

245
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:35,700
He's always weird.

246
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:41,010
Then, what did you talk about with him on the rooftop?

247
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:43,420
I don't even want to think about it.

248
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,330
Can I leave now?

249
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:48,440
Good night.

250
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,400
Reporter!

251
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:13,220
Reporter!

252
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,530

253
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:27,260
I'm here to meet Chief Seok Oh Won. Is he inside?

254
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:28,440
What business are you here for?

255
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:32,270
I have something important to tell him regarding his research.

256
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:36,050
He was murdered... last night.

257
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:43,190

258
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:58,430

259
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:01,060

260
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:03,370
Yes, Professor.

261
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:06,040
The reporter has been injured.

262
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,510
Do Yeon?

263
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:12,950

264
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:14,830
Where is patient Kim Do Yeon?

265
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:16,760
Lieutenant.

266
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:25,050
You can't go in.

267
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:29,390
She can't see your face.

268
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:33,520
Who did it?

269
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:37,290
She didn't see the culprit's face, because he approached her from behind.

270
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:42,330
But I found this on the site of the scene.

271
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:49,920
I think it's the culprit's, but I don't know who's phone it is because there's a password on it.

272
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:55,160
What's wrong?

273
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:58,730
Do you know whose it is?

274
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,240
Jin Gyeom?

275
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,680

276
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:41,490
 Where are you? Are you outside?

277
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:50,040

278
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:55,700
Son, can't you here me?

279
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:10,210

280
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:14,760
 The person you are trying to call...

281
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:17,380
 is not available. After the tone,

282
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:14,360
Did you go somewhere?

283
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,760
Just for some fresh air.

284
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:19,900
Did your phone break?

285
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:25,990
No.

286
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:34,950
 Jin Gyeom...

287
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:39,750
 Jin Gyeom

288
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:43,680
 Jin Gyeom...

289
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,920
 Jin Gyeom. Jin Gyeom. Jin Gyeom.

290
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:55,390
 Jin Gyeom. Jin Gyeom. Jin Gyeom.

291
00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:58,110
 Jin Gyeom! Jin Gyeom. Jin Gyeom.

292
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,100
 Jin Gyeom. Jin Gyeom. Jin Gyeom.

293
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:33,130
We need to tell your mother.

294
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:35,750
She definitely knows something.

295
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:40,540
It could be that Do Yeon just had the phone on her.

296
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:43,210
Do Yeon is a special friend to me.

297
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:46,200
That should be the same for the me of this world, as well.

298
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:51,320
There is no reason I would do that to Do Yeon, even here.

299
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,390
I'll try to meet your mother tomorrow.

300
00:34:53,390 --> 00:34:56,990
No. There's no time for that.

301
00:34:56,990 --> 00:35:01,920
We need to look into Seok Oh Won's case, and you need to help me.

302
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,660
What case?

303
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:07,160
He's been murdered.

304
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:10,750
Seok Oh Won, who should be alive until 2020,

305
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,600
has died.

306
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:20,190
When my mother and Seok Oh Won were conducting research, he received "The Book of Prophecy"  from her.

307
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:25,080
There's a high chance he was killed because of that "Book of Prophecy."

308
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:27,080
Are you going to enter his room?

309
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:30,470
Yes. Time traveler Seok Oh Won

310
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:33,610
likely entered that room in search of "The Book of Prophecy."

311
00:35:33,610 --> 00:35:36,540
I need to find clues that'll lead me to him.

312
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:40,230
With your identity, you can't enter that space.

313
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:44,280
But others cannot tell the difference between your mother and me.

314
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:58,610
Do you think the Chief would really have kept "The Book of Prophecy" here?

315
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:06,410
Isn't it weird?

316
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:08,230
What?

317
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:11,940
I first met Chief Seok around this time in 2010.

318
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:16,890
But... he's never heard about or been to your mother's research lab.

319
00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:23,170
Based on the fact that the workers at the desk recognized your mother, it means she frequently came here.

320
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:27,370
Where does your mother conduct her research?

321
00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:42,250
Can you raise the indoor temperature as high as you can?

322
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:43,590
What are you going to do?

323
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:45,570
Hurry.

324
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:02,790
There's a thermal equation called the ideal gas law.

325
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:07,230
As the indoor temperature of an enclosed space increases, the thermal energy of the air increases.

326
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:11,650
As the air particles start hitting the walls more frequently with more force, the pressure increases.

327
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:15,250
If there is a secret compartment hidden in this room,

328
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:19,280
that compartment will take in the smoke due to the difference in air pressure.

329
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:32,250
It's here.

330
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:35,780
There should be a switch near here.

331
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:23,970
Your mother... must have conducted her research here.

332
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:58,600

333
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:04,320

334
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:19,250
 The child born through the doors of time will come to control it.

335
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:25,140
 However, instead of being happy, he must be sad.

336
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:31,700
 Controlling time means that one must pay a large price.

337
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:36,580
 He will experience a loss he cannot handle.

338
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:55,950
The Book of Prophecy.

339
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:01,600
I have seen the last page.

340
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:26,930
I don't remember all of the contents, but...

341
00:40:26,930 --> 00:40:31,660
 I remember this sentence exactly.

342
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:39,250
At the time, I didn't understand what it meant.

343
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:48,610
But... the woman who opened the doors of time

344
00:40:56,990 --> 00:41:03,050
must be... your mother.

345
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:36,150
Are you pretending to sleep?

346
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:09,250
Your memory must be wrong.

347
00:43:10,970 --> 00:43:13,700
Does it make sense that I would kill my mother?

348
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:19,120
She burned it because it contained horrible content about her son.

349
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:23,130
She didn't want to show it to anyone else.

350
00:43:23,130 --> 00:43:26,040
I've told you, your memory must be wrong.

351
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:28,790
I'm not suspecting you.

352
00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:33,200
I'm suspecting the high school Park Jin Gyeom of this world.

353
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,620
He's also me!

354
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:39,770
Why would I kill my mom?

355
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:45,170
Ten years ago, when my mother was murdered,

356
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:48,990
I was looking for her.

357
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:55,020
There's no reason I would be the culprit, and there's no reason the culprit would change.

358
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:09,430
Lieutenant...

359
00:44:09,430 --> 00:44:12,170
Did you just hear that?

360
00:44:12,170 --> 00:44:14,030
What?

361
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:17,660
A scream.

362
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:21,610
No... I didn't hear anything.

363
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:25,400
Are you sure you didn't hear it?

364
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:28,110
Lieutenant, what's wrong?

365
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:32,590
 Jin Gyeom!

366
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,330
Are you okay?

367
00:44:42,330 --> 00:44:44,190
Lieutenant!

368
00:45:05,890 --> 00:45:07,810
 Jin Gyeom.

369
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:21,720
Come and eat.

370
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:43,210
Hello?

371
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:59,780
Jin Gyeom. Jin Gyeom?

372
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:08,440
What happened?

373
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:09,940
I'm not sure.

374
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:14,000
He was experiencing hallucinations all night, and just fell asleep.

375
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:19,320
Those were not hallucinations.

376
00:46:20,630 --> 00:46:23,660
He's hearing sounds of another dimension.

377
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:26,930
What are the sounds of another dimension?

378
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:32,460
The voices of those living in another dimension.

379
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:35,410
Jin Gyeom shouldn't have come here.

380
00:46:35,410 --> 00:46:38,660
He shouldn't have traveled through time.

381
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:43,770
Every time he travels through a worm, something weird will happen to Jin Gyeom.

382
00:46:43,770 --> 00:46:46,260
Is that why

383
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:48,590
your high school son has become strange?

384
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:56,370
As the cost of opening the doors of time, she will die at the hands of her son.

385
00:46:56,370 --> 00:46:58,680
That's the last page, right?

386
00:47:00,790 --> 00:47:06,800
Is the son that's mentioned on the last page, Lieutenant Park?

387
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:11,130
You're misunderstanding. It has nothing to do with Jin Gyeom.

388
00:47:11,130 --> 00:47:14,150
Then why did you tell him to go back?

389
00:47:14,150 --> 00:47:17,820
It's because you knew issues would arise due to him being here.

390
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:20,320
Isn't that why you were trying to stop time travel?

391
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:25,170
You were trying to stop time traveling to prevent anything from happening to your son.

392
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:37,560
It was mentioned in "The Book of Prophecy,"

393
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:43,590
the people who are able to stop time travel. How can we stop time travel?

394
00:47:44,830 --> 00:47:46,960
It cannot be stopped.

395
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:53,900
Time travel is not something that can be prevented.

396
00:47:55,140 --> 00:48:00,250
Once it has been started, no one can stop it.

397
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:04,320
You're the one who created time travel. There must be a way.

398
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:09,580
If there was a way, I would've already stopped it.

399
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:14,570
It's all my fault.

400
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:18,900
Time travel shouldn't have been created.

401
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:24,330
Your mother also couldn't have known things would go this way.

402
00:48:24,330 --> 00:48:26,130
My mother?

403
00:48:28,170 --> 00:48:30,730
Do you know my mother?

404
00:48:30,730 --> 00:48:32,730
How?

405
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:41,970
The person who first discovered "The Book of Prophecy" was your mother.

406
00:48:41,970 --> 00:48:44,420
Wasn't it my father?

407
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:49,330
Your mother was also a time traveler.

408
00:48:52,990 --> 00:48:58,510
When I was your age, I succeeded in creating time travel.

409
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:02,000
At the time, weird rumors were circulating.

410
00:49:03,450 --> 00:49:09,970
about a book that outlined the end of time travel. At first, I didn't believe it.

411
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:14,580
I thought it was nonsense that someone came up with.

412
00:49:15,270 --> 00:49:19,500
A new world of time travel was just about to open,

413
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:25,500
so how could I believe a book already outlined the end of it?

414
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:32,860
However, your mother found it.

415
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:35,480
The Book of Prophecy.

416
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:41,160
With that book, she ran away.

417
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:43,070
Why?

418
00:49:44,990 --> 00:49:47,860
Nobody knew the reason

419
00:49:49,370 --> 00:49:52,570
as to why your mother made that decision.

420
00:49:53,570 --> 00:49:58,820
I only found out later that your mother had run away

421
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:02,300
to the year 1986.

422
00:50:05,130 --> 00:50:11,240
There, your mother... married someone of the past.

423
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:17,960
That's your father, Dr. Jang Dong Sik.

424
00:50:18,710 --> 00:50:24,570
The following events are as you know them. Your mother passed away while giving birth to you,

425
00:50:24,570 --> 00:50:28,170
and your father found "The Book of Prophecy"

426
00:50:28,170 --> 00:50:30,670
from her belongings.

427
00:50:32,370 --> 00:50:38,750
I, who found out later where your mother was,

428
00:50:38,750 --> 00:50:41,560
traveled to 1992 to reclaim "The Book of Prophecy."

429
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:45,600
I needed to know myself

430
00:50:46,470 --> 00:50:49,350
what was written in that book.

431
00:50:50,170 --> 00:50:56,700
But because I was too late, I wasn't able to save your father.

432
00:50:56,700 --> 00:51:02,710
Instead, I tried to raise you myself.

433
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:05,630
Why?

434
00:51:05,630 --> 00:51:10,090
Like you, I grew up as an orphan.

435
00:51:12,070 --> 00:51:16,970
That's why... I was so committed to time travel.

436
00:51:16,970 --> 00:51:20,020
I wanted to find my parents.

437
00:51:20,670 --> 00:51:26,870
The only thing I remember is my father's face.

438
00:51:28,370 --> 00:51:34,370
It was only after I went to the year 1992

439
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:38,370
that I found my father.

440
00:51:40,290 --> 00:51:42,590
No way.

441
00:51:43,550 --> 00:51:46,070
That's when I realized

442
00:51:46,070 --> 00:51:51,030
that the time traveler who found "The Book of Prophecy" was my mother,

443
00:51:52,190 --> 00:51:56,010
and Dr. Jang Dong Sik was my father.

444
00:51:56,830 --> 00:51:58,770
And then...

445
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:06,980
 The young child crying by my side

446
00:52:09,910 --> 00:52:12,620
could also be me.

447
00:52:14,910 --> 00:52:18,170
That's why I wanted to watch over you.

448
00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:26,910
But after I saw the last page, I changed my mind.

449
00:52:28,250 --> 00:52:32,590
I wanted you to be free from this destiny.

450
00:52:32,590 --> 00:52:34,660
What destiny?

451
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:39,490
The woman who must pay the price of opening the doors of time

452
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:42,620
does not just refer to me.

453
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:49,810
When you go back, forget it all.

454
00:52:49,810 --> 00:52:55,910
Don't ever meet Jin Gyeom. You could be in danger, too.

455
00:53:09,530 --> 00:53:12,110
This is where your parents are buried.

456
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:15,470
I've been taking care of them.

457
00:53:41,270 --> 00:53:46,180

458
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:56,680
Jin Gyeom.

459
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:08,990
Mom.

460
00:54:08,990 --> 00:54:11,170
Are you okay?

461
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:14,230
Yes.

462
00:54:20,730 --> 00:54:23,040
Why aren't you eating?

463
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:27,560
It's been... 10 years.

464
00:54:28,530 --> 00:54:31,190
Since eating food that you've cooked for me.

465
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:33,540
Eat up.

466
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:08,810
Why are you crying?

467
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:17,330
Because it tastes good.

468
00:55:20,110 --> 00:55:22,620
It's so good, Mom.

469
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:41,790
Mom, The Book of Prophecy is wrong.

470
00:55:41,790 --> 00:55:44,840
There's no reason I'd be the culprit.

471
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:47,800
How could I do that to you?

472
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:51,220
I'll check it myself.

473
00:55:51,220 --> 00:55:54,220
Whether the me that's here is the culprit or not.

474
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:59,100
Don't worry. I won't meet him in person.

475
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:03,440
Jin Gyeom, you don't have to worry about me.

476
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:06,160
How can I not worry about you?

477
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:13,270
I... I'm going to protect you no matter what.

478
00:56:14,750 --> 00:56:19,760
Then, I'll leave. I'll leave without regrets.

479
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:26,330
You've been lonely because of me for the past 19 years.

480
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:30,010
I'll protect you.

481
00:56:30,010 --> 00:56:34,890
I wasn't lonely.

482
00:56:34,890 --> 00:56:40,250
Because I had you, for 19 years,

483
00:56:40,250 --> 00:56:43,220
I was happy every day.

484
00:56:54,400 --> 00:57:00,080
Our son... You've grown well, even without me.

485
00:57:03,570 --> 00:57:06,860
I guess I don't have to worry anymore.

486
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:41,790
Okay.

487
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:51,590
Where are you going?

488
00:57:51,590 --> 00:57:53,540
Hey!

489
00:58:04,730 --> 00:58:06,820
Master.

490
00:58:54,690 --> 00:58:56,570

491
00:58:56,570 --> 00:58:59,050

492
00:59:02,790 --> 00:59:06,830

493
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:58,090

494
01:01:02,890 --> 01:01:05,140
Are you going inside right away?

495
01:01:05,140 --> 01:01:07,480
You have to light the candles for me.

496
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:09,390
Okay.

497
01:01:25,620 --> 01:01:29,720
It's a lie, right? That you can't stop time travel?

498
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:33,060
It's not. Why would I lie about that?

499
01:01:33,060 --> 01:01:37,470
Then... is it a coincidence that Chief Seok found me 10 years ago?

500
01:01:37,470 --> 01:01:41,380
Didn't he lure me into continuing your research?

501
01:01:41,380 --> 01:01:43,580
Let's talk outside.

502
01:01:54,090 --> 01:01:56,370
Fine. You're right.

503
01:01:56,370 --> 01:01:59,960
I had found a way to stop time travel.

504
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:04,060
But I also found something I hadn't thought of before.

505
01:02:04,060 --> 01:02:06,980
That's why I stopped.

506
01:02:06,980 --> 01:02:11,090
If you stop time travel, everything resets.

507
01:02:11,090 --> 01:02:12,410
"Reset?"

508
01:02:12,410 --> 01:02:15,630
It becomes a world in which time travel never existed,

509
01:02:15,630 --> 01:02:18,730
and all time travelers disappear.

510
01:02:18,730 --> 01:02:20,750
Isn't that what we want?

511
01:02:20,750 --> 01:02:24,790
No. We can't reset.

512
01:02:24,790 --> 01:02:26,570
We've already come too far.

513
01:02:26,570 --> 01:02:29,730
What do you mean?

514
01:03:08,990 --> 01:03:10,880
Are you laughing?

515
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:14,860
When a day comes for you to know the entire truth,

516
01:03:14,860 --> 01:03:17,580
you'll understand

517
01:03:17,580 --> 01:03:19,920
how humorous this current situation is.

518
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:22,240
Cut the bull.

519
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:26,560
Did you think I wouldn't know that you're the culprit who killed my mom?

520
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:29,400
How would I dare to kill her?

521
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:34,290
However, her death is necessary.

522
01:03:34,290 --> 01:03:36,140
Then who is it?

523
01:03:36,140 --> 01:03:38,740
Who's after my mother?

524
01:03:40,860 --> 01:03:43,180
Please accept it.

525
01:03:43,180 --> 01:03:45,880
Tell me who it is, you bastard.

526
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:50,160
I think you're already aware.

527
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:52,980

528
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:35,630
Mom!

529
01:05:42,710 --> 01:05:44,590
Mom.

530
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:47,340
Mom.

531
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:56,930
Mom.

532
01:05:58,610 --> 01:06:00,590
Mom.

533
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:52,690
It was really... you?

534
01:07:02,860 --> 01:07:05,270
Tell me! Did you do it?

535
01:07:07,750 --> 01:07:09,980
Tell me it isn't true.

536
01:07:11,150 --> 01:07:14,200
Tell me is isn't true, you bastard!

537
01:07:24,510 --> 01:07:27,580
♫  My love will bring us back  ♫

538
01:07:27,580 --> 01:07:31,670
♫  Ain't nobody holding me back  ♫

♫  We'll be like Bonnie and Clyde  ♫

550
01:08:01,170 --> 01:08:04,330
 I've seen my mother die three times. I'm going to catch him.

551
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:06,810
 Something happened to Jin Gyeom while time traveling, right?

552
01:08:06,810 --> 01:08:09,680
 How nice it is to hear your voice. This time, it's your turn.

553
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:12,910
 I need to find out how his mother was planning on ending time travel.

554
01:08:12,910 --> 01:08:15,520
 I think Yoon Tae Yi has brought the last page of the book.

555
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:16,590
 Let's take care of everything at once.

556
01:08:16,590 --> 01:08:20,060
 Min Hyeok, there's nobody that can protect Jin Gyeom other than you.

557
01:08:20,060 --> 01:08:22,910
 I need to catch someone. I'll return after I get him.

558
01:08:22,910 --> 01:08:25,200
 To be honest, I know who killed Tae Yi.

559
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:28,040
 A you, of another dimension, could be the culprit.

560
01:08:28,040 --> 01:08:31,260
 I told you, it's your turn this time.
