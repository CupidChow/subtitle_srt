1
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:35,960
 Time is the coin of your life.

2
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,040
 It is the only coin you have,

3
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,800
 and only you can determine how it will be spent. 
 - Carl Sandburg -

4
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:51,070
 Passed away?

5
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,580
What are you talking about?

6
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:00,560
Are you saying Lieutenant Park is dead?

7
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:03,620
Where is Lieutenant Park right now?

8
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:05,070
Please stop.

9
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:08,800
We'll make sure to catch the culprit.

10
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,450
No.

11
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:16,140
There's no need to catch anyone.

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,570
Lieutenant Park is not dead.

13
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:23,960
Where's the culprit?

14
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,970
Even just this morning,

15
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:32,060
we were in the same house.

16
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:38,080
Just a little while ago, he came to save me.

17
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,090
How could someone like that die?

18
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
And...

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,800
that person doesn't feel emotions.

20
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,210
Do you know how stoic he is?

21
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,940
He's not someone who would die.

22
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:01,310
Please call Lieutenant Park here for me.

23
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:06,650
Hurry up and call him!

24
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:13,000

25
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:25,550

26
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,710

27
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:33,760
 The number you've dialed does not exist.

28
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,000
 Please check the number and dial again.

29
00:02:54,780 --> 00:03:03,400

30
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:27,380
 But still, you shouldn't sell the house and just leave it.

31
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:31,350
 I'll come and meet you here in the future.

32
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:33,540
 I'll be waiting

33
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,710
 until you come.

34
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:41,300
I came to see you.

35
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,890
Why aren't you here?

36
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:50,670
You said you'd wait for me.

37
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:55,740
Why didn't you keep your promise?

38
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:08,200
♫  From your dazzling, beautiful eyes  ♫

39
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,240

40
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:17,830
♫  Please just stay with me as much as you remember  ♫

41
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 The person you are trying to reach is not available.

42
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,920

43
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,640
♫  As you missed me  ♫

44
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:39,730
♫  Far away, I'm with you shooting star  ♫

45
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:46,810
♫  The night I still picture you  ♫

46
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:47,920
Professor!

47
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:54,190
♫  It get clearer when I close my eyes  ♫

48
00:04:54,190 --> 00:05:02,580
♫  I'm sick and I just miss you again  ♫

49
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:08,780
♫  To draw you even in a dream  ♫

50
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:16,160
♫  I'm afraid I'm going to wake up  ♫

51
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,810
♫  We...  ♫

52
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:22,050
Where are you right now?

53
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:26,460
You said you'd protect me.

54
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:31,730
You said you'd come running whenever.

55
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:40,630
♫  Even a little closer  ♫

56
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:50,370

57
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:56,980

58
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,320

59
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,640
 Are you...

60
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,050
 in this house right now?

61
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:30,850
 I'm also

62
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,380
 in this house.

63
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:43,940
Lieutenant Park...

64
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:47,720
Did you wait for me here?

65
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:07,430
 I know you're afraid.

66
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,150
 But... please don't be too uneasy.

67
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:15,090
 Whatever year you're in,

68
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:17,640
 I'll save you.

69
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:20,680
 Please wait just a little bit.

70
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,400
 Whatever world I'm in,

71
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,700
 that you'll come save me?

72
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,310
 I believe it.

73
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:03,250

74
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:10,750

75
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,220
Unnie!

76
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:21,430
- Yeah... 
 - Why are you here already?

77
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:25,610
- Huh? 
 - I thought you were going to be away for a month.

78
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:27,740
Oh,

79
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,320
I just...

80
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,770
Did you get into another argument with Reporter Kim?

81
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,600
Tae Yi!

82
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,260
Why?

83
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,320
You don't want to eat?

84
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:59,550
Just eat a little bit.

85
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,630

86
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,530
It is really...

87
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:11,280
2021?

88
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:14,970
What's wrong with you? Why are you asking the obvious?

89
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,060
Hey. Did something happen?

90
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:21,550
No.

91
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:26,450
Yeah right. I knew something was up when you said you'd go with Reporter Kim.

92
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:29,280
Even close friends become enemies when they go on trips.

93
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,800
But you two weren't close to begin with.

94
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:36,250
But still, how could you come back in just a week? Flights to Spain are so expensive...

95
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:38,170
You made the right choice.

96
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:40,780
If you feel something's off, it's right to just stop it there.

97
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:43,670
Yeah, it has been a year already.

98
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:47,170
It's time for you to accept it. It's not like Lieutenant Park will just come back to–

99
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:49,050
Ouch!

100
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:52,070
I told you not to say that in front of her.

101
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:02,500
You must be tired. Eat up and go rest.

102
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:30,280
Why? Does the few days you were away make it feel awkward?

103
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:36,570
I'm just tired. I'll rest now.

104
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:39,740
Do you want some beer?

105
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:43,600
Don't worry. I won't tell Mom.

106
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,300
Only if you promise not to cry when you get drunk.

107
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:50,140
You've already done enough.

108
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:34,270

109
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:37,980

110
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:44,110

111
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:50,410
 On the 15th, Lieutenant Park Jin Gyeom (29) was found dead in his home at dawn.

112
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:00,540

113
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:03,460

114
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,290
I've checked the CCTV,

115
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,730
and they only caught Professor Yoon falling from the roof.

116
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:16,430
There aren't any of her hitting the ground.

117
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:23,540
I'm sorry. I should've protected her better.

118
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:27,960
What happened to her?

119
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,120
I'll tell you later.

120
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,920
But you know.

121
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,750
Answer me.

122
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,840
I don't have time to explain.

123
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:42,900
Are you the only detective? I want to find her, too.

124
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:43,840
Please let go.

125
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,070
Tell me what happened.

126
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:48,640
- Let go. 
 - Tell me!

127
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:53,150
It's because of me.

128
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,450
She disappeared because of me.

129
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:12,950
These are the people involved in my mother's case.

130
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,770
Why are there two pictures of Professor Yoon?

131
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:20,270
One of those... is my mother.

132
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:22,240
Your mother?

133
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:24,340
Aren't they both pictures of Professor Yoon?

134
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:29,680
At first, I also thought they were the same person.

135
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:33,690
 But in 2010...

136
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:36,340
  - What?  
  - ...I met both, my mother

137
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:39,130
 and Professor Yoon at the same time.

138
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:40,290

139
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:44,170
Though they looked undeniably similar,

140
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:49,860
their personalities and ages were different.

141
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:54,880
I don't understand what you're saying.

142
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:02,530
I'm saying there are time travelers who came from other dimensions.

143
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:06,320
Someone who looks exactly like you could come here.

144
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,660
He could be a child or an elder.

145
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:17,060
Just like Professor Yoon... and my mother.

146
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:23,310
Are you saying these people are doppelgängers?

147
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:26,650
I don't know. I just want to find the professor.

148
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:28,860
Do you know where she is?

149
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:32,940
She's probably in another dimension.

150
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:58,370
I'd like to use the laboratory that I used before.

151
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:00,320
I have something to analyze.

152
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,720
How was your travel?

153
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:04,940
Travel?

154
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,830
Oh, you mean Spain?

155
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:11,530
No, your time travel.

156
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:16,760
How did you know that?

157
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:21,110
I heard it from you a year ago.

158
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:23,210
From me?

159
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,040
You will return to 2020.

160
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:32,360
Once you return, please never be interested in time travel again.

161
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:35,330
You could be in danger.

162
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:39,640
Do you know how I feel right now?

163
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:45,800
In the blink of an eye, 2020 became 2021.

164
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:52,280
This is where I used to live, and these are people I used to know,

165
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:55,820
but everything feels so unfamiliar and there are so many things I don't know.

166
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:03,340
Even though I was with Lieutenant Park until yesterday, they say he's dead now.

167
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:10,520
Can you at least tell me why he died?

168
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,570
Do you know of 'The Book of Prophecy?'

169
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:22,260
It's a record of the history of time traveling.

170
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:26,750
It also records the beginning and end of time travel.

171
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:29,300
I don't know how that

172
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:32,670
has anything to do with Lieutenant Park's death.

173
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:37,970
I just need to know who killed Lieutenant Park.

174
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:43,350
Lieutenant Park... was looking for the last page of 'The Book of Prophecy.'

175
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,840
With that page, he could figure out how to stop time travel

176
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:49,650
and find out who killed his mother.

177
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:54,840
However, he was killed because of that,

178
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:58,290
by the same culprit who killed his own mother.

179
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,960
Who's the culprit?

180
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:06,700
You said it's on the last page.

181
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:09,800
I also have not seen the last page.

182
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,470
It disappeared in 1992.

183
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:16,810
However, I do know

184
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:19,160
who had the last page.

185
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,050
Who is that?

186
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,370
You, Professor Yoon.

187
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,120
Me?

188
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:32,390
But I... have no memories–

189
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:33,930
I know...

190
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:36,190
that you've lost your memories prior to 1992.

191
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:41,220
That's why there is no way you can save Lieutenant Park.

192
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,740
Please don't even look for it.

193
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:48,740
As I've mentioned before, you could be endangering yourself.

194
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:56,600

195
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:27,000

196
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:03,290

197
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:44,140

198
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:53,450
 The child born into the opening doors of time will someday come to control time.

199
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:31,830
Was it you who captured me here?

200
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:34,360
How do you...

201
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:38,280
know about 'The Book of Prophecy?'

202
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:42,600
How do you know about that book?

203
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,380
Are you here to kill me?

204
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,940
Where's the last page of 'The Book of Prophecy?'

205
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,470

206
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:07,620
The cause of death are skull fractures and bleeding under the scalp. And they didn't find anything unusual.

207
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:10,450
We'll receive a more detailed report soon.

208
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:16,100
Please look into this person a bit more.

209
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:20,080
But if what you've said is correct, this person is a time traveler...

210
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:24,230
Anyway, I'll look into him for now.

211
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:36,460
Isn't that a tracking device?

212
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:38,280
What's the use of that?

213
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:42,920
I don't think the time travelers will leave this body here.

214
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,470
We need to find where they exist

215
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:49,060
to find Professor Yoon.

216
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,010
 Why are you suddenly being like this?

217
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,480
Just answer my questions. Why did you meet Lee Se Hoon?

218
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:04,730
Are you asking because you don't know? It was for "The Book of Prophecy."

219
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:07,160
I wanted to ask him where he hid it.

220
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:11,180
Then, did you also meet Tae Yi?

221
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:19,060
I met her coincidentally. On the way back from meeting Lee Se Hoon.

222
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:23,380
Did nothing happen to her?

223
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:30,150
That's what I heard and that's how it seemed.

224
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:35,740
She said she met and married a person from the past and that he was a good person.

225
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,910
I already told you.

226
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:40,460
Why are you asking me this again?

227
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,620
In what year did you meet Tae Yi?

228
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:45,150
2011.

229
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:50,290
Didn't you forget about her?

230
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:05,800
Team Leader, an illegal time traveler died from a fall

231
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,290
and we've found evidence of a wormhole opening near his body.

232
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:10,330
It seems that someone has traveled through time.

233
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:12,310
- When? 
 - Today, in the afternoon.

234
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:13,950
Why are you reporting that now?

235
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:15,550
Watch Team must've missed it.

236
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:18,940
"Missed it?" How could they miss it?

237
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:22,170
Who was on duty?

238
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:24,340
It was Team Leader Oh Shi Young.

239
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:28,060
 How could you let this happen?

240
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:30,990
I apologize. It was my mistake.

241
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:32,730
Have you located the autopsy room?

242
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:35,420
There shouldn't be any difficulty in bringing back the body.

243
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:39,640
Move as quickly as possible. He's not our client, but he is a time traveler.

244
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:42,380
We can't leave a body of a time traveler to the people of the past.

245
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,190
I understand.

246
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:47,090
I'll take care of it myself.

247
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,310
What happened?

248
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:04,750
He was here just a while ago.

249
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:06,420
Where did he go? My goodness.

250
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:16,160
Lieutenant Park, the body of the culprit disappeared.

251
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:19,990
Okay, I understand.

252
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,920

253
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:49,050
Look into Team Leader Oh's time-traveling records in 2011.

254
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:51,530
Yes, Sir.

255
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:00,240

256
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,270
Speed up.

257
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:23,990

258
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,500

259
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:28,510
Do we look that easy?

260
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:31,000
Did you think you could find us

261
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,590
with one lousy tracker?

262
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:36,140
Where is Professor Yoon?

263
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:38,660
Don't even think of finding that woman.

264
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:45,070
You... You've seen me before, haven't you?

265
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:57,320

266
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:06,460
How did you know my mother?

267
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:10,230
I'll give you one more chance for old time's sake.

268
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,540
Forget it all.

269
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:16,840
Then, I'll let you go. Don't look for Yoon Tae Yi, either.

270
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,760
She's not your mother.

271
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,750
She has nothing to do with you.

272
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:23,520
Whether she's my mother or not,

273
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:27,300
I'm going to protect her.

274
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:32,480
Even your personality is the same as your mother's.

275
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:38,370
Tell me. Where's Professor Yoon?

276
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:02,870
I did nothing wrong. It was all your mom's fault.

277
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:12,410

278
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,720

279
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:57,340
 The child born through the door of time

280
00:29:57,340 --> 00:30:01,960
 will control time one day.

281
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:38,010

282
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,680
Yes.

283
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:03,800
 Lieutenant Park, we've located Professor Yoon.

284
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:06,110

285
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:30,790
Professor Yoon!

286
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:54,870
♫  Even as time   ♫

287
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:59,910

288
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,510
Thank you.

289
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:08,850
I'm so grateful I got to see you again.

290
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:15,480
♫  From the beginning, I'll follow my chosen fate   ♫

291
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:21,230
♫  And tomorrow will be yesterday  ♫

292
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:23,350
It's all okay now.

293
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:27,590
It's all okay.

294
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:33,740
♫  One day and somewhere, I'll be with you   ♫

295
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:37,570

♫  One day and somewhere, I'll be with you   ♫

296
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:44,080
♫  Whenever, wherever, whatever   ♫

297
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,350
Lieutenant! Lieutenant!

298
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:52,060
♫  No matter how far we go   ♫

299
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:55,470
♫  We'll see each other again  ♫

300
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:57,490
Lieutenant Park!

301
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,680
What do you mean?

302
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,510
Park Jin Gyeom suddenly disappeared.

303
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:12,350
Disappeared? Do you mean he time traveled?

304
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:17,730
No. He just disappeared.

305
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:32,350
Today, the doctor told you not to move.

306
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:34,460
Are you okay, Professor Yoon?

307
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:36,770
You shouldn't be worrying about me now.

308
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:39,460
Why were you at the ossuary?

309
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:43,910
Did you travel through time?

310
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,690
What are you talking about?

311
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:49,440
Then, where have you been all along?

312
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:52,250
I don't know.

313
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:56,030
When I became conscious, I was already at the ossuary.

314
00:33:56,660 --> 00:34:00,880
I just had a weird dream.

315
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:03,980
It wasn't a dream.

316
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:11,040
What happened while you were traveling through time?

317
00:34:12,430 --> 00:34:15,280
Do you remember...

318
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:17,800
why I became a physicist?

319
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:24,410
So that I can build a time machine and see my mother again.

320
00:34:24,410 --> 00:34:25,960
But...

321
00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:31,980
now that I've come back from time traveling,

322
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:34,570
do you know what I'm thinking?

323
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:40,430
No matter where I go or who I meet,

324
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:43,630
nothing is more precious

325
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:49,400
than those who remember me, here and now.

326
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:53,240
The person I am now at this moment is the real me,

327
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:58,160
and the people by my side right now are really my people.

328
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:02,520
Although I was with my family there,

329
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:07,580
I missed the family I had here.

330
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:11,140
But in return, you can meet people you can't meet here.

331
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:14,510
What does that change?

332
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:17,850
Meeting someone you can't meet here

333
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:22,110
doesn't mean they can stay by your side.

334
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:28,700
Please don't get any strange ideas.

335
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:35,760
Don't think about things like time traveling to save your mom or getting revenge for her.

336
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,120
Please don't mind yourself with that.

337
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,960
It's something I must do.

338
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:43,840
How can I not mind it? Especially, when you're this hurt now.

339
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:49,330
Why do you keep getting hurt to make me worry?

340
00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:53,920
Why do you keep acting kind to me and making things difficult?

341
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:57,740
Why do you keep making me worry about you?

342
00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:00,000
By any chance...

343
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:03,530
Does something happen to me?

344
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:08,810
Did you see me?

345
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:12,750
No.

346
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:19,520
But I heard that you were doing well.

347
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:23,830
Go to sleep and rest. I need to sleep as well.

348
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:27,000
I'll be busy starting tomorrow.

349
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,850

350
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:56,610

351
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:13,140

352
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:21,350

353
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:32,370
 Whatever year you're in, I will protect you.

354
00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:34,880
 Just wait for me a little bit more.

355
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:03,190
 You know he passed away last year.

356
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:06,380
 Are you saying Lieutenant Park is dead?

357
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:11,520
 No, Lieutenant!

358
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:18,310
 The lieutenant went to look for the last page in "The Book of Prophecy."

359
00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:20,830
 If he found that, he could figure out how to stop time travel

360
00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:26,190
 and find out who killed his mother. However, it was because of this that

361
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:28,940
 he was killed.

362
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:42,440
They planted a device for dimension-travel here.

363
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:46,080
With this, he came here without going through the normal access facilities.

364
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,240
Anything else?

365
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:49,790
There isn't anything special other than this.

366
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:52,170
I understand.

367
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:03,480
I'm curious about something, so I'll ask you a question.

368
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:07,140
When a pregnant woman enters a wormhole,

369
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:09,780
can the baby be born?

370
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:13,930
Though they may face complications at birth, it is not impossible.

371
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:18,390
However, it'll be difficult to grow as an ordinary child afterward.

372
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:20,740
Modifications in the DNA could arise.

373
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:22,600
By modifications, what do you mean?

374
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:26,720
Physically or mentally, the child won't be normal.

375
00:39:28,310 --> 00:39:30,100
 Did you look into Park Jin Gyeom?

376
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:34,550
 He graduated from a police academy and is currently a detective at Seoul Nambu Police Station.

377
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:38,370
 What's interesting is that at age 6, he was diagnosed with alexithymia.

378
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:42,320
 Alexithymia? The inability to feel emotions?

379
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:46,170
Though there aren't many instances of such conditions, it's difficult for me to know the specifics.

380
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:50,660
Even if the baby is lucky and is born, it probably couldn't live for long.

381
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:33,750
 I am trying not to think of the worst,

382
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:37,610
but to be honest, judging from how we have yet to hear from him,

383
00:40:37,610 --> 00:40:39,020
I think our director must have...

384
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:43,240
No. The director is definitely alive.

385
00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:49,500
I'll keep looking for him, so please call me right away if you hear anything.

386
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:55,240
No matter what, I have to see him.

387
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:57,960

388
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:04,350

389
00:41:09,290 --> 00:41:12,480
I went to KUIPER to interview suspects

390
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,720
and they said Professor Yoon stopped by.

391
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:16,530
Professor did?

392
00:41:16,530 --> 00:41:17,870
Yes.

393
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:20,900
She said she'd find Director Seok.

394
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:24,530
We ultimately lost the suspect's corpse.

395
00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:27,760
We haven't been able to find any evidence about the time travelers.

396
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:31,770
We found one.

397
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:35,650

398
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:48,920
She knew my mother well.

399
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,370
Professor Yoon Tae Yi, too.

400
00:41:51,370 --> 00:41:52,960
How?

401
00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:55,340
I have a favor to ask.

402
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:58,980
The wife of Professor Jang Dong Sik who was murdered in 1992,

403
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:00,430
can you find her?

404
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:03,040
The records show she died during childbirth.

405
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:07,290
No, I believe she left her daughter at an orphanage, then disappeared.

406
00:42:07,290 --> 00:42:11,410
Was Dr. Jang's daughter in an orphanage? Didn't her relative take her?

407
00:42:11,410 --> 00:42:12,790
No.

408
00:42:12,790 --> 00:42:18,770
I must know why the time travelers were targeting Dr. Jang's family.

409
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:33,400
What are you doing?

410
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:39,730
Yes, Metro stopped by regarding the disappearance of the suspect's body and they said some weird things.

411
00:42:39,730 --> 00:42:42,810
There was a list of all the fingerprints collected by the forensics in the lecture hall.

412
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:46,870
It included information about the identity of the suspect, but that's the only thing missing.

413
00:42:46,870 --> 00:42:49,020
Have you seen it?

414
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:50,130
No.

415
00:42:50,130 --> 00:42:53,830
Ah right. Weren't you the last person to see the list?

416
00:42:53,830 --> 00:42:56,280
What? Was I?

417
00:42:56,280 --> 00:43:00,100
Oh, we all went to go eat together. Only Captain stayed behind.

418
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:03,400
- Oh, right. 
 - We got Chinese.

419
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,770
How can just that picture disappear?

420
00:43:18,990 --> 00:43:22,890
I heard you got hurt again. Where did you get hurt?

421
00:43:22,890 --> 00:43:24,310
It's nothing.

422
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:26,500
- Let me see. 
 - It's really nothing.

423
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:30,770
What is so important to guard a corpse that you got shot doing it?

424
00:43:30,770 --> 00:43:33,670
I really can't face your mother when you're acting up like this.

425
00:43:33,670 --> 00:43:35,490
I'm sorry for worrying you.

426
00:43:35,490 --> 00:43:40,280
Since tomorrow is your mom's memorial, you must come by 8:00 p.m.

427
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:43,940
Captain.

428
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:45,480
What?

429
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:48,660
Never mind.

430
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:55,840

431
00:44:01,630 --> 00:44:07,170
 It isn't just the body that disappeared, so did the woman that fell with him. I saw it.

432
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:12,230
Can you tell me about what you saw?

433
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:16,680
 At first, I thought two lovers were just quarreling.

434
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:18,150
 But...

435
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:21,810
 I kept watching because it seemed strange.

436
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:25,590
 Suddenly, the two of them fell off.

437
00:44:25,590 --> 00:44:26,710
And?

438
00:44:26,710 --> 00:44:28,450
The woman disappeared.

439
00:44:28,450 --> 00:44:31,030
 Only the man fell and died.

440
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,000
Lieutenant!

441
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:48,900
What are you doing?

442
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:52,600
I'm washing my hair.

443
00:44:56,600 --> 00:45:00,600
How can you wash your hair on your own in that condition?

444
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:03,400
Ah, it's okay.  I will do it myself.

445
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:27,800
I shampooed it already.  You just need to rinse.

446
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,800
You probably didn't do it right with just one hand.

447
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:31,800
I'll do it again.

448
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:35,600
Does it feel nice?

449
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:40,500
Why are you looking for Director Seok?

450
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:44,200
I'm just worried about him.

451
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:52,400
Please don't look at me.

452
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:55,200
I must look ugly from that angle.

453
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:59,100
It's no different than usual.

454
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
My goodness.

455
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,400
 Are you two having fun?

456
00:46:08,950 --> 00:46:12,280
Why don't you get naked and take a bath together as well?

457
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:27,000
Should I call a taxi for you?

458
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,400
Why would you call a taxi all of a sudden?

459
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:29,900
You haven't heard?

460
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:33,600
The suspect is dead. You're safe now.

461
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:35,200
Please go home now.

462
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:39,200
But we don't even know who he is yet.

463
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,600
I'm still in danger.

464
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:43,000
Stop being doggone ridiculous and please go.

465
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,400
"Doggone ridiculous?" Did you just swear at me?

466
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:49,000
What do you mean swear?  You really are ignorant.

467
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,200
"Dog" in the words "dog apricot" and "dog dream" are not animals.

468
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:55,200
It is used as a prefix to mean "in vain" or "useless."

469
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:56,400
You are a professor and you don't even know that?

470
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:59,800
Miss Reporter, your personality really is doggone strange!

471
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:04,400
I didn't swear, either.

472
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:07,300
Please go when I am talking nicely. This is trespassing, you know.

473
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:10,900
If you don't want to be with me, you leave. This is not even your house.

474
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:13,700
If you don't leave, I won't either.

475
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:19,000
- Do Yeon. 
 - What?

476
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,300
Do you smell something burning?

477
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:24,200
It's my hair.

478
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:26,200
I'm sorry.

479
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:33,400
I'm a bit tired so I'm going to bed now.

480
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:35,000
I'll sleep on the sofa.

481
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
No, not in that condition. Sleep in the room.

482
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,600
That's right. Take the room.

483
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:41,600
Miss Reporter can sleep in the living room.

484
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,800
Is this really necessary?

485
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:51,600
If it's uncomfortable for you, then you can leave.

486
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:53,800
I don't find it uncomfortable at all.

487
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:56,200
Sure. Neither do I.

488
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:02,400
Can I ask you something?

489
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:04,400
Where were you yesterday?

490
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:06,000
Why are you asking that all of a sudden?

491
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,600
I know you were missing. What happened?

492
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:13,400
You won't believe whatever I say anyway.

493
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:17,800
I'll believe it. Tell me.

494
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:22,200
If I told you that you and I

495
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:26,000
go on a pilgrimage to Spain together a year from now,

496
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,100
would you believe it?

497
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:29,800
Can you even believe that?

498
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:30,900
No.

499
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:33,200
Are you kidding me?

500
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:41,200
Can I ask you something, too?

501
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:45,100
Do whatever you want. I won't answer anyway.

502
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:49,200
When did you start having feelings for Lieutenant Park?

503
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,200
Why are you asking that?

504
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:54,000
I'm just curious.

505
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:58,700
I am also curious why you started liking the lieutenant.

506
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:08,000

507
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:35,200
Hey, Park Jin Gyeom!

508
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:38,600
I know you're in there. Open the door.

509
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:42,100
I'm throwing a rock through your window. You've been warned.

510
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,400
I told you to come today.

511
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:11,000
How could you not show up at our play?

512
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,800
I told you I'm quitting the drama club.

513
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:16,000
Even if you quit, you should come to watch the performance.

514
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,200
I am a senior in high school.

515
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:20,000
What do you think I am then?  A senior in middle school?

516
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
You must come tomorrow.

517
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,200
You don't need to be thankful. My mom insisted I bring it.

518
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:31,000
Let's call it even. This for the broken window.

519
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,800
Take it back. I only eat my mom's kimchi.

520
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:36,200
But your mother passed away.

521
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:39,200
Did she leave enough kimchi for the rest of your life?

522
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:42,000
If that's not the case, then eat it.

523
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,600
I'm going now.

524
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:53,800
Why aren't you leaving?

525
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:56,400
Do you know what time it is?

526
00:50:57,990 --> 00:51:00,090
It's 10:00 p.m.

527
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:03,000
Shouldn't you at least escort me to the main road?

528
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,800
Did someone escort you when you were coming here?

529
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,600
It was 9:50 p.m. when I was coming here,

530
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:08,800
but it's 10:00 p.m. now.

531
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:11,500
Is 9:50 p.m. the same as 10:00 p.m.?

532
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:16,400
It may only be a 10-minute difference but it's enough to make a girl terrified.

533
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:23,600
Where are you going?

534
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:27,700
You said there is a huge difference between 9:50 p.m. and 10:00 p.m.

535
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:35,400
Wait for me, Park Jin Gyeom!

536
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:43,700
Do you know what the fastest thing in the world is?

537
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:47,300
The moment you fall in love.

538
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:52,200
I don't know when I started having feelings for him either.

539
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:57,200
It's just... at some point, I realized that I was starting to like him.

540
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:00,200
It is the light.

541
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,600
The fastest thing in the world is the light.

542
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:06,400
Why is a reporter so ignorant?

543
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:10,800
So annoying!

544
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,200
Hey, don't hog the blanket.

545
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:14,400
Ah, it's so cold!

546
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,400
 Hey, look here!

547
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:20,400
I'm thirsty.

548
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,200
Are you thirsty?

549
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,400
It's refreshing, right?

550
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,300
Oh, my goodness!

551
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:30,100
You. Why are you coming out of this house?

552
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:31,800
You said you had to work last night?

553
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:34,800
What are you talking about? I was just going inside.

554
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:38,200
Let's talk about this at home.

555
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:41,200
Dad! Dad! Dad! I really didn't sleep here last night.

556
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:43,600
I really did spend the night at work and I just came.

557
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:47,700
Then why is your hair wet?

558
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:49,800
It looks like you just applied your makeup, too.

559
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:54,600
- This... I can explain this. If you give me a chance to explain— 
 - You brat!

560
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:56,400
Go home and explain.

561
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:59,940
Wait!  Wait!  Mom and Dad!

562
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:04,800
You are here.

563
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,200
I delivered everything.

564
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:08,000
Good job.

565
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,200
You worked hard.

566
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:11,600
If you ever need an escort, please let us know.

567
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:15,300
Why do you always eat Chinese food? It's greasy.

568
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:19,000
Why do you keep hindering our business?

569
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:23,200
Recently, I saw some negative comments on the app for our delivery service.

570
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,100
It's you, right?

571
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:27,800
What are you talking about? Why would I?

572
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:30,100
Hey! Hey! We are behind for deliveries. Hurry up and go.

573
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:31,200
Go and make the delivery.

574
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,400
Ah, again? Where?

575
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:37,760
Ah, seriously!

576
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:57,400
Unnie, you're the one who ordered.

577
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,800
Mom and Dad can't know I'm staying here so keep it a secret.

578
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:01,400
Why?

579
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:10,800
What's going on now? Are you guys together? Since when?

580
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:12,000
It's not like that.

581
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,800
What do you mean it's not like that? You're even living together.

582
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:17,200
We're living together, but we're not together.

583
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:19,700
Then, you are just having some fun?

584
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:21,800
I said it's not like that.

585
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:24,000
Mom and Dad won't understand, so don't say anything to them.

586
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,500
Hey! I am the one misunderstanding right now.

587
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:28,400
Why are you two living together?

588
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:29,800
We're not living together alone.

589
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:32,900
We are living with some rude woman.

590
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:37,800
Unnie, were you such a liberal woman?

591
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:41,200
What are you saying? Leave quickly.

592
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:43,400
Fine.

593
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:47,000
Today you're coming over later, right? It's your birthday.

594
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,800
I was already planning on going later.

595
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:51,000
Okay, then.

596
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:56,600
I'm going now.

597
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:09,800
Was it your birthday today?

598
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:13,000
According to your ID, I thought it was in the summer.

599
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:16,600
That was randomly decided by the orphanage.

600
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:18,600
My real birthday is today.

601
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:22,800
You said that you have no memory of when you went to the orphanage.

602
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:26,400
But still, I remembered two things.

603
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,900
My name and birthday.

604
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:45,190
Thank you for dropping me off.

605
00:55:45,190 --> 00:55:47,870
I don't think I'll be home tonight.

606
00:55:47,870 --> 00:55:52,020
Okay. I wish you a happy birthday.

607
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:55,050
Just words? What about my present?

608
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:00,190
It's okay.  I didn't expect any.

609
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:01,760
Are you heading home right away?

610
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:04,640
No. I also have somewhere to go.

611
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:06,620
Drive safely.

612
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:19,790

613
00:56:49,370 --> 00:56:51,140

614
00:56:51,140 --> 00:56:53,770

615
00:57:05,450 --> 00:57:07,950

616
00:57:19,690 --> 00:57:24,150
 I now have another heart.

617
00:57:24,150 --> 00:57:28,000
 It's smaller and weaker than mine, but I can feel it beating.

618
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,730
 My baby's heart.

619
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:37,880
 So, how could I get rid of it? It's my baby.

620
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:41,960
 A child who is alive and breathing inside me...  my baby.

621
00:57:57,730 --> 00:57:59,770
I'm sorry.

622
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:05,730
I'm sorry, Tae Yi.

623
00:58:30,670 --> 00:58:32,330
What is this?

624
00:58:32,330 --> 00:58:35,230
It's something that Jin Gyeom's mother used to enjoy.

625
00:58:35,230 --> 00:58:38,480
Today, it's her birthday and death anniversary.

626
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:44,500
Is that why you bought these on purpose?  She would be pleased looking down from the above.

627
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:49,110
Our Do Yeon would do really well when she gets married.

628
00:58:49,110 --> 00:58:50,060
Right?

629
00:58:50,060 --> 00:58:52,730
No, Ma'am.

630
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:57,910
Let's bow and eat.

631
00:59:18,660 --> 00:59:23,820
I don't think I can sleep at your house for a while.  It's a shame, isn't it?

632
00:59:26,620 --> 00:59:29,060
- Yeah. It's a shame.
 - Yeah, right.

633
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:31,820
Is that woman still there?

634
00:59:31,820 --> 00:59:35,880
No. Professor won't be home tonight, either.

635
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,020
Congrats!

636
00:59:42,020 --> 00:59:44,930
Happy birthday!

637
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:51,340
Since it's her birthday today, let's eat out tonight. Mom, you can pay.

638
00:59:51,340 --> 00:59:53,560
I don't even have money for that.

639
00:59:53,560 --> 00:59:57,490
No. I will buy. Also, here.

640
01:00:04,810 --> 01:00:05,630
What are these?

641
01:00:05,630 --> 01:00:09,900
I bought them on the way.  They are just something small so don't expect much.

642
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:12,260
It's your birthday. Why did you get us presents?

643
01:00:12,260 --> 01:00:16,400
Sis, are you crazy?  You sure became insane in a nice way.

644
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:18,350
I went traveling...

645
01:00:18,870 --> 01:00:21,050
I realized the importance of family.

646
01:00:21,050 --> 01:00:24,320
Traveling? When? Where did you go?

647
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:29,030
There is a place... near yet far.

648
01:00:31,710 --> 01:00:33,380
Open them up.

649
01:00:38,890 --> 01:00:47,980

650
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:58,070
It's your birthday. Why are you back already?

651
01:00:58,070 --> 01:01:01,530
Then, why did you get a cake?

652
01:01:03,010 --> 01:01:06,540
What are you doing? Wish me a happy birthday.

653
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:14,980
Aren't you going to sing for me?

What a surprise? I didn't think you would ever do anything like this.

664
01:02:42,220 --> 01:02:44,510
I really wanted to sing it for you.

665
01:03:01,060 --> 01:03:03,330
Lieutenant,

666
01:03:03,330 --> 01:03:05,670
did you just smile?

667
01:03:05,670 --> 01:03:06,690
Did I?

668
01:03:06,690 --> 01:03:09,600
Yes, you smiled just now.

669
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:12,250
You know how to smile?

670
01:03:13,090 --> 01:03:16,940
Smile often, please. You have a beautiful smile.

671
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:19,150
Okay.

672
01:03:20,050 --> 01:03:24,450
Should we... have some pork belly with soju?

673
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:29,050
Why? You don't want to?

674
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:32,570
I will go buy them.

675
01:03:32,570 --> 01:03:35,020
No, let's go together.

676
01:03:39,890 --> 01:03:43,550
But you really don't have a present for me?

677
01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:50,780
I just said it in jest.  You bought the cake.  That's enough.

678
01:03:53,750 --> 01:03:58,370
But this isn't right.  You knew today was my birthday.  How do you come empty-handed?

679
01:03:58,370 --> 01:04:03,600
It's a matter of sincerity.  For your birthday, I am going to buy nothing but a cake, too.

680
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:14,940
Is that my present?

681
01:04:14,940 --> 01:04:16,260
Yes.

682
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:22,260
I didn't expect it but you even prepared a present?

683
01:04:22,260 --> 01:04:26,160
Cake would have been enough. Thank you.

684
01:04:40,250 --> 01:04:41,920

685
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:46,010

 I didn't know your mother died or that she had a son.

720
01:06:16,570 --> 01:06:19,760
 You are one of them. The suspects who killed my mother.

721
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:21,670
 I think it was the captain.

722
01:06:21,670 --> 01:06:25,210
 It's all thanks to you, so please stay by my side as you're now.

723
01:06:25,210 --> 01:06:26,750
 Lieutenant, you're going to die!

724
01:06:26,750 --> 01:06:28,480
 What did you see during your time travel?

725
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:30,890
 You are curious about why your mom died, right?

726
01:06:30,890 --> 01:06:32,610
 I've arrived, Teacher.

727
01:06:32,610 --> 01:06:35,870
 It's you. You were the killer.
