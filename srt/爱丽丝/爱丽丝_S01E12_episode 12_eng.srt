1
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:34,060
 I can't go back to tomorrow.

2
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:39,180
 That's because I'm a different person from then.
 - Alice in Wonderland -

3
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,220

4
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,950
Stay quiet if you want to save Jin Gyeom.

5
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,810
Yes, I've arrived.

6
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:58,500
Why haven't you arrived yet?

7
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:03,230
 Did you think you could protect Park Jin Gyeom this way?

8
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:09,560
 Now, this is out of my hands.

9
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:20,530
Teacher.

10
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,990
Because of today's decision, Mr. Go Hyeong Seok,

11
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:39,330
you will lose both, your wife and Park Jin Gyeom.

12
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:54,040

13
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,240
Team Leader!

14
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:04,290
What do you mean it's the chief?

15
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:09,000
Chief Seok Oh Won is not the same person you know.

16
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,160
He's a time traveler.

17
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:17,260
From now on, listen carefully to what I say.

18
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:22,210
The current Seok Oh Won wants time travel to continue.

19
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:26,480
He's been getting rid of those trying to stop time travel.

20
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,320
He's looking for the last page of "The Book of Prophecy"

21
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:33,830
to get rid of the page that details how to stop time travel.

22
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:36,140
Then, why are they trying to kill Lieutenant Park?

23
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:39,360
Because Jin Gyeom is the only one who can close the door of time.

24
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,300
We have to find the last page of "The Book of Prophecy" first.

25
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:46,670
That way Jin Gyeom can be able to close the door of time.

26
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:50,260
Only through that way, everything will be finished.

27
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:56,040
- I, too, want to find it. But how do I... 
 - You'll be able to find it. That's your fate as written in "The Book of Prophecy."

28
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,970
Survive,

29
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:02,640
and do what you can do.

30
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,260
I'll do what I can.

31
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:14,530
Team Leader! Team Leader!

32
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:48,190
Why are you...

33
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:59,750
I didn't know Mr. Go Hyeong Seok had so much affection for you.

34
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,700
It was you...

35
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:06,740
From where?

36
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,750
Since when have you tricked us?

37
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,070
Your mother asked me the same question.

38
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,250
You killed my mother...

39
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,590
because of time traveling.

40
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,740
Professor Yoon Tae Yi,

41
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,990
how was it getting to know her?

42
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:37,990
This world is not the only one that exists.

43
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:42,440
In a parallel universe, there are countless other dimensions,

44
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:45,970
and in each of those places, another version of us exists.

45
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:50,540
When the influence of time travel expands, a world in which death holds no meaning will be crafted.

46
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,810
A world in which you could even meet

47
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,290
your late mother.

48
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:59,150
Like you say...

49
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:04,910
Even though there may be so many versions of my mother in other dimensions,

50
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:09,350
my mom is just one person.

51
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:14,040
And the fact that you killed my mother...

52
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,510
will never change.

53
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:19,950
That's unfortunate.

54
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,950
Even though others may not understand me,

55
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:26,490
I thought you, Lieutenant, would understand me.

56
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:28,970
I don't care for whatever reason

57
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:33,050
you guys time-traveled to come here.

58
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,240
But the fact that because of time travel,

59
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,730
innocent people died here, is important.

60
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:42,420
There is one thing you don't know.

61
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:48,800
How do you think time travel became possible?

62
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,520
It was the efforts of one research scientist, so you shouldn't resent me for it.

63
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,630
The person you should blame is your mother.

64
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,020
That research scientist was your mother.

65
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:17,470
Detective, have you found the location of the fishery?

66
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:21,670
We're looking into it right now, but it's taking a while. Please wait just a little longer.

67
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:26,820
Find it quickly please. Quickly! Lieutenant Park is in danger right now!

68
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:50,940
 What brings you here Detective?

69
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,880
 Detective...

70
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,960
 Ms. Yoon Tae Yi.

71
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,470
 Who are you?

72
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,780
 How do you know my name?

73
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:04,800
 Teacher is after you.

74
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,230
 Please take care of yourself.

75
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:11,910
 I'm sorry I can't help you.

76
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,700
Stop speaking nonsense.

77
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:35,570
I, too, at first, couldn't understand.

78
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:39,230
Why would your mother betray us,

79
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:44,050
and try to destroy the ability to travel time that she crafted.

80
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,200
Maybe she knew this would happen,

81
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:53,020
and decided to pass away early on.

82
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:07,040
Are you not afraid of death?

83
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:10,040
I am afraid.

84
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:14,970
I'm afraid I'll die before arresting you.

85
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:19,030
I'm so afraid of that.

86
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:33,070
Jin Gyeom! Jin Gyeom!

87
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:38,490
Mister, don't come here! It's dangerous!

88
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:39,990
Jin Gyeom!

89
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:46,360
Mister!!

90
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,920
Mister!! Don't come here!

91
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,930
Mister!

92
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:01,050
Mister, you should hurry up and leave.

93
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:03,630
You should quickly get away from this place!!

94
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:12,060
Mister...

95
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:19,520
Mister!

96
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,900
Mister!

97
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,670
Let's hurry and go to the hospital.

98
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:46,780
Jin Gyeom..

99
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,120
Let me rest now.

100
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:59,240
It's tiring, having lived two lives...

101
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:05,070
Don't speak... Don't speak, Mister...

102
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,150
I'm sorry.

103
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,670
I couldn't keep my promise.

104
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,940
I...

105
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:20,010
should have caught him sooner.

106
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:27,830
You're a man.

107
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:32,770
Crying? Goodness.

108
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:38,320
You've got a long way to becoming a man.

109
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:42,360
I still have things left to teach you...

110
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,400
Mister.

111
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:47,980
I...

112
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:52,920
thought I would have a good life here.

113
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:59,660
But I kept getting reminded

114
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:04,060
of the person who lived a lonely life next to me,

115
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:10,080
and died before I did.

116
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:20,960
When I traveled time to come here,

117
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,210
my life had already come to an end.

118
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:28,130
So, Jin Gyeom,

119
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:33,030
don't cling to the past,

120
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:37,040
and what is precious is

121
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:40,370
now... now.

122
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:45,850
The one next to you.

123
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:55,050
Still,

124
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:58,360
I was happy

125
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,540
to have met you

126
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:05,020
and to have met my wife again.

127
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:08,860
I was happy, Jin Gyeom.

128
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:11,060
Understand.

129
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:14,230
Me too.

130
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:18,840
I was also

131
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:24,020
very happy,

132
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:30,360
Father.

133
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,740
Brother!

134
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:30,600
Brother.

135
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:33,420
Brother...

136
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:45,370

137
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:50,410
Seok Oh Won isn't at his home or his research lab.

138
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:53,800
I think he already fled.

139
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:07,270
What happened?

140
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:11,280
This isn't true, right? I'm the one who heard it wrong, right?

141
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:14,630
There's nothing wrong with Mister, right?

142
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,310
Why aren't you saying anything?

143
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:24,280
Say something!

144
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,800
I have to see him!

145
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,910
Let me see him once! I need to see for myself.

146
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:36,800
Let me see Mister!

147
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,850
Where are you going?

148
00:14:54,850 --> 00:15:00,280
There's something I have left to do. For Mister.

149
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,240
 Mister!

150
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:42,120
What do I do now?

151
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:47,250
How can I live on now?

152
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:57,890

153
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:06,730

154
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:13,890

155
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:33,920

156
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,400

157
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:53,740

158
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:20,570
 It doesn't matter wherever you are.

159
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:27,220
 Whether you escape to the future or another dimension,

160
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:29,900
I'll definitely find you.

161
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:35,790
I'll find you... and kill you with my own hands.

162
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:39,090
Just wait a little bit.

163
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:44,260
Please hold a nice funeral.

164
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:41,870
One tries to stop time,

165
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,510
and the other wishes to protect it.

166
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:48,930
Isn't it quite ironic?

167
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,550

168
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,060
Why are you here?

169
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,030
People are waiting for you.

170
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:42,380
What did you talk about with the Team Leader?

171
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:44,390
Lieutenant Park...

172
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,920
Did you figure out why Team Leader was here?

173
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,940
Or hear anything about Seok Oh Won?

174
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:58,860
I think people cope with hardships in different ways.

175
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,840
There are no right or wrong ways to cope,

176
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,070
but I don't think running away is the best way.

177
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:11,650
Please stay next to Team Leader.

178
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,980
That's what a son should do.

179
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:46,060
I'll be by your side.

180
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:55,200
♫  Forget everything and go on your way  ♫

181
00:20:56,130 --> 00:21:00,370
♫  Like a dream that leaves the night sky  ♫

182
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:08,770

♫  You remain in time  ♫

183
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:12,880
♫  Even if the memories that come from far away  ♫

184
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,120
♫  Are covered by the thick night  ♫

185
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:21,240
♫  You quietly linger near  ♫

186
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:24,490
Salute.

187
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:27,430
♫  Wherever you are  ♫

188
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:29,740
♫  Even with my eyes closed  ♫

189
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:35,180
♫  I will protect you by your side  ♫

190
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:38,430

♫  Please promise me  ♫

191
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:39,870
Rest.

192
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:43,590
♫  Even if we grow apart in time  ♫

193
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:45,120
♫  Remember me  ♫

194
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:50,000
♫  I will remember you  ♫

195
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,400
When time travel became possible...

196
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:00,200
I thought people would become much happier.

197
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:04,300
Humans make a lot of mistakes, suffer a lot,

198
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:07,000
and separate a lot.

199
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,400
If, through time travel,

200
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,400
people could undo their mistakes

201
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,900
and meet people they wanted to see,

202
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:23,040
I thought they could be happier.

203
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,700
Perhaps,

204
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
your mother

205
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,800
thought the same thing I did.

206
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,200
But because of time travel,

207
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:38,400
my mother was murdered.

208
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,600
So was Mister.

209
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:46,000
If I leave things like this, it'll keep happening over and over.

210
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,910
Don't come and see me for the time being.

211
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,000
Lieutenant...

212
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,900
If you're around me, you'll be in danger, too.

213
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:04,100
The Team Leader was trying to find the last page of "The Book of Prophecy."

214
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,400
But I don't believe in stuff like prophecies

215
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,400
because I'm a scientist.

216
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,800
Your mother was also a scientist,

217
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,400
so I'm sure she looked for another way.

218
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Do you still have the computer

219
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
your mother used?

220
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,200
There might be something that can help us in there.

221
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:33,000
I don't want you to worry about this case anymore.

222
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I still don't believe that time travel itself is a problem.

223
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,800
People who abuse it are the problem.

224
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:45,800
If it's catching people like them, please let me help.

225
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,000
After my mom passed away, I used it for several years.

226
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,800
But nothing unusual came out.

227
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,800
She's someone who created time travel.

228
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:14,200
It wouldn't be found that easily. I'll take a look.

229
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:40,200
As someone who fights against people who time travel, can you not even endure this?

230
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,600
Let's find him for sure...

231
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:57,400
but don't get hurt.

232
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,000
Okay.

233
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:14,200
This was activated 10 years ago, but there's nothing special and there are only a few numbers that were dialed.

234
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,700
Seok Oh Won's number wasn't one of them.

235
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,200
Have you looked into Seok Oh Won's recent activities?

236
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,200
Yes.

237
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,000
There's something strange. Seok Oh Won's car.

238
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,600
His car was moved even during the time that he was trapped in the warehouse,

239
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:32,800
even though it was never stolen or driven by the family.

240
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:44,710
Is there a record of the phone being used near the warehouse on the same date?

241
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:54,400
There is. At a mountain near by.

242
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,990
It looks like he's been dead for about five days.

243
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:32,200
I wonder if you'll be able to protect your son this time, too.

244
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:38,200
The real Seok Oh Won died while he was locked up in the abandoned warehouse.

245
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:41,200
At this rate, we won't be able to catch the guy who killed Team Leader.

246
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,800
Who's going to look for him when the suspect's body was found?

247
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:48,000
Let's be open about what we know and investigate at a larger scale.

248
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,700
They're not going to believe us even if we reveal everything.

249
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,700
Then, what do you suggest we do?

250
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:57,600
I heard Seok Oh Won came here to find the last page

251
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,300
of "The Book of Prophecy."

252
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,300
We have to find it first.

253
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,400

254
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,400
You don't look well.

255
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,700
What brings you here?

256
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:40,600
The CCTV for Lee Se Hoon's case has be restored.

257
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,800
Is that so?

258
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:46,090
That's good.

259
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:50,930
Did anything come up?

260
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,600
What's wrong?

261
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,800
We didn't find anything.

262
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,800
There wasn't anything especially suspicious either.

263
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,900
I'm here because you told me to report to you when we got the results.

264
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:07,020
That's a shame.

265
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:11,400
I was curious who was behind the case.

266
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,600
Yes.

267
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,900
I'm disappointed, too.

268
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,000
Are you sure they were after Park Jin Gyeom?

269
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,100
Yes.

270
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:26,800
We have to find them before Park Jin Gyeom does. I'm sure they're associated with us.

271
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:31,000
Also, look into where Go Hyeong Seok went before he came here.

272
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,400
Yes, Sir.

273
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,600
Who is the gift for?

274
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,900
Your boyfriend?

275
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:48,200
Just someone I appreciate.

276
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,300
Lieutenant!

277
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,600
 Your mother

278
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:52,200
 and I must really look alike.

279
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:55,400
 Enough that you'd think of her every time you saw me.

280
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,200
 Didn't Jin Gyeom tell you?

281
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,000
 That you look like his mother.

 Why do you ask something like that?

00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,400
 Do you have a son?

288
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:15,400
 Do you really not know who I am?

289

I didn't hide it on purpose.

I must be stupid.

298
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,200
I knew about time travelers

299
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
and I even traveled myself.

300
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,600

00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:11,130
I heard you were the last to see Go Hyeong Seok before he died.

319
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:14,720
Did you hear anything from him?

320
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,150
Why do you want to know?

321
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:19,690
Is this also for Lieutenant Park?

322
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:22,340
Someone is trying to kill Park Jin Gyeom.

323
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:25,430
Why do you worry about him so much?

324
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:30,720
You're excessively nice to me, too. Is that just your personality?

325
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:36,540
Or is it because you're confusing me for the lieutenant's mother?

326
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:41,780
Do you know what I fear most?

327
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:48,390
The fact that I'm no longer myself to some people.

328
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:55,270
They're looking at me, but they're seeing someone else who looks exactly like me.

329
00:32:56,280 --> 00:33:01,560
They're with me, but thinking about that person.

330
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:08,030
I also thought of a person that I knew when I first saw you.

331
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:12,370
However, every time I meet you I realize

332
00:33:12,370 --> 00:33:17,040
that you are not the person that I knew.

333
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:21,880
Because a person is built by the time they experienced.

334
00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:26,180
Either way, this was all caused because of us.

335
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:29,980
I'm sorry to have caused you chaos.

336
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:32,660
Who are you?

337
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:43,310
I am Yoo Min Hyeok from Alice.

338
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,980
 I am Yoo Min Hyeok from Alice.

339
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:56,210
 We will be taking "The Book of Prophecy."

340
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:06,940
 Where is it?

341
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:10,660
 Where is the rest? Tell me!

342
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:21,950
 Sorry. I'm sorry.

343
00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:23,930
 It's okay, now.

344
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,810
 What's your name?

345
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:36,710
Tae Yi!

346
00:34:56,370 --> 00:34:58,990
Are you okay?

347
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:02,430
I called Park Jin Gyeom, so he should be here soon.

348
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:06,850
I'll be taking my leave.

349
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:09,610
My father was murdered.

350
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:18,430
What was the reason?

351
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:21,320
I'm not sure what you're talking about right now.

352
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:26,360
You were there, too. When my father died.

353
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:33,250

354
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:36,640

355
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:51,050
This is a hospital.

356
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:04,060
Take good care of the professor.

357
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,300
What happened?

358
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:17,640
I've met your mother before.

359
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:34,310

360
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,570
I'll come back tomorrow.

361
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:10,190
Don't think about anything today and get some sleep.

362
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:17,840
Your mother saved me.

363
00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:26,440
I was able to live because your mother traveled through time.

364
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:36,000
But my father died because of the time travel she created.

365
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:41,060
I'm sorry.

366
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,490
No.

367
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:47,290
It's not your fault.

368
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:51,680
It's not our fault.

369
00:37:53,930 --> 00:38:01,020
I thought I would only meet people I wanted to through time travel.

370
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:08,930
The fact that I would meet people I shouldn't meet

371
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:12,360
never crossed my mind.

372
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:23,330
What kind of relationship do your mother and I share?

373
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:30,930
How about... you and me?

374
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:35,200
Professor.

375
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:42,910
It would have been better if I hadn't met you.

376
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:52,060
It would have been even better if I didn't know about the past.

377
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:30,050
I know that we shouldn't have met.

378
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:38,160
But I was very happy to have met you.

379
00:39:55,060 --> 00:40:02,360
Hyung, why did you send me and Tae Yi to Dr. Jang Dong Shik?

380
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:06,020
It was an order from headquarters. You know this.

381
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:12,060
Then, by any chance, was headquarters involved in Tae Yi's death?

382
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:19,140
Don't be ridiculous. Why would headquarters do something like that?

383
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:26,800
Professor Yoon Tae Yi was Dr. Jang Dong Shik's daughter.

384
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:35,920
The Tae Yi of '92 met another Tae Yi.

385
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:47,660
A case like Yoon Tae Yi was bound to happen from the moment we arrived here.

386
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:52,340
We have to endure some paradox.

387
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:55,430
It's not that simple.

388
00:40:55,430 --> 00:41:00,400
The life of the Yoon Tae Yi here has become chaotic because of the time travel that we created!

389
00:41:02,090 --> 00:41:06,470
We have to stop. I'm going to stop it.

390
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:26,100
 Yoon Tae Yi has started to regain her memory.

391
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:29,570
We can finally find the last page.

392
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:37,020
Let's talk for a minute.

393
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:39,070
It's important.

394
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:44,200
I have something to show you. Let's go to my office.

395
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:48,490
I have nothing to discuss with you.

396
00:41:48,490 --> 00:41:50,170
I'm trying to help you.

397
00:41:50,170 --> 00:41:53,710
I've already told you that I don't need your help.

398
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,540
Don't look at me like that.

399
00:41:57,540 --> 00:42:02,090
If you hadn't lied, Tae Yi wouldn't have died.

400
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:07,090
If I had known a little sooner, I wouldn't have let Tae Yi die like that.

401
00:42:07,090 --> 00:42:09,390
Is that why you're meeting her?

402
00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:11,110
For vicarious satisfaction?

403
00:42:11,110 --> 00:42:13,810
- What? 
 - The Yoon Tae Yi you loved is dead.

404
00:42:13,810 --> 00:42:17,230
I know. Tae Yi is dead.

405
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:23,410
She died because of you. I will never forgive you.

406
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:29,650
If I had known this would happen, I should've killed her myself.

407
00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:56,660

408
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:06,130
Reporter Kim.

409
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:08,950
You scared me!

410
00:43:08,950 --> 00:43:11,850
Are you here to see Lieutenant Park? What for?

411
00:43:11,850 --> 00:43:16,500
What are you doing here? He even changed the password.

412
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:19,160
You two are up to something, aren't you?

413
00:43:30,630 --> 00:43:32,080
What's all this?

414
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:35,510
This is an ongoing investigation, so I can't share this with you.

415
00:43:35,510 --> 00:43:37,740
Move.

416
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,410
I really can't show you...

417
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:41,830

418
00:43:41,830 --> 00:43:43,630

419
00:43:43,630 --> 00:43:48,620
Are these people... time travelers?

420
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:07,960
Why are you so surprised?

421
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:10,480
Let's talk for a bit.

422
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:13,390
Can't we do it later? I'm a bit busy right now.

423
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:15,760
It's something related to Min Hyeok.

424
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:18,510
Then I don't think I need to hear it.

425
00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:24,050
As Min Hyeok investigates this case, he'll find out about me.

426
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:28,530
Like you.

427
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:35,500
Before that happens, I'll have to take care of Min Hyeok myself.

428
00:44:37,150 --> 00:44:39,960
If only you help me, Min Hyeok won't know anything.

429
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:45,750
Are you... telling me to keep quiet?

430
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:51,890
I've always made decisions that benefit Alice the most.

431
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:59,200
And I'll continue doing so. So I'm giving you an opportunity.

432
00:45:00,430 --> 00:45:01,560
An opportunity?

433
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:05,160
An opportunity for you to win Min Hyeok over.

434
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:08,820
There's something I must get from Yoon Tae Yi.

435
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:15,120
Whatever happens to Yoon Tae Yi after that doesn't matter to me.

436
00:45:21,590 --> 00:45:28,350
Although you and I may have different destinations, we're traveling along the same path.

437
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:42,830
If that person is alive, Min Hyeok will continue to have lingering feelings.

438
00:45:45,690 --> 00:45:50,940

439
00:45:56,910 --> 00:45:58,740

440
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:03,150

441
00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:15,030
Hello. You're a physicist from Hanil University, correct?

442
00:46:15,030 --> 00:46:18,360
I'm Physicist Yoon Tae Yi from Korea University.

443
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:22,560
I was wondering if you had any information or know of people who knew

444
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:25,760
Dr. Jang Dong Sik, who was murdered 30 years ago.

445
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:30,460
No. This is something personal.

446
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:36,290
I'll wait for your call. Thank you.

447
00:46:47,510 --> 00:46:50,450

448
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:53,020

449
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:55,140

450
00:47:08,210 --> 00:47:11,430

451
00:47:27,350 --> 00:47:29,980
 The person you are trying to call...

452
00:47:36,140 --> 00:47:38,090
Hello.

453
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:54,450
I went to Hanil University, which is where Dr. Jang used to work.

454
00:47:54,450 --> 00:47:57,770
It was so long ago. There was barely any information.

455
00:47:57,770 --> 00:48:02,550
But... I think Professor Yoon Tae Yi is also looking for her father.

456
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:06,360
 What is precious...

457
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:08,980
  is now.

458
00:48:11,050 --> 00:48:13,650
 The people next to you.

459
00:48:20,090 --> 00:48:24,470
Lieutenant Park, what are you thinking about?

460
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:31,110
I'll go meet Professor Yoon.

461
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:35,620
That's all for today's lecture. Be sure to submit your reports by the end of this week via email.

462
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:38,080
If you need to consult me about your thesis, come to my office.

463
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:40,890
 Okay!  Thank you!

464
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:53,650
You called about Dr. Jang Dong Sik, correct?

465
00:48:53,650 --> 00:48:55,860
Yes, I did.

466
00:48:55,860 --> 00:49:00,430
My father was friends with Dr. Jang Dong Sik.

467
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:34,690
 The phone number you're trying to reach is not on...

468
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:42,400
To be honest, I didn't think you'd get back to me so quickly.

469
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:44,160
Sure.

470
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:53,760
Was your father also a Physics major?

471
00:50:11,710 --> 00:50:13,780
What are you doing?

472
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:17,690
Who are you?

473
00:50:17,690 --> 00:50:20,040
Why does that matter?

474
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:22,860
It's important who you are.

475
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:24,260
Do you know me?

476
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:28,440
Yoon Tae Yi... You were always the issue.

477
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:30,980
Then and now.

478
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:35,310
Professor!

479
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:44,260

480
00:51:45,130 --> 00:51:47,110
Professor!

481
00:51:58,460 --> 00:52:00,240
Professor.

482
00:52:41,890 --> 00:52:43,610
Lieutenant Park...

483
00:53:00,650 --> 00:53:06,900

484
00:53:25,290 --> 00:53:29,240
I heard you found the witness yourself.

485
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:31,130
You must've worked so hard.

486
00:53:31,130 --> 00:53:36,080
Why did that student commit suicide while on the roof with Jin Gyeom?

487
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:38,360
My goodness, Jin Gyeom was unfairly framed.

488
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:42,550
I think some mean students did some horrible things to that student.

489
00:53:42,550 --> 00:53:45,090
Was that it?

490
00:53:45,090 --> 00:53:47,920
My goodness, how unfortunate for her as well.

491
00:53:48,790 --> 00:53:50,820
I gave you an extra half-pound.

492
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:53,830
Since Jin Gyeom is a senior in high school, just think of it as an unlucky event.

493
00:53:53,830 --> 00:53:56,210
He'll get into a good university.

494
00:53:56,210 --> 00:53:58,230
Of course.

495
00:53:58,230 --> 00:54:00,850
My son is very smart.

496
00:54:00,850 --> 00:54:02,790
See you!

497
00:54:06,330 --> 00:54:11,170
How could a son like that be born from such a kind mother?

498
00:54:15,950 --> 00:54:19,950

499
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:23,760

500
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:30,710

501
00:54:32,350 --> 00:54:33,310
Move.

502
00:54:33,310 --> 00:54:36,260
Hey, let's hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

503
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:47,730

504
00:54:51,730 --> 00:54:53,420
Lieutenant–

505
00:55:02,210 --> 00:55:04,390
Mom, I'm home.

506
00:56:19,220 --> 00:56:24,250

507
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:37,760
Tae Yi.

508
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:57,260
Other than her loss of memory, there isn't much that should concern you.

509
00:56:57,260 --> 00:56:59,800
Can she really not remember a thing?

510
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:04,060
No. Judging from how she thinks you're her mother,

511
00:57:04,060 --> 00:57:05,960
that seems to be the case.

512
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:07,790
But please don't worry too much.

513
00:57:07,790 --> 00:57:12,370
Since the damage to her hippocampus is not too large, her memory should return.

514
00:57:12,370 --> 00:57:14,700
Mom!

515
00:57:38,170 --> 00:57:42,540
When did you get back home? You should've called when you got here.

516
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:44,000
I told you I came back.

517
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,160
When?

518
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:46,860
In the living room.

519
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,710
I need to study.

520
00:57:52,710 --> 00:57:54,040
Right, sorry.

521
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:57,460
I'll change and cut some fruit for you.

522
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:59,270

523
00:58:59,270 --> 00:59:02,260
♫  My love will bring us back  ♫

524
00:59:02,260 --> 00:59:06,310
♫  Ain't nobody holding me back  ♫

525
00:59:06,310 --> 00:59:08,430
♫  We'll be like Bonnie and Clyde  ♫

526
00:59:08,430 --> 00:59:10,120
♫  We ride or die  ♫

527
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:12,940
♫  We tight  ♫

528
00:59:12,940 --> 00:59:15,950
♫  My love will bring us back  ♫

529
00:59:15,950 --> 00:59:20,030
♫  Ain't nobody holding me back  ♫

530
00:59:20,030 --> 00:59:22,050
♫  We'll be like Bonnie and Clyde  ♫

531
00:59:22,050 --> 00:59:23,890
♫  We ride or die  ♫

532
00:59:23,890 --> 00:59:25,350

♫  Like Bonnie and Clyde  ♫

533
00:59:25,350 --> 00:59:27,780
 I've seen the last page of "The Book of Prophecy" before.

534
00:59:27,780 --> 00:59:29,720
 All time travelers disappear.

535
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:32,630
 There's a change. She was killed because of "The Book of Prophecy."

536
00:59:32,630 --> 00:59:34,340
 This isn't somewhere you should be.

537
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:37,610
 He became a lieutenant to catch the culprit who killed his mother.

538
00:59:37,610 --> 00:59:39,620
 Why would I kill my mom?

539
00:59:39,620 --> 00:59:41,020
 Please come to terms with it.

540
00:59:41,020 --> 00:59:43,200
 Who are you? We even have the same voice.

541
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:46,300
 It was really... you?
