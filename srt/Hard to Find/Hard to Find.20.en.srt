I've searched every palace.

Xi Jiu?

195
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:50,710
Give it back to me.

196
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:51,590
Miss.

197
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:54,590
I'm sorry for having touched your face.

198
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:55,870
I just wanted to help you

199
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:57,110
the flying paper.

200
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,480
I didn't mean to do that.

201
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:02,890
Fine.

202
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,200
I apologize to you too.

203
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:05,040
I'm sorry.

204
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:06,480
I misunderstood you.

205
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:07,570
Miss.

206
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,540
Since you knew it was a misunderstanding

207
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:10,570
and hit me,

208
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,480
please

209
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,250
explain to those people.

210
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,030
Explain what?

211
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:15,860
Exactly.

212
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,400
We saw it with our own eyes.

213
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:20,540
Xi Jiu?

214
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,160
Helian Xi?

215
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,090
Shi Ying.

216
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,470
Cousin-in-law?

217
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:26,870
When did you come back?

218
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:28,960
Cousin-in-law?

219
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:31,740
Helian Xi, you know each other?

220
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,970
She's Yuan's cousin, Shi Ying.

221
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:35,080
This is Xi Jiu.

222
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:36,640
He is Yuan's...

223
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:38,950
good friend.

224
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:41,840
[Zhizi Clinic]

225
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,200
Where is Feng Yuan?

226
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,040
She should be in the room.

227
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:51,920
I'll go get her.

228
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:52,770
Okay.

229
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,140
I'll wait for you here.

230
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:58,370
Cousin.

231
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,300
That was a misunderstanding.

232
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:01,690
I'm sorry.

233
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:03,600
I know.

234
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:07,180
Yuan.

235
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:08,830
Xi Jiu is coming.

236
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,070
Xi.

237
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,630
I have urgent business at the Palace.

238
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:23,470
Don't worry.

239
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:24,840
I'll be back in the dark.

240
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:29,760
Where's Feng Yuan?

241
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,270
She has gone to the Palace alone.

242
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:32,270
I have to find her.

243
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,130
Shi Ying.

244
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:34,030
Please arrange a room

245
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:35,120
for Xi Jiu.

246
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:36,030
Okay.

247
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:37,530
I'll go with you.

248
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:38,140
Your Highness.

249
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:38,960
With your identity, it's inappropriate

250
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,750
for you to go to the Yongzhao Palace.

251
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,870
It will affect the relation
between the two states.

252
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:44,130
Why did Cousin suddenly go to the Palace?

253
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:11,410
When you arrive in Linchuan,

254
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:12,880
don't forget your duty

255
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,590
as the Princess of Yongzhao.

256
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:21,970
Long time no see.

257
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,540
My dear sister.

258
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,880
Your husband is really tolerant.

259
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:18,360
He hasn't said a word until now.

260
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,080
I didn't expect

261
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:47,940
I would come back here again.

262
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,340
Auntie.

263
00:14:58,490 --> 00:14:59,290
Your Majesty.

264
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,290
Is there anything wrong in the Palace?

265
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:02,680
Father didn't show up.

266
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:04,590
But as you said,

267
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,650
someone in the Imperial Guards saw you return to the palace,

268
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:07,850
so they couldn't wait

269
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:10,250
and immediately informed the outside.

270
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:12,690
Bring him in.

271
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,160
Yun Mu.

272
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:43,130
I didn't expect

273
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:44,720
it was you.

274
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:46,930
Princess.

275
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:48,610
We meet again.

276
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:53,090
Where is Feng Yin?

277
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:54,860
Tell me where he is.

278
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:57,030
I can keep you your dead body complete.

279
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:58,530
Or I'll let you

280
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:00,560
suffer the pain of dismembering your body.

281
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,380
His Highness

282
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:04,220
had a message

283
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,140
for you alone.

284
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:08,060
What is it?

285
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,360
Just say it.

286
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:10,890
If you can't,

287
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:11,870
I'll cut off

288
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,960
your tongue now.

289
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:16,840
Your Majesty.

290
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,700
I have something

291
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,830
to settle with him alone.

292
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:32,120
Auntie, but you're alone.

293
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:33,030
I'm fine.

294
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:35,040
Don't worry.

295
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,060
Alright.

296
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:38,000
Elite soldiers are guarding the outside.

297
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,990
I promise

298
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,210
no fly can fly out.

299
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,770
Do you hear that, Yun Mu?

300
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,560
You can't leave today.

301
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:52,910
Tell me.

302
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:55,790
What did Feng Yin ask you to tell me?

303
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:58,070
Tell me.

304
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,540
I'll give you a good death.

305
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:07,060
His Highness asked me to tell you

306
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:09,450
he had obtained

307
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:11,130
the power of the Tree's Heart.

308
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,300
He will soon take the Tree's Heart

309
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,270
to find you

310
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,790
and kill Helian Xi again.

311
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,980
Back then,

312
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:22,910
I cut

313
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:25,700
Helian Xi into pieces.

314
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:29,600
It was so fun.

315
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,040
So fun!

316
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,210
So fun!

317
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:05,110
Princess.

318
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,150
Helian Xi

319
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:09,790
was much more painful than this.

320
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,580
Shut up!

321
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:19,580
Who are you?

322
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:20,500
Move!

323
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:26,420
So fun!

324
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,300
It's okay.

325
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,950
It's okay, Yuan.

326
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,340
It's okay.

327
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:55,570
Calm down.

328
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:56,630
Yuan.

329
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:00,320
He's dead.

330
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:03,190
He

331
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,680
tormented you.

332
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,920
I want him to pay it back.

333
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:10,630
Look at me.

334
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:11,770
Look at me.

335
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,420
Look at me.

336
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:15,240
It's okay, Yuan.

337
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:16,390
Look at me.

338
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:17,450
It's okay, Yuan.

339
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:18,460
It's okay.

340
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,250
Calm down.

341
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,780
It's okay.

342
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,030
Look at me.

343
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:26,450
I'm fine.

344
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:28,370
He's dead.

345
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:30,940
It's okay.

346
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:34,560
It's all over.

347
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:36,220
I'm sorry, Xi.

348
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,210
Auntie.

349
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:40,720
I can't control myself.

350
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,680
When I think about how you were back then,

351
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,560
I can't help myself.

352
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:46,670
I can't forget it.

353
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:50,080
I can't forget it.

354
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:52,820
It's okay.

355
00:19:58,750 --> 00:19:59,780
Let's go home.
