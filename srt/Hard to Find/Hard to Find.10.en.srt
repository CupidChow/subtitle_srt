00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:39,910
Yuan, my daughter, you are going to marry to Linchuan,

5
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:41,280
I'm sorry that I can only

6
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,510
see you off here.

7
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,410
Mother, don't worry about me.

8
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:46,390
I will

9
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:48,390
come back soon to visit you.

10
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:49,870
Yuan.

11
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:51,210
Your Majesty.

12
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:56,710
Mother, what happened to your hand?

13
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,160
I'm fine.

14
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:01,910
I just accidentally scratched my finger.

15
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:03,440
It's a long way to Linchuan.

16
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,340
Take care of yourself, Yuan.

17
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:07,730
Alright, sister,

18
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:09,170
it's getting late.

19
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,630
You should set off.

20
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:13,590
Brother, you promised me

21
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:14,910
that

22
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:16,740
our father would send me off today.

23
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:17,500
Where

24
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:19,690
is he?

25
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:21,950
Sister,

26
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:23,230
I forgot to tell you

27
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:25,270
that our father

28
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:27,190
had a sudden illness yesterday.

29
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,680
You are so filial.

30
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,830
So I think you can understand

31
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:31,510
that he is too weak to see you off today, right?

32
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:32,630
Feng Yin, you...

33
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:47,470
Your Highness,

34
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:48,940
our Young Mater

35
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:50,470
ordered me

36
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,520
to take the Princess to Linchuan.

37
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,690
He is considerate.

38
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,400
Sister,

39
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,110
after you reach Linchuan,

40
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:58,229
you shall not forget your responsibility

41
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:00,060
as the Princess of Yongzhao.

42
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:06,500
Granny Chun,

43
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,130
thank you.

44
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,509
Your Highness, please.

45
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:15,470
I

46
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:20,990
bid farewell to you, my mother.

47
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:35,110
Hua'e, take good care of the Princess.

48
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:36,380
Yes,

49
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:37,700
Your Highness.

50
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:20,329
It was the first time I had left Yongzhao

51
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:22,990
and the first time I had come to Linchuan.

52
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:25,610
I met him for the first time.

53
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:28,110
The legendary

54
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:29,870
and mysterious Linchuan

55
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,040
has the purity

56
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:35,470
and cleanness that I was fascinated by.

57
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:37,300
But I was

58
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,430
the drop of poison,

59
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:43,450
because I'm the Princess of Yongzhao

60
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:46,790
who was forced by my brother

61
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,250
to marry to Linchuan

62
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,030
for a mission that I must fulfil.

63
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,740
Your Highness,

64
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,840
according to Linchuan's wedding customs,

65
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,700
our Young Master will wait for you under the Twinned Tree.

66
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,520
I'll take you there later.

67
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:12,560
Thank you, Granny Chun.

68
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,890
The Princess of Yongzhao is beautiful.

69
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:10,190
Of course.

70
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:11,190
Otherwise, she wouldn't have

71
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:12,090
had the chance to marry the Young Master.

72
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:13,020
She's beautiful

73
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:15,290
and a perfect match for the Young Master.

74
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,040
The wedding ceremony of the Young Master and Young Madam of Linchuan

75
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,240

76
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,400
Please get closer to the Young Master, Your Highness.

77
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:09,150
Hair-binding rite.

78
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,850
Hair-binding rite.

79
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,510
Take a strand of the Young Master's hair

80
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:31,470
and a strand of the Young Madam's hair.

81
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:33,870
Tie the two strands of hair with a red thread

82
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:35,070
and then add some flowers

83
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:37,470
that signify pure love.

84
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:39,610
May Young Master and Young Madam

85
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,230
everlasting love

86
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,980
and happiness.

87
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,670
Twin the branches!

88
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,470
Twin the branches!

89
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:11,180
Mix the blood taken

90
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:14,450
from the Young Master's and the Young Madam's fingers.

91
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:16,180
Take two branches of the Twinned Tree

92
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,190
as mediums.

93
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:22,190
Make a promise to protect each other with your life.

94
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:24,850
May Young Master and Young Madam

95
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,760
love each other

96
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,590
and be together forever.

97
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:47,650
The wedding ceremony is over.

98
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:06,430
Well,

99
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,620
what is twinning the branches?

100
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,290
It is

101
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:22,410
the most important rite

102
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:23,830
in the wedding ceremony

103
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:25,180
of the King of Linchuan.

104
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:26,770
It is to take

105
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,600
the branches of the Twinned Tree

106
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,330
and let them absorb our blood to make us connected.

107
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:34,020
Why?

108
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:35,440
My ancestor regretted

109
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:37,580
that he failed to save his wife.

110
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:41,770
No matter how deep their love was,

111
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:44,310
they couldn't do anything about death.

112
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:46,490
If the branches make us connected by absorbing our blood,

113
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:48,550
we can have a chance to save our spouse

114
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,500
with our life.

115
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:53,960
I see.

116
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:56,030
People of the Linchuan tribe have not married foreigners

117
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:57,430
for over a hundred years.

118
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,500
Over 20 years ago,

119
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,560
there was a flood in Linchuan.

120
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:03,400
My father asked all the tribes in the eastern continent

121
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,560
for supplies.

122
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,640
It was your father who helped us.

123
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:09,400
My father and your father

124
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,310
then decided on our marriage.

125
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,550
I know you didn't

126
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:14,660
want to marry me.

127
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:16,150
But I hope

128
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,720
you can enjoy your life in Linchuan.

129
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:23,230
Twinning the branches is a matter of life and death.

130
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,890
I don't want to force it on you.

131
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:27,810
But this branch now belongs to you.

132
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:29,000
Just keep it.

133
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:33,970
You must be tired.

134
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,960
It's time to rest.

135
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:41,510
Rest?

136
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,600

What are you doing?

138
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,970

140
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:12,540
taught me how to have a wedding night.

141
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,350
I...

142
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:29,060
I'm sorry. I...

143
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,860
Your Highness,

144
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:43,730
we don't have to sleep together.

145
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:51,710
I'll sleep here.

146
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:01,110
Actually,

147
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:03,260
we've met before.

148
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:06,300
But you probably don't remember me.

149
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,330
I met you

150
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:13,450
when I visited Yongzhao for the first time.

151
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:16,990
Thank you, doctor.

152
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,800
Are you a foreigner?

153
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,700
Are you not feeling well?

154
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,350
I'm new here.

155
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,060
I'm not acclimatized.

156
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,970
Let me check your pulse first.

157
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,980
Are you here for medicine, too?

158
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,040

Excuse me.

195
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:28,070
Your Highness, you're in such a good mood.

196
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,500
Have you forgotten

197
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:31,730
what you are here for?

198
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:37,250
I have my own plan.

199
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,000
I don't need you to remind me.

200
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,620
Your plan is

201
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:48,130
to ask General Wu Jiu

202
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:49,500
for help, right?

203
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:51,290
[To General Wu Jiu]

204
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:53,700
Are you curious

205
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:55,910
why I got the letter

206
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:57,820
you sent to General Wu Jiu?

207
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,030
I have bad news for you.

208
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:04,060
This letter

209
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:05,750
didn't even be sent out of

210
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,230
the palace.

211
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,480
The hands of the maid who helped you send the letter

212
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,420
were chopped off.

213
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,810
How could you be so vicious?

214
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,710
Your Highness, don't be afraid.

215
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:22,030
I'm just here to remind you

216
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:23,430
that whether your mother

217
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:26,000
can enjoy her remaining years in the palace

218
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:28,200
depends on you.

219
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,130
Yuan.

220
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,250
Your Majesty.

221
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,900
You saw it when you came that

222
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:41,230
the entrance to Linchuan is hidden.

223
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:42,140
Foreigners

224
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:43,230
can only enter here

225
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:44,050
with the guidance of the Linchuan people.

226
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:45,730
Even if I can kill Helian Xi,

227
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:47,370
Feng Yin may not have the capacity

228
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:48,810
to take over Linchuan.

229
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:49,960
Where did the Young Master go

230
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,030
early in the morning?

231
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:52,550
Wu Qing, calm down.

232
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:55,570
The Young Master must have something important to do.

233
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,270
Look,

234
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,640
the young master is back.

235
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,520
Young Master,

236
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:00,590
why are there so many flowers?

237
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:01,380
Let me help you.

238
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:02,060
No need.

239
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:03,110
Yin Qiao,

240
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,150
is the food ready?

241
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:04,770
Yes.

242
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:05,930
Put it in the room.

243
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:07,569
I will have breakfast together with the Young Madam.

244
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:08,260
Yes.

245
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:11,710
His Highness will plan

246
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:13,400
to take over Linchuan.

247
00:17:14,609 --> 00:17:16,069
You will do us a favour

248
00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:18,089
if you can kill your husband,

249
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:21,140
the Young Master of Linchuan.

250
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:27,980
You're awake.

251
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,540
Your Highness, the Young Master is here.

252
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:33,830
I'll leave now.

253
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,680
Young Master.

254
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:47,630
These are for you.

255
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,100
For me?

256
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:53,990
You seem to like flowers.

257
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:55,910
So I prepared some.

258
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:02,080
Thank you.

259
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:04,620
Last night,

260
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,600
I saw that flower

261
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,120
lying on the table alone,

262
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:08,730
so I...

263
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:11,400
You look a little haggard.

264
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,120
I'm fine.

265
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:16,750
Maybe it's because I didn't sleep well

266
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:18,220
since I just came here.

267
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:23,940
Young Master, Young Madam,

268
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,340
it's time for breakfast.

269
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:34,260
I heard

270
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,620
people here like raw food.

271
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,010
Why is all this cooked?

272
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,380
I saw you didn't have a bite

273
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:42,260
at the wedding banquet yesterday,

274
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:44,210
I remember that the Yongzhao people love cooked food.

275
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:44,790
I don't know

276
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,150
what you like to eat,

277
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:48,380
so I prepared various dishes for you.

278
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:49,780
Thank you, Young Master.

279
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,080
Drink something.

280
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,060
What is this?

281
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,300
Blood wine?

282
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:14,910
Blood wine?

283
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:19,650
It's neither blood nor wine.

284
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:21,150
It's pomegranate juice.

285
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:22,390
Pomegranate juice?

286
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:24,660
What is pomegranate?

287
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,030
There are no pomegranates in Yongzhao.

288
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:30,270
Pomegranate is

289
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,500
a kind of fruit.

290
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:33,180
Try it.

291
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:42,480
How is it?

292
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,720
It's sweet.

293
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,710
Sweet?

294
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:49,850
I want to know

295
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,210
what sweet tastes like.

296
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,300
Don't you know

297
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:54,640
what sweet is?

298
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,950
I have no sense of taste since I was born.

299
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:01,310
But it's good that I don't have taste

300
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:04,320
because I won't be controlled by my appetite.

301
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:07,380
Young Master,

302
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,790
Granny Chun asked you to take the Young Madam

303
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:09,850
to the Divine Tree.

304
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,020
Okay.

305
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,440
We

306
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:13,520
will go after breakfast.

307
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,160
Okay.
