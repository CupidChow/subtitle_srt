Mom!

195
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:40,270
Shi Liu.

196
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:42,090
Uncle brought me

197
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:43,990
a toy!

198
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:55,380
Shi Liu.

199
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,370
I didn't buy it.

200
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:01,850
She bought it.

201
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:03,540
Thank you, sister.

202
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:08,520
You shouldn't call me "Sister." I am your...

203
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:27,250
I am

204
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:29,970
your mom's sister.

205
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:31,890
You can

206
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:34,250
call me "Auntie."

207
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:36,290
Thank you, Auntie.

208
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:48,900
Mom.

209
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:51,460
Mom.

210
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,500
I want to go to bed now.

211
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,840
Okay. Shi Liu, wait for me a bit longer,

212
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:56,850
okay?

213
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:58,250
Okay.

214
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,640
We've disturbed you for a long time.

215
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:07,330
We should go now.

216
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:10,050
Yuan, you are back now.

217
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,690
How can you go back?

218
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:13,480
We are a family.

219
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:14,990
This is your home.

220
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,720
It used to be, it is now,

221
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,530
and it will continue to be in the future.

222
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:19,860
Just stay at the clinic.

223
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:26,390
Let's stay at the clinic.

224
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,190
Before I got married in Linchuan,

225
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:50,030
I used to come here often to stay for a while

226
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:51,660
and often

227
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:53,620
sit here watching the moon.

228
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:55,870
At that time, I never imagined

229
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:58,410
that my future daughter

230
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,930
would also grow up here.

231
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:05,450
There are some things

232
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:06,530
about Shi Liu

233
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,680
that I want to ask you.

234
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:11,980
You want to ask me about her matters?

235
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,210
Did you know...

236
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:17,820
that you were pregnant

237
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,150
when you left Linchuan?

238
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,070
I only found out

239
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,990
I was

240
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,930
three months pregnant

241
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:34,370
when I came to the palace.

242
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:38,860
Everything happened so suddenly.

243
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:41,470
Feng Yin placed me under house arrest

244
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,770
and compelled me to reach out to you

245
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,450
in order to lure you to come to Yongzhao.

246
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:47,330
So,

247
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:50,210
you didn't want to put me at risk.

248
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:53,090
You knew it was the rainy season,

249
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:56,180
so the letter couldn't reach Linchuan,

250
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:56,990
right?

251
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:03,520
I planned to have Feng Qing,

252
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:06,510
the current king of Yongzhao,

253
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:08,730
contact Qin Sang for me,

254
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,160
and then I'd try to escape.

255
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,740
However,

256
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,920
things didn't turn out quite the way I planned.

257
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:18,560
You came suddenly.

258
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:21,690
On the day you entered the palace,

259
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:23,360
I had a premature birth.

260
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:25,750
So,

261
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,870
you came to save me...

262
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,560
right after giving birth to Shi Liu?

263
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,460
I...

264
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:44,090
I even misunderstood you...

265
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:47,130
I also don't know

266
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:49,080
why I survived

267
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:51,140
after using the Twinned Branch.

268
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,090
Fortunately,

269
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:54,410
the three of us

270
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,240
are fine now.

271
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:01,380
We're all fine.

272
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,070
What about you?

273
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:05,860
How did you know Shi Liu

274
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:07,100
was sent here?

275
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,220
Actually,

276
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,690
I didn't first meet you

277
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:13,950
in Linchuan

278
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:15,290
on our wedding day,

279
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:17,700
but at...

280
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:20,310
Yuan.

281
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:22,780
Xi.

282
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,720
I've cleaned up a room for you.

283
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:26,290
It's the same room

284
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:27,610
you used to live in.

285
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:28,700
Ying.

286
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:30,090
Thank you.

287
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:31,130
Yuan.

288
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,010
Why are you being so polite

289
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:33,170
to me again?

290
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:35,480
You haven't had dinner, have you?

291
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,940
I'll fix some food for you.

292
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:58,430
How about

293
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:00,530
I ask Ying

294
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,240
to find another room for you?

295
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:06,150
Are you still beating yourself up

296
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:07,750
and don't know how to face me?

297
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:14,110
Yuan.

298
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,710
Although

299
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:20,040
the problem is not solved yet,

300
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,700
we are husband and wife.

301
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:24,700
We were

302
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,020
and still are.

303
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:28,670
I love you.

304
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:32,860
I know you love me.

305
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:36,110
Since we're deeply in love with each other,

306
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:37,850
we should

307
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:39,340
be there for each other

308
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,370
instead of running away from each other,

309
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:43,210
okay?

310
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:47,870
Okay.

311
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:19,520
Miss,

312
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:20,900
do you have feelings...

313
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,410
I feel nothing about him.

314
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:10,560
I'm sorry.

315
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:13,099
Go to sleep.

316
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:15,040
I'll sleep on the couch.

317
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,410
Xi, I'm sorry.

318
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,690
I still have a lot on my mind.

319
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:22,050
I've been thinking about

320
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:23,770
those things over and over again.

321
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:25,170
Back to the clinic today,

322
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,550
brings back memories of Yin Qiao

323
00:17:27,569 --> 00:17:28,590
and Wu Qing.

324
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:29,540
I understand.

325
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:31,690
Don't worry.

326
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,600
The Nanzhi Manor in Linchuan

327
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,110
will be restored.

328
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,130
Sleep.

329
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:41,040
[Memorial]

330
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,100
Eunuch He.

331
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:52,490
I told you

332
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,140
not to bother me if there was nothing.

333
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:58,980
Your Majesty.

334
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:00,570
You shouldn't be here.

335
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:02,340
Before I sentence you

336
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:05,060
to the punishment of flogging, get out!

337
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:08,750
Your Majesty.

338
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:10,970
The Grand Lady-in-Waiting asked me

339
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:12,500
to bring the clothes to you.

340
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:15,810
If I disturb you,

341
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:17,090
I'll leave now.

342
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:25,670
Wait.

343
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,500
I spared your life

344
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:35,950
because my birth mother passed away

345
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:37,090
when I was young, and you took care of me

346
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:38,420
for a while.

347
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:40,450
But...

348
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:42,740
it doesn't mean I don't loathe you.

349
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:46,670
You've soiled my clothes.

350
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:49,130
Take them out and throw them away.

351
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:53,210
Yes.
