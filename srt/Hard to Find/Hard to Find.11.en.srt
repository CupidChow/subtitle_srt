00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:27,470
[Hard To Find]

3
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:30,480
[11]

4
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:35,500
Every Young Master and Young Madam must

5
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,260
make a contract with the Divine Tree

6
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:38,520
after their marriage.

7
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:46,790
This is the contract seal between

8
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:48,850
the Young Master and the Divine Tree.

9
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:54,660
Please reach out your right hand

10
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:56,940
to make a contract with the Divine Tree.

11
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:14,760
Granny Chun.

12
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:17,100
Maybe it's because Young Madam is a foreigner.

13
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,560
She just came to Linchuan,

14
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,960
and can't make a contract with the Divine Tree.

15
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,870
Let's call it a day.

16
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:23,990
Maybe.

17
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:25,400
In a few days,

18
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:27,250
I'll let her try again.

19
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:34,270
Young Master.

20
00:01:34,789 --> 00:01:36,100
What is the contract?

21
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:38,240
Every Young Master and Young Madam in Linchuan

22
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,750
have their responsibility to protect

23
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,539
the tribe people and the Divine Tree.

24
00:01:41,539 --> 00:01:43,000
Once the contract is made,

25
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:43,870
it means forming

26
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,630
a protective bond with the Divine Tree.

27
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:47,270
If you protect the Divine Tree once,

28
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:48,930
it will also protect you once.

29
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:53,190
It's truly

30
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:55,729
a miraculous tree.

31
00:01:56,229 --> 00:01:57,690
Legend has recorded that an ancient goddess

32
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:59,090
fell in love with a demon,

33
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:01,420
but they were not accepted by heaven and earth.

34
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:02,890
Together, they created this

35
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:04,290
magical land of Linchuan

36
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,410
and hid from the world.

37
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,940
Our tribe settled here by mistake

38
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:10,630
during that time.

39
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:13,320
And then?

40
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:14,720
They lived a few years of

41
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,450
ordinary human life together.

42
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:17,890
But in the end,

43
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,540
the Heavenly Emperor found out

44
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:20,670
and punished them.

45
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,240
So,

46
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:24,510
they transformed into two ancient trees

47
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:25,579
to protect the future generations

48
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:26,840
of the Linchuan tribe.

49
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,890
And Granny Chun is...

50
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:35,300
The Divine Tree will choose one person

51
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,420
among the generation

52
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,820
to be the Spirit of the Divine Tree.

53
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:38,660
Granny Chun

54
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,260
is the current Spirit of the Divine Tree.

55
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:49,120
You don't need to

56
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,380
worry about the contract.

57
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,200
It's possible not to make it.

58
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,690
I can see

59
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,150
that he really likes you.

60
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:59,870
He sent you flowers

61
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:02,070
and took care of your diet.

62
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:04,800
The people here are so simple.

63
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:06,440
If you sleep with him,

64
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:08,800
you'll have plenty of chances to kill him.

65
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:11,050
Now that he moved out,

66
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,850
how are you going to do it?

67
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,190
I'm tired today.

68
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,560
You may leave now.

69
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,250
I have my own plan.

70
00:03:19,579 --> 00:03:22,060
Princess. Why don't you tell me

71
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,880
about your plan?

72
00:03:39,579 --> 00:03:40,910
I could kill him.

73
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,340
But if I kill him,

74
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,420
I will be the prime suspect.

75
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:48,910
You are my maid.

76
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:50,250
Do you think

77
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,680
you can escape?

78
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:57,680
You made a point.

79
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,360
I have patience,

80
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,390
but His Highness doesn't.

81
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:04,090
If you don't

82
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,170
do anything within three days,

83
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:08,090
I will give you

84
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:09,930
a big gift.

85
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:21,430
By the way,

86
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:24,120
the wedding gift

87
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:26,010
I prepared for you

88
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,560
is on the petals.

89
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,460
It's a good thing in the palace,

90
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,530
Love Potion.

91
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:38,100
Tonight, it will make him

92
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,640
unable to resist you.

93
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,400
I have to clean it up quickly.

94
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,960
Why didn't you eat anything?

95
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:09,700
I...

96
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,340
I'm not hungry.

97
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:18,530
What's that smell?

98
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:21,910
You...

99
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:23,730
Why did you move to the side room?

100
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:26,360
You're a young girl,

101
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:28,340
and came to an unfamiliar place.

102
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:30,410
It's inconvenient for you

103
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:31,290
to stay with

104
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,550
a stranger.

105
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:34,520
I moved to the side room,

106
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,320
so you can be rest assured.

107
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,580
Rest early.

108
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:41,070
Wait.

109
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:43,780
What's wrong?

110
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,200
I heard that

111
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,070
there is a rule in the Linchuan tribe

112
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:52,360
that women cannot bathe

113
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,190
within three days after marriage.

114
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:55,390
That's true.

115
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,320
It's because after the wedding night...

116
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,800
It's okay.

117
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,610
I'll take you there.

118
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,110
Okay.

119
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:12,130
Don't worry.

120
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,580
I'll be here guarding for you.

121
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,080
Do I really

122
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:41,630
have to kill him?

123
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,940
He has been considerate and caring to me,

124
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,590
but I'm planning how to harm him.

125
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,600
No.

126
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:18,990
I can't give up like this.

127
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,560
Where is it?

128
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,780
It's been three days.

129
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:48,140
Have you figured out a perfect plan,

130
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,380
Princess?

131
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:54,210
You said it was a perfect plan.

132
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:55,440
It's not that easy.

133
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:59,140
You broke your promise.

134
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:01,280
But I've been taught to

135
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,230
keep my promise.

136
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,610
I've brought

137
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,410
your gift.

138
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,190
The Queen of Yongzhao's nail

139
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:30,950
used to be carefully

140
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:32,840
maintained in the palace.

141
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:34,720
I peeled it off

142
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,100
bit by bit

143
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:39,530
from the flesh.

144
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:40,770
It hurts.

145
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:41,830
Shut up!

146
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:48,790
Princess.

147
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:50,610
Were you looking for this?

148
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,680
Don't be afraid.

149
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,340
I just applied

150
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,930
some poison on it

151
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:02,360
so that you can

152
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:07,500
kill him with one stab.

153
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:14,210
Young Master.

154
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:15,920
Why is your hand injured?

155
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,080
I feel something is wrong with

156
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,390
Feng Yuan's maid.

157
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:26,770
Young Master.

158
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:27,890
Should I ask Granny Chun

159
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:28,920
to take a look?

160
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,360
It's just a minor injury.

161
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,420
Nothing serious.

162
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:37,830
How is Young Madam doing?

163
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,860
I always feel that she has something on her mind,

164
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,450
but she seems

165
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,500
unwilling to get close to others.

166
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,970
I have to think of a way.

167
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,510
Could it be that something

168
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,600
in the Yongzhao Palace is bothering her?

169
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,410
The Young Madam is far away from home.

170
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:57,390
She may not be accustomed

171
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:58,370
to the life here yet.

172
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:00,170
She will get used to it in a while.

173
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,670
Perhaps.

174
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,420
Have you got the things I asked

175
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,370
prepared?

176
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:08,480
Don't worry, Young Master.

177
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,680
I've got it prepared.

178
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:20,660
Hua'e brought

179
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:22,060
mother's nail today.

180
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:24,900
Who knows what it will be tomorrow.

181
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:28,580
But Helian Xi...

182
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,750
What should I do?

183
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,390
Feng Yuan.

184
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:57,580
Young Master.

185
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,250
What brings you here?

186
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:01,600
Nothing in particular.

187
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:03,890
I just noticed that you've been

188
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:05,420
staying in the room all day.

189
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,110
I'm afraid you find Nanzhi Manor boring.

190
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:08,640
So I brought you something.

191
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:13,070
Here are some art supplies.

192
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:14,790
If you don't want to go out,

193
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:16,150
you can paint at home.

194
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:17,890
How did you know

195
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,870
I can paint?

196
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:19,670
I...

197
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,400
I heard about it.

198
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:27,460
Wu Qing.

199
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:29,580
There seems to be no paper here.

200
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:31,890
Go check if you missed it.

201
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:33,260
Yes.

202
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:37,720
Feng Yuan.

203
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:40,110
I'm your husband,

204
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,980
and your dependence in Linchuan.

205
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,830
If you are not used to the life here,

206
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:48,080
you can tell me.

207
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,290
Rest early.

208
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,400
What's wrong?

209
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,240
Can you...

210
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,990
Can you stay here tonight?

211
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,900
I've been accompanied

212
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:46,840
by a maid when sleeping since I was young.

213
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,500
I feel scared sleeping

214
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,840
alone in a room.

215
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,520
Okay.

216
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:52,920
Go to sleep.

217
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,140
But if I don't do it,

218
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:21,280
what will happen to my parents?

219
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,580
They are imprisoned by Feng Yin,

220
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,620
living a miserable life.

221
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,360
No.

222
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:28,480
This is a matter of life and death.

223
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,410
He has no grudge against Yongzhao.

224
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,560
It's Feng Yin and Hua'e who

225
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,360
threatened and intimidated me.

226
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:35,920
How could I harm him?

227
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,820
Morning, Young Madam.

228
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,160
Morning.

229
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:11,280
I'll get the breakfast prepared

230
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,120
for you.

231
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:12,910
Okay.

232
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:13,220
Young Master, you must see

233
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,150
the dagger that Young Madam

234
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:15,470
hid last night.

235
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:17,430
Feng Yuan.

236
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,980
She's just

237
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:25,200
carrying a dagger for self-defense.

238
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:25,760
Young Master.

239
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,190
Young Madam acts so sneaky.

240
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:27,960
Did she do anything

241
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,560
with that dagger last night?

242
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,110
Nothing happened.

243
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,630
I'm fine.

244
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,480
What can she do?

245
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,400
I can't

246
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,400
do anything to harm Helian Xi again.

247
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,500
I need to find a way to deal with Hua'e.

248
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,200
Young Madam, it's time for lunch.

249
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:17,119
Okay, thank you.

250
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,180
Young Madam, are you going to write a letter?

251
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,770
Let me grind the ink for you.

252
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:22,800
Not really.

253
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,230
I just want to paint a...

254
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,880
Letters can

255
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,360
be sent out in Linchuan?

256
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,600
Of course.

257
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,960
But Linchuan rarely

258
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,120
interacts with the outside world.

259
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,210
Letters or items

260
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:39,400
are usually exchanged within the tribe.

261
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,120
If you want to send a letter out of Linchuan,

262
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,580
you have to send it to the post station first.

263
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,800
I couldn't send the letter out

264
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,280
in Yongzhao Palace.

265
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:48,640
But now I'm in Linchuan.

266
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,480
I can send another letter to General Wu Jiu

267
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,560
for help.

268
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,810
During this period,

269
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,640
I just need to take control

270
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,640
of Hua'e.

271
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:01,710
She clearly drew out the dagger.

272
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:02,990
Why did she give up

273
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:04,390
such a good opportunity?

274
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,850
If she really wanted to kill me,

275
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,760
why did she bury

276
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,760
the dagger?

277
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,020
She has been troubled these days.

278
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,160
Maybe it's not

279
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,560
her intention to kill me.

280
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,770
There must be some hidden reason behind this.

281
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:21,900
Don't

282
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,040
tell anyone about this.

283
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:29,920
Young Madam carries

284
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,520
a poisonous dagger with her.

285
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,760
This is

286
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:34,590
definitely not that simple.

287
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,600
Princess. You let him

288
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,770
stay last night.

289
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,160
How could you fail?

290
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,600
Is it because you didn't have the chance

291
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,440
or you were bewitched

292
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,360
by his tenderness?

293
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:57,040
What about you?

294
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,280
You left your hometown

295
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,920
and dedicated yourself to Feng Yin.

296
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,240
Are you bewitched by him?

297
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,050
But as far as I know,

298
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:04,360
he is not

299
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,880
a tender person.

300
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,590
What do you want to say?

301
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,230
Just say it.

302
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,390
Hua'e.

303
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,880
I am Princess of Yongzhao,

304
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,960
and Young Madam of Linchuan.

305
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,590
I can give you

306
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,370
whatever you want.

307
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:23,760
If you want to get married,

308
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,330
I'll change your identity and find you

309
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:27,670
a good husband.

310
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,420
You will no longer be the daughter of a sinner.

311
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:32,080
If you don't want to get married,

312
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,180
I can guarantee

313
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,550
that you can enjoy wealth

314
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:36,810
and prosperity for the rest of your life.

315
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,150
Okay.

316
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:42,440
Do you think

317
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,040
I would answer you like that?

318
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:49,120
You can't give me

319
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,440
what I want,

320
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,760
but maybe His Highness

321
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,400
can.

322
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,910
I advise you

323
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,920
not to have any other thoughts.

324
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:02,440
If it were me taking action,

325
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,560
it wouldn't

326
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:04,960
just be Helian Xi

327
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,280
who dies.

328
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,490
I warn you.

329
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:19,880
Do not harm anyone

330
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,080
in Nanzhi Manor.
