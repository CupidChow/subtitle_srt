1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:26,980
[Hard To Find]

3
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:30,020
[8]

4
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,640
Helian Xi, your hand.

5
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:14,789
Thank you.

6
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:51,210
Father, we seem to be lost.

7
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,100
Don't be afraid.

8
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,430
I remember the way home.

9
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,940
Father, the light is not on.

10
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:59,240
Don't worry. I can see the way.

11
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:07,110
Go.

12
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:30,240
Father, the light is on again.

13
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,630
Yes, the light is on again.

14
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:32,960
Let's go home.

15
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:02,220
What are you doing here?

16
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:08,050
Take off your clothes.

17
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:09,680
What did you say?

18
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,430
I saw the burns on your back.

19
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:13,340
Qin Sang said you would deal with it yourself.

20
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:13,870
But what do you do with

21
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,230
your back?

22
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,840
You're a girl.

23
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,440
Girls can be doctors.

24
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,020
Is there a difference between men and women

25
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,550
in the treatment of wounds?

26
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:52,860
Why do you have

27
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:54,620
so many scars?

28
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,170
Who could hurt you?

29
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:03,190
Didn't you deal with them before?

30
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,460
Are you afraid of fire?

31
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,380
How do you know?

32
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:13,810
It's not hard to guess.

33
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,690
I went to you with a candle that day.

34
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,149
You wanted to blow it out.

35
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:18,990
But your room

36
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:20,269
was dark.

37
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:21,750
You didn't light a candle.

38
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,820
If you're not afraid of fire,

39
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:24,830
do you prefer

40
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:26,250
to live in the dark?

41
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:28,880
I didn't expect you to be so smart.

42
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,450
Do you have to

43
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,600
talk to me like that all the time?

44
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,300
How did you come to Shuoyun

45
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,890
three years ago?

46
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:00,770
Actually,

47
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,380
I couldn't really remember.

48
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:04,810
I only know that Xi Jiu saved me

49
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:06,810
and took me to the Prince's Mansion.

50
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:08,610
He saved you?

51
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,620
Hurry up.

52
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,040
Apply the ointment again tomorrow.

53
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:39,800
Don't let the wounds get wet.

54
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:57,880
Helian Xi.

55
00:05:58,290 --> 00:05:59,130
Why do you always

56
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:00,980
like to look at the stars from above?

57
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:02,460
Is it because you can

58
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,620
find things that others can't

59
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,260
from up high?

60
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:08,790
Because it's closest to the starry sky.

61
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:14,820
My closest approach to the starry sky

62
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:15,940
is not now.

63
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:18,940
It was the night I was punished

64
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,340
at the execution ground.

65
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,290
In the night,

66
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,860
a group of fireflies like stars

67
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:27,420
suddenly flew in.

68
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,640
Those were not fireflies. Those were...

69
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:34,930
Those weren't fireflies? What were they?

70
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,400
You must be mistaken.

71
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,120
Helian Xi.

72
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:44,730
I'm not the only one you've brightened up

73
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:46,140
the night for, right?

74
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:49,730
Do you often light up

75
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:51,760
for people in the dark?

76
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,860
You may leave.

77
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:00,380
Otherwise, if Xi Jiu comes up,

78
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:01,710
he will bother me again.

79
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,040
Okay.

80
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:10,020
By the way,

81
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:16,230
I'll give this back to you.

82
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:21,140
Since the Amber of the Divine Tree

83
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,740
can help me regain my memory,

84
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:25,060
I'll return it to you.

85
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,500
After all, if you let me keep it,

86
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,250
I don't know how to deal with it.

87
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:30,410
I don't know if I should steam it

88
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:32,220
or take it in a soup.

89
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,060
Your Highness.

90
00:07:53,409 --> 00:07:54,409
Have you found

91
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:55,880
anything unusual

92
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,860
about Helian Xi to Liang Chan?

93
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,240
Everything is normal.

94
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:03,510
But on the night of Yongzhao Palace Coup,

95
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:04,860
the one who killed the royal family of Feng

96
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:05,770
was him.

97
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:07,660
I'm afraid

98
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,490
after Liang Chan regains her memory,

99
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:10,300
if he gets

100
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,370
what he wants,

101
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,530
he will kill Liang Chan.

102
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,700
But Helian Xi

103
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:18,580
has no weakness.

104
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,340
It's not easy to catch him.

105
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,020
His weakness?

106
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:35,380
[He]

107
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:42,230
[Helian Xi is soft-hearted but stubborn.]

108
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,530
[He's afraid of fire.]

109
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,190
How can I bring light

110
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:55,010
into his darkness?

111
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:07,940
Qin Sang.

112
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,010
Qin Sang.

113
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:17,580
Young Madam.

114
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:18,970
Can I help you?

115
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:20,080
Could you please

116
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,300
buy something for me?

117
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:22,960
Of course.

118
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,010
Thank you.

119
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,110
The list is on the paper.

120
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:30,410
Okay, I'll go later.

121
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:38,140
Qin Sang, what are you cooking?

122
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:39,330
This doesn't smell

123
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:40,740
like my usual medicine.

124
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:42,090
This is...

125
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,540
This seems to be...

126
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,840
The smell of the Amber of the Divine Tree?

127
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,020
It's okay.

128
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:53,260
Thank you.

129
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:07,260
Young Madam.

130
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,660
Things you want are here.

131
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,620
Don't let Helian Xi

132
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,290
come to me until tonight.

133
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:18,730
Okay.

134
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:48,590
What are you doing in my room again?

135
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,580
I...

136
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:53,820
I bring something for you.

137
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,050
What tricks are you playing?

138
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:58,020
Don't move.

139
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,900
I really have something for you.

140
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:02,590
What is it?

141
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,220
A cloud of stars

142
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,100
in the dark.

143
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,140
Your room

144
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:32,410
is always dark.

145
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:34,760
You can't light the flame for fear of fire.

146
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,170
So I made

147
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:38,950
this lamp with the fluorite

148
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,140
to give you some light.

149
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:43,940
Why do you give me these?

150
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,700
I've been with you

151
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:49,280
long enough to realize

152
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:51,040
that the more stubborn you are,

153
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:53,440
the more soft-hearted you'll be.

154
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:55,660
When I was suffering,

155
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,700
besides holding an umbrella for me,

156
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:00,490
you also brought me stars.

157
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:02,480
You should have

158
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:04,330
lit lights for many people

159
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,500
in the dark, right?

160
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,730
But your night

161
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,660
is always dark.

162
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:16,600
No matter how close the stars are,

163
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,970
you still can't touch them.

164
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:27,610
I want to

165
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:31,230
light up your dark night.

166
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,260
Have you forgotten

167
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,910
I wanted to kill you?

168
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,610
Of course I remember.

169
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,530
But I could also see

170
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,100
how you protected me

171
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:50,970
and treated others well.

172
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:53,380
If you're really

173
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,780
so wicked,

174
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:56,960
how can Qin Sang

175
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:58,830
be so loyal to you?

176
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:02,300
You must have been nice to me before.

177
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:03,330
I must have done something

178
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:04,640
to hurt you

179
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,480
to make you treat me like this.

180
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,340
When I regain my memory

181
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,600
and remember the past,

182
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,380
I will

183
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:12,890
atone for my mistake.

184
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:15,250
Atone for your mistake?

185
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:19,060
I know

186
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:21,260
you asked Qin Sang to make the medicine.

187
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,550
I can drink it now.

188
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:23,640
After drinking it,

189
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,720
I should be able to regain my memory.

190
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,580
Helian Xi.

191
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,370
Did you hear me?

192
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,290
Drinking it at night has no effect.

193
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:36,980
Let's talk tomorrow.

194
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,130
I'm sleepy.

195
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:44,940
Well.

196
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,430
You can give it to me tomorrow at daylight.

197
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:34,700
The heart of the Divine Tree.

198
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:26,100
Helian Xi.

199
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:30,660
What are you doing?

200
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,740
You even

201
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,160
want to spend

202
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,930
the unreal time with her.

203
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,560
Young Madam.

204
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:06,690
Was the young master

205
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:08,300
happy to see the fluorite

206
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,579
you made last night?

207
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:11,960
I don't know.

208
00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:13,690
He doesn't show

209
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,950
his happiness or unhappiness

210
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:17,569
on his face.

211
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:19,270
You're right.

212
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:21,940
In the past three years,

213
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,970
Young Master has long lost

214
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:26,410
the ups and downs of a normal person's mind.

215
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:29,810
Qin Sang.

216
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,930
You go out first.

217
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,390
Young Master.

218
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:51,330
What's wrong?

219
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,370
Was it the bright light

220
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,930
that kept you up last night?

221
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:01,340
What is this?

222
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:04,770
The medicine made from
the Amber of the Divine Tree.

223
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,180
Give it to me.

224
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,150
This medicine can cure difficult diseases,

225
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:13,930
but it can easily attack the heart.

226
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:15,570
People with heart disease

227
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:17,010
or cardiopulmonary damage should not take it.

228
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:19,120
You've been taking medicine for years.

229
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,560
Is it related to this?

230
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,350
I took the medicine because I was weak.

231
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:28,300
I'm fine.

232
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:29,730
Give me the medicine.

233
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,840
Have you ever thought

234
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:41,890
what kind of person you were before?

235
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:44,940
I don't know.

236
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,800
Maybe

237
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:49,460
it was better than my current disposition.

238
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:50,790
I was not that stubborn.

239
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:52,850
Maybe it was even worse

240
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:55,050
because I was selfish.

241
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,700
I never would have been

242
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,220
a gentle person.

243
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:04,420
What if you were

244
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,470
a vicious

245
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:09,270
and unpardonably wicked person?

246
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:12,370
Can you bear it?

247
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:17,020
If that's the case,

248
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:18,930
it's still me.

249
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,930
At least I can find myself.

250
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:22,960
I can pay for

251
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:24,100
for my sin.

252
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,780
After drinking it,

253
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,660
it will work in two hours.

254
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:51,700
What's wrong?

255
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,440
Feng Yuan?

256
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,250
Feng Yuan!

257
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:06,420
Feng Yuan!
