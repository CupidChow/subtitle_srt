00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:30,440
[Episode 12]

4
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:34,280
I'm warning you.

5
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:36,930
Don't touch anyone

6
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:38,080
in Nanzhi Manor.

7
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:40,690
Princess,

8
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,110
are you going to kill me?

9
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:44,740
Do you think I dare not?

10
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,640
Since I dare to come to Linchuan,

11
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:48,930
I'm prepared

12
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:50,850
to protect myself and escape.

13
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:52,980
If I die,

14
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:54,950
Princess,

15
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:58,190
your father and mother

16
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,400
will be...

17
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:03,840
Good.

18
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:06,600
Then we'll fight till the end.

19
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:12,060
Even if I can't kill you,

20
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:14,700
I still have chances

21
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:16,980
to cut off your tongue

22
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,350
and take out your eyes.

23
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:24,380
You will stay further

24
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:27,660
from what you want.

25
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:33,950
From now on,

26
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:36,350
I'll decide

27
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:37,450
when and how to

28
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:39,070
take action.

29
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:40,900
And you

30
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:43,680
are not allowed to enter my room

31
00:01:45,259 --> 00:01:47,380
without my permission.

32
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,170
Why did you suddenly come to me?

33
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:13,740
What happened?

34
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:14,570
Feng Yuan has been down

35
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:15,790
recently.

36
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:17,180
I want to ask you

37
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,370
when you went to Yongzhao Palace

38
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,570
did you notice anything strange?

39
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:23,690
Strange?

40
00:02:25,329 --> 00:02:26,829
I heard that King of Yongzhao

41
00:02:26,829 --> 00:02:28,430
loves Young Madam very much.

42
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,410
But he didn't show up

43
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,640
when she got married.

44
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,380
Only Young Madam's mother

45
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:34,570
and elder brother were here.

46
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,250
[Old King] [Feng Yin]

47
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:35,990
Generally speaking,

48
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:38,190
when the princess married to Linchuan,

49
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:39,650
Yongzhao would

50
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:40,850
care about

51
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:42,250
how Young Madam was doing.

52
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,490
But they didn't

53
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,720
ask anything.

54
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,270
Is it possible that

55
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:49,579
is there something wrong

56
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,910
in Feng family?

57
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:55,150
Young Master,

58
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,020
bad news.

59
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:57,610
What is it?

60
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:58,620
Tell me.

61
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,930
I apologize to you first.

62
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,130
I'm worried that Young Madam

63
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:02,970
will harm you.

64
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:05,330
I made the decision without permission

65
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:06,720
to detain Young Madam's letter

66
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,980
and confirmed the content of the letter.

67
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:10,750
Wu Qing.

68
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,970
Young Master, let me finish.

69
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,740
Something big happened

70
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:17,000
in Yongzhao.

71
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:18,970
[Old King] [Feng Yin]

72
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,010
confined his biological father,

73
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:22,450
threatened his brothers,

74
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:23,930
and assassinated brother in law.

75
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:26,310
The royal family of Yongzhao is really vicious.

76
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,170
It has nothing to do with others from Yongzhao Royal Family.

77
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:30,250
This is all done

78
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,050
by Feng Yin.

79
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,000
But Feng Yin

80
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,350
wanted to kill you.

81
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,560
I have never met him.

82
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,560
I don't know why he wants to

83
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:41,920
kill me,

84
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,620
but after all,

85
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,680
the confined Prince Yongzhao

86
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,440
is the internal affair of Yongzhao.

87
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,040
I have no right to interfere.

88
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,260
What's your plan?

89
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:57,370
Have you sent the letter?

90
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:57,980
Yes.

91
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:59,000
No mistake.

92
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,950
The rainy season is coming.

93
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:09,080
It's inappropriate to send a letter.

94
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:11,330
This is a serious matter.

95
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:13,050
I’d better

96
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:14,510
to see General Wu Fei in person.

97
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:15,840
This is the securest way.

98
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,740
[The Old King] [The King] [Feng Yuan]

99
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:28,750
Where are you going

100
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:29,630
in such a hurry?

101
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:30,600
I...

102
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:35,460
I wrote a letter.

103
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,920
I want to go to the post to check

104
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,320
whether it has been sent.

105
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:39,409
It seems that

106
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:40,909
she won't feel at ease

107
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,190
if she doesn't check in person.

108
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:44,909
Let me go with you.

109
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:47,480
You've been in Linchuan for a while.

110
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,320
I'm going on a long trip tomorrow.

111
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,760
I can take you around.

112
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:52,260
Go with me.

113
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,470
It'll be faster if I go with you.

114
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:00,600
You just confirmed that

115
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:01,990
the postman

116
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:03,710
had sent the letter.

117
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:04,790
Then

118
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:07,040
how long will it take to the next post?

119
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,270
How many posts will it pass

120
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:09,830
to go out of Linchuan?

121
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,850
When it leaves Linchuan to Yongzhao,

122
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:13,050
will it be delayed

123
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:14,270
if the weather is bad?

124
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,030
It takes one day

125
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,700
to get to the next post

126
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,200
It needs to pass 32 posts

127
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,480
to get out of Linchuan.

128
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:22,670
It's indeed troublesome

129
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:23,830
in rainy days.

130
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:25,550
But I promise you

131
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:28,320
the postman who send the letter

132
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:30,340
will travel through wind and rain

133
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:32,140
and deliver the letter safely.

134
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:36,320
So,

135
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,030
can you relax

136
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,710
and just look around?

137
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:43,060
Okay.

138
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,320
Is that man

139
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:49,909
selling a tree?

140
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:51,170
Don't go there.

141
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,880
In this market,

142
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,500
only that tree is not for sale.

143
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:14,500
No for sale.

144
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,010
Then why is he standing there

145
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:16,840
with that tree?

146
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,370
This is a pomegranate tree.

147
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:19,490
In Linchuan.

148
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,340
pomegranate tree

149
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,090
symbolizes happiness

150
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:24,840
and many children.

151
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,180
He's waiting for someone

152
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:28,130
who can plant the tree,

153
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:29,540
and wait for blossom

154
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,060
and fruit with him.

155
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:39,430
Look.

156
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:45,300
I see.

157
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:49,920
All right, let's wrap up.

158
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,790
Let's go.

159
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:52,650
Okay, let's clean up.

160
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,680
It's only dusk.

161
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,409
Don't you have a night market here?

162
00:06:57,409 --> 00:06:58,530
In Linchuan,

163
00:06:59,070 --> 00:06:59,930
the day of work is over.

164
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:01,690
at dusk.

165
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:02,430
The night

166
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,480
belongs to the moon and stars.

167
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,330
Do you want to know

168
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:10,550
where they are going?

169
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,690
I'll take you there.

170
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,450
Compared with being alone,

171
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:21,680
Linchuan people

172
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:22,770
prefer to stay together

173
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:23,800
like this.

174
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,530
Is there anything special

175
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:30,890
in Yongzhao?

176
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,120
Yongzhao has a night market,

177
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:36,920
but if it's curfew,

178
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,030
people will shut down doors and windows,

179
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,960
and are not allowed to walk around.

180
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,470
You...

181
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,420
want to give it a try?

182
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:58,630
No, thanks.

183
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,290
I...

184
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:01,840
I'll just look at the stars.

185
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,830
Yongzhao and Linchuan

186
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,160
are far apart,

187
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,530
the customs are different,

188
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,350
but at least they are under the same sky

189
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:18,460
They are looking at same stars.

190
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,560
There are stars in Linchuan

191
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,060
that do not exist in Yongzhao.

192
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,310
Special stars.

193
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:26,930
What kind of stars?

194
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,130
Let's go.

195
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,310
I'll take you there.

196
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:34,559
If you don't mind,

197
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,280
cover your eyes first.

198
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:37,360
Okay.

199
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,540
I forgot that I can't see.

200
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:53,320
Let's go.

201
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:54,830
Let me show you the way.

202
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:02,790
Be careful.

203
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:16,330
We're here.

204
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:29,800
The Divine Tree shines at night.

205
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,560
Those are

206
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,600
nightflies.

207
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:32,720
Nightflies?

208
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,690
Fireflies?

209
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:36,120
Not exactly.

210
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:37,050
It's an insect that

211
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:38,810
grows on the heart

212
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,440
of the Divine Tree.

213
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:54,850
How did it fly?

214
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:06,860
I'm sorry.

215
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,370
This is the only way to let you

216
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:09,640
have a good sleep.

217
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:39,740
When did I

218
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,350
get back last night?

219
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:55,440
[My dear wife Feng Yuan]

220
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,610
Yuan,

221
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,180
maybe you haven't gotten used to the life in Linchuan

222
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:00,580
since you left your home,

223
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:03,150
you seem like you haven't slept well

224
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:05,020
these days.

225
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:07,210
After consideration,

226
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,400
I took you to see the nightflies.

227
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,860
The powder of them can help you sleep well.

228
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,200
I've prepared some.

229
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,960
May you stop having nightmares at night.

230
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:19,080
If you inhale too much,

231
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,820
you'll look like you're dead.

232
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:22,950
In this case, you must have water as soon as possible.

233
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:23,820
Remember,

234
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:28,970
a new pomegranate tree was planted in the yard.

235
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:30,840
Please take care of it

236
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,490
during the time I'm out.

237
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:35,060
By the time I'm back,

238
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,750
hope to see the pomegranate flower blooms,

239
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,550
and all the nightmares are gone.

240
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,450
I hope when I return,

241
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,830
everything has been solved.

242
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:17,080
Yin Qiao,

243
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:23,270
do you know

244
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:25,340
why Young Master suddenly went out?

245
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,610
Is it because

246
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:27,450
he has some grievances

247
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:28,850
with our princess?

248
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:30,880
Don't worry.

249
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,570
Young Master and Young Madam are fine.

250
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:33,740
There was a flood in the south.

251
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:34,790
Young Master and Wu Qing

252
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:36,120
went out to deal with it.

253
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,350
That's good.

254
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:41,820
Did Young Master say when he will come back?

255
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:43,940
Probably two months.

256
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,500
Helian Xi isn't here.

257
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,760
Then I have a chance.

258
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,420
[Biography of Linchuan]

259
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,490
There are so many people

260
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:05,510
in this world without a conscience.

261
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:07,670
How could His Highness believe

262
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,350
the tree has a heart?

263
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,030
My father has

264
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:14,070
never given me anything in his life,

265
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:16,290
but I found

266
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:17,440
this book.

267
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,520
He and the King of Linchuan

268
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:22,370
were very close.

269
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,530
This book

270
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,970
recorded a Divine Tree

271
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,930
in Linchuan.

272
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:32,270
If Young Master of Linchuan dies accidentally,

273
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:34,780
the Divine Tree will wither.

274
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:37,580
The heart of the tree with ancient power

275
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,010
will appear in the world.

276
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:43,560
If I

277
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,160
get the heart of the tree,

278
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,980
not only the tribes of the East,

279
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,740
the whole world will be mine.

280
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,980
Yongzhao belongs to you.

281
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,360
Then I am the queen of Yongzhao.

282
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:01,230
If the world is yours,

283
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,030
then what am I?

284
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,290
Then you are

285
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:12,950
the queen of the world.

286
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,560
So I want you to follow her

287
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,130
to Linchuan,

288
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,100
kill Helian Xi,

289
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,720
and bring the heart of the tree back.

290
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:23,320
Okay.

291
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,540
I'll leave you alone.

292
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,110
Yin Qiao.

293
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:35,790
What did Hua'e do here?

294
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:36,770
Nothing.

295
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,860
I just asked

296
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:39,350
why Young Master went out.

297
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:44,010
Yin Qiao,

298
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:45,590
you should keep a distance

299
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:46,270
from her

300
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:47,710
and don't be close to her.

301
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,360
I will take good care of you

302
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,010
when Hua'e

303
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:53,270
goes back to Yongzhao.

304
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:55,010
Okay, thank you.

305
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,300
When did Young Master

306
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:03,180
plant this pomegranate tree?

307
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:05,720
After you fell asleep last night,

308
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,090
he came alone to plant it.

309
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:08,420
He also asked me

310
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,070
not to disturb you.

311
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,410
Young Madam.

312
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,860
please go back to your room and wash up.

313
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:17,660
Young Master has prepared something else for you.

314
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:23,940
He said

315
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,120
you like flowers,

316
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,850
and asked me to change them for you every day.

317
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:28,270
He said that if you see the flowers,

318
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:29,270
he will be happy.

319
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,430
There's no need to change them every day.

320
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:35,520
The flower won’t wither within a day.

321
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:40,160
I wonder whether General Wu Jiu

322
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:42,320
has received my letter.

323
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,230
Helian Xi and Nanzhi Manor

324
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:46,430
have protected so carefully.

325
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:47,850
I can't let Feng Yin

326
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:49,310
destroy this land

327
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:51,300
just for my family.

328
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:54,720
When Helian Xi comes back,

329
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,810
I'll tell him everything,

330
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:58,390
and leave Linchuan.

331
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,080
If I can't save my parents,

332
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,270
at least I can

333
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,450
live and die with them.

334
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,380
So lucky. I got it!

335
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,150
Young Madam.

336
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:41,470
Young Madam.

337
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,110
There's a letter for you.

338
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:44,240
It's from Yongzhao.

339
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:45,600
Give me the letter.

340
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,270
[To the Princess]

341
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:49,730
Yin Qiao, didn't you say

342
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,020
it takes at least a month

343
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:52,280
from Linchuan to Yongzhao?

344
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,210
Why so soon?

345
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,570
Young Master knows you care about your family,

346
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:56,860
so he asked all the posts

347
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,440
to escort and send your letter

348
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,610
as soon as possible.

349
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:01,080
[Wu Fei]

350
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:09,730
It’s really the handwriting of General Wu Fei.

351
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:11,540
Let's go.

352
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:13,250
Let's go back to Nanzhi Manor.

353
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:19,670
Young Madam.

354
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:20,880
Yongzhao.

355
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,569
What kind of place is it?

356
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,400
Yongzhao and Linchuan

357
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,950
are completely different.

358
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:29,590
When I have the chance,

359
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,670
I'll take you there.

360
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:31,580
Really?

361
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,710
Of course.

362
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:33,800
It seems that she's no longer

363
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,920
Princess of Yongzhao,

364
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,630
but Young Madam of Linchuan.

365
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,090
If I stay longer,

366
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,400
it won't do me any good.

367
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:40,330
Young Madam.

368
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,050
Is Hua'e

369
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:43,730
in a bad mood recently?

370
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,680
I haven't seen her in a while.

371
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:46,610
What's wrong?

372
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:49,170
Nothing.

373
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:50,830
One time,

374
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:52,710
she asked me how to get out of Linchuan.

375
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:54,850
I went to her room to find a route for her.

376
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:56,750
But she was so angry.

377
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:57,900
That was the first time

378
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,300
I saw her lose her temper.

379
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:01,490
Maybe

380
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:03,170
I just scolded her a few days ago.

381
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:05,700
She lost her temper and wanted to leave early.

382
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:08,710
No wonder she has so much alcohol in her room.

383
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:11,260
She was scolded by Young Madam and was unhappy,

384
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:13,930
so she had alcohol.

385
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,110
So much alcohol?

386
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,470
I clearly remember

387
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:21,870
she can't even have a sip.

388
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:26,110
Young Madam, today is the Washing Festival.

389
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:27,160
Granny Chun said

390
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,250
you have to go with your people

391
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,620
to wash away the disaster.

392
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:30,370
Okay.

393
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:09,860
Burn it.

394
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:11,910
After it,

395
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:14,700
I can go back to Yongzhao.

396
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:18,170
You crazy?

397
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:26,050
Princess,

398
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:28,560
I want to see

399
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:30,480
how you can put out the fire.

400
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:47,100
How can Young Madam miss

401
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:49,020
such an important day?

402
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:50,610
But Young Madam said

403
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,870
she's not feeling well.

404
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:52,720
Not well?

405
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:53,860
Just don't get into the water.

406
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,300
At least attend the pray.

407
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:00,030
Granny Chun.

408
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:07,600
Granny Chun, what's wrong?
