[17]

00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:33,500
Xi.

5
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:08,100
What did you

6
00:01:10,289 --> 00:01:11,530
just call me?

7
00:01:15,789 --> 00:01:17,030
Wasn't I

8
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,690
being held hostage?

9
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:24,510
That was three days ago.

10
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:36,410
What did you

11
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,259
just call me?

12
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,140
Helian Xi.

13
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,539
How's your injury?

14
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:53,180
You were badly hurt.

15
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:04,680
I'm fine.

16
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,400
How are you?

17
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,170
I...

18
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:15,700
Liang Chan.

19
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,410
Liang Chan.

20
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:24,960
You're finally awake.

21
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,380
Xi Jiu.

22
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,010
Why are you here?

23
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:29,380
I heard you haven't woken up,

24
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:30,710
so I came to check on you.

25
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:32,020
You came at the right time.

26
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,860
I have something to ask you.

27
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,140
What is it?

28
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:38,660
Can you

29
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:40,780
leave us alone?

30
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,120
It's too cold here.

31
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:47,660
I'll take you inside.

32
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,350
You just woke up.

33
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:16,010
I’ll get you something to eat.

34
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,170
Liang Chan.

35
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:37,940
What’s the matter?

36
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,340
Xi Jiu.

37
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,100
Thank you for saving me three years ago.

38
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,180
If it weren't for you,

39
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,079
I would have died long ago.

40
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:50,350
Why are you suddenly bringing this up?

41
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,430
I want to ask you something.

42
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:55,180
When you found me three years ago,

43
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:56,780
was there

44
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:00,380
anything

45
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,020
stuck in my

46
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:02,900
chest here?

47
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,460
Something stuck?

48
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:11,260
No.

49
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,540
Your chest wound was strange,

50
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,270
not caused by an ordinary weapon.

51
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:16,709
I've always wanted to

52
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,860
know what injured you.

53
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:22,980
Did the Twinned Branches

54
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,140
disappear back then?

55
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:29,470
If the Twinned Branches really disappeared,

56
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:32,260
how could he revive the Divine Tree?

57
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:35,780
Liang Chan.

58
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,180
Why do I feel

59
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,310
you're different from before?

60
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:42,020
It's just that after going through this

61
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,150
and waking up again.

62
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,950
I feel like being in a different world.

63
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,620
Helian Xi.

64
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,960
Why are you treating it by yourself?

65
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,890
What are you doing here?

66
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:28,180
Why?

67
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:30,170
I came to help you with it.

68
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:31,980
No need.

69
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,100
I just wanted to help you.

70
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,860
Aren't you here to see Feng Yuan?

71
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,390
What are you doing here?

72
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:46,670
I'm not only here to see her,

73
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:49,659
but also to see you.

74
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:52,220
See me?

75
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:59,270
I came to apologize to you.

76
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:00,420
I was reckless,

77
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:01,460
stupid

78
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,700
and ignorant before.

79
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:06,610
Helian.

80
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:08,060
Today,

81
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:09,700
I offer you tea

82
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:11,080
as an apology.

83
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,060
If there is

84
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:14,380
ever a need for my help

85
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:15,380
in the future,

86
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,820
I will definitely do my utmost.

87
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:29,050
Feng Yuan is my wife.

88
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,620
It’s my duty to save her.

89
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:36,180
Not just because of Liang Chan,

90
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:38,380
but also because you saved my Shuoyun tribe

91
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:39,580
without considering

92
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,960
past grievances or differences.

93
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:43,970
Their ancestors

94
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:46,230
were originally from my Linchuan tribe,

95
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:48,180
so they have some Linchuan bloodline.

96
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,640
It's something I should do

97
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:50,820
to save them.

98
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:52,810
Then why didn't our two tribes

99
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,170
intermarry later on?

100
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:57,500
The Linchuan people have a peculiar taste for raw food,

101
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,700
which is seen as strange by foreigners.

102
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,430
Just this difference in habits

103
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,200
has caused many troubles.

104
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:04,710
After intermarriage,

105
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:07,020
whenever there is a murder case in Shuoyun,

106
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,220
it is always linked to

107
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,350
the Linchuan tribe.

108
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:10,970
Later,

109
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:12,580
my grandfather stopped

110
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,220
the intermarriage with foreign tribes.

111
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,220
Some people are shallow and biased,

112
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,490
but they call others sinister.

113
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:19,400
It seems that

114
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:21,210
I am also one of those people.

115
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:25,270
By the way,

116
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,690
how are those people doing?

117
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:29,620
Perhaps it's because

118
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,700
they were trapped in a harsh environment.

119
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:32,780
Their wounds got infected.

120
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:35,220
Although the doctors are doing their best to treat them,

121
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,280
there is one person

122
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,580
who may not survive tonight.

123
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,580
Take me to see them.

124
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,570
Helian, do you have a solution?

125
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,060
Maybe we can try.

126
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:58,900
What is this?

127
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,740
The heart of the Linchuan Divine Tree.

128
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:02,620
Yongye.

129
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:34,730
So the tree heart doesn't have resurrection power.

130
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,700
Then my resurrection must be

131
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,600
because of the Twinned Branches.

132
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:41,159
But if Yuan used the Twinned Branches,

133
00:08:41,299 --> 00:08:42,900
why could she be still alive?

134
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,420
Thank you for trying to save him.

135
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,460
I'm grateful for that.

136
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,260
Forget it.

137
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:57,950
Just follow the fate.

138
00:08:58,050 --> 00:08:59,220
I have something to do.

139
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,180
I have to go.

140
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:11,190
As the Young Master of Linchuan,

141
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:12,940
he's willing to risk his own life

142
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:14,140
to protect our tribe.

143
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:15,620
If the King had agreed

144
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:17,530
to send troops to help them back then,

145
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:19,060
Linchuan wouldn't have...

146
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:20,220
What do you mean

147
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,150
by the King refused to send troops?

148
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:33,540
You mean

149
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,500
Young Master of Linchuan

150
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:37,540
saved them by cutting his own heart?

151
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:38,660
Yes.

152
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:45,140
You may leave.

153
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:46,540
Yes.

154
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:58,970
Your Highness.

155
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,490
When you were severely injured

156
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:07,950
and stranded in Linchuan,

157
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:09,180
not only did Linchuan people save you

158
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,040
with the most precious medicine,

159
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:14,060
they also sent someone to escort you back to Shuoyun.

160
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,950
When Linchuan was invaded by Yongzhao

161
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:16,940
and fell into a desperate situation,

162
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,260
they asked for your help,

163
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,990
but you refused to send troops.

164
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:23,320
Every member of our guards is loyal and brave.

165
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,140
Did you lack confidence in them

166
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,660
or were you afraid of Yongzhao?

167
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,660
As the King of Shuoyun,

168
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,180
I have my reason.

169
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:47,700
Is it because you are

170
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,260
ungrateful?

171
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:52,180
Or are you just afraid of death?

172
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,010
How dare you!

173
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:05,320
I was to protect Shuoyun from getting

174
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:06,580
involved in trouble.

175
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,460
Was that trouble?

176
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:11,220
That was a battle of extermination.

177
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,740
The entire Linchuan tribe perished because of it.

178
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,670
The extinction of the Linchuan tribe

179
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,500
has nothing to do with Shuoyun.

180
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,030
I can be accused of ingratitude

181
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:26,820
by everyone in the world,

182
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,580
but I will not let

183
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:30,620
Shuoyun be in any danger.

184
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,930
Even if I could go back three years ago,

185
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:33,900
I would

186
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:36,140
still make the same choice.

187
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:41,100
Is this righteousness

188
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,260
you taught me?

189
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:44,450
Is this repaying kindness

190
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:45,620
you taught me?

191
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,780
When Linchuan was in real danger

192
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,110
and asked for your help,

193
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:51,020
you turned a blind eye.

194
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:53,870
Helian Xi begged you for the Planchette

195
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:55,140
to revive Linchuan,

196
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,660
but you ignored it.

197
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:00,820
If you're afraid of paying the price

198
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,250
for using the Planchette,

199
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,340
then teach me now.

200
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:04,980
I will repay Linchuan

201
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:06,300
and bear all the consequences.

202
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,140
Enough.

203
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,260
You're just a young brat.

204
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:10,540
What can you bear?

205
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:16,780
Go and bring him here.

206
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,580
What are you thinking?

207
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,340
Qin Sang said

208
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:28,090
no matter where

209
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
you've been in the past three years,

210
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:34,130
you always like to stay in high places.

211
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:35,450
I want to know

212
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,340
what you're thinking

213
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,700
when you're alone.

214
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:47,500
Nothing.

215
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:48,730
Are you

216
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,200
thinking about Linchuan?

217
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,820
Everything you did back then

218
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,810
was to save me with

219
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:09,070
the Twinned Branches,

220
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:13,180
but I hurt you so deeply.

221
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:17,370
Yes.

222
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,780
I'm thinking about Linchuan

223
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,100
and wondering

224
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,390
where you are.

225
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,420
Helian Xi.

226
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:43,900
Can you

227
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:45,300
take me to

228
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:47,710
the Spirit Realm of the Divine Tree again?

229
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:00,500
All of this...

230
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,980
is because of me.

231
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,220
Young Madam.

232
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,900
-Young Madam.
-Young Madam.

233
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:17,220
Young Madam.

234
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,650
Young Madam.

235
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,940
-Young Madam.
-Young Madam.

236
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,310
How did you get up there?

237
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:24,910
Don't worry.

238
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,020
I came up on my own.

239
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:27,180
Young Madam, please come down.

240
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,110
Don't be afraid.

241
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:28,660
Yeah.

242
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:29,820
I'm fine.

243
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:31,420
-Young Madam.
-Young Madam.

244
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:33,180
Please come down, Young Madam.

245
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,830
What are you looking at?

246
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:44,500
I'm thinking

247
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,660
if I were to

248
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,750
look at Linchuan from here before,

249
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,620
would the scenery be great

250
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,990
with fragrance of flowers?

251
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:00,550
Yes.

252
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,340
Is it only the Twinned Branches

253
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:10,140
can revive the Divine Tree?

254
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,040
Both two branches

255
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:14,030
are indispensable.

256
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:16,130
Right?

257
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:17,420
Yes.

258
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,330
What's wrong with you?

259
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:35,300
The bird's nest is crooked.

260
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:36,820
I'll fix it.

261
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,700
The missing earring

262
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:46,030
is here.

263
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:55,020
How could it be here?

264
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:04,140
Can I

265
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:05,980
take it back?

266
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,050
This is the Spirit Realm.

267
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:10,940
You can grasp

268
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:12,380
everything but

269
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,310
can't take it away.

270
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:17,940
I want to try.

271
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:21,700
Take me back.

272
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:36,020
The lost memories

273
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,620
are like

274
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:39,540
the long-lost earring.

275
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,620
Even if I find it,

276
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,240
it's still in vain.

277
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,800
Helian Xi.

278
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:00,270
When will the pomegranate flowers bloom?

279
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:03,810
Normally,

280
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,130
there should be another month.

281
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:07,420
Unfortunately,

282
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,520
the pomegranate flowers in Nanzhi Manor

283
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,140
will never bloom again.

284
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:12,700
I'll go back first.

285
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,540
Have you remembered it all?

286
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:17,910
No.

287
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:19,690
It's not that easy.

288
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:26,860
Did you use the Twinned Branches

289
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:27,780
to save me?

290
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,500
I'll try to remember

291
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:37,420
where the Twinned Branches are.

292
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:39,620
I didn't ask you

293
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:40,860
where the Twinned Branches are.

294
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,020
I'm asking

295
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:43,490
if you used the Twinned Branches

296
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:44,350
to save me.

297
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:50,470
I can't just tell him like this,

298
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:52,180
unless I find

299
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:54,390
another way to revive the Divine Tree.

300
00:18:57,690 --> 00:18:58,500
Helian Xi.

301
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:00,840
Helian Xi.

302
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,180
Why are you two standing there

303
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,640
without saying anything?

304
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,060
If there's nothing else,

305
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:09,830
I'm leaving.

306
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:10,660
Wait.

307
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:19,680
What are you doing?

308
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,480
I'm fine. It's almost recovered.

309
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,470
My father wants you to meet him.

310
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:36,540
Perhaps after you meet him,

311
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:37,940
you will know everything

312
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,060
you want to know.
