[Episode 9]

4
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:41,480
Your Highness.

5
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:43,940
Why do you need these household registers?

6
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,920
They wouldn't disappear for no reason.

7
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:47,950
I always feel

8
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:50,170
these missing people

9
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,590
must have something in common.

10
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,460
Your Highness!

11
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,520
Your Highness.

12
00:00:58,010 --> 00:00:58,960
What is it?

13
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:00,470
Miss Qin Sang just said

14
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:01,230
her Young Master

15
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:02,370
asked you to go to Nanzhi Manor.

16
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:04,569
Something happened to Miss Liang Chan.

17
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,200
What?

18
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,870
Why did she react like this

19
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,080
after drinking the amber juice?

20
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,510
Why is it still so hot?

21
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:32,850
Don’t touch her.

22
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:47,229
What happened to Liang Chan?

23
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,570
Her life is safe for now.

24
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,800
I wanted to ask you

25
00:01:51,789 --> 00:01:53,640
why she has been weak for 3 years.

26
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,160
Does she have heart disease?

27
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,740
Or were her heart and lungs damaged?

28
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:57,920
What does that have to do with you?

29
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,020
I want to save her!

30
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,070
Tell me!

31
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:01,880
Now,

32
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,150
you can only trust me.

33
00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:09,750
When I met her

34
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,400
three years ago,

35
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,530
she was covered in wounds.

36
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:16,910
And her heart was stabbed

37
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,160
by unknown objects.

38
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,310
I spent a month

39
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,470
to save her life.

40
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:23,960
No doctors

41
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:24,950
could diagnose

42
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:26,140
her illness.

43
00:02:26,829 --> 00:02:28,079
So she can only take medicine every day

44
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:29,880
to nourish her energy and blood.

45
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,390
But good for you.

46
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,140
The first time you met her,

47
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,270
you stabbed her.

48
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:35,790
Now,

49
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:38,579
you are asking me why she is weak.

50
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:40,660
Her heart was injured.

51
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:41,600
Could it be...

52
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,320
What are you doing?

53
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:50,470
What do you want to do?

54
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,910
If you want to save her,

55
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,390
don't get in the way.

56
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,110
Let me do it.

57
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:51,870
She's fine now.

58
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:53,579
You take care of her.

59
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:03,280
Young Master.

60
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,540
How is Young Madam?

61
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:06,990
She's fine.

62
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:09,240
Her heart and lungs were damaged.

63
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,190
She usually takes medicine

64
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,310
whose medicinal properties are hot.

65
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:12,390
That's why she would be like that.

66
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:13,030
Okay.

67
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,040
I'll go check on her.

68
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:14,970
Don't go in.

69
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,279
You can go later.

70
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,130
Xi Jiu is accompanying her.

71
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:19,910
Young Master.

72
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:21,769
How can you

73
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,020
let him accompany Young Madam of Linchuan?

74
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,080
It doesn't matter.

75
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:26,080
He just wants to protect her.

76
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,310
While he's here,

77
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:31,150
I'll go to the Crown Prince's mansion.

78
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:32,350
You go to Shuoyun's dungeon

79
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:33,920
and find out the identity

80
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,260
of the one they caught.

81
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:36,150
Yes.

82
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,430
Maybe your past

83
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:56,470
really has something to do with him.

84
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,670
The way you save people

85
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:58,940
is so similar.

86
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,760
You don't dislike me

87
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:04,950
doesn't mean you love me.

88
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,430
Your Highness.

89
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:14,620
Your Highness.

90
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,940
I've brought you the list of missing people

91
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,400
and household registers.

92
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:19,670
Put it here.

93
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:24,650
Your Highness.

94
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,030
One more thing.

95
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,190
What is it?

96
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,420
One of the tribesmen

97
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,550
who was captured escaped last night

98
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:31,610
and was saved by us.

99
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,560
When he escaped,

100
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:35,490
he took one object of the bad guy.

101
00:05:42,659 --> 00:05:43,700
Got it.

102
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,210
Go watch the door.

103
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:46,150
Yes.

104
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:01,110
The intermarriage between Shuoyun and Linchuan

105
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,550
happened a century ago.

106
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:03,950
Why do the ancestors of these people

107
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,430
who went missing

108
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:07,950
have intermarriage with Linchuan people?

109
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,660
This ring...

110
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:25,520
Linchuan.

111
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,540
Could it be Helian Xi?

112
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,710
Sheng.

113
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,560
Gather all guards in the city to stand by.

114
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,270
Yes.

115
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:45,520
When Miss Liang Chan

116
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,510
was brought back,

117
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:47,670
she was covered in wounds.

118
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:49,290
She's barely breathing.

119
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,659
All doctors in Shuoyun

120
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:51,490
used all the methods

121
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:52,550
recorded in the medical books.

122
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:54,730
She was treated for a month,

123
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,720
and finally survived.

124
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:57,830
As for this matter,

125
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,200
all the servants

126
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:00,960
and maids can testify.

127
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:02,660
What exactly

128
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:04,090
hurt her heart?

129
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:05,910
This wound is very strange.

130
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:07,590
It's not caused by an ordinary weapon.

131
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:09,690
But it can reach the heart.

132
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:11,310
I've been a doctor for many years,

133
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:13,230
but I've never seen such wound.

134
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:15,480
Could it be

135
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:17,870
she stabbed her heart with a twinned branch

136
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,670
to sacrifice her life to save me?

137
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:20,950
But if so,

138
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:23,270
why is she still alive?

139
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:25,390
What is the scar

140
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:26,910
on her arm?

141
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:48,750
What do you want?

142
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:49,770
Helian Xi.

143
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:51,860
Why don't we

144
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:53,950
have an open and honest conversation

145
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:57,520
as Young Master of Linchuan
and the Crown Prince of Shuoyun?

146
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:59,030
What do you want to talk about?

147
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:00,200
Liang Chan.

148
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:03,470
Is she Feng Yuan,
the Princess of Yongzhao State?

149
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,400
Did you slaughter

150
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,800
the royal family of Feng?

151
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,200
You want her to regain her memory.

152
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,470
Are you up to something?

153
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:09,250
Once you get what you wanted,

154
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,160
you'll kill her, right?

155
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,800
What I want to do

156
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:20,590
has nothing to do with you.

157
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:29,240
Is this your ring?

158
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:39,289
Where did you get it?

159
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:41,130
That seems to be the case.

160
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,470
All guards, listen up!

161
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:43,690
Take him!

162
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:58,430
Keep watch.

163
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,550
Almost everyone was transferred

164
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:00,790
to capture an important criminal tonight.

165
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,160
It's just a few of us left now.

166
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,080
Yes.

167
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,150
It seems that

168
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:07,490
the Crown Prince of Shuoyun
transferred everyone to

169
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:08,440
capture Helian Xi

170
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,110
as you planned.

171
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,230
Be careful!

172
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:42,240
Oh no!

173
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:20,430
Young Madam.

174
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,830
[Go to Luoyun Cliff alone to save Feng Yuan]

175
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:45,780
I never thought

176
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,240
about hurting Shuoyun people.

177
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:51,010
Have you ever thought about
hurting Liang Chan?

178
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:57,760
Stop!

179
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,790
Get lost!

180
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:04,400
Young Master, Young Madam is in trouble.

181
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:09,920
[Go to Luoyun Cliff alone to save Feng Yuan]

182
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:11,510
My lord, you are wise.

183
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:13,310
You deliberately released one tribesman.

184
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:15,310
Let him take Helian Xi's belongings

185
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:16,920
to mislead the Crown Prince

186
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:18,960
to stir up their conflicts.

187
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:21,190
Then we have an opportunity.

188
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,120
Let us go.

189
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,870
Please.

190
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:42,650
Fine.

191
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,310
Let's settle the score together.

192
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:48,860
Too bad my body double is gone.

193
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:56,430
This place was deserted

194
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:57,430
over 10 years ago.

195
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:58,830
Who would hide here?

196
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,510
It's you again!

197
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:21,400
Leave it to me.

198
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:23,190
Go save Liang Chan.

199
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:24,310
OK.

200
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,730
Take care.

201
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:46,300
You're finally awake.

202
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:48,920
My good sister.

203
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:57,990
Who are you?

204
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:00,710
Guess.

205
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,430
Guess who I am.

206
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,320
This seems to be

207
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,630
the heart of the Divine Tree

208
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:12,030
that Helian Xi showed me.

209
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:18,590
He's here.

210
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,870
Stop playing tricks.

211
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:29,910
Come out.

212
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:41,650
Helian Xi.

213
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:43,380
Feng Yuan.

214
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:24,740
I'll cut your ears if you move again.

215
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:19,890
Come out.

216
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:22,430
One more step.

217
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,540
She will die

218
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:27,370
with Shuoyun people here.

219
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:34,430
Save us! Save us!

220
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:36,400
Please save us.

221
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:48,390
Helian Xi.

222
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:50,190
Don't mind me. Save them.

223
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,460
What do you want?

224
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:01,190
What do I want?

225
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,070
I want your heart blood.

226
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:04,510
Pick it up.

227
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:05,310
No.

228
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:07,040
Don't pick it up!

229
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,530
Don't pick it up! Don't.

230
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,540
Helian Xi, don't!

231
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:18,840
Don't pick it up.

232
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:21,550
Pick it up!

233
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,580
No, Helian Xi.

234
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:25,880
No!

235
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:28,130
Don't pick it up.

236
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:29,870
Helian Xi.

237
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:37,970
No!

238
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:45,500
Helian Xi.

239
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:48,230
You're manly.

240
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,210
No.

241
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,150
No!

242
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:00,640
Is it enough?

243
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:02,940
No.

244
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:04,650
Continue.

245
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:05,710
Continue.

246
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,910
No! No!

247
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,670
No, Helian Xi!

248
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,920
You'll die! No!

249
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:15,319
No!

250
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:16,109
I still remember

251
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:17,710
the first time we met,

252
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,660
I stabbed your right shoulder.

253
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:28,550
Actually,

254
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,970
I've always regretted hurting you.

255
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,880
This time,

256
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:39,550
I repay the debt.

257
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:31,320
Yuan!

258
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,460
Yuan.

259
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,870
Yuan.

260
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:15,830
Yuan.

261
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:19,750
Yuan.

262
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:30,470
Yuan.
