Stop!

Who is in the carriage?

6
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:47,920
His Majesty is leaving the palace.

7
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,120
How dare you stop him?

8
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:50,410
His Majesty？

00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,320
Get out of the way!

10
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,340
Open the door.

00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,160
like your mother.

14
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,670
Don't speak ill of my mother.

15
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,440
Fine.

16
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:30,760
It's my fault.

17
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:33,080
I'll take you to buy

18
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,120
the most beautiful lantern

00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,560

20
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,080
Okay.

21
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:37,880
Okay.

22
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:39,170
Let's go.

23
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,810
Let's go.

He said he'd take me

27
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,520
to buy the most beautiful lantern.

28
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,880
Mom, come with us.

29
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:54,570
No.

30
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:56,840
You're an adult.

31
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,400
Don't spoil the kid's fun. Let's go.

00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,210
How weird.

39
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,039
Yeah.

00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:11,880
Maybe

41
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,480
he bought it for his wife.

42
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:29,480
It's a waste

43
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,970
to buy so many lanterns.

44
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:32,480
I have to satisfy

45
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,040
a lady's needs.

46
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,720
Why did you two come out together?

47
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:45,260
This is my first time in Yongzhao.

48
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,680
The Lantern Festival is such a grand festival.

49
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,280
So I'm here to experience it.

Your daughter is a shopaholic.

00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,580
What's wrong with you? Are you blind?

53
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,650
Don't make trouble.

54
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:19,270
His Majesty.

55
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,120
Where are you going?

56
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,650
I seemed to see His Majesty.

57
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,460
The King of Yongzhao?

58
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:36,000
Why is he

59
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:36,930
here

60
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:38,130
in civilian clothes?

61
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:47,640
The two are following him.

62
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,500

00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:50,490

00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:51,440
back to the clinic with Shi Ying.

65
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,200
I'm afraid something will happen at the Lantern Fair tonight.

66
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,010
Okay.

67
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,670
His Majesty is missing.

68
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,400
Now, everyone is here.

69
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,030
Remember,

70
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:10,920
don't let anyone go.

71
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:12,310
Yes, my lord.

72
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:34,980
Your Majesty, step back.

73
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:50,909
How dare you block my way?

74
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,290
Did my father send you here?

He's back?

79
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,410
This is not the time to talk about this.

80
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:23,210
Your Majesty, come back with us.

81
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,480

82
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:32,720
you've grown up.

83
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,420
You have your own thoughts.

84
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:37,360
You have

85
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:42,240
associated with my enemy.

86
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,360
Feng Yin,

87
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:45,020
he is your only son.

88
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,720
Won't you let him go?

89
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,930
Son?

90
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,920
Feng Yuan,

91
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,659
your father

92
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,040
taught me a lesson.

93
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,700
There is no father-son relationship in the royal family.

94
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,860
You came at the right time.

95
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,960
I don't need to bother to find you.

96
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,620

97
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:13,550
Aunt, what is that?

98
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,730
The heart of the Linchuan Divine Tree.

99
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:20,490
I

100
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,560
won't let you trample on me

101
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,330
as before.

102
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,560
You talk too much.

103
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:03,000
Aunt.

104
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:04,580

Aunt!

106
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,530
Aunt, why did you

107
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:27,920
have the same injury?

108
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:34,840
What did you do to her?

109
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:40,170
She will

110
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:42,400
hurt when I get injured?

111
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,600
Come on, Helian Xi.

112
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:51,840
Aren't you going to kill me?

113
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:54,130
What are you waiting for?

114
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,140
You can't kill him.

115
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,800
You dare not.

116
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,800
Because...

117
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,680
I knew it.

118
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,360
I was wondering

119
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:17,310
why I was able to use

120
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:19,320
the Heart of Riyao suddenly?

121
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,630
Thanks to

122
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,640
my blood relationship with you.

123
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:27,030
Our blood relationship?

124
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,960
Turns out

125
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,679
at that time…

126
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,280
Come on, Helian Xi.

127
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:41,919
Kill me.

128
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:44,039
If I hurt, she will hurt.

129
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,520
If I die, she will die, too.

130
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,920
Come on, avenge Linchuan

131
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,430

you killed a substitute.

135

Three years later,

136
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,800
you can't kill me.

137
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,110
If I were you,

138
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,050
I would have no face to return to Linchuan.

139
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:11,480

140
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:13,660
kill him!

Xi, don't worry about me.

142
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,320
Kill him!

No!

Helian Xi,

153
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:42,820
why did you stop me?

154
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:44,800
If he dies, Yuan will also die.

155
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:46,500
What are you talking about?

I can finally kill you.

160
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,590
Take them away.

I dare.

Go.

00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,000
It'll be done soon.

199
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:30,340
Hang in there.

200
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:51,110
How is Feng Yuan?

201
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:52,530
Is Aunt okay?

202
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:54,890
Don't worry.

203
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,040
These are just superficial wounds,

204
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,040
not lethal ones.

205
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:58,720
I've stopped the bleeding and applied the medicine.

206
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,330
The wounds will heal slowly.

207
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,760
-That's good. -That's good.

208
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,980
I don't know why Your Majesty left the palace,

209
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,500
but if you don't mind,

210
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:11,760
please stay in the clinic tonight.

211
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:13,740
Thank you.

212
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,200
This way, please.

213
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,250
Don't worry.

214
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:52,620
Yuan is fine.

215
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:55,410
Thank you.

216
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:11,900
What's up?

217
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:15,440
What

218
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,640
did Yuan go through?

219
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:17,960
Can you tell me?

220
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:40,490
Is your wound hurting again?

221
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:43,160
It's hot.

222
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:49,460
Hang in there.

223
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,040
Don't touch it.

224
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:58,350
Do you want some water?

225
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,080
It turns out

226
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,000
there were so many things

227
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,320
between them.

228
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:06,770
They suffered so much.

229
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,720
Yes.

230
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:09,160
I think the word "suffer"

231
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,360
can't sum up what they've been through.

232
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,170
Shi Ying,

233
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:16,760
you can't hide

234
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,930
your love for a man when you gaze at him.

235
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,650
Do you

236
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,680
love Helian Xi?

237
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,960
When I met him,

238
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,260
I didn't think so much.

239
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:43,940
Miss,

240
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,400
it's going to rain.

241
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:46,390
Looks like

242
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:48,020
there won't be any patients.

243
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:49,290
Let's take the child

244
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:50,720
back to the inner court and rest.

245
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,520
Okay.

246
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,620
She has

247
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:56,770
never cried

248
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,510
when there's thunder and lightning.

249
00:16:58,510 --> 00:16:59,380
I wonder

250
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,170
which one she is like, her mom or dad?

251
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:02,580
It's good to be bold.

252
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,400
She can be a doctor like me in the future.

253
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,920
But she's not your kid.

254
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,280
Do you want to take her as your own kid and raise her?

255
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:14,760
Got it.

256
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:16,240
I'll go pack up.

257
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,589
Let's go back to sleep.

258
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,560
Auntie Lan,

259
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,400
is it raining outside?

260
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,250
He...

261
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:28,069
He...

262
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,470
Where is she?

263
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:46,200
Who are you looking for?

264
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:53,340
Feng Yuan.

265
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:54,670
Where is she?

266
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,980
I don't know where Yuan is.

267
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,440
Why are you looking for her?

268
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,810
Yuan.

269
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,400
Where did this child come from?

270
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:17,600
I fed her

271
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,650
once an hour today.

272
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,330
It's almost

273
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,510
the same as yesterday.

274
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:36,050
You

275
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:37,740
ate so much.

276
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:39,430
Little glutton.

277
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:49,300
[Autumn Festival. Colorful threads can drive out the evil spirits]

278
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:11,020
You are her father, right?

279
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,200
It's you.
