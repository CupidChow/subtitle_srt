[14]

4
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:20,650
Young Master, are you asleep?

5
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:24,960
Young Master.

6
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,310
The one Young Madam saved,

7
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:29,150
Miss Qin Sang, wants to see you.

8
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,840
Thank you for taking me in.

9
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,920
I've been in Nanzhi Manor for a long time.

10
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,300
Sorry to bother you late at night.
I'm here to bid you farewell.

11
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,700
You have no family left.

12
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:48,000
You're a girl.

13
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,039
Where can you go?

14
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:50,080
Are you going to be able

15
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,240
to make a living?

16
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:52,940
Just take one step

17
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,020
and see how it goes.

18
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:56,700
There's always a place for me.

19
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,800
Helian Xi.

20
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,290
Can I leave Qin Sang

21
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:06,930
at Nanzhi Manor?

22
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:08,620
Yes, you can.

23
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:11,140
Young Madam.

24
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:12,590
I'm a foreigner.

25
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:15,160
There's no distinction
between foreigners and natives here.

26
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,829
Since you have nowhere to go,

27
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,910
and you're used to staying in Linchuan,

28
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:19,750
why don't you stay here

29
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:20,560
and be with

30
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,600
Young Madam?

31
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:27,820
I, Qin Sang, would like to

32
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,700
thank Young Master and Young Madam

33
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,870
for taking me in.

34
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:43,320
Yin Qiao.

35
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,760
Do you know

36
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,640
why the first pomegranate flower in May

37
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,440
should be picked up and given away?

38
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,220
In Linchuan,

39
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,630
pomegranate trees bloom three times a year.

40
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,079
Only flowers that bloom in May

41
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:54,000
bear fruits.

42
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,660
Flowers in June and July

43
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,120
only bloom but can't bear fruits.

44
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,250
These flowers are called lie flowers.

45
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,760
So,

46
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,440
young master sends you the flower in May

47
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,520
because he wants to...

48
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:12,970
Yin Qiao.

49
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,760
Can you get me

50
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,760
some tools?

51
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:16,160
Sure, Young Madam.

52
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,610
What are you going to do?

53
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,760
I can't let the flower in May

54
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,880
wither.

55
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:21,730
Let's go.

56
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,620
Young Madam.

57
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,250
What are you doing?

58
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,280
The color of pomegranate flowers
is so special.

59
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,280
The rouge made from these

60
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,400
must be pretty.

61
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,150
Can these be made into rouge?

62
00:03:44,829 --> 00:03:46,680
Qin Sang, do you want to join us?

63
00:03:47,829 --> 00:03:48,980
The rouge doesn't suit me.

64
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,840
I'd better practice swordsmanship.

65
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,650
Qin Sang.

66
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,910
You've just recovered.

67
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:53,840
You can't move too much.

68
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,950
Stop practicing.

69
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:55,910
Look.

70
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,240
I'm quite well now.

71
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:01,030
Come on.

72
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:13,660
Qin Sang.

73
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:23,920
Stop!

74
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,360
Stop!

75
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:40,680
You're back.

76
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,350
Today, you...

77
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,240
Young Madam made rouge

78
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:56,080
from the pomegranate flowers you gave her.

79
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,210
We tried it just now.

80
00:04:58,030 --> 00:04:58,710
Yes.

81
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:01,270
She even changed into beautiful new clothes.

82
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:01,870
You...

83
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:02,900
Qin Sang.

84
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:12,980
Yuan.

85
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:15,970
Do you want to go out for a walk?

86
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,440
Sure.

87
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:28,550
Young Master.

88
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:30,530
Aren't you rushing back for dinner?

89
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:32,010
You're not going to eat?

90
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,170
Wu Qing.

91
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:36,610
As Young Master's bodyguard, it's useless

92
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:38,140
for you to be skilled in martial arts.

93
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:40,360
You still need to learn to
observe others' words and expressions.

94
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,200
But Young Master said

95
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,860
he was coming back for dinner.

96
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,840
Come on.

97
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,120
Here. Here.

98
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:00,880
Yes. Go around him.

99
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,920
Push him.

100
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:03,140
That's right.

101
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,040
We won!

102
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:12,840
Young Madam.

103
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,520
Do you want to compete with me?

104
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,160
Come on.

105
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,160
Me?

106
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,680
The winner

107
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,600
is qualified to choose

108
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,920
her next competitor.

109
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,870
Come on, Young Master and Young Madam.

110
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:23,840
Okay, let's do it.

111
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,590
It's fun.

112
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,720
Please.

113
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:28,960
Come on.

114
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:29,730
Okay.

115
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:32,620
Come up.

116
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:37,550
Hold on tight.

117
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,680
Be careful.

118
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,670
Almost.

119
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,190
Young Madam is amazing.

120
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:14,670
When did you bury it?

121
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,940
I buried it when I waited for you
to come back.

122
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,500
I forgot to take it out.

123
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:20,670
Have some.

124
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:31,450
No cups.

125
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,350
No need for cups.

126
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,870
It tastes sweeter.

127
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:06,850
Unfortunately, I have no sense of taste.

128
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:08,730
I don't know what sweet is.

129
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Sweet...

130
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:12,320
Sweet is...

131
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,250
Hold this for me.

132
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:19,970
Give me your hand.

133
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,780
I saw you like pomegranates.

134
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:35,870
Pomegranate flowers.

135
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:37,000
Pomegranate fruits.

136
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,059
Pomegranate wine.

137
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:39,720
I saw this at the market.

138
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,640
So, I bought it.

139
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,000
Do you like it?

140
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,720
Yes.

141
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:47,690
Let me put it on you.

142
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,830
It's pretty.

143
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:48,280
Don't...

144
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,530
Don't drink so fast.

145
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,700
Do you want to know

146
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:03,750
what sweet is?

147
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,720
What is it?

148
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:33,710
Yuan.

149
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:39,870
It's so sweet.

150
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:45,050
Do you want to go back?

151
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:14,740
What's wrong?

152
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,280
I think I lost an earring.

153
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:19,280
I couldn't find it.

154
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,110
Don't worry.

155
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:22,950
I'll help you find it in the morning.

156
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:26,830
It's almost dawn.

157
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,150
Let me take you to meet someone.

158
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:30,380
Okay.

159
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,100
Let's go.

160
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:41,510
Come on.

161
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:45,810
I'll use tea instead of wine.

162
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,290
Thank you for saving me.

163
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,550
I didn't expect to see General Wu Jiu here.

164
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:51,020
It's a real surprise.

165
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:52,440
Your Highness, you're too kind.

166
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,540
Being loyal to the king

167
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,190
and protecting the country is my duty.

168
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:55,700
Please.

169
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:56,390
Please.

170
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:04,980
I was worried

171
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:06,840
you couldn't receive my letter for help.

172
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,270
I didn't feel at ease

173
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,880
until you wrote me back.

174
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,640
You wrote me a letter for help?

175
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,840
Didn't you

176
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,840
receive my letter

177
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:17,800
before returning to the palace

178
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,660
to resolve the unrest in Feng Yin?

179
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,060
I knew there was trouble in the palace

180
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:23,160
because your husband

181
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,360
came to Western Frontier with your hairpin

182
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,640
to look for me.

183
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,960
He told me about it.

184
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:28,640
I thought it was you

185
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,390
who let him to ask for help.

186
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,800
It was him.

187
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:35,560
He didn't want you to worry,

188
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,560
so he asked me to send a letter

189
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:39,010
to tell you the progress.

190
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,530
Before he left,

191
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,640
he gave me the key

192
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,070
to the entrance of Linchuan.

193
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:44,720
He told me to come to see you

194
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,950
as soon as the unrest was settled

195
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,320
so that you could rest assured.

196
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,660
His Majesty knew about this

197
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:49,620
and sent people

198
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,090
to escort bullion and supplies

199
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:52,420
to express his gratitude.

200
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:53,620
I see.

201
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:57,160
Although the unrest has been resolved,

202
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,320
His Majesty thought
that his grandson was young.

203
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,190
And His Highness

204
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:03,070
was Yongzhao's only prince.

205
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:06,210
So, His Majesty wasn't determined
to execute him.

206
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:08,910
He just put His Highness
in the dark cell for punishment.

207
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:10,840
Father was kind and soft-hearted.

208
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,790
There's no daylight in that dark cell.

209
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:16,710
Feng Yin can only spend
the rest of his life there.

210
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:18,560
Forget it.

211
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:21,580
It's getting late.

212
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:23,710
The soldiers and I should leave

213
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,720
and go back to Western Frontier.

214
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:27,080
You came a long way.

215
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,760
Why don't you stay for one more day

216
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,960
and depart tomorrow?

217
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:31,040
So many soldiers of Yongzhao with weapons

218
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,680
are staying here.

219
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,000
The people of Linchuan

220
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,460
can't sleep well at night.

221
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:37,520
We'd better leave early.

222
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,590
I hope

223
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:44,700
to meet you again

224
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:45,890
in the future.

225
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,680
Sorry for the haste. I didn't treat you well.

226
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,350
Linchuan welcomes you to come again.

227
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,040
General.

228
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,080
What's wrong?

229
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:13,980
It was you.

230
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:21,470
Let's go back.

231
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,440
I still have things to do.

232
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,480
You go back first.

233
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,200
Okay.

234
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:26,830
I'll wait for you at home.

235
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:34,460
Wu Qing.

236
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:37,640
Let Granny Chun

237
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,400
come to meet me under the Divine Tree.

238
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,120
Yes.

239
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,080
Young Master.

240
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,460
Why did you come to me alone

241
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,740
to implant the Twinned Branch in your body?

242
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:56,970
Young Madam...

243
00:15:58,070 --> 00:15:59,330
Before we got married,

244
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:01,040
I've been waiting with great joy

245
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,520
for her to come to Linchuan

246
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:04,110
and become my wife.

247
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:06,270
After we got married,

248
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,690
I found this marriage made her miserable.

249
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:12,170
She's always endured

250
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,950
and fought alone.

251
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:18,550
As her husband,

252
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:20,920
it's natural to protect my wife.

253
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:22,440
I just want to

254
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,670
help her more

255
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:25,390
and more.

256
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:27,740
I can do it

257
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,220
by myself.

258
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,790
In that case,

259
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:37,270
please give me the Twinned Branch.

260
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:42,820
Thank you.

261
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:53,970
You volunteer to perform the Implantation
of the Twinned Branch.

262
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:55,640
That means

263
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:56,720
you've made a promise

264
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,450
to exchange your life for hers.

265
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:00,540
If Young Madam

266
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,890
is in danger someday,

267
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:05,310
you can stick this branch

268
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,700
into your heart

269
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:09,140
in exchange for her life.

270
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:12,069
Young Master.

271
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:14,160
Please allow me to say more.

272
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,400
After all, you are the Young Master of Linchuan.

273
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,010
Your wife needs you.

274
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:20,880
The clan also needs you.

275
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:25,069
I want to ask you about this.

276
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:26,359
When I was young,

277
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:27,720
my grandpa told me

278
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,360
the Leaves Closure of the Divine Tree

279
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,690
could protect our clan.

280
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:33,000
How should we use this method?

281
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,730
You can't use the Leaves Closure

282
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:36,380
unless necessary.

283
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:38,120
Why?

284
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,710
Once the Leaves Closure is activated,

285
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:41,790
the clansmen

286
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:44,270
will be sealed in the leaves.

287
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,100
What follows

288
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,940
will be leaves falling into dust

289
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:49,950
and the Divine Tree withering away.

290
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:52,450
If the Divine Tree is withered,

291
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:54,050
how can we save the clansmen?

292
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:56,390
The Twinned Branch
between you and Young Madam

293
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:58,570
can be used to plant the Divine Tree again.

294
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:01,890
If the Divine Tree is resurrected,
the clansmen will return.

295
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:03,530
To start the Leaves Closure,

296
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:05,660
you need to take your blood marrow

297
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:08,100
from your bones as the trigger.

298
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:09,380
It's a pain

299
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:11,390
that few people can endure.

300
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,160
Are you determined

301
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,790
to use your own body

302
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,560
to start the Leaves Closure?

303
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:20,870
It's just physical pain.

304
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,280
You said that

305
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,300
my wife and my clansmen

306
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:27,200
all needed me.

307
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,220
These three acupuncture needles

308
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,240
should be stabbed

309
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,850
into three different bones

310
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:40,210
to take your blood marrow.

311
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,270
Thank you.

312
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,120
Your Highness.

313
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:54,510
Young Master of Linchuan mentioned

314
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:56,440
you were threatened by the Prince.

315
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,700
I guess

316
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,490
you have found a way to solve it.

317
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:00,910
Don't let this create a grudge

318
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:02,710
between you and Young Master.

319
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:09,620
So you already knew everything.
