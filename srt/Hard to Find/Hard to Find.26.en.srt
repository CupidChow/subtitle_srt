[Hard To Find]

00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:30,670
I, Helian Xi, am an unfilial person.

4
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,020
I'm here to apologize.

5
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:36,970
I'm afraid I can't revive the Divine Tree

6
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:39,860
and save the clan.

00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:45,380
[26]

8
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:51,140
Your Majesty. When you were a child,

9
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:52,430
you didn't like to eat.

10
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:54,270
You only liked to come to my palace

11
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:55,800
to have some chestnut cake.

12
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:56,950
Have some.

13
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:58,020
Auntie.

14
00:00:58,430 --> 00:00:59,950
Don't call me Your Majesty.

15
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:00,790
Besides, I am

16
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:01,790
a failed king.

17
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:03,190
I can only hide here

18
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:05,310
without serious ambition.

19
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:07,150
Qing is not a failed king.

20
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:10,150
Qing is a diligent,

21
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:12,230
benevolent, soft, young,

22
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:14,220
and strategic king.

23
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:15,030
You're just

24
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,010
having some temporary setbacks.

25
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,150
In this world,

26
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:20,390
Everyone is bound to have setbacks.

27
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:23,350
Auntie.

28
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:29,580
In the future,

29
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,610
if Your Majesty returns to the throne,

30
00:01:33,229 --> 00:01:34,550
you must remember to seek advice

31
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:37,170
from the wise, be aware of the wicked

32
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:39,070
and cherish the people's power.

33
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:41,310
You can't be greedy for enjoyment.

34
00:01:41,539 --> 00:01:42,870
You should stay away from

35
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:44,380
those bewitching things.

36
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:46,840
Auntie, you mean...

00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:51,990
Here.

00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:53,210
Have some.

00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:55,190
Auntie.

40
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:56,880
I'm not a child anymore.

41
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:58,410
Why do you

42
00:01:58,580 --> 00:01:59,390
always give me some food

43
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:00,750
for children?

44
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:03,670
So what? Can't adults

45
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:04,980
eat children's food?

46
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,540
Children's food is better.

47
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:08,600
Thank you, auntie.

48
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:16,990
The Double-Edged Knife?

49
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:19,450
Yes.

50
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:21,820
It is said that

51
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,190
this is the last knife made

52
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,470
by Liang Man, the most famous forger

53
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:26,070
in the Eastern Land.

54
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:28,290
Why do you have it?

55
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:30,870
I stole it from the Yongzhao Palace.

56
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:36,600
I'm just kidding.

57
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,780
Before I was born,

58
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,930
my father

59
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,380
asked Master Liang for it for me.

60
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:46,870
However,

61
00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:48,820
I was a girl.

62
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:50,890
Although my father was disappointed,

63
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:52,540
he still gave it to me.

64
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:54,180
In the Yongzhao Palace,

65
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,570
there's nothing

66
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:57,829
besides this knife

67
00:02:57,829 --> 00:02:59,110
that belongs to me.

68
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:02,280
Instead of

69
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,570
let it lay idle in my place,

70
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:05,630
how about

71
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,890

72
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:09,250
Give me?

73
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:10,110
Yes.

74
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:12,340
A sword for a hero.

75
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,920
A famous knife for my best friend.

76
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:17,460
Why do you suddenly

77
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,600
want to give me something?

78
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:22,020
If you treat me as your best friend,

79
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,670
take this knife.

80
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:25,590
Okay. Okay.

81
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:26,700
I'll take it.

82
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:38,340
What a good knife.

83
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:50,620
Why are you drinking with me

84
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:52,200
in the daylight?

85
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:53,750
So what?

86
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:56,050
Isn't drinking allowed at all times?

87
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,850
Helian Xi

88
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,300
looks very serious.

89
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,750
Actually, he can't drink.

90
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:12,450
He gets drunk on one drink.

91
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,320
I can't find anyone

92
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:15,710
when I want to drink.

93
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:17,589
Okay.

94
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:19,279
I'll drink with you.

95
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:26,530
The first drink

96
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:29,350
is to Xi Jiu, the Crown Prince of Shuoyun,

97
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,260
for saving me in a time of need.

98
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,409
Saving people’s lives

99
00:04:32,409 --> 00:04:34,750
is a matter of course.

100
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:44,950
The second drink

101
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:46,860
is to Xi Jiu,

102
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,280
the best man in the world.

103
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,480
For three years,

104
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,200
he has protected me with food and clothing,

105
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:52,909
and tolerated my willfulness

106
00:04:52,909 --> 00:04:54,740
not accepted by the world.

107
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,580
The third drink

108
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,490
is to Xi Jiu, my best friend.

109
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,160
You always stand by me through thick and thin.

110
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,150
If I have an afterlife,

111
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,780
I hope

112
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:20,300
we can still be intimate

113
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,820
and close friends.

114
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:24,720
Feng Yuan.

115
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:26,710
Did something happen to you?

116
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,480
Something big happened to me.

117
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:38,960
What happened?

118
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:41,750
Last night, I dreamed

119
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:45,320
that we had found the Twinned Branch

120
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:47,440
to let the Divine Tree revived.

121
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:48,470
When I woke up,

122
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:50,840
I felt very happy.

123
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:56,250
Good.

124
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:57,630
Good.

125
00:05:58,909 --> 00:06:00,590
When Linchuan can be revitalized,

126
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:01,310
we'll

127
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:03,440
drink together and get drunk.

128
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:05,960
Okay.

129
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:07,620
Deal.

130
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,670
Let's get drunk.

131
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:28,410

[Zhizi Clinic]

133
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,100
What is this? It's an cinnamon branch.

134
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,300
I caught a cold last time.

135
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,880
And I got a headache and a stuffy nose.

136
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,470
This was

137
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:38,070
in the medicine my mother gave me.

138
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,530
Shi Liu is so smart.

139
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:40,670
Where should we put

140
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:41,880
the cinnamon branch?

141
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:45,409
Where?

142
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:46,570
Over there.

143
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,200
Doctor.

144
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:47,909
Yes.

145
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:49,460
Shi Liu is so smart.

146
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,690
What medicine should I take?

147
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,030
No need for medicine.

148
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:54,030
There's nothing wrong

149
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:55,159
with your body.

150
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:56,840
You've thought too much.

151
00:06:56,909 --> 00:06:57,990
Go back and lie down for two or three days.

152
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:59,070
You'll get better if you don't go to work.

153
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:00,070
Thank you, Doctor Shi Ying.

154
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:00,750
Here.

155
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:05,780
Auntie Lan.

156
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,710
Close the door today.

157
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:08,700
I won't check any patients.

158
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:09,340
Okay.

159
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,360
Miss.

160
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,810
Your cousin is here.

161
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:15,280
Cousin.

162
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:18,180
When did you come back?

163
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,920
I've been here for a while.

164
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,070
What's up?

165
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:23,240
Come here.

166
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,020
Look at this.

167
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:29,530
Auntie Lan told me

168
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:31,550
you've been busy attending the clinic these days.

169
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:33,080
You didn't have time to eat.

170
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:36,610
So I made some soup

171
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,640
for you.

172
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:45,990
If they

173
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:47,130
listen to me,

174
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,190
they wouldn't have

175
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,920
to the clinic almost every day.

176
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:56,159
It's delicious.

177
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:00,790
Cousin.

178
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:01,990
Do you have

179
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:03,250
something else for me?

180
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:11,780
This is...

181
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:13,640
Shi Liu's birthday is coming.

182
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,380
I made her a dress

183
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:16,930
and sewed a handkerchief.

184
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:19,540
Okay, I'll go get her.

185
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:21,770
No need.

186
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:25,920
I have something to tell you.

187
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,080
The clothes can only be worn

188
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,590
when she is 16.

189
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,140
But I don't know

190
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:47,230
if she will

191
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:50,400
like it.

192
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,280
What is this? Smell it.

193
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:53,590
I just taught you.

194
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:00,510
Cousin, why do you...

195
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:01,950
Shi Liu is so smart.

196
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:04,340
When I was 16,

197
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,000
my auntie also

198
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:07,760
made me a new dress.

199
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:09,580
Similarly,

200
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:11,820
as the auntie of Shi Liu,

201
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,420
I should

202
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:14,720
make her a dress

203
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,350
for her 16.

204
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:20,140
Cousin.

205
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:23,000
Why are you telling me this suddenly?

206
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,690
Are you

207
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,900
here

208
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,530
to give your daughter to me?

209
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:29,980
Give?

210
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,400
Shi Liu

211
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:36,730
will always be your daughter.

212
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:38,590
Of course,

213
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:40,360
she's also my daughter.

214
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:43,400
Then why do you...

215
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:46,660
I mean

216
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:49,830
Shi Liu is our mutual daughter.

217
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:52,110
She just has two mothers.

218
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:54,770
You scared me.

219
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,800
I thought something big happened.

220
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:00,980
How about

221
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:03,340
finding a time

222
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,250
to tell Shi Liu

223
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,700
that you are her birth mother?

224
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:12,090
No hurry.

225
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,260
She's still young.

226
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:16,240
She can't understand that.

227
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:18,090
There's

228
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,540
still time.

229
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:25,540
Okay.

230
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:27,110
Come on.

231
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:29,310
Have more soup.

232
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:31,620
Let me see.

233
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:34,660
Mother. Auntie.

234
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,000
Shi Liu is here.

235
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:41,450
Look, Shi Liu.

236
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:43,430
Don't you like auntie the most?

237
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:44,680
Go and hug her.

238
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,510
- Auntie, hug me.
- Go.

239
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,240
Shi Liu.

240
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:54,630
Shi Liu.

241
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:57,110
You can call your auntie

242
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:58,430
mother.

243
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:02,620
Mother, do you want to abandon me?

244
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:04,810
Silly girl.

245
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:06,450
How could I abandon you?

246
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:10,200
That's because Auntie is the only one

247
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:11,490
who loves you very much

248
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:13,790
in this world besides me.

249
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:15,750
So,

250
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:17,400
you are luckier

251
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:18,630
than other children.

252
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:21,180
You have two mothers.

253
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:24,010
I have two mothers.

254
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:26,980
Mother.

255
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,020
Mother.

256
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:33,940
Mother.

257
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:41,800
Shi Liu.

258
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:43,230
What are you showing us?

259
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,310
Look.

260
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,170
Am I taller?

261
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,910
Yes, you are.

262
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:57,390
Mother.

263
00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:00,030
When will I grow up to be like this?

264
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,960
16.

265
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:09,330
You'll grow so tall at 16.

266
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,160
Uncle Helian told me

267
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:13,130
it was the moon that made me grow taller.

268
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:14,590
The moon is so beautiful.

269
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:17,790
But there's no moon on a rainy day.

270
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:26,270
Let me tell you.

271
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:28,250
When the sun sets,

272
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:29,980
there will be the moon.

273
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:31,850
When the moon hides,

274
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,410
there will be stars.

275
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:34,950
After the rain,

276
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:37,300
there will be a seven-coloured rainbow.

277
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:40,220
There are many

278
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,300
beautiful things in the world.

279
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,910
They are waiting for Shi Liu to grow up.

280
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,830
They are waiting for Shi Liu

281
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:48,900
to find them.

282
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:52,870
Mother, the moon is hiding.

283
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:56,820
Look, Shi Liu.

284
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:57,910
Meteorites.

285
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:01,000
Stars with long tails.

286
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:02,110
Cousin. Shi Liu.

287
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:03,260
Make a wish quickly.

288
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,730
The illusory world is like a bubble.

289
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:21,260
The unreal life makes my eyes blurred.

290
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,440
May everything in Linchuan

291
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,530
will come back to life.

292
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:29,170
May the person I love

293
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:33,030
will be safe forever.

294
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:51,340
Father.

295
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:53,200
I won't be naughty anymore.

296
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,870
Can the immortals in Heaven

297
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:55,830
let my mother

298
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:57,360
get better soon?

299
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:58,070
Yes.

300
00:13:58,090 --> 00:13:59,610
Immortals will bless

301
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:00,690
your mother.

302
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,490
[Yuan Prime Minister's Residence]

303
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:07,990
Everything is bitter.

304
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:10,310
Immortals can listen to your wishes.

305
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:13,110
Everything is bitter.

306
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:15,240
[Yuan Prime Minister's Residence]

307
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:15,630
Immortals can listen to your wishes.

308
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:49,600
[Hard]

309
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:59,040
[Hard to Find]

310
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:11,930
Young Madam.

311
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:13,450
Let's fly the sky lantern.

312
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:18,150
Miss.

313
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,750
Qin Sang.

314
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:42,150
Are you hiding something

315
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,430
from me?

316
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:47,180
Young Madam.

317
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:48,990
If someone sees the wish

318
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:50,210
written on this sky lantern,

319
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:51,130
it won't work.

320
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:54,800
Since you are so sincere,

321
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:56,150
I'll

322
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:57,790
give you my chance

323
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:58,610
to make a wish.

324
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:00,140
You can make two wishes now.

325
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,960
Don't you have any wishes?

326
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,800
My wish

327
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,520
will come true soon.

328
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:16,030
I don't need to pray to immortals anymore.

329
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:28,540
I've made a wish for you.

330
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:30,740
I wished you'll have a stable family

331
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:32,990
and members who love you more than us.

332
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:34,680
For the rest of your life,

333
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,750
you don't have to

334
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:37,020
follow us around anymore.

335
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:38,020
Young Madam.

336
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,430
I don't want any other family.

337
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:42,550
You are my family.

338
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,500
Let's go.

339
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:48,160
I'll show you around the night market.

340
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,030
Young Master.

341
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:12,810
You're here too.

342
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:15,480
Have a look.

343
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:17,060
Xi.

344
00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:19,520
Do you want to take a walk together?

345
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,319
Sure.

346
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,050
Young Master. Young Madam.

347
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,390
It occurred to me

348
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:27,650
that I have to meet a friend.

349
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:28,490
I have to go.
