1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,980
[Hard to find]

3
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,970
[4]

4
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:33,430
Qin Sang,

5
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:36,530
go and check whether the men of sacrifice

6
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:37,790
are the same as those we met in the dark alley

7
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:38,870
a few days ago.

8
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:40,430
Yes, sir.

9
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:41,860
The Crown Prince of Shuoyun

10
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:43,220
has searched for us all night.

11
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:44,270
It doesn't matter.

12
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:45,530
Let them search for us.

13
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:47,170
I can deal with them alone.

14
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,060
Yes.

15
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:53,020
Young Madam.

16
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:54,710
Miss,

17
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:56,480
don't call me like that.

18
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:03,470
I have to

19
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,340
go back to the prince's mansion today.

20
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:07,510
I told you that

21
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:09,480
you couldn't go anywhere.

22
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:11,500
I won't let you go

23
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:14,039
until I find the Twinned Branches.

24
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,280
I thought about it all night.

25
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:23,000
I believe what you said

26
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:24,120
and what I saw.

27
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:26,720
For this reason,

28
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:28,280
I can't marry Xi Jiu.

29
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:30,270
I have to give him an explanation.

30
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:30,950
After that,

31
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:32,229
I'm at your disposal,

32
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:34,470
whether it's to find the twinned trunks

33
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,030
or to atone for my mistakes.

34
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:37,250
What do you think?

35
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:43,110
Let's go.

36
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:45,940
I can go back alone.

37
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:47,630
You don't have to company me.

38
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:48,900
You saw it yesterday.

39
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,140
Those men of sacrifice came to kill you.

40
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,430
Do you think you can survive

41
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:53,970
if you go back alone?

42
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:55,979
I...

43
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,759
What's more,

44
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:00,490
before I find the Twinned Branches,

45
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:02,820
your life

46
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:04,420
belongs to me.

47
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,060
Why are there no clues?

48
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:09,919
Your Highness.

49
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:11,090
What's new?

50
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:13,140
Although we didn't find the Crown Princess in the city,

51
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:13,900
we...

52
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:25,230
That's it.

53
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,490
Your Highness,

54
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:28,630
Sheng said

55
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:29,820
they found that

56
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:31,040
half a year ago,

57
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:32,730
that guy appeared in Shuoyun.

58
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,010
He built a manor

59
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:34,820
named Nanzhi

60
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,079
on Wangyuan Mountain.

61
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,430
We're checking the manor's location,

62
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:38,630
and will find it soon.

63
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:39,870
Then what are you waiting for?

64
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:40,780
Go and search!

65
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:41,950
Yes, sir.

66
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,579
-Your Highness. -What’s wrong?

67
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:04,070
Liang Chan.

68
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:08,590
How dare you come here?

69
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:10,550
Xi Jiu,

70
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,340
he didn't do anything to me.

71
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,870
It was a misunderstanding.

72
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,970
He is the young master of Linchuan.

73
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,160
The young master of Linchuan

74
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:21,840
died three years ago.

75
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:24,660
Linchuan no longer exists.

76
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:26,600
Guards,

77
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,520
attention!

78
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,700
You are the young master of Linchuan.

79
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:36,500
You must have a way

80
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,829
to prove your identity,

81
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:38,750
right?

82
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:45,260
Ten years ago,

83
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,390
your father,

84
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,260
namely the King of your tribe,

85
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,520
was injured in a battle

86
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:52,860
and accidentally entered Linchuan.

87
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:55,590
He recuperated in Linchuan for more than a month.

88
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,110
After he recovered,

89
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:00,080
he was sent back to Shuoyun by the people of Linchuan.

90
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:01,140
I think you

91
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:03,120
know this, right?

92
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:05,160
No one

93
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:08,520
knows that my father went missing at that time.

94
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,690
How did he know?

95
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,710
Is he really...

96
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,050
Xi Jiu,

97
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:21,829
I have something to tell you.

98
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:26,190
Can you leave us alone?

99
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:35,550
Leave us alone!

100
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:36,540
Xi Jiu,

101
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:37,820
let's talk inside.

102
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,030
Let's go.

103
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:45,150
Guards,

104
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:46,260
keep an eye on him.

105
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:47,310
Yes.

106
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:52,110
Break off our engagement?

107
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:53,070
A man

108
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:54,340
who you just met three times

109
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:54,980
told you that you had married

110
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:55,840
all of a sudden.

111
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,260
Do you believe his words?

112
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:01,630
Xi Jiu,

113
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,790
I'm the cause of

114
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:11,350
the riots in the city.

115
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:13,140
I will bring disasters to Shuoyun

116
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,260
sooner or later.

117
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,290
I will find out

118
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:17,830
the cause and culprits

119
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,350
of what happened last night.

120
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:20,150
It has nothing to do

121
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:21,200
with our engagement.

122
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,660
I don't care about the past

123
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,030
that you can't let go of.

124
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:26,460
But what if

125
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,900
I am his wife?

126
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,470
I can't put

127
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:31,670
Shuoyun in danger.

128
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:32,620
Anyway,

129
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,790
I will never break off the engagement.

130
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:35,670
Xi Jiu.

131
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:36,900
Are you afraid of him?

132
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,540
I'll make it clear to him.

133
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:39,890
If he has the guts,

134
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:41,620
just come at me.

135
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:54,550
Linchuan has helped Shuoyun,

136
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,300
if you are really the young master of Linchuan,

137
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,430
I‘m over

138
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,820
what happened before.

139
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:01,500
I will repay Linchuan,

140
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,580
sooner or later.

141
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,330
But it has nothing to do with Liang Chan.

142
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:05,590
I won't break off the engagement

143
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:07,590
until Liang Chan regains her memory

144
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:09,670
and confirms your relationship.

145
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:11,450
Sheng,

146
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,300
put the sword away.

147
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,180
Guards, leave.

148
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,870
You saved me last night.

149
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:21,610
Why don't we make peace?

150
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:23,630
Please stay here.

151
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,630
and find a way together with me

152
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:26,020
to help Liang Chan regain her memory.

153
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:26,780
What do you think?

154
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:27,780
Ridiculous.

155
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,640
Living in your mansion?

156
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:32,060
Are you waiting for more killers

157
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,320
to assassinate her?

158
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,460
Only by my side

159
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,500
will she be safe.

160
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:38,560
Safe?

161
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,050
I think you are the most dangerous person.

162
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:45,820
Forget it.

163
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:46,580
I'd better

164
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:47,630
find a place to stay.

165
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:48,870
-No. -No.

166
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:54,620
Whether she is your wife or not

167
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:55,740
is not sure yet.

168
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,260
But she is

169
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,670
my fiancee.

170
00:06:59,659 --> 00:07:01,000
How can a man entrust his wife

171
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,470
to someone else?

172
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,820
In that case, how about

173
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:06,490
letting me go to your place

174
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,140
and protect her together with you?

175
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,140
What do you think?

176
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,630
Whatever.

177
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:19,970
Your Highness,

178
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:21,260
do you believe

179
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:22,260
he is

180
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:23,380
the young master of Linchuan?

181
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:24,380
With his ability,

182
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:26,400
he can make up his identity.

183
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:27,300
There is no need for him

184
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,350
to say he is the young master of a tribe that no longer exists.

185
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:31,790
If he is the young master of Linchuan,

186
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:33,010
a tribe that

187
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:34,580
has done us a favor,

188
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:35,430
and

189
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:36,490
the Crown Princess

190
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,830
is his wife,

191
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,080
Your Highness,

192
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,300
you will

193
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,080
be in an awkward position.

194
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,030
You just

195
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,590
talk nonsense

196
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:45,780
when I need you to say something

197
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:46,550
but rub it in

198
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,010
when you should be silent.

199
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,140
Go and check

200
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:49,659
whether Dong Li has got

201
00:07:49,659 --> 00:07:50,860
my luggage prepared.

202
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:51,950
I'll go now.

203
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:13,610
Wait.

204
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:16,750
Helian Xi,

205
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:18,500
I'm patient with you

206
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,010
because Liang Chan has to regain her memory

207
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:21,370
with your help.

208
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,700
Don't push your luck.

209
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,220
If you really want to

210
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,770
help her regain her memory,

211
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:27,780
you can use

212
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:28,910
the secret planchette writing skill

213
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:30,000
of the Shuoyun royal family.

214
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,990
I heard that by using this skill,

215
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:32,250
you could know the past

216
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,549
and the future.

217
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,059
It's a secret magic art.

218
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,020
Only the Kings

219
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,179
of Shuoyun

220
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:39,590
know how to use it.

221
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,130
It can only be used once in a lifetime.

222
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:43,990
If I knew how to use this magic art,

223
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,550
I don't need your guidance.

224
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,660
Only the Kings of Shuoyun know how to use it?

225
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:50,760
Your Highness,

226
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:53,810
I heard that it's cold on Wangyue Mountain.

227
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:54,550
Let me prepare more clothes

228
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:55,940
for you.

229
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:56,670
Dong li,

230
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:57,380
you've prepared a lot of clothes

231
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:58,510
for me.

232
00:08:58,990 --> 00:08:59,750
His Highness insisted on

233
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:00,840
going to the Nanzhi Mannor with us.

234
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,500
Prepare more clothes for him.

235
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,780
There's one more thing

236
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:05,140
I want to confirm with you.

237
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,480
Confirm with me?

238
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:07,870
Do you think

239
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:09,310
I'm your servant?

240
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:18,500
Are you going to

241
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,740
fight again?

242
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,160
Liang Chan, don't worry.

243
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:23,140
I promised you

244
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:24,950
as long as he didn't hurt you,

245
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,800
I wouldn't fight with him.

246
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:27,980
In that case,

247
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:31,030
why don't you think about

248
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:32,180
who the hell

249
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:34,110
she has

250
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:35,260
got a problem with.

251
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:36,980
Liang Chan is gentle

252
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:37,880
and kind to people.

253
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,610
She doesn't usually go out.

254
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,180
Besides, I'm doting on her.

255
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,800
Who dares to take revenge on her?

256
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,360
I'm afraid

257
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:44,870
you are

258
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:46,660
the only enemy she has.

259
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,510
Then who

260
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:50,170
tried to kill her all the time?

261
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:51,820
Don't bother.

262
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:53,030
I've sent someone

263
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:54,720
to find out the background of those killers.

264
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,060
What can your men find out?

265
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:56,910
Your men

266
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,120
may not find anything either.

267
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,370
I've seen

268
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:04,180
the face of the killer

269
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,780
that didn't intend to kill me

270
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,350
in the alley.

271
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,980
I can draw what he looks like.

272
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,290
Stop arguing,

273
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,130
okay?

274
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,970
Your Highness, bad news!

275
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,260
His Majesty came back.

276
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,500
No big deal.

277
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,940
Why are you making a fuss?

278
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:18,800
Your Highness,

279
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:19,540
His Majesty wants you

280
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:21,230
to see him right away.

281
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,050
Otherwise...

282
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:23,910
Got it.

283
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:25,150
Bring all the weapons

284
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:25,920
in my mansion

285
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:27,540
to Wangyue Mountain.

286
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:29,620
Helian Xi,

287
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:30,940
I need one room

288
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:31,870
for the weapons,

289
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:33,140
one room to sleep in

290
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:35,650
and another one to handle official affairs.

291
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:39,540
Sir,

292
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,470
since you don't want

293
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:41,730
to be Shuoyun's enemy,

294
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,580
please give us

295
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,710
your address on Wangyue Mountain.

296
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:52,260
My lord, why that man

297
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,660
moved so fast

298
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:54,940
like a phantom?

299
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:57,540
It was indeed the power of the Tree's heart.

300
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:00,460
If I can get it,

301
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,860
I can have the same power

302
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,910
as Helian Xi.

303
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:06,820
Should I find another chance to

304
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:09,070
kill the Princess?

305
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:11,520
No hurry.

306
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:14,740
I used to think that girl

307
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,920
was an eyesore.

308
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:18,960
But after so many things happened,

309
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:21,190
now I think she is interesting.

310
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:23,340
Go and catch some people of the Shuoyun tribe

311
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,620
who have a Linchuan bloodline.

312
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:28,370
Maybe their blood

313
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:30,180
can open the Tree's heart.

314
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,110
Yes.

315
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:44,190
When did you return?

316
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:46,630
You unfilial son!

317
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:48,010
How dare you dodge?

318
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:49,430
During my absence,

319
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,150
did you try to stir up the world?

320
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:52,470
Why do you say so?

321
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,870
You wanted to marry a foreign girl

322
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:55,830
of unknown origin

323
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:57,140
and even wanted to give her

324
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,150
the Planchette.

325
00:11:58,340 --> 00:11:59,460
Isn't it the Shuyun's wedding custom

326
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:00,180
to give the most precious thing

327
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:01,620
to the people we love?

328
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,700
You will die one day.

329
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:04,740
Why don't you give me

330
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:05,870
the Planchette now?

331
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:06,830
Nonsense!

332
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:18,900
The planchette writing skill is a forbidden magic art

333
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,660
used by our ancestors to tell fortunes.

334
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:21,340
Every King of Shuoyun

335
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,900
could use it once in a lifetime.

336
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,070
As the Crown Prince of Shuoyun

337
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:24,660
how could you use it

338
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,780
for a woman?

339
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:27,240
She

340
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,620
is my wife.

341
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:31,110
The Kings of Shuoyun followed the mandate of heaven

342
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:31,990
and refused to

343
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:33,260
to tell the fortunes of our tribe by using this magic art.

344
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:34,950
Then there is nothing wrong

345
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:35,860
with me using it for my wife.

346
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:37,220
Is she your wife?

347
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,230
Your wedding

348
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:39,790
caused such a big disturbance.

349
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:41,390
I'm not going to blame her.

350
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:43,310
It's destiny that you two didn't get married.

351
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:44,580
From now on,

352
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:45,750
your engagement

353
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,780
is off the table.

354
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:47,900
Why?

355
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,180
I will find out

356
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,820
the cause of the disturbance on our wedding day.

357
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,410
Then we can pick an auspicious day

358
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:54,090
to hold the wedding ceremony.

359
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:57,420
Son,

360
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,490
I can tolerate you once

361
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:02,590
but never again!

362
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:04,250
If you break off the engagement now,

363
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,850
I'll spare your punishment.

364
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,290
You can punish me however you want.

365
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:09,020
I will never break off the engagement.

366
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:09,830
Sheng,

367
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:11,490
put him in jail.

368
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:12,660
Your Majesty, His Highness is...

369
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,460
Do you want to go to jail with him?

370
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,890
You don't have to let someone to detain me.

371
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,880
I'll go to jail by myself.

372
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,310
Your Highness...

373
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:24,030
I have wasted

374
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:25,350
a whole day for you.

375
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,260
Do you know that your mission is to...

376
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:29,040
My mission is to find the Twinned Branches.

377
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:29,830
I know.

378
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,070
Good.

379
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:32,340
But I promised Xi Jiu

380
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:33,310
to wait for him.

381
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,070
He was suddenly summoned by the King.

382
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:35,540
It’s very likely

383
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:37,350
related to what happened on the wedding day.

384
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:38,230
How can I just

385
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,550
leave like this?

386
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,820
What does it have to do with you?

387
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:44,260
Helian Xi,

388
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,550
do I just have to

389
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:46,740
keep my promise to you

390
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,390
but not to others?

391
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,260
Should I only be responsible

392
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,800
for the affairs of Linchuan?

393
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,590
Should I ignore

394
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:54,310
the disturbance caused by me in Shuoyun

395
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:55,260
and

396
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:56,580
stay out of this?

397
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:03,990
Stop saying

398
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,320
high-sounding words.

399
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,510
You were not like this

400
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:08,660
before.

401
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,450
Rest early.

402
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:12,840
Helian Xi.

403
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,820
She is the sinner

404
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:28,170
who caused the destruction of Linchuan.

405
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:30,390
But she lost her memory now.

406
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,780
How can I get the information

407
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:34,640
of the Twinned Branches from her?

408
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,720
Young Master.

409
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,620
What's the matter?

410
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:50,230
I saw pomegranates

411
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,650
at the market of Shuoyun.

412
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:54,400
Give it to me.

413
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,120
Anything else?

414
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:07,750
I...

415
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:10,980
Can I

416
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,660
give her one?

417
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:16,460
After all,

418
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,660
she saved you once.

419
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:19,470
Give her one if you want.

420
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:23,030
Thank you, sir.

421
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:24,710
Qin Sang,

422
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,140
what do you

423
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,260
think of her?

424
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,200
I know nothing

425
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:42,140
about the destruction of the Linchuan tribe.

426
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:42,890
As a foreigner,

427
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:44,620
I have no right to comment on it.

428
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,830
But in my eyes,

429
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,790
Young Madam is not a wicked person.

430
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:20,890
Helian Xi, are you there?

431
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:23,430
I want to borrow something from you.

432
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:34,690
Where is he?

433
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:36,690
Young Madam,

434
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:37,790
you are here.

435
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:38,910
Miss Qin Sang,

436
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,340
you came at the right time.

437
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,240
I want a brush, paper, some ink, and an inkstone.

438
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:42,970
Can I?

439
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,190
Sure.

440
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:45,920
I'll send those things to you later.

441
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,670
Thank you.

442
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,760
Young Madam,

443
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:52,140
I...

444
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:55,460
Do you have something to ask me?

445
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:01,610
Please take the pomegranate.

446
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,540
It's okay if you don't want it.

447
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,910
How could you

448
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,819
take back the gift given to me?

449
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:18,700
Let me break it for you,

450
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:19,760
it's easier to eat.

451
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:22,589
Take this half.

452
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:27,950
You can eat it like this.

453
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,180
Young Madam, that's what you taught me.

454
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,070
I forgot

455
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,900
that you can't remember the past

456
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:44,190
or me.

457
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:54,690
Almost.

458
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:56,420
Let me try again.

459
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,600
Look at me.

460
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:11,210
Like this.

461
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,600
Pomegranate, try it.

462
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:28,400
Eat it like this.

463
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:37,170
Just chew it like this?

464
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,300
There is another way to eat it.

465
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:59,030
Try it.

466
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,650
Come on.

467
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:01,880
Try it.

468
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,800
Here you are.

469
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,860
Turns out you have your failures

470
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:24,890
Let me try again.

471
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,080
I'll definitely succeed this time.
