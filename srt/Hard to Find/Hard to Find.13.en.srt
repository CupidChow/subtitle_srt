00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,480
[Hard to Find]

3
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:30,470
[13]

4
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:35,590
Oh no!

5
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:38,490
Something happened to the Divine Tree.

6
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,400
Your Highness,

7
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,240
you are one of the Yongzhao.

8
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:01,060
Why put your life at risk

9
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:02,660
for a darn tree in Linchuan?

10
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:10,910
I will kill you!

11
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,100
It's raining!

12
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:41,780
It's raining!

13
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:46,050
-Young Madam.
-Young Madam.

14
00:01:46,289 --> 00:01:47,890
-Young Madam.
-Young Madam.

15
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:49,210
Damn it!

16
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:50,970
-Young Madam.
-Young Madam.

17
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,600
Young Madam, I'll be gentler.

18
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:32,570
It's okay.

19
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:36,630
It's almost summer.

20
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:38,680
A lot of lightning means a lot of fires.

21
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,960
Fortunately, you noticed it in time.

22
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,670
Young Madam,

23
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,210
you sent Hua'e back,

24
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:48,860
but Young Master hasn't come back yet.

25
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:49,900
From now on,

26
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:50,900
I am your hands.

27
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,079
I'll bring food to your mouth.

28
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:52,880
I can bathe you

29
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,260
and give you a scratch.

30
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,470
-Granny Chun.
-Young Madam.

31
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:04,310
Young Madam! Young Madam!

32
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,810
Granny Chun! Young Madam!

33
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:06,670
I'll go take a look.

34
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:08,330
Looks like people are coming.

35
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:09,650
I'll go with you.

36
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:14,340
Young Madam! Young Madam!

37
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:15,570
-Granny Chun.
-Coming.

38
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:16,340
They're out.

39
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:19,770
Yin Qiao.

40
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:21,520
Apply this medicine to Young Madam.

41
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,810
It won't leave a scar. I guarantee.

42
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:23,600
Granny Chun.

43
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:25,240
I heard that Young Madam likes this.

44
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,420
I have plenty at home.

45
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:27,970
If it's not enough, I'll bring some more.

46
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:28,670
Thank you.

47
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:30,920
And this.

48
00:03:31,329 --> 00:03:32,280
Take it, Granny Chun.

49
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,000
This...

50
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:36,200
Take them all.

51
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,560
Okay.

52
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:39,020
Take it, Granny Chun.

53
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:40,720
Thank you.

54
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:41,890
-Take it.
-Young Madam.

55
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:43,410
Take care!

56
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:45,260
We'll visit you again!

57
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:53,720
At the regular pace,

58
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:54,990
General Wu Jiu should have

59
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:56,320
come back to the palace.

60
00:03:56,329 --> 00:03:57,870
If everything goes well,

61
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:59,210
I'll receive his letter

62
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:00,610
in a while.

63
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:30,910
Yongzhao's cavalry?

64
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:44,990
Granny Chun.

65
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,540
How is this girl?

66
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:48,170
She's badly injured.

67
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:49,570
Although I've tried my best

68
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:51,210
to preserve her dying breath,

69
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:52,940
I'm afraid she won't last long.

70
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:08,380
Granny Chun, can it save her?

71
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:13,010
Young Madam.

72
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:15,730
Why do you have the Amber of the Divine Tree?

73
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:17,990
Young Master gave it to me before he left.

74
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,930
If you are in danger

75
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,800
and your life is at stake,

76
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:28,550
you can use the item in the box.

77
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:38,310
Granny Chun.

78
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:39,710
Did she make it?

79
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:41,320
Don't worry, Young Madam.

80
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:43,720
She will wake up in a couple of days.

81
00:05:46,409 --> 00:05:47,470
Well, that's good.

82
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:57,430
I wonder

83
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:58,600
if there will be a postman

84
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,060
to deliver a letter today?

85
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:04,810
Young Madam, here you are.

86
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:05,730
What's wrong?

87
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:07,060
Is there a letter for me?

88
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,910
The girl you brought back is awake.

89
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:11,620
Okay, I'll go check on her.

90
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:20,090
Thank you for saving my life, Young Madam.

91
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,220
Get up.

92
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,910
You haven't fully recovered.

93
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:27,040
You were in Yongzhao's military uniform.

94
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:28,830
Are you from Yongzhao?

95
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:31,450
I didn't expect

96
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:32,460
to meet

97
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,480
a fellow townsman.

98
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,740
Are you also from Yongzhao, Young Madam?

99
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:38,480
I'm the Princess of Yongzhao.

100
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,340
I just got married and moved here.

101
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:41,909
Without a local guide,

102
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:42,760
it's hard for people from other tribes

103
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,400
to enter Linchuan.

104
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:45,870
You're a girl.

105
00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:47,250
How did you come to Linchuan

106
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,580
in that military uniform covered in wounds?

107
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:50,760
His Highness wants to build

108
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,920
his own army.

109
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,710
All men, young and old,

110
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:55,370
are all taken to join the army.

111
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:57,420
My father and brother died on the battlefield.

112
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,320
I only have

113
00:06:58,350 --> 00:06:59,730
a 12-year-old brother at home.

114
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:01,720
I learned martial arts from my big brother.

115
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,660
I planned to

116
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:03,640
dress up as a man

117
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:05,350
to join the army for my little brother.

118
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:06,830
But we are recruited

119
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,040
to kill each other.

120
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:09,740
Why did you do that?

121
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,050
I heard that the purpose of His Highness's army

122
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:13,070
was to stop

123
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,300
the return of General Protector Wu Jiu.

124
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,500
The two armies fought.

125
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,430
His Highness was defeated and retreated.

126
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:20,240
We went south

127
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,800
for, I don't know, how long.

128
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:23,910
I only remember falling into a river,

129
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:25,730
and when I woke up, I was here.

130
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,170
Could it be

131
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,280
that General Wu Jiu has solved everything?

132
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:34,460
Young Madam!

133
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:37,580
Young Madam, there is a letter for you.

134
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:45,909
[I've suppressed the civil unrest and saved the King and the Queen.]

135
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:54,740
Qin Sang!

136
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:55,860
Thank you!

137
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:57,750
Thank you for coming to Linchuan.

138
00:07:58,170 --> 00:07:59,970
Yin Qiao, thank you!

139
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:01,860
General Wu Jiu replied to me.

140
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:04,100
All the problems have been solved!

141
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:07,180
Are you leaving?

142
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:09,190
You haven't fully recovered yet.

143
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:10,590
Thanks to your help

144
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,010
and the good care of Yin Qiao.

145
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:13,270
I'm fine now.

146
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:14,690
It's time to say goodbye.

147
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:20,670
I only have this jade bracelet.

148
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:21,770
It's not worth much.

149
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:23,770
I can only express my gratitude through it.

150
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:25,630
Thank you for saving my life!

151
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,990
I can't accept this.

152
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:31,700
The person who really saved you is the Young Master.

153
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,280
If he hadn't left the Amber to me,

154
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,030
all I could do

155
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:34,570
would be bring you back

156
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:35,919
from the river.

157
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,870
Young Madam, just take...

158
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:39,809
Take it back.

159
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:52,820
Yin Qiao told me

160
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:54,110
that the Young Master went on a long trip,

161
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:55,280
yet he still asked her

162
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,210
to bring flowers for you every day.

163
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,260
I think

164
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:00,130
that the Young Master must be a good person.

165
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:01,010
Yes.

166
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:02,970
He's a very good person.

167
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:06,130
I hope I can

168
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,680
thank him face-to-face.

169
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:12,810
Young Madam, these are today's flowers.

170
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:14,140
Should I bring them to your room?

171
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:14,720
Give it to me.

172
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,870
I'll take it myself.

173
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:29,620
Yin Qiao.

174
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:31,990
When will the Young Master come back?

175
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:33,450
It should be soon.

176
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:39,640
Young Madam.

177
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:44,540
Qin Sang, didn't you say

178
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,200
that you wanted to thank the Young Master in person?

179
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,110
Don't go.

180
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:48,390
Wait for him with me.

181
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:49,470
He is...

182
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,120
a very, very good person.

183
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:56,150
Okay.

184
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:20,290
Please bloom.

185
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:22,230
When you bloom,

186
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:23,540
he will come back.

187
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:40,790
Yin Qiao.

188
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:41,520
Didn't you say

189
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,000
that the Young Master was on his way back?

190
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,330
Will he arrive tonight?

191
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:54,260
Arrive today?

192
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:55,990
Arrive tomorrow?

193
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,480
Today?

194
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:02,650
Tomorrow?

195
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:08,600
Forget it.

196
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,960
Just wait.

197
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:11,760
He'll be back tomorrow.

198
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,100
Young Madam!

199
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,350
Young Madam!

200
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:17,700
Young Madam, Young Master is back!

201
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:25,080
Where is Young Master now?

202
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,050
Almost at the riverbank.

203
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:27,220
I'll go get him!

204
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:09,420
I wonder

205
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:10,140
if she has received the letter

206
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,260
from Wu Jiu or not.

207
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:13,790
She will only rest assured

208
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:16,090
when she sees the letter.

209
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:16,970
You ordered

210
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,150
all the postmen from the tribes

211
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:19,820
not to stay at each post.

212
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:20,570
I suppose

213
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:23,610
the Young Madam received the letter several days ago.

214
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:24,400
I wonder

215
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,930
how she is now.

216
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:46,040
Young Master.

217
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:47,320
There seems to be someone

218
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,120
waving at us from the riverbank.

219
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:54,910
Feng Yuan?

220
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:59,120
Seems to be the Young Madam.

221
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:01,520
Why is she coming?

222
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:09,690
Helian Xi.

223
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:11,480
You...

224
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,570
What did you call me?

225
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,390
Helian Xi.

226
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,160
You came to me in such a hurry.

227
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,620
Is there something wrong?

228
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:32,690
I heard you'd come back today.

229
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:34,030
I was very happy,

230
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:35,640
so I came to pick you up.

231
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,980
Young Madam, why are you here?

232
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,790
She came to pick me up.

233
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:56,410
I also have something to tell you.

234
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,090
I won't go back to Yongzhao.

235
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:00,230
I want to live in Linchuan

236
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:01,470
forever.

237
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,520
Let's go home.

238
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,090
Well...

239
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:34,620
What happened so suddenly?

240
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:35,630
Young Master.

241
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:36,910
Don't just stand there.

242
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,710
Young Madam wants you to go home.

243
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,720
Okay.

244
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,000
Let's go home.

245
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:03,720
What's wrong?

246
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,720
Pomegranate flowers are blooming.

247
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,810
It didn't bloom when I went to pick you up.

248
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:09,740
It bloomed as soon as you came back.

249
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,380
I promised,

250
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:14,290
"When the pomegranates bloom,

251
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:15,200
I'll be back."

252
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:18,490
Young Master.

253
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:54,000
Why snap it?

254
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,870
There is a custom in Linchuan.

255
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:57,890
The first pomegranate flower in May

256
00:15:58,390 --> 00:15:59,740
is meant to be a gift.

257
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,430
I see.

258
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,210
Go back to your room.

259
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,090
Young Master, Young Madam.

260
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:47,000
Rest early!

261
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:06,359
I heard

262
00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:07,359
that a few days ago,

263
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,930
the Divine Tree was struck by lightning and caught fire.

264
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:11,400
You got hurt to save it.

265
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,660
How are you doing now?

266
00:17:13,609 --> 00:17:14,569
I'm fine.

267
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:16,250
Just some flesh wounds.

268
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:17,810
They're already healed.

269
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:22,810
Is there a scar?

270
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:25,050
If there is a scar,

271
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:27,690
there are some prescriptions for scars in the tribe.

272
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:28,890
I'll get them for you.

273
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:32,210
Don't worry. There's no scar.

274
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:35,660
Well,

275
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:38,330
rest early.

276
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:41,090
Okay.

277
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:46,490
Helian Xi.

278
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:48,990
What's wrong?

279
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,570
I like the flowers

280
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:54,450
you sent me very much.

281
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:56,090
As long as you like it.

282
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,480
Well,

283
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:05,050
I'm going to bed.

284
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:07,890
Wait.

285
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:39,850
I don't know

286
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,890
when the pedal fell on my head.
