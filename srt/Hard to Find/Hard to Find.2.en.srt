[Episode 2]

4
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,760
Don't touch him.

5
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:35,380
Don't think I dare not kill you.

6
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,060
Liang Chan.

7
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:43,440
How are you, Liang Chan?

8
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,300
What did you call her?

9
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,920
Her name is not for you to ask.

10
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:48,060
Xi Jiu. Don't.

11
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:51,800
Go.

12
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,760
Liang Chan?

13
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:55,690
Your Highness.

14
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:01,650
Your Highness.

15
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:02,930
Please leave with the Crown Princess first.

16
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:03,860
Leave this to me.

17
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:07,070
I want him alive.

18
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:09,530
Catch him!

19
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:18,180
Where is he?

20
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,580
Liang Chan?

21
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:33,310
Crown Princess?

22
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:36,500
Did I really get it wrong?

23
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:39,750
Young Master.

24
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,080
Have you found out

25
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,270
who drew that painting?

26
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:44,000
The Crown Princess of Shuoyun.

27
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:46,009
But how could the Crown Princess of Shuoyun

28
00:01:46,009 --> 00:01:47,690
see the Linchuan Divine Tree?

29
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:55,560
My lord.

30
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,070
I'm incompetent.

31
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,350
I didn't have time to confirm

32
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:00,010
if that woman is the Princess.

33
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,590
No need to confirm.

34
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,730
If you think she looks similar,

35
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:05,200
just do it.

36
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,590
But that woman

37
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:09,070
seems to be the future

38
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:10,639
Crown Princess of Shuoyun.

39
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,980
So what?

40
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,830
I ended up like this

41
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:16,620
because

42
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:18,100
I fell into her trap.

43
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,540
Better to kill a thousand by mistake

44
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,210
than let one go.

45
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:24,360
Do you understand?

46
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,740
Yes.

47
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:27,150
By the way,

48
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,260
my lord,

49
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:30,360
I saw

50
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:32,410
that person tonight.

51
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:38,100
That person?

52
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,950
Impressive, the Crown Princess of Shuoyun.

53
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:27,840
Yuan.

54
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,280
Your Highness.

55
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:42,160
Sheng wants to see you.

56
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:43,530
Got it.

57
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,060
Go and prepare the medicine.

58
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,280
I'll feed her when it's ready.

59
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:46,990
Yes.

60
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:54,620
The guards searched all night

61
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:55,710
but found nothing?

62
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:56,310
Yes.

63
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,320
What happened after I left

64
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,220
with the Crown Princess?

65
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,930
Right after you left with the Crown Princess,

66
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:01,630
the guards and I

67
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:02,460
drew our swords suddenly

68
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:03,590
and surrounded him.

69
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:05,090
But then, like a gust of wind,

70
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:06,790
he swiftly passed by us in a woosh.

71
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:08,920
And the torches on me and the guards...

72
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,950
What are you talking about?

73
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:12,530
Get rid of all the useless parts.

74
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:14,180
Say it again and get to the point.

75
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,190
Your Highness.

76
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:17,019
What I said is the point.

77
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:18,110
Your Highness.

78
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:19,910
Dong Li.

79
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,680
Do you understand what he said?

80
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:23,760
Sheng said

81
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:24,870
that man

82
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,010
disappeared?

83
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:28,620
Disappeared.

84
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,240
Just disappeared

85
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,170
right under the eyes of the guards.

86
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:34,590
Sheng.

87
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:36,500
Block the news

88
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:38,240
to avoid causing panic.

89
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,240
Okay.

90
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,150
Besides,

91
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:41,550
increase the number

92
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:42,750
of guards these days.

93
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:44,120
Report to me immediately

94
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,460
if there's any unusual activity in the city.

95
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:46,420
It must not affect...

96
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,020
The safety of Shuoyun tribe.

97
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,040
my wedding.

98
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:08,100
No.

99
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:13,890
Watch out, Xi Jiu!

100
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:42,550
You're awake.

101
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:02,980
You hid it so well.

102
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:05,290
Feng Yuan.

103
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:06,990
It's you again.

104
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,630
How did you come in?

105
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,780
It's as easy as flipping my hand

106
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:14,800
to enter the Shuoyun

107
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:17,830
Crown Prince's Mansion.

108
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:26,780
Did you draw this?

109
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,570
Why do you have it?

110
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:31,090
So you did draw it.

111
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,900
If Liang Chan takes the medicine and doesn't wake up,

112
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,210
go get the witch doctor.

113
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:48,920
Don't worry, Your Highness.

114
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,780
The Crown Princess is blessed.

115
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,520
Xi Jiu.

116
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,820
Liang Chan.

117
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,360
Your Highness.

118
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:14,010
It's that man last night.

119
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:14,690
Let's go.

120
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:19,460
Let go of me.

121
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,210
Put me down.

122
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:28,630
Who are you?

123
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:29,730
Put me down!

124
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,720
Young Master.

125
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,520
Don't come in without my order.

126
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:33,940
Put me down!

127
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,710
Who are you?

128
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,790
Why did you kidnap me here?

129
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:47,830
Stop pretending.

130
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:50,450
Hand over the Twinned Branch.

131
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:04,800
Don't come over.

132
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,250
Do you really think a hairpin

133
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,510
can hurt me?

134
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,040
Give me back the Twinned Branch.

135
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:16,260
I don't even know who I am,

136
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,090
let alone what

137
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,300
the Twinned Branch you want me

138
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,260
to hand over is.

139
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,840
If you come any closer,

140
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,520
I'll kill myself.

141
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,250
If I die,

142
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,090
you won't get anything.

143
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:41,280
Your pretentious face

144
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,210
hasn't changed at all.

145
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,440
Give me the Twinned Branch.

146
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,470
Do you hear me?

147
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,070
I don't know anything

148
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:05,280
about the Twinned Branch.

149
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:08,670
Even if you die,

150
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,900
you can only die in my hands.

151
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,910
Who are you?

152
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:17,960
Who am I?

153
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:27,610
I'm the ghost

154
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:31,870
under your blade.

155
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:53,640
All guards, listen up.

156
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,070
Search every corner.

157
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:57,010
Anyone who dare to disturb the merchants

158
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:57,810
and the people

159
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:58,920
will get fifty lashes.

160
00:09:58,920 --> 00:09:59,630
-Yes.
-Yes.

161
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:00,660
The rest of you

162
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:02,820
follow me to the outskirts.

163
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,280
Young Master.

164
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,500
The woman you brought back

165
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:24,200
is the Crown Princess of Shuoyun?

166
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,060
Qin Sang.

167
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:25,700
Investigate

168
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,880
the background, identity,

169
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,930
and relationships of this Shuoyun

170
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:29,050
Crown Princess thoroughly.

171
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:30,040
Don't miss anything.

172
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:30,670
Yes.

173
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:31,540
Besides,

174
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:33,300
someone tried to kill her

175
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,810
in the market last night.

176
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:35,580
Check

177
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:36,980
the identity of the dead.

178
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:38,790
Whether it was a common robber

179
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:39,990
or someone else?

180
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:42,540
Understood. I'm on my way.

181
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:47,260
I want to see

182
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:50,010
how long you're going to pretend.

183
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:20,170
Come here.

184
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:30,050
Do you want me to invite you?

185
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,190
Crown Princess of Shuoyun.

186
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:50,110
This is the rouge you used before.

187
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:52,580
Made from pomegranate flowers in May.

188
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:55,300
Do you recognize it?

189
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:58,860
No.

190
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,070
Sit over there.

191
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:11,950
Sit.

192
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,530
What do you want?

193
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:23,670
Don't move.

194
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:40,870
Three years ago,

195
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:42,950
it wasn't like this.

196
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:45,510
What are you talking about?

197
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,030
You haven't worn earrings

198
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:52,960
for the past three years, have you?

199
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:54,050
No.

200
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:06,240
Take a good look at yourself.

201
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,010
You're not even a member of

202
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:09,240
the Shuoyun tribe.

203
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,200
Think carefully about who you are,

204
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,340
who I am,

205
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,900
and where the Twinned Branch is.

206
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,340
It's best if you can remember.

207
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,320
What do you...

208
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:22,950
What do you want?

209
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:25,850
Don't worry.

210
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,340
I won't let you die

211
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,500
so easily.

212
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,940
Your Highness.

213
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:43,170
Something happened.

214
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,610
Have you found Liang Chan?

215
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:45,330
No.

216
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:47,100
A merchant told us

217
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,110
that there's a girl

218
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:49,800
who seems to be investigating the Crown Princess'...

219
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,000
Investigating what?

220
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,880
Identity and background?

221
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:53,430
Yes.

222
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:55,500
Who is this girl and where is she?

223
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:56,580
I've sent someone to follow her.

224
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,630
Let's go meet her.

225
00:13:57,690 --> 00:13:58,150
Okay.

226
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:13,310
Young Master, I've confirmed it.

227
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:15,020
The Crown Princess of Shuoyun

228
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,040
arrived in Shuoyun

229
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,040
three years ago.

230
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,340
For the past three years,

231
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,850
she has been searching for

232
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:21,600
information about the Twinned Tree.

233
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,320
Maybe she lost her memory.

234
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:27,240
I heard that the Shuoyun Crown Prince and Crown Princess

235
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,970
are getting married tomorrow.

236
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:33,780
I've been looking for her for three years,

237
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,200
but she lost her memory

238
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,060
and became

239
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:39,880
the Crown Princess of Shuoyun.

240
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,120
Young Master.

241
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:42,990
What's the relationship between

242
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:43,940
this Shuoyun Crown Princess

243
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:45,020
and our Linchuan Divine Tree?

244
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:47,540
Only she knows where the other Twinned Branch

245
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:49,510
that we are looking for is.

246
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:52,230
So she is...

247
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,300
Get up.

248
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:17,430
Your wound needs treatment.

249
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,070
Don't touch me.

250
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,900
You can't die yet.

251
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:43,500
Apply the medicine.

252
00:15:58,010 --> 00:15:59,840
Do you remember something?

253
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:02,140
What do you think I can remember?

254
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:04,230
What do you want me to remember?

255
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:06,100
Since the first time I saw you,

256
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,290
you either tried to kill me

257
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,740
or brought me here by force.

258
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:14,140
Who are you exactly?

259
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,140
What do you really want?

260
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:18,150
It's been three years.

261
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:19,250
I still haven't remembered

262
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,130
anything.

263
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:23,140
But what does it have to do with you?

264
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,140
Don't

265
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,650
you want to know

266
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:33,590
what our relationship is?

267
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:46,370
I don't care who I was before

268
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,680
and what past we had.

269
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:53,540
Right now,

270
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:55,370
I just want to leave this place

271
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:57,860
and stay away from you.

272
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:16,210
Go.

273
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:22,079
Go?

274
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:52,530
Why?

275
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:59,180
Why am I the only one

276
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,750
who remembers?

277
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:24,790
Your Highness, please don't worry.

278
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:25,580
There will soon be news

279
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:26,720
from the Qingyang Forest.

280
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,380
We will definitely

281
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,780
find the Crown Princess.

282
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:30,020
Liang Chan.

283
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:31,350
Wait for me.

284
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:34,390
Miss.

285
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:35,950
Miss, are you okay?

286
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:36,910
Do you need help?

287
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,450
No.

288
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:39,360
Thank you.

289
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:42,440
What’s wrong with that girl?

290
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,810
Liang Chan.

291
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,480
Xi Jiu.

292
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:49,440
It's okay.

293
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,030
I'll take you back.

294
00:19:58,780 --> 00:19:59,640
Your Highness.

295
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:01,530
I've asked someone to prepare a carriage.

296
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:02,330
No need.
