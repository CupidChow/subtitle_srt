00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:43,670
Xi said

3
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:44,710
that he would bring Yuan back,

4
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:46,370
so he will definitely make it.

5
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:48,000
Come and eat something.

6
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:49,870
Thank you, Miss Shi Ying.

7
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:53,230
Your Highness,

8
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:54,490
please eat something.

9
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:55,960
No.

10
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,410
I must go to the palace and see.

11
00:00:59,070 --> 00:00:59,750
In case something happens,

12
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:00,350
and Helian Xi can't handle them,

13
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:01,390
I can help.

14
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:02,530
Your Highness.

15
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:03,960
That's the Yongzhao Palace.

16
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,430
You really shouldn't go there.

17
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:06,360
Back in Shuoyun,

18
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:07,920
when you and Ms. Feng Yuan got married,

19
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,000
so many men of sacrifice suddenly appeared on the street.

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,430
All the guards were mobilized,

21
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:12,230
but they couldn't compare to Helian Xi

22
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:12,950
alone.

23
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:14,870
You were beaten so badly that...

24
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:19,789
You and Yuan?

25
00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:21,039
Getting married?

26
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,940
There are some little stories

27
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,010
between your cousin and me.

28
00:01:33,789 --> 00:01:34,600
We guards...

29
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,950
are quite strong.

30
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:37,759
It's just that...

31
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:39,930
we were caught off guard at that time.

32
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:46,150
Feng Yuan?

33
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:47,680
You are back!

34
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,120
Yuan!

35
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,229
Helian Xi.

36
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,000
What happened?

37
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,840
I'll tell you later.

38
00:01:58,509 --> 00:01:59,310
Yuan,

39
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:00,640
are you injured?

40
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:01,630
Let me take a look.

41
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:02,430
Shi Ying.

42
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:04,040
We're fine.

43
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,100
Could you please boil some hot water,

44
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:08,750
and give Yuan a bath later?

45
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,280
Sure, I'll do that now.

46
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:15,310
I'm glad you're not hurt.

47
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,520
Auntie, you're back.

48
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,560
I have candied haws for you to eat.

49
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:33,920
It's okay.

50
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,390
Shi Liu didn't see it.

51
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:36,360
Xi Jiu.

52
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:37,800
Stop Shi Liu for me.

53
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,840
So your name is Shi Liu, right?

54
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:43,840
Yes.

55
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,750
Sir, who are you?

56
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:46,960
Who am I?

57
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,800
Take a guess.

58
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,840
I can't guess.

59
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,030
You can't?

60
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:55,310
My name is Xi Jiu.

61
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,190
You can call me Uncle Xi Jiu.

62
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,870
Yuan,

63
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:03,590
your hands can draw,

64
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,240
sew clothes for Shi Liu,

65
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:08,800
and do anything,

66
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,570
but they should never be used for killing.

67
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,210
Don't let them be stained with blood anymore.

68
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,400
I'm sorry.

69
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,480
I was going to discuss

70
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,120
going to the palace with you.

71
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:23,670
But you weren't here,

72
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,840
so I...

73
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:25,870
I know.

74
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,800
You went to the palace to use yourself

75
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,930
to lure Feng Yin out,

76
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,960
retrieve the Tree's heart sooner,

77
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,890
and revive the Divine Tree, right?

78
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,710
It was all my fault.

79
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:43,120
It was all because I was so obsessed

80
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,870
with finding that hairpin.

81
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,560
Was it the hairpin

82
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,870
you made me draw?

83
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,560
I saw a scene

84
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:54,850
in the Planchette of the King.

85
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,680
With the planchette writing skill,

86
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,750
one can comprehend

87
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:03,030
both the past and the future.

88
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:04,630
Although it was just a scene,

89
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,360
it indeed showed

90
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:10,010
that the Divine Tree had sprouted again.

91
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,680
But the revived Divine Tree

92
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,360
was set on fire by a woman.

93
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:17,630
If what the Planchette showed comes true...

94
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:18,430
So,

95
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,399
I have to find the woman with the hairpin

96
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,350
before Feng Yin returns.

97
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:26,560
Since she can find the Divine Tree,

98
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:27,680
she must have a great connection

99
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,070
with it.

100
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:30,920
Perhaps,

101
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:32,390
we can find clues

102
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:35,200
to revive the Divine Tree through her.

103
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,270
Unfortunately,

104
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:38,950
my plan failed.

105
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,780
Not only did it make you worry,

106
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:44,560
but it also failed to lure Feng Yin out.

107
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:49,310
Your plan

108
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:51,110
has already succeeded halfway.

109
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,950
Yun Mu will appear.

110
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:56,010
Feng Yin must have returned to Yongzhao.

111
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,310
Trust me.

112
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,830
With his ambition,

113
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,980
he will soon return to the palace.

114
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,870
By then,

115
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,400
I will be able to retrieve the Tree's heart.

116
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:23,390
Hua'e.

117
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:27,690
Your Highness,

118
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,070
you're finally back.

119
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,190
I knew it.

120
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:13,360
How could the Highness I know,

121
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,240
who's far-sighted,

122
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,160
be killed by Helian Xi?

123
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,240
The one he killed here last time

124
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:23,600
was just my stand-in.

125
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,240
Why do I feel that

126
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,360
you seem different

127
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,310
this time you're back?

128
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,360
I guess

129
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,490
you obtained the Linchuan Divine Tree's heart.

130
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:42,680
From my father,

131
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:44,640
I have only learned one thing.

132
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,870
What is it?

133
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:52,360
The throne is just power.

134
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,680
It won't take long

135
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,280
to pull someone down from it.

136
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:57,270
So, only when I possess

137
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,950
both divine power and political power

138
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,720
can I do as I please

139
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:04,870
on this throne.

140
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,240
But now,

141
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,040
this throne

142
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:13,830
belongs to your son, Feng Qing.

143
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,560
He even conspired with that girl, Feng Yuan,

144
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,680
in killing Yun Mu.

145
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:24,600
Feng Qing?

146
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:27,310
So what if he's my son?

147
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,600
In the future,

148
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,070
only I can do as I please

149
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:33,510
on this throne.

150
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:36,510
Of course.

151
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:38,510
Only you

152
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:40,430
are the sole king

153
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:42,800
of Yongzhao.

154
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:46,310
I don't care who sits on the throne

155
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,800
between you and your son.

156
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:50,510
As long as I can be the queen.

157
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:06,950
Shi Liu.

158
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:07,750
Uncle Xi Jiu

159
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:08,680
can make it fly.

160
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:09,600
Look.

161
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,390
It can fly! I want to play it too.

162
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,160
Go ahead.

163
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:14,950
Your Uncle Xi Jiu

164
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:16,120
is going to see your auntie first.

165
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,190
I'll make you something fun tomorrow,

166
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:17,870
okay?

167
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:19,190
Okay.

168
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,830
I'll get out of the way. You go first.

169
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:33,360
No need, I'll change my way.

170
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,880
Mom!

171
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:09,870
This is to save you.

172
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,630
Don't hit me.

173
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,780
I didn't ask you to save me.

174
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,040
What's wrong with me saving you?

175
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:25,510
Shi Liu?

176
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,630
Shi Liu.

177
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:30,030
What's wrong, Shi Liu?

178
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,240
Uncle Xi Jiu, come here.

179
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:36,030
I have a question for you.

180
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,240
What is it?

181
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,600
Are you my dad?

182
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,270
Me?

183
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,440
Your dad?

184
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,000
Shi Liu.

185
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,320
Xi Jiu,

186
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:00,670
you want to see me?

187
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,320
Helian Xi.

188
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,720
Poor Shi Liu.

189
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,600
She doesn't even know

190
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,860
who her real father is.

191
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,000
How could

192
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:10,200
there be

193
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,670
such an irresponsible man?

194
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:12,440
He doesn't even want

195
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,770
such a lovely daughter.

196
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,840
Helian Xi,

197
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:18,360
do you know

198
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:20,000
who Shi Liu's real father

199
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,960
is?

200
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:22,630
I do.

201
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:26,120
It's me.

202
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:30,360
You?

203
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:32,550
You and Shi Ying...

204
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,100
What are you thinking?

205
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:34,750
Shi Liu

206
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,280
is me and Feng Yuan's child.

207
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,750
Shi Ying

208
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,960
has been taking care of her for the past 3 years.

209
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,910
You and Feng Yuan

210
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,870
actually have a child?

211
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:04,840
Yuan.

212
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,670
You scared me when you came back last night.

213
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:08,030
Fortunately, you're fine,

214
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:09,440
just a bit weak.

215
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:10,960
Don't worry.

216
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,390
It's just my old problem.

217
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:13,320
I'm really fine.

218
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,270
Feng Yuan,

219
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,050
you've been in Shuoyun for 3 years,

220
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:18,480
But I still haven't been able to

221
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,140
help you recover your health.

222
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:22,320
Just because Shuoyun's doctors can't heal her

223
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,520
doesn't mean I can't.

224
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:24,630
You can.

225
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:26,920
What you're best at is arguing with me.

226
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:27,840
You...

227
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,370
Haven't you just met each other for a few days?

228
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,370
How come you're so familiar with each other already?

229
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:47,270
Yuan,

230
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,620
I'll go and decoct some medicine for you.

231
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:51,080
Feng Yuan,

232
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:52,240
I didn't expect

233
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,320
Shi Liu to be you

234
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,480
and Xi's daughter.

235
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:56,790
Well, it's for the best.

236
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:57,630
The three of you

237
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:58,890
are finally reunited.

238
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,670
Yun Mu is father's trusted aide.

239
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,360
He appeared.

240
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,960
Could it be true what Aunt said,

241
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,880
that father didn't actually die back then?

242
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,320
Your Majesty.

243
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,470
You haven't slept yet?

244
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,160
I've said it before,

245
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,600
no one is allowed to enter here

246
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,660
without my orders.

247
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,600
I'm here

248
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:15,470
to bring you a piece of good news.

249
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,440
It turns out that the one killed

250
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,790
by the Young Master of Linchuan

251
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:23,990
in the hall back then was your stand-in.

252
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:27,030
Father, when did you return to the palace?

253
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:29,440
I returned to Yongzhao a few days ago.

254
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:31,550
It wasn't convenient for me to enter the palace.

255
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:32,870
I intended for Yun Mu

256
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:35,630
to enter the palace first to send you a message.

257
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,840
Then he died.

258
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:46,960
It turns out Yun Mu

259
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:49,390
came to deliver a message for you.

260
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:50,990
I thought he was an assassin,

261
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:52,750
so I got rid of him.

262
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:56,970
It doesn't matter.

263
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,150
He's dead, so be it.

264
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:03,440
He was just a dog.

265
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,840
Your Highness, you've been hiding outside for 3 years.

266
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,440
You must have suffered a lot.

267
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,920
Now that you've returned to the palace,

268
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:20,230
what are your plans?

269
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:21,510
I'm already a dead man

270
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:23,270
in public.

271
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:26,910
Of course, I can't stay in the palace for too long,

272
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,720
right?

273
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:33,910
In a few days,

274
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:36,510
when the senior officials of the court return,

275
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:37,270
I...

276
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,260
will publicly reveal your identity.

277
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,480
Qing.

278
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:50,560
Is my throne comfortable to sit on?

279
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,150
Thank you,

280
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,240
for the last 3 years.

281
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:10,090
It has been 3 years.

282
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,720
I have grown up.

283
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:13,150
I'm supposed to take on

284
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:15,120
the responsibilities of being in this position.

285
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,030
Is that so?

286
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,120
Your Majesty,

287
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,080
the Commander of the Imperial Guard suddenly passed away

288
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,150
a while ago.

289
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:44,790
What?

290
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:51,440
He acted so quickly.

291
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:53,550
Eunuch Mo,

292
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,910
find a way to leave the palace immediately

293
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:58,120
and deliver a message for me.

294
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,030
Look.

295
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:06,910
Mom,

296
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:09,480
the little rabbit doesn't have eyes yet.

297
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,030
Well, how about we...

298
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:14,910
How about you

299
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:16,710
draw eyes for the little rabbit?

300
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:17,720
No.

301
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:19,440
Auntie is good at drawing.

302
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:21,390
I want to leave it to Auntie to draw.

303
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:22,150
How did you know

304
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:23,630
Auntie is good at drawing?

305
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,000
Do you often play with Auntie?

306
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:27,910
Auntie likes me.

307
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,960
I like Auntie too.

308
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,910
Then I must draw eyes for it.

309
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:38,630
The eye of the rabbits drawn by Mom

310
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,440
is so ugly!

311
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:42,960
What? It's not ugly.

312
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:46,000
Shi Liu.

313
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:48,440
Why did you make Shi Liu cry?

314
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,600
Doctor Shi Ying,

315
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:52,080
if you're not good at something,

316
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,740
don't force yourself to do it.

317
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:55,440
Shi Liu,

318
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,030
let me draw the other eye

319
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:58,240
for the little rabbit for you,

320
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,080
okay?

321
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:00,510
I'm really good at

322
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:01,750
drawing.

323
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:15,160
There you go. Take a look.

324
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:22,589
It seems like

325
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,560
this pen isn't quite suitable for drawing.

326
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:27,550
Shi Liu.

327
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:29,590
Comfort her.

328
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:31,960
Don't cry, Shi Liu.

329
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,030
Here's the thing.

330
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:34,960
The eyes of this little rabbit are sick.

331
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,550
Let me treat it, okay?

332
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,480
Yes.

333
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,270
Look.

334
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:42,550
This way,

335
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:44,070
we can help the little rabbit

336
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:45,590
heal its eyes.

337
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,570
Let's bandage it up.

338
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:48,680
Look.

339
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:51,480
There you go.

340
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:56,160
Other people's little rabbits

341
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,440
have big eyes.

342
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:01,590
My little rabbit

343
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,350
is blind!

344
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:10,070
Don't cry.

345
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,350
Shi Liu.

346
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,080
Let me figure out a solution.

347
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:15,070
There's an old lady from a jewelry shop

348
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:16,720
who said she recognized the style of that hairpin.

349
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,440
It was customized by a geisha

350
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,960
from a dance hall decades ago.

351
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,590
But as for the name of that geisha,

352
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:21,920
she couldn't remember.

353
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,200
A geisha from decades ago?

354
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,510
But the figure of the woman who burned the Divine Tree

355
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:30,510
doesn't seem old.

356
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:33,000
Young Master,

357
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:33,640
shall I go inquire more

358
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,790
at the dance hall?

359
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:36,680
Okay.

360
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:38,510
Could that hairpin

361
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,110
be a family heirloom?

362
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:46,680
Young Madam.

363
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,720
Didn't you plan to give Shi Liu

364
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,880
the rabbit lantern?

365
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:54,750
Why did you bring it back?

366
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,440
Shi Ying already made one

367
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,310
for Shi Liu.

368
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,160
I'll take you to give it to her.

369
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,510
You've spent so much effort on it.

370
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:12,240
Shi Liu should know

371
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,240
your love for her.

372
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,030
Don't go.

373
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,740
She's just a child.

374
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,690
She doesn't need two lanterns.

375
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,530
You've already made it.

376
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:24,790
It would be a waste

377
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:26,720
to leave it in the house.

378
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,550
Why don't we

379
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:28,960
take it

380
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,370
to celebrate the festival together instead?

381
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,960
Alright, let's go together.

382
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,240
Why hasn't Eunuch Mo returned yet

383
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,900
from delivering the message?

384
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:53,590
Your Majesty!

385
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:55,070
Bad news, Your Majesty!

386
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,550
What's the matter with such panic?

387
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:57,480
Eunuch Mo...

388
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,840
He's dead!

389
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,480
What?

390
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,090
If I continue to stay in the palace,

391
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,790
I'll end up like Aunt

392
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,640
and Grandfather.

393
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,750
I have to do something.
