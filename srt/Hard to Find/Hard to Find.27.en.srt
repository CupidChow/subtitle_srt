1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:32,530
I didn't expect

3
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:34,520
you to come and fly the sky lantern.

4
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,150
Before, I didn't understand

5
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:37,710
why people worshiped gods.

6
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:39,750
Now I understand.

7
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:41,670
Why?

8
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,320
A lot of things

9
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,110
haven't worked out for a long time.

10
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,720
Perhaps it's not because of lack of effort,

11
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:52,640
but the timing is not right,

12
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,180
and the key hasn't been unlocked.

13
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:58,150
Flying lanterns and praying for blessings

14
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,070
is just convincing oneself

15
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:02,750
to wait a little longer.

16
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:07,440
What's wrong?

17
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:09,350
The way

18
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:11,400
you speak now makes you sound like

19
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,280
an old man in his twilight years.

20
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,390
If you really become an old man,

21
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:18,110
wouldn't you look like this?

22
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,789
If I become an old man,

23
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,150
you would be an old lady.

24
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,400
Flowers for sale.

25
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,870
Flowers for sale.

26
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:30,760
Sir,

27
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,759
buy a flower for the lady.

28
00:01:34,039 --> 00:01:34,870
Okay.

29
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:37,200
Grandpa Xi.

30
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:40,350
Let me buy it for you.

31
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,350
Thank you, Grandma Yuan.

32
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,920
I'll buy all these flowers.

33
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,350
From today onwards, please send a flower to

34
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:55,200
Zhizi Clinic

35
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:56,590
every three days.

36
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:58,590
OK. Thank you, Granny Yuan.

37
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:05,760
Why did you suddenly want to

38
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,920
buy so many flowers?

39
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,840
I learned it from you.

40
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:09,840
You used to

41
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,710
give me a lot of flowers

42
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,150
to make me happy.

43
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,710
I also want everyone to be happy.

44
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,800
If Xi Jiu could learn from you

45
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,430
or me,

46
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:23,280
he wouldn't have been beaten by Shi Ying every day.

47
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,280
He hasn't confessed

48
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,680
his feelings to Ying yet?

49
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,079
I think he's afraid that

50
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:30,030
not only will he be rejected by Shi Ying,

51
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:31,960
but he will also be beaten up by her.

52
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,360
Xi.

53
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,400
Instead of

54
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,240
waiting for new hope here,

55
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,540
why don't we go to Linchuan again?

56
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:48,630
Maybe

57
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,030
there are still Twinned Branches in Linchuan.

58
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:53,310
People say that miracles can happen in desperate situations.

59
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:54,190
Perhaps

60
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:55,760
the most unlikely place

61
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,240
hides the last hope.

62
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:58,630
But Linchuan has been silent

63
00:02:58,630 --> 00:02:59,910
since three years ago.

64
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,880
If there were Twinned Branches,

65
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:05,040
they would have been discovered long ago.

66
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
We have no hope of

67
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,630
finding them in Yongzhao either.

68
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:09,870
Instead of wasting time,

69
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:11,800
let's go to Linchuan again and see.

70
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,710
Maybe Granny Chun has put

71
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,240
the Twinned Branches in some hidden place.

72
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:18,150
But your body...

73
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,150
Shi Ying spends so much

74
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,360
effort every day

75
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:22,870
to take care of my health.

76
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:24,470
Don't you

77
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:26,360
believe in her medical skills?

78
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,190
Fine.

79
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,710
We'll set off tomorrow.

80
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,680
OK.

81
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,030
Why isn't it my turn yet?

82
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:53,840
Gentlemen, please calm down.

83
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,280
Today, our young lady will choose her spouse.

84
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,590
Once the marriage is settled,

85
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:59,450
we will set a date for the wedding.

86
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:00,400
Alright.

87
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,150
Usually, she doesn't show

88
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:03,470
such a pleasant demeanor during consultations.

89
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:04,360
But when it comes to choosing a husband,

90
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,680
she seems very happy.

91
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,810
Ying, your medical skills are superb,

92
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,900
and I am knowledgeable and talented.

93
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,360
Only I am worthy of you,

94
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:18,560
and only you are worthy of me.

95
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,510
I agree.

96
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,079
I won't bother you then.

97
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,600
I’ll wait for your good news.

98
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,390
OK.

99
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,310
Auntie Lan, next one.

100
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:39,750
Mr...

101
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:41,510
What are you doing here?

102
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:42,600
This is a clinic.

103
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:45,000
Of course I'm here to see a doctor.

104
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,560
We're not seeing patients today.

105
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,159
Please go to another clinic.

106
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:49,430
Auntie Lan.

107
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:04,440
What do you want?

108
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:06,000
I have something to ask you.

109
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,430
Are there any suitable suitors

110
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:09,030
among those two-legged men?

111
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:11,120
Not yet.

112
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:15,110
But I can continue to search.

113
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,240
I have high standards for a husband.

114
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:18,680
Then...

115
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:21,120
Then raise your standards even higher.

116
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,180
Include me as well.

117
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,070
You?

118
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:27,070
What's wrong with me?

119
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,140
I'm also a two-legged man.

120
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,990
You don't have a fever.

121
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:39,820
Why are you talking nonsense?

122
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,630
What nonsense?

123
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:43,430
Do you not believe

124
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:45,030
that I have feelings for you?

125
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:47,240
You...

126
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:49,480
Besides having a bad temper

127
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:51,560
and hitting people hard,

128
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,560
everything else about you is great.

129
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,790
I have a bad temper?

130
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:58,310
No, no.

131
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:00,120
It's not like that.

132
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,830
You're straightforward,

133
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:04,430
honest,

134
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:06,240
and sincere.

135
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,790
I don't know when

136
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,240
I started to be

137
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,040
attracted to you.

138
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:15,480
You

139
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,000
do have a good taste.

140
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:18,830
Let me think about it.

141
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,040
What are you thinking about?

142
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:21,750
Shi Ying,

143
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,120
let's go find your cousin

144
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,160
and Helian Xi.

145
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:25,190
You can learn more about me

146
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:26,390
through them.

147
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:30,070
Do I really need them to understand you?

148
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,600
They left early this morning

149
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,060
and returned to Linchuan.

150
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:36,280
Why did they suddenly return to Linchuan?

151
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,750
I don't know.

152
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,060
Speaking of which,

153
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,150
have you noticed that

154
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:44,950
your cousin has been acting strange

155
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:46,270
these past few days?

156
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,310
She suddenly said some

157
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:48,640
ambiguous things to me.

158
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,920
Now that you mention it,

159
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,240
it does seem that way.

160
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,680
She specially made a dress

161
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,480
for Shi Liu's sixteenth birthday.

162
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,560
What is she trying to do?

163
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,630
You've been waiting a long time.

164
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,390
I finally understand

165
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:21,240
the meaning behind

166
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:24,190
my lucky survival.

167
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:26,120
Yuan.

168
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,830
Go back.

169
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,370
There can't be Twinned Branches here.

170
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,460
The miasma is too strong. We can't stay too long.

171
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,600
Xi.

172
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,140
I want to look a little longer.

173
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:40,070
Can you

174
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:42,070
help me get my veil

175
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:43,560
to block the miasma?

176
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,040
Okay.

177
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:49,950
I'll be back soon.

178
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,390
Xi.

179
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,810
I know where the Twinned Branches are.

180
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,040
You do?

181
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,270
Yuan.

182
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,320
What are you doing?

183
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:49,390
This is

184
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,830
where the Twinned Branches last

185
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:53,150
disappeared.

186
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,440
They can only

187
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:59,120
be here.

188
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:39,480
Found it.

189
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:23,000
Didn't you promise me

190
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:24,790
you wouldn't hurt yourself

191
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:25,960
to hurt Feng Yin?

192
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,310
Why?

193
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,840
Why did you do that?

194
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,390
I'm sorry.

195
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,360
I broke my promise

196
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
and made the decision on my own.

197
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,270
But I know the Twinned Branches

198
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,390
are in my heart.

199
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,200
You couldn't

200
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,240
make the choice.

201
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:51,750
So

202
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,270
I had to

203
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,720
give you the Twinned Branches.

204
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:57,360
No.

205
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:59,360
No, I don't want it.

206
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,270
I don't want it.

207
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,440
I don't want it!

208
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:05,870
Put it back!

209
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:08,960
Put it back.

210
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,630
I don't want it.

211
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,600
I want you to live!

212
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:16,390
I want you to live.

213
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,200
Xi.

214
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:20,320
Yuan.

215
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,200
Don't...

216
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,600
Don't be sad.

217
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,960
Don't be sad.

218
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,750
I want you to live.

219
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,600
My life has been

220
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,080
very happy.

221
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:33,190
-I have you,
-Yuan.

222
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,790
our daughter, and friends.

223
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,720
I've been very happy.

224
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,790
Yuan, no.

225
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,910
Only if Linchuan revives,

226
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:47,600
and you are no longer sad,

227
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,390
will I

228
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,240
be happier.

229
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,720
I'll take you back to find Shi Ying.

230
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,980
Shi Ying will save you.

231
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,080
No. No.

232
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:56,320
Xi. Xi.

233
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:57,630
Xi.

234
00:11:58,630 --> 00:11:59,870
You...

235
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:00,910
You...

236
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:03,440
You must be happy.

237
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:05,390
Be happy.

238
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,870
I'll love you

239
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,440
in my next life.

240
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,480
I want you to live.

241
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,120
Yuan.

242
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:16,990
I want you to live.

243
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,600
Xi.

244
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:25,950
Look.

245
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,200
The Divine Tree

246
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,270
is sprouting.

247
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,550
Yuan.

248
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Yuan.

249
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,790
Yuan.

250
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,360
Yuan.

251
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,480
Yuan!

252
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,550
Yuan.

253
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,440
Yuan!

254
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,390
Yuan.

255
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:32,750
It seems the rumor in the palace is true.

256
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:34,240
His Majesty

257
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,270
must really be possessed.

258
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:37,720
Quiet.

259
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:39,600
Don't let His Majesty hear you.

260
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,200
I heard

261
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,920
you have complaints against me.

262
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:59,960
We dare not speak ill of Your Majesty.

263
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,000
Guards.

264
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,360
Your Majesty. Your Majesty.

265
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,240
Your Majesty.

266
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,990
Your Majesty. What's wrong?

267
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:11,720
Your Majesty.

268
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,440
Did he get backfired?

269
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,480
He has brought the evil on himself.

270
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:22,750
How could I...

271
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:25,520
Feng Yuan.

272
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,200
It must be Feng Yuan.

273
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,080
Feng Yuan!

274
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,120
What are you doing?

275
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:36,330
Call the imperial physician!

276
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,840
This is karma, truly.

277
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,550
He deserves this for his misdeeds.

278
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,200
Look at him.

279
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,790
He won't live long.

280
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,690
He's suffering retribution.

281
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:00,960
This is karma, exactly.

282
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,360
I am the King of Yongzhao.

283
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:12,240
I have the tree's heart.

284
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:14,390
I won't die.

285
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:19,080
No one can stop me anymore.

286
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:34,550
I am the King of Yongzhao.

287
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,840
I am the King of Yongzhao.

288
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:53,480
No one can stop me anymore,

289
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,270
anymore...
