1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:27,370
[Hard To Find]

3
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:30,260
[25]

4
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:31,670
Your Highness.

5
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:32,600
Guards have sent

6
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:33,820
the thing you wanted

7
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:34,740
at top speed.

8
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,370
His Majesty also asked the guards

9
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:38,550
to send a letter to you

10
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:40,750
to give to the Young Master of Linchuan.

11
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,000
Got it.

12
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:43,580
I'll go to him later.

13
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:47,100
Your Highness.

14
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:49,260
There is...

15
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:51,750
There is one more thing.

16
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:53,580
Just say it.

17
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,260
You are a man. Why so coy?

18
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,410
Your Highness.

19
00:00:58,450 --> 00:00:59,740
I'll say it then.

20
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:00,870
Back then,

21
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:01,740
we were here

22
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:02,970
to deal with Feng Yin.

23
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,060
Now, not only can we not kill him,

24
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,800
but he is also the King of Yongzhao.

25
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,870
Actually,

26
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,840
you're not really helping here.

27
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,620
Then why don't we...

28
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:11,670
Get to the point.

29
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,190
The point is...

30
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:17,560
Could you please let me go back to Shuoyun first?

31
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,100
I heard

32
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:19,480
that while I've been away,

33
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,420
a lot of guards

34
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:21,670
have been trying to court Dong Li.

35
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:22,760
If I stayed here any longer,

36
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,840
Dong Li would be with someone else.

37
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,260
I miss her so much!

38
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:25,930
Enough.

39
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:27,120
You

40
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:29,210
go back to Shuoyun immediately.

41
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:30,020
Really?

42
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:32,970
I'll go pack up right now.

43
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:39,340
And...

44
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:40,270
What now?

45
00:01:40,289 --> 00:01:42,550
There's one last thing I need to tell you.

46
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:43,410
Recently, there has been a constant flow

47
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:44,610
of people

48
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,910
proposing marriage to Doctor Shi Ying.

49
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:47,539
If you have feelings for her,

50
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,479
don't miss the girl you love again.

51
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:18,390
It's time to return it to its rightful owner

52
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:20,230
and say goodbye.

53
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:24,630
My father sent me a letter

54
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:26,750
[To Helian Xi]

55
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:26,150
to give to you.

56
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,250
His Majesty wrote to me?

57
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,930
What you see may not be true.

58
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:37,350
What you do may become true.

59
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:41,910
What does His Majesty mean

60
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,329
by sending this letter?

61
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,620
Can't that old man

62
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:48,090
make himself clear?

63
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:52,170
By the way, Feng Yuan,

64
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:53,660
this is for you.

65
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,850
My hairpin!

66
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,830
The one who was going to marry me

67
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:05,750
was Liang Chan,

68
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:07,050
not Feng Yuan.

69
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,410
This hairpin belongs to Feng Yuan.

70
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:09,160
Now,

71
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:11,610
it's time to return it to you.

72
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,590
There was an incident that day.

73
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:16,450
I don't know

74
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,079
where I dropped the hairpin.

75
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:19,680
Fortunately, you found it.

76
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,490
This hairpin...

77
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:27,920
This hairpin

78
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:28,930
is the one

79
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:30,130
you gave me back then.

80
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:33,490
It's the Twinned Branch.

81
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,050
How come this hairpin

82
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,620
is the Twinned Branch?

83
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:40,260
I even accidentally broke it once.

84
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,180
That's right.

85
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:43,170
The hairpin I gave you

86
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:45,370
is made from the resin of the Divine Tree.

87
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:46,870
Can you remember how you repaired it

88
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:47,930
after breaking it?

89
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,500
I had no way to fix it at that time.

90
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:54,530
So, without any choice,

91
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:56,130
I asked Granny Chun for help.

92
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:00,460
No wonder the Young Master

93
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,690
came to the Divine Tree to gather resin

94
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:03,450
at 3 a.m. every day this month.

95
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:04,470
It turns out

96
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,980
he wanted to make a hairpin for you.

97
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:06,700
He...

98
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,780
He got up at 3 a.m. every day

99
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:11,500
just to make a hairpin for me?

100
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,960
Don't worry, Young Madam.

101
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,800
I will

102
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,480
fix this hairpin for you.

103
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,980
It won't break again.

104
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,880
Granny Chun must have been afraid

105
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,280
that it would break again,

106
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,870
so she snapped a Twinned Branch

107
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:24,870
and hid it inside.

108
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,130
Twinned Branch

109
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:31,860
is in it?

110
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,180
That means...

111
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:35,190
the Divine Tree can be revived?

112
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,850
Maybe we can give it a try.

113
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:39,060
Fortunately,

114
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:40,300
I had someone

115
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,420
bring it from Shuoyun.

116
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,250
In that case,

117
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:43,130
I'll go with you

118
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:44,590
to revive the Divine Tree.

119
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:00,590
Keep an eye on the clinic,

120
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:02,290
watching

121
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,650
Feng Yuan's every move.

122
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,980
If anything happens to her...

123
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:08,630
Yes.

124
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:13,740
Remember.

125
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,990
Report her every move to me immediately,

126
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:19,750
no matter what.

127
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:21,770
Got it.

128
00:05:33,409 --> 00:05:34,180
Here.

129
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:36,500
This is for you.

130
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:57,840
Thank you, Your Majesty.

131
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,480
Here.

132
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:03,970
Your medicine.

133
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:05,710
-Take it.
-Thank you.

134
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,680
Shi Ying.

135
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:20,070
I have something to tell you.

136
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,080
Come with me for a minute.

137
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,300
I'm seeing patients.

138
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,380
Say to me here if you must.

139
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,140
I...

140
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:32,640
What are you doing?

141
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,480
Shi Ying.

142
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:36,550
I...

143
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:37,580
When Helian Xi and I

144
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:38,740
go out,

145
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,990
can you not...

146
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:46,170
Can I what?

147
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:48,860
Can...

148
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:51,450
you...

149
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:53,440
Go out now.

150
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,540
All the hemming and hawing. I'm busy.

151
00:06:58,370 --> 00:06:59,300
Can you

152
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:00,370
not go to...

153
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:02,380
Yuan.

154
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,990
We have discussed

155
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,670
and decided to set off for Linchuan today.

156
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,000
Didn't we agree

157
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:10,090
to go to Linchuan together tomorrow?

158
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,560
Auntie Lan, I have to go for a moment.

159
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:15,000
Thank you, Doctor.

160
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:18,480
It's a long journey.

161
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,340
Xi Jiu and I

162
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:21,250
are enough

163
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,580
to revive the Divine Tree with the Twinned Branch.

164
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,300
Yes.

165
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:24,300
After all, Linchuan

166
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,320
is shrouded in miasma,

167
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,250
and you're weak.

168
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,890
You'd better stay here.

169
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,850
When the Divine Tree is revived,

170
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:30,940
its heart will return

171
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,340
to the two Twinned Trees.

172
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:33,659
At that time, your bond with Feng Ying

173
00:07:33,659 --> 00:07:34,790
will also be broken.

174
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:35,810
When that time comes,

175
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:37,540
I'll take you back, okay?

176
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,140
How can it be the same?

177
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:41,180
I want to witness the revival of the Divine Tree myself.

178
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:41,900
I...

179
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,830
See?

180
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:46,240
After being busy in the clinic for only half a day,

181
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,200
you start to feel weak,

182
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,440
not to mention the miasma.

183
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,870
You just stay at the clinic

184
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:50,980
with your heart in your chest.

185
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:51,770
Leave

186
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,700
this matter to me

187
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:53,659
and Helian Xi.

188
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,550
I promise nothing will go wrong.

189
00:07:58,990 --> 00:07:59,960
Okay.

190
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:01,540
There are only

191
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,400
two Twinned Branches left.

192
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:05,700
Nothing can afford to go wrong.

193
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:08,440
I'll swear with my life.

194
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:09,750

Forgive me for not being able to

say goodbye to you.
