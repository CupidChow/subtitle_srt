[Episode 1]

4
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:10,960
Listen to my order.

5
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:12,660
Don't let this person

6
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:15,120
step into the palace hall.

7
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:17,039
Kill him!

8
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:54,860
You're not my target.

9
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,280
Get lost!

10
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:02,850
Kill them!

11
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:22,910
Why is it suddenly quiet?

12
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:24,690
What happened?

13
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:26,329
What kind of person

14
00:02:26,329 --> 00:02:28,210
can break into the palace at night?

15
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:30,070
Can the Imperial Guards stop him?

16
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:30,890
Your Majesty.

17
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:33,090
The Imperial Guards will do their best.

18
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:43,079
Hurry, find someone to protect me.

19
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:43,810
Go.

20
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:45,130
Yes.

21
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,880
You're supposed to be dead.

22
00:02:58,930 --> 00:02:59,980
Die?

23
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,630
How could I die

24
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:05,230
at the hands of you scum from Yongzhao?

25
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,910
Helian Xi, listen to me.

26
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,300
I didn't kill you.

27
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:10,550
Feng Yuan killed you.

28
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:11,750
Feng Yuan?

29
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,800
Do you think I will let her go?

30
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:16,910
Go to hell!

31
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:33,880
I'll order now.

32
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:35,240
Linchuan and

33
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:37,250
Yongzhao State will be equals.

34
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,850
You are not only the young master of Linchuan,

35
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:41,000
but also the Prince of Yongzhao State.

36

Helian Xi.

37
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:09,730
The shame of past lingchi.

38
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:13,610
The Hatred of
the Annihilation of the Linchuan tribe.

39
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:14,850
I will never spare

40
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:16,930
any sinner from Yongzhao State.

41
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,890
Unworthy descendant, Helian xi,

42
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,690
comes to beg for forgiveness.

43
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:57,120
One day,

44
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:02,280
I will find another twinned trunk

45
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:03,830
to restore the Divine Tree

46
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,940
and unseal the tribe.

47
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,150
Even if I arrive at the depths
of the underworld，

48
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:14,500
I must crush

to dust.

51

Your Highness.

52
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,050
The Crown Prince asked someone

53
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:16,540
to send you a new wedding dress.

54
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:18,000
Which ones do you like?

55
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:19,250
I'll pick them out.

56
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,180
You can try them later.

57
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:22,620
I can wear

58
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:24,590
any of those wedding dresses.

59
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:26,730
I'll take it back to the room.

61
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,970
Which wedding dress does
Crown Prince like the most?

62
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:32,940
I guess

63
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:34,120
this one.

64
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:34,930
The Crown Prince

65
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:36,680
chose the silk and

66
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,360
embroidery thread in person.

67
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:39,690
I'll wear this one

68
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:41,020
on my wedding day.

69
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:41,690
Okay.

72
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:54,970
The doctor said that the Crown Princess

73
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:56,409
was lack of energy and blood yesterday.

74
00:06:56,409 --> 00:06:57,610
You hunted a deer

75
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:58,830
for her today.

76
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:00,280
Tell them now.

77
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,330
While it's fresh,

78
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:02,050
dig out the deer heart

79
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:03,580
and make soup for Liang Chan

80
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:05,850
to replenish blood.

81
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:06,810
Don't worry.

82
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:08,220
I've already told them.

83
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:09,310
Your Highness.

84
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:11,860
Which wedding dress

85
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,130
did Liang Chan choose?

86
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:14,000
Your Highness,

87
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,970
the Crown Princess chose this one.

88
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:18,290
I like this one too.

89
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,410
I knew it.

90
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:20,710
We have the same taste.

91
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:31,120
Liang Chan.

92
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:32,850
The trees you drew

93
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:34,290
are more and more vivid.

94
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:39,950
Your Highness.

95
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:43,810
You and I will become husband and wife

96
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:44,930
two days later.

97
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:46,840
Just call me Xi Jiu.

98
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:51,450
Liang Chan.

99
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:52,659
Sorry.

100
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:54,050
I've been looking for it for so long,

101
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:54,970
but I couldn't find

102
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:56,130
where the trees are.

103
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,730
What I can confirm now is

104
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:58,810
the trees weren't in the entire Shuoyun

105
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:00,090
and even the entire

106
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:01,870
northern region.

107
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:02,780
Crown...

108
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,760
Xi Jiu.

109
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,200
Do you know the eastern region?

110
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:12,320
Yongzhao State in the eastern region
has always been prosperous.

111
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,920
If there were such big trees,

112
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,500
we would know long ago.

113
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,090
As for Linchuan...

114
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,580
What's wrong with Linchuan?

115
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,840
Linchuan

116
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,650
is the most dark and mysterious place

117
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:27,110
of all the eastern tribes.

118
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:28,830
I heard that

119
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:30,450
the entire Linchuan tribe

120
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:31,940
disappeared overnight 3 years ago.

121
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:33,010
Every foreign people

122
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:34,380
who wanted to find out the truth

123
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,510
would never return.

124
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,020
Three years ago?

125
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,990
You brought me back to Shuoyun

126
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:40,190
three years ago.

127
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:41,860
I lost

128
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:43,630
all my memories 3 years ago.

129
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:45,010
For the past 3 years,

130
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:47,700
I've been dreaming of these two trees.

131
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:50,820
Are they related to my background?

132
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,930
Your name is Liang Chan.

133
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:54,330
You were born in Shuoyun.

134
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:56,050
You and I were engaged before our births

135
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:57,680
and grew up together.

136
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:59,070
That day 3 years ago,

137
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:00,490
you were chased by a beast,

138
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:02,690
dropped in a river and lost your memory.

139
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,870
That's you.

140
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:05,810
These trees

141
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,760
may exist,

142
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,640
but maybe it's just a dream.

143
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:15,670
Okay.

144
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:21,850
You've never been in good health.

145
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:23,580
Don't stay in the yard anymore.

146
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:28,080
I'll give this

147
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:29,330
to Dong Li

148
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:30,420
and ask her to sell it

149
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,450
in the market.

150
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,490
Okay.

151
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:41,340
Is the past

152
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:44,410
really important?

153
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:50,080
On the wedding day,

154
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,350
all girls in Shuoyun

155
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:53,020
will envy you.

156
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:54,200
Dong Li.

157
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:56,060
You knew

158
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:58,560
he fabricated

159
00:09:58,650 --> 00:09:59,490
my identity

160
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:00,690
to make me happy.

161
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:02,190
Your Highness.

162
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,840
What are you talking about?

163
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,090
Don't be nervous.

164
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,140
I knew it all.

165
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:11,120
One rule of the Shuoyun tribe

166
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,650
is we can't harm our bodies.

167
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:16,410
Shuoyun girls

168
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:18,210
wouldn't pierce their ears.

169
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,750
But...

170
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,440
I pierced.

171
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,490
Your Highness.

172
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:27,840
Alright.

173
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,800
Let's not talk about this.

174
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,350
Any news

175
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:33,640
about my paintings?

176
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:34,730
Not yet.

177
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:35,940
But

178
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,530
there will be Lantern Festivals these days.

179
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:39,100
So there are many merchants and tourists.

180
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,930
Maybe some customers

181
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:41,850
can recognize

182
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,870
the trees you drew.

183
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:45,090
Lantern Festival?

184
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,020
Let's go too.

185
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,390
Your Highness.

186
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:51,420
According to Shuoyun's custom,

187
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:53,620
if the woman goes out 3 days
before the wedding,

188
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,960
there'll be bad luck.

189
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:56,910
What do you want to buy?

190
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:58,490
I'll buy it for you.

191
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:00,930
It's fine.

192
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:02,250
I see.

193
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:03,880
Go and rest.

194
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,840
You're pretty

195
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:00,760
and talented.

196
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:02,020
Don't worry.

197
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:05,020
The leaf that belongs to you

198
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:07,370
will eventually fall into your hands.

199
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:08,370
Who are you?

200
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,420
Where are you?

201
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:31,410
If no one

202
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:33,470
recognizes these two trees tonight,

203
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:35,600
I'll only be Liang Chan

204
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:38,080
then

205
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:40,240
and not dig into the past.

206
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:48,880
Take it.

207
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:49,870
Be careful.

208
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:51,050
This is for the Crown Prince's wedding

209
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:52,260
to pick up his bride.

211
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:54,450
Young Master.

212
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:56,570
This is the Shuoyun tribe's place.

213
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:57,710
That painting

214
00:12:57,730 --> 00:12:58,730
was from a calligraphy and painting stall

215
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:00,300
in this market.

216
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:05,470
I'd like to see

217
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,500
who drew the Linchuan Divine Tree.

218
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,610
Landscape paintings, animal paintings.

219
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:34,700
Masterpieces. Take a look.

220
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:35,570
Boss,

221
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:37,090
I’m from the Prince’s Mansion.

222
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:37,890
May I ask

223
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:39,050
if anyone

224
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:40,530
recognizes the treeS in this painting?

225
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:42,010
Some people wanted to buy it.

226
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:42,970
But I remember

227
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:44,670
what Miss Dong Li said.

228
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:45,440
So every painting

229
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,330
will be kept here for a month

230
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:47,290
before selling.

231
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:50,210
Please close the stall later tonight.

232
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:51,510
I'll come back later.

233
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:52,230
Okay.

234
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:54,450
I'll close the stall later tonight.

235
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,670
Take her away and identify her

236
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,110
while there's chaos.

237
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:18,260
Looking for the blessings!

238
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,450
Hurry up.

239
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,740
It's time to look for the blessings.

Your Highness.

244
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:05,160
Are you asleep?

245
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:07,690
The calligraphy and painting stall...

246
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:09,730
Your Highness.

247
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:11,650
Your Highness!

248
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,570
Your Highness, Crown Princess is missing.

249
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:18,180
I can't find her anywhere.

250
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:19,650
She is missing.

251
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:49,910
I guess you two

252
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,910
just want money.

253
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:53,640
Take this purse

254
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:55,160
to buy some wine.

255
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:56,330
If it's not enough,

256
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:58,110
I'll go back and get some more.

257
00:16:58,210 --> 00:16:59,730
Remove her veil.

258
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:01,560
If she's the princess,

259
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:03,080
just kill her.

260
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:04,490
What if she's not?

261
00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:06,410
Suit yourself.

262
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:12,940

263
00:17:25,089 --> 00:17:26,770
You don't get to

264
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:29,530
remove her veil.

265
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:35,130
How could it be him?

266
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:36,450
No.

267
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:38,750
I must go back and report it to my lord.

268
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:54,020
It's you!

269
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,570

Tell me.

Where is the twinned trunk?

273
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,210
What is it?

274
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:18,010
Cut the crap.

275
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:19,940
Give it to me.

276
