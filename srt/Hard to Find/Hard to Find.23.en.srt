00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:42,560
was not at our wedding

7
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,930

After a brief alliance with

12
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:58,620
Linchuan has never intermarried with foreigners.

When our marriage was settled,

14
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:03,140
our tribe was against it.

15
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:06,650
But I came to Yongzhao secretly

16
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:09,020
to see

By chance, I stumbled into this clinic.

a girl who got hurt on the street.

29

our first encounter

how I got bonded with Feng Yin

because of the tree's heart.

with the Divine Tree before.

173
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:38,020
Maybe it was because you protected

174
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,670

175
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:41,010
Fate brought you together,

176
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:42,520
and the Divine Tree bonded with you

177
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,260
without your knowledge.

178
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,280
It was also because of the bonding

179
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,970
that the Divine Tree

180
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:49,720
protected your life

181
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,960

00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,720
the power of dedication.

Okay.

189
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,170

00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,140
Yuan, this...

197
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,650
The old scars on her back

198
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:04,000
are so strange.

199
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,540
What kind of injury is it?

200
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,250
Yuan.

201
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,250
Your wounds will be healed

202
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:15,370
after applying the medicine a couple more times.

203
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:17,030
I won't let you have any scars.

204
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:18,840
I know.

205
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,360
Our Doctor Shi Ying

206
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:21,970
has the best medical skills.

207
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,510
Feng Yuan.

208
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:40,430
Have you finished it?

209
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,950
Yes. Come in.

210
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:46,350
Shi Liu.

211
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,930
If you really care about Auntie,

212
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:49,620
just tell her.

213
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,080
She will be very happy to know.

214
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:51,790
You know?

215
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:56,790
Go.

216
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:01,210
Shi Liu.

217
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,290
Auntie, does it hurt?

218
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:06,100
Let me blow it for you.

219
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:13,690
Shi Liu.

220
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:16,240
Your mother applied medicine for me,

221
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,730
so it won't hurt anymore.

222
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,080
Shi Liu,

223
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:27,850
I want to tell you something.

224
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,280
Actually, auntie is your real...

225
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:33,570
Ying, I’m hungry.

226
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:35,190
Can you bring me some food?

227
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,300
Okay.

228
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,510
I'll get it.

229
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:54,450
My mother will definitely

230
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,680
cure you.

231
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:56,660
Yes.

232
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:58,420
Your mother

233
00:12:58,450 --> 00:12:59,840
is the best doctor.

234
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:07,190
What?

235
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,390
Feng Yuan was injured

236
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:10,570
because of

237
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:12,240
her blood relationship with Feng Yin?

238
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,170
If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes,

239
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,000
I wouldn't believe

240
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,460
such a thing could happen.

241
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:21,200
Helian Xi.

242
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,410
This time, I must go with you

243
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:23,920
to find Feng Yin and get the tree's heart.

244
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,450
Once Feng Yuan's

245
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:25,440
bond with him is broken,

246
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,790
I'll kill him immediately.

247
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:27,550
No.

248
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:30,430
I can only retrieve the tree's heart

249
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:31,830
after Feng Yin's body

250
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:33,070
has fully recovered

251
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,380
and go together.

252
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:35,580
Why?

253
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,510
Feng Yuan is just a girl.

254
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,690
Can she help you deal with Feng Yin?

255
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:46,410
Based on the extent of Feng Yin's

256
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:47,800
bond with Feng Yuan,

257
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:50,370
Feng Yin has already

258
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:52,030
merged with the tree's heart.

259
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:53,860
I'm afraid

260
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:56,560
that if I forcefully retrieve it from Feng Yin,

261
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:58,680
it will affect Yuan.

262
00:13:58,780 --> 00:13:59,740
I see.

263
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:02,050
Looks like I can't

264
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,490
be of much help again this time.

265
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,480
Since Yuan and I came to Yongzhao,

266
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:10,180
one thing after another has happened.

267
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:11,210
Thanks to you at the medical clinic

268
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:12,810
taking care of Shi Liu for us.

269
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:14,990
Thank you.

270
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,110
We are brothers.

271
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:20,370
No need to thank me.

272
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:22,190
Your daughter is my daughter.

273
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:22,800
If you need

274
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,840
any help in the future,

275
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,770
just let me know.

276
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,030
Speaking of help,

277
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:29,350
there is something

278
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:30,550
I need your help with.

279
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,170
I heard from Yuan

280
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:37,610
that you've been collecting

281
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:38,720
various hairpins for her.

282
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,630
Have you seen

283
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:40,730
this hairpin?

284
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:44,300
Uncle. Your Highness.

285
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,740
I'm here to thank you

286
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:50,830
for saving my life.

287
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,630
Your Majesty, you are the King of Yongzhao.

288
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:56,470
There's no need for you to do this.

289
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:59,270
Back then, I disregarded my grandfather's words.

290
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:01,150
As a innocent child,

291
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,980
I was soft-hearted and released my father,

292
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,310
causing a great mistake

293
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,820
and harming Linchuan.

294
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,460
Don't blame yourself.

295
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,650
It was thanks to you

296
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:12,050
that helping Yuan send Shi Liu

297
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:13,090
to the clinic

298
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,310
and saved her life.

299
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:15,190
Yeah.

300
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,930
Your father may have lost his morals

301
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:17,930
and humanity,

302
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,790
but it has nothing to do with you.

303
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:20,670
Helian Xi.

304
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:22,160
I'll keep this hairpin sketch

305
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,400
and ask Sheng to help find it.

306
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,080
OK.

307
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:26,930
Your Highness, can I take a look

308
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:28,460
at this hairpin sketch?

309
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:34,030
I seem to have

310
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,300
seen this hairpin somewhere before,

311
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,530
but I can't remember.

312
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:41,350
It's something that girls wear.

313
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:42,560
How could you have seen it

314
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,640
at such a young age?

315
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:47,290
If you've seen this hairpin,

316
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,150
it's most likely in the palace.

317
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:38,240
Your Highness.

318
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,140
Your medicine is here.

319
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:42,780
What was I doing?

320
00:16:58,620 --> 00:16:59,980
What are you looking at?

321
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:02,620
Nothing.

322
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:04,930
I just feel that

323
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,940
you're getting more and more...

324
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:10,650
More and more what?

325
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:17,960
More and more

326
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,000
similar to your sister,

327
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,510
Feng Yuan.

328
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:27,290
You're indeed siblings.

329
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,020
Alright.

330
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:34,530
You may leave.

331
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,610
Your Highness, don't forget

332
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,160
your promise to me.

333
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,120
You are the King of Yongzhao.

334
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,680
I...

335
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:46,270
am the queen of Yongzhao.

336
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:56,680
I forgot to tell you something.

337
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:58,390
Your son

338
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,300
is the current emperor after all.

339
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:02,460
Now that he's missing,

340
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:04,080
the officials

341
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,980
are not that easy to fool.

342
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,700
If you don't give an explanation,

343
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:09,840
I'm afraid

344
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,040
the royal city may fall into chaos.

345
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,560
Fine.

346
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,130
I'll give them an explanation.

347
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:24,160
Then I'll wait for the good news.

348
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:45,740
Even if your identity is true,

349
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,440
as the former Crown Prince,

350
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:48,720
you are nothing more

351
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:50,990
than the son of a lowly dancer.

352
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,320
How can the throne of King of Yongzhao

353
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,620
fall into the...

354
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,370
Anything else?

355
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:39,760
Your Majesty, please show mercy.

356
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:41,000
Please show mercy.

357
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:51,620
Young Master, Madam.

358
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,550
There has been a coup in the palace.

359
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:54,720
What's going on?

360
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,830
Feng Yin appeared at the morning court

361
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:57,200
and announced that His Majesty is seriously ill.

362
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,450
He took the abdication decree.

363
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:00,540
Some officials didn't believe it and wanted to verify the decree.

364
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:02,200
They were executed on the spot

365
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:05,360
and their bodies are hanging outside the city walls.

366
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:06,500
Young...

367
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,030
Qin Sang.

368
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,620
Don't tell

369
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,800
Qing about this yet.

370
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,490
He has suffered a lot more than

371
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,410
he should at this age

372
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:19,550
during these days.

373
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:22,140
Don't worry, Young Madam. I understand.
