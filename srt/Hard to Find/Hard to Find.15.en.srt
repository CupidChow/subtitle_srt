[Episode 15]

4
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:39,190
Xi.

5
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:43,030
Are you okay?

6
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:46,820
Why are you still up?

7
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,580
I want to wait for you.

8
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,070
What happened?

9
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:54,130
Are you okay?

10
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,220
Your birthday is coming.

11
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:08,740
I made you a hairpin

12
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:10,700
with the resin of the Divine Tree.

13
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:11,580
Look.

14
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:13,940
Why?

15
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:16,950
I almost killed you,

16
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,730
but you did so much for me.

17
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,130
You're so nice to me.

18
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:25,770
You...

19
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,840
know...

20
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,760
You know everything.

21
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:33,900
You still know

22
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,030
that I'm here to kill you.

23
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:40,940
But you...

24
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:46,940
Stop crying.

25
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:50,650
I'm fine.

26
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:58,180
Let me put it on you.

27
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:13,580
It looks good on you.

28
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:22,190
Sorry.

29
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:28,420
I'm sorry.

30
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:50,540
Xi!

31
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,030
Xi.

32
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,020
Xi.

33
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:56,340
Xi!

34
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:57,460
What's wrong?

35
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:58,990
Xi!

36
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:01,590
Granny Chun.

37
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:02,540
In order to protect

38
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:03,810
tribesmen and me,

39
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:05,090
Xi did Leaves Closure

40
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:07,060
and Implantation of the Twinned Branch

41
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,120
The Leaves Closure

42
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:10,260
needs his blood marrow as the gateway drug.

43
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,890
That's why he fainted.

44
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,310
Right.

45
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,260
The reason Young Master fainted

46
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:16,500
because of the agonizing pain

47
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,910
of getting blood marrow out.

48
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:18,990
He's okay.

49
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,500
He'll be fine after a sleep.

50
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,990
Don't worry, Young Madam.

51
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:25,480
Granny Chun.

52
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:29,380
Can you help me
embed the twinned branch into my bones?

53
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:32,750
Why?

54
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,400
Xi loves me so much.

55
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:37,150
Whether he protected me

56
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:39,100
or embedded the twinned branch into bones,

57
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,760
it was all done behind my back.

58
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:43,540
He was afraid that if I found out,

59
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:45,820
I would refuse to

60
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,460
sacrifice his life for me

61
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,470
if anything happens in the future.

62
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,620
But I think the same way.

63
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,140
He wants to protect Linchuan

64
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:58,820
and me.

65
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:00,940
And I

66
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:03,250
feel the same.

67
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,020
Granny Chun,

68
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,900
please keep it a secret for me.

69
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,070
Okay.

70
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:40,909
You scared me.

71
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:43,470
Let me catch a fish for you.

72
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:45,000
Do you want to steam it

73
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:46,100
or braise it?

74
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:47,070
No need.

75
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:48,790
I can eat raw fish.

76
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:50,170
Really?

77
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:51,900
I'll get used to it.

78
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:53,550
It seems that

79
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:55,300
you really like Linchuan.

80
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:58,230
I really like Linchuan.

81
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:19,690
Young Madam,

82
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,540
you got a letter from Yongzhao.

83
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,550
A letter from Yongzhao?

84
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,200
[Although I'm unwilling to let my kid feel fearful, my kid has not yet been able to bear this situation.
I'm seriously ill, and Feng Yin is facing a great challenge]

85
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,200
[My condition has reached the point where I cannot get out of bed,
and the doctors all say that there is no cure, fearing that I will not live much longer]

86
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,070
[Although I'm unwilling to let my kid feel fearful, my kid has not yet been able to bear this situation.
I'm seriously ill, and Feng Yin is facing a great challenge]

87
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,070
[My condition has reached the point where I cannot get out of bed,
and the doctors all say that there is no cure, fearing that I will not live much longer]

88
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:58,880
[For Feng Yuan Only]

89
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:13,340
Your father is in critical condition.

90
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,860
He wrote that he also wanted to see me.

91
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:15,380
It's reasonable

92
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,260
to accompany you

93
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,460
to see him.

94
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:21,180
Because of the matters

95
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:21,790
between the tribes of Linchuan,

96
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:23,350
you have been

97
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:24,670
so busy for several days

98
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:26,200
that you have hardly slept.

99
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:28,020
The rainy season is in a few days.

100
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,020
You need to supervise the renovation
of the mountain road.

101
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,620
You are the Young Master of Linchuan.

102
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:32,220
Of course you should

103
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:34,060
put the matters of Linchuan
before everything else.

104
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,470
You don't have to go back with me.

105
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:36,820
But if you go back alone,

106
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:39,140
how am I supposed to feel at ease?

107
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,220
I'll ask Qin Sang to go back with me.

108
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,350
She's from Yongzhao, and good at fighting.

109
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:47,750
You should rest assured.

110
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:49,990
Okay.

111
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:51,659
Wait for me.

112
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:00,390
Take it to protect yourself.

113
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,270
This is my dagger.

114
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:05,290
Yes.

115
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,500
It's good to take it

116
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:11,190
to protect yourself.

117
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:20,380
I'm sorry.

118
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:36,060
Promise me

119
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:38,140
to come back

120
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:41,380
when the pomegranate flowers bloom
next time.

121
00:07:41,659 --> 00:07:42,740
Okay.

122
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,190
Qin Sang.

123
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:49,000
Take good care of

124
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,280
Young Madam there.

125
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:51,780
Yes, Young Master.

126
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:00,950
Qin Sang.

127
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,460
I prepared some food.

128
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:04,100
You come back early.

129
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:06,380
Okay.

130
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,140
Young Master. Young Madam.

131
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:09,420
Young Master.

132
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,340
It's not too late.

133
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:12,630
Young Madam.

134
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:14,830
Granny Chun asked me to give this to you.

135
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:20,580
What's wrong?

136
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:24,070
Nothing.

137
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:26,440
I asked Granny Chun to do me a favor.

138
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:30,910
Don't worry about it.

139
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:33,110
When the pomegranate flowers bloom,

140
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:34,500
I'll be back.

141
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:44,210
You can come back sooner or later.

142
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:44,790
I just want you

143
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,190
to come back safely.

144
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:03,910
I still left this place.

145
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,060
But I didn't expect

146
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:10,700
that I can never see

147
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,780
the water and mountain

148
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:16,650
in Linchuan again.

149
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:36,980
So

150
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:38,620
this is Young Madam's home.

151
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:40,450
This is just a palace.

152
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:42,550
It's not a home.

153
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,320
Qin Sang.

154
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:52,940
Don't go in with me.

155
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:55,290
Go back to visit your family's grave.

156
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,410
No, I have to protect you.

157
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:59,400
I'm the Princess of Yongzhao.

158
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,540
What are you worried about me
after I enter the palace?

159
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:02,630
But...

160
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:05,030
You haven't been home for over a year.

161
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:06,020
Go back and have a look.

162
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,220
Don't worry about me.

163
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,460
When you return to Linchuan,

164
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:10,870
remember to inform me.

165
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,310
Go back.

166
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,870
Why is there no guard

167
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:18,750
on duty?

168
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:24,860
Yi Qing, Si Wu.

169
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:25,990
You...

170
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,740
Yun Mu, what are you doing?

171
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:35,590
Long time no see.

172
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:37,030
My dear sister.

173
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:46,420
Move.

174
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:54,660
How have you been, Sister?

175
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,030
What did you do to father?

176
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,500
He wouldn't let you out.

177
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:04,310
Father?

178
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,710
You just came back.

179
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:08,850
You may not know

180
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:10,420
that our father

181
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,260
died of illness.

182
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:16,140
He is now the former King.

183
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:17,270
The current King of Yongzhao

184
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:18,660
is my son, Feng Qing.

185
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,760
He is so kind.

186
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:20,780
How could he let his father

187
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:21,910
suffer?

188
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:26,190
Father shouldn't have

189
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,470
considered father-son relationship

190
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:28,990
and spared your life.

191
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,350
Father-son relationship?

192
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,690
Feng Yuan, have you forgotten

193
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:33,800
how he compared us

194
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:35,180
when we were young?

195
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:36,790
Your mother

196
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,030
is a noble lady

197
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,340
and helped him sit on the throne.

198
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,510
So you are the most respected

199
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,170
little Princess of Yongzhao.

200
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,160
My mother is

201
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,620
a dancer he slept with when he got drunk.

202
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:46,110
So I'm a bad seed.

203
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:47,110
He did it.

204
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,790
Why am I the bad seed?

205
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:54,300
Feng Yuan.

206
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:55,500
Do you know

207
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,820
why I hate you so much?

208
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:59,140
You were loved.

209
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:00,670
You don't even know

210
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:02,580
what bad seed means.

211
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:04,740
But you stand here to judge me

212
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,270
about why I'm not kind.

213
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,820
Your father is not as respectable

214
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,550
as you think.

215
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,520
He hated you for being a woman.

216
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,900
He hated my lowborn background.

217
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:20,670
He would rather abdicate in favor of

218
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:21,820
Feng Qing.

219
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:23,750
A teenager!

220
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:25,890
It's ridiculous.

221
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,860
At that moment,

222
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,060
I couldn't refute

223
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:34,460
a single word of Feng Yin.

224
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:37,510
My small-mindedness

225
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,710
and father's prejudice

226
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:42,030
may be the origins of these disasters

227
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,590
that Helian Xi

228
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:47,060
and the whole Linchuan have suffered.

229
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,060
It's all my fault.

230
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,030
You hate me.

231
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:56,110
So if you want to kill me,

232
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:56,940
or torture me,

233
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,760
just do whatever you want.

234
00:13:58,870 --> 00:13:59,550
Let go of the Linchuan people

235
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:01,190
who escorted me back to the palace.

236
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:02,980
Why didn't you tell me earlier? Sister.

237
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,250
I cut off her

238
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:05,660
hands and feet.

239
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:06,750
Here.

240
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,430
Show it to her.

241
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:38,860
Princess, you're awake.

242
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:49,300
Hua'e.

243
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:52,100
You didn't expect

244
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:54,150
to see me again in this life, right?

245
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,790
Why are you here?

246
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:56,940
I'm here to tell you

247
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,380
a good news.

248
00:14:58,900 --> 00:14:59,830
You are

249
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:02,180
three months pregnant.

250
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:10,900
It seems that you don't know about this.

251
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,510
Then Helian Xi

252
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:14,290
doesn't know about it as well.

253
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:16,640
What do you want?

254
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,830
Princess, guess it.

255
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:21,630
If Helian Xi knows you had a miscarriage,

256
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:24,080
will he come to Yongzhao immediately?

257
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:35,540
What do you want on earth?

258
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,150
If Helian Xi dies,

259
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,490
the two trees in Linchuan will be ruined.

260
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,990
The legendary

261
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:43,580
tree's heart with divine power

262
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,390
will appear in the world.

263
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,580
These

264
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,180
are written

265
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,910
by

266
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,440
your beloved former King.

267
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,720
So what Feng Yin really wanted

268
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,260
is the tree's heart.

269
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:02,470
So what you're looking for

270
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:03,820
is the tree's heart.

271
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,460
Do you think

272
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:07,740
the Divine Tree's heart

273
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,540
can be used by anyone who gets it?

274
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:10,590
Naive.

275
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:12,370
Let me tell you.

276
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:14,260
The people who can use the tree's heart

277
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:14,980
are

278
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,930
the heirs of Linchuan bloodline.

279
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:21,950
I think

280
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:23,500
you just want to

281
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,470
keep the baby in your womb.

282
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,140
You don't believe me?

283
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:29,260
Then try it.

284
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:38,240
Go out and tell Feng Yin.

285
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:40,380
If he wants the Divine Tree's heart,

286
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:41,820
then don't get any ideas about

287
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:42,900
the baby in my womb.

288
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:47,660
By the way,

289
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:49,230
I forgot to tell you

290
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:50,700
another bad news.

291
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,380
Don’t

292
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:55,190
try to

293
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,980
ask for help from Wu Jiu.

294
00:16:57,970 --> 00:16:58,950
He

295
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:01,470
was loyal to the emperor and the country.

296
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:03,330
He died in battle half a month ago.

297
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,170
What is this?

298
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:24,000
This is the key to return to Linchuan.

299
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:26,140
But

300
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:27,670
this is just a leaf.

301
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:53,670
The entrance of Linchuan is hidden.

302
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:55,630
Only Linchuan people can enter.

303
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:56,830
With it,

304
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:59,480
you can activate the mechanism anytime.

305
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:05,380
Is this the same thing

306
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,530
you gave to General Wu Jiu last time?

307
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:07,700
The key I gave him

308
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:09,950
can only be used 3 times.

309
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:14,990
If Feng Yin's plot succeeds,

310
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:16,750
even if I die,

311
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,510
he will drag my body

312
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:19,660
to Linchuan.

313
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:51,070
I can't let him get the key

314
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:53,260
to open the entrance.

315
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:41,950
It’s been 4 months.

316
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,380
Why hasn't Yuan come back yet?

317
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:50,190
Young Master, the stockaded villages
in the east

318
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:52,320
have finally been peaceful recently.

319
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:57,310
That's good.

320
00:19:58,550 --> 00:19:59,380
Wu Qing.

321
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,660
Except for the letter reporting safety

322
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:02,900
from Qin Sang,

323
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,500
did we get any letters from Young Madam

324
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,030
recently?

325
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:10,480
Don't worry, Young Master.

326
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,580
It's rainy season now.

327
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,840
The letters usually can't be delivered.

328
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:23,430
Pomegranate flowers bloom again.

329
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,790
Why hasn't she returned yet?
