[Hard To Find]

00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:30,000
[6]

4
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:31,230
This marriage

5
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:31,750
is between

6
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:32,950
her and me.

7
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:34,860
If you can't be responsible for her,

8
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,250
I can.

9
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,350
Liang Chan.

10
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,490
Liang Chan.

11
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:00,000
Xi Jiu.

12
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:04,190
Do you

13
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:06,490
really have to cancel this marriage

14
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:07,460
with me?

15
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,020
I used to

16
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:14,300
live in a daze.

17
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:17,810
I thought forgetting the past

18
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:20,380
could lead a new life.

19
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:23,539
But I never thought

20
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:26,480
there are things I can't forget.

21
00:01:26,789 --> 00:01:28,550
I thought

22
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:30,330
we could...

23
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,620
I let you down.

24
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:42,759
I deserve

25
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:46,000
all the blame.

26
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,610
Stop it.

27
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,130
What are you doing?

28
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:57,920
As the Crown Prince of Shuoyun,

29
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:59,170
how could I be so shameless

30
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:00,650
to marry a married woman?

31
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,790
I regret

32
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,530
this marriage.

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,800
You

34
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:12,400
can leave now.

35
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,590
But according to Shuoyun's rules,

36
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:17,930
even the Crown Prince has to...

37
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:20,950
You're not one of the Shuoyun tribe.

38
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:23,340
Our marriage

39
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:25,670
is wrong at first.

40
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,880
It's not restricted by the rules.

41
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:44,070
Liang Chan.

42
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:47,620
Sorry.

43
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,230
Liang Chan.

44
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,580
She just fainted.

45
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,890
Take her for treatment now.

46
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:06,480
I'll leave her to you.

47
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:54,530
What's wrong with Young Madam?

48
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:55,630
Prepare some food.

49
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:56,570
Soup and rice porridge would be best.

50
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:57,300
Okay.

51
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:01,830
Your Highness.

52
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:03,320
Just apologize to His Majesty.

53
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,060
Why do you have to suffer here?

54
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:07,010
There are the tribe rules

55
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:09,020
and rules

56
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,960
must be followed.

57
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:35,180
I'm glad you don't have a fever.

58
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,900
You're finally awake.

59
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:00,040
What's wrong?

60
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,070
Water.

61
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,760
I want water.

62
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:04,130
I want water.

63
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:05,590
Drink it.

64
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:20,720
Have some porridge.

65
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:23,300
If there's anything else you want to eat,

66
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,360
I'll have Qin Sang prepare it for you.

67
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,320
Why are you

68
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:30,950
doing this to me?

69
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:36,810
I just can't let you die

70
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:39,220
from thirst, hunger,

71
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:40,280
or choking, etc.

72
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,380
Got it.

73
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,030
What now?

74
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:51,950
What's wrong

75
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,190
with the porridge?

76
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:54,380
It smells bad.

77
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:56,990
Did you put something

78
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,830
strange in it to trick me?

79
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:05,250
It's not the porridge.

80
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,520
It's you.

81
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,360
Me?

82
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:11,890
Exposed outside for two days and nights.

83
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:12,590
Do you think

84
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:13,670
you can stay clean?

85
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,310
You can wash here.

86
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:33,460
The hot spring water here

87
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,920
is good for your injuries.

88
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:37,580
Wait.

89
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,770
What now?

90
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,070
Do you want me to wash it for you?

91
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:47,980
Even if I need help,

92
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:49,330
I'll ask Qin Sang.

93
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,380
I just wanted to ask

94
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:52,570
if you have soapnut

95
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,770
or hibiscus leaves?

96
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:55,680
I need to wash my hair too.

97
00:06:58,670 --> 00:06:59,600
So troublesome.

98
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:15,470
Could there be hidden secrets

99
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:17,270
behind what happened back then?

100
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:20,110
What should I do

101
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:22,340
to help her regain her memory?

102
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:29,970
Feng Yuan.

103
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:31,730
Feng Yuan.

104
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:35,020
Feng Yuan.

105
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,770
Feng Yuan.

106
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:43,900
Feng Yuan.

107
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,000
Feng Yuan.

108
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:51,730
Feng Yuan.

109
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:20,240
What are you doing here?

110
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:21,770
What's wrong with you?

111
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:24,080
You got yourself lost while taking a bath.

112
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,410
I just stepped on a stone.

113
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:28,310
Why are you making a fuss?

114
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,630
It's dark here.

115
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:40,000
Don't be so nervous.

116
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,940
I won't do anything to you.

117
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:53,760
It's actually snowing here.

118
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:54,870
I haven't seen snow

119
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,400
in Shuoyun for three years.

120
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,420
It's normal.

121
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:00,570
This place is at a high altitude

122
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:02,160
in the mountains with low temperature,

123
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,500
so it naturally snows.

124
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:04,700
But what's

125
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,960
the stone you mentioned earlier?

126
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,150
It's this stone.

127
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:12,590
I was afraid Qinsang might hurt her foot

128
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:13,510
when bathing,

129
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:14,600
so I picked it up

130
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:15,710
from the water.

131
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:18,980
What...

132
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:20,070
What are you doing?

133
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:22,750
What's wrong with it?

134
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,570
I don't know.

135
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:26,430
It has been there

136
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:27,650
since I can remember.

137
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:39,790
Why did her arm

138
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:40,960
become like this?

139
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,150
What happened back then?

140
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,030
I'm done.

141
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:47,050
Please leave.

142
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:08,440
His heart blood can't work.

143
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,700
Your blood should do.

144
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:14,500
You must be luckier than him.

145
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,630
Come. Come here.

146
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:16,840
Don't move.

147
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:18,110
It won't take long.

148
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,480
I'm looking for

149
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:32,950
Shuoyun people

150
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,640
with Linchuan bloodline.

151
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:35,390
What have you

152
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:36,970
brought me?

153
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:38,350
Why don't you give it a try?

154
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:39,110
My lord.

155
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:40,430
As you ordered,

156
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:41,530
all I brought

157
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:42,310
are the Shuoyun people

158
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:43,910
with Linchuan bloodline.

159
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,710
But the intermarriage between Shuoyun and Linchuan

160
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:46,990
happened a hundred years ago.

161
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:48,830
Perhaps the Linchuan halidom

162
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:50,470
can only be activated

163
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:51,910
by true Linchuan people.

164
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,310
But I can't even find

165
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:54,750
a single bird in Linchuan,

166
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,020
let alone the people.

167
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:58,980
Where can I find

168
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:01,130
pure-blooded Linchuan people?

169
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:03,110
How can I activate

170
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:05,110
the heart of this Divine Tree?

171
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:06,590
When will I have

172
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:07,750
the same abilities

173
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,190
as Helian Xi?

174
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:12,050
My lord.

175
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:14,650
Since they're all looking for us,

176
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:16,020
why don't we play along?

177
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,740
I'll sneak in

178
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:18,510
and use the Princess

179
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:20,070
to sow discord between Shuoyun and Helian Xi,

180
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:22,040
[Wanted]

181
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:21,410
and lure Helian Xi

182
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:22,900
to this place.

183
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,470
Helian Xi.

184
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:29,800
That woman treated him badly back then,

185
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:31,890
but he still wants to protect her.

186
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:32,950
Why?

187
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:34,030
Perhaps

188
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:35,500
the Princess

189
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:37,080
can help us

190
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:38,800
get Helian Xi's blood.

191
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,020
Good idea.

192
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:46,780
Good idea.

193
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:51,930
Let's send a gift to

194
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:53,410
the Shuoyun Crown Prince.

195
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,300
Why would I use

196
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:24,540
pomegranate flowers from May as rouge?

197
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:27,500
If she had any grudges

198
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,830
with people in Shuoyun,

199
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:31,220
it should be from before.

200
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:33,300
But when Young Madam was in Linchuan,

201
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,030
she'd been loved by the people.

202
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,450
Besides, Linchuan has already...

203
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:39,600
I mean,

204
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:40,480
it's even less likely for her

205
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,080
to have enemies in Linchuan.

206
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,100
Then there is only one possibility left.

207
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:48,150
It's related to her previous identity.

208
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:49,510
Could it be

209
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:51,270
that incident three years ago?

210
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:52,870
That incident?

211
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:54,150
Young Master.

212
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,850
Please forgive me for this.

213
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:57,700
Over these days,

214
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:58,740
I can tell

215
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,670
that you also don't want to believe

216
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:00,210
that incident.

217
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:01,670
I'll keep investigating.

218
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:03,660
Since she has come to Nanzhi Manor,

219
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,880
take good care of her.

220
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:06,540
Got it.

221
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:21,070
Young Madam.

222
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:23,290
Wake up. Your hair is still wet.

223
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,300
Young Madam.

224
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,140
Young Madam, wake up.

225
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,170
Young Master.

226
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:36,050
She's been busy all day

227
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:37,590
and is very tired.

228
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,010
Don't wake her up.

229
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:39,850
I'll do it.

230
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:01,520
Why don't you ask Qin Sang

231
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,180
to apply the ointment for you?

232
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,750
I can do it myself.

233
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:06,520
No need to trouble others.

234
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:11,910
Is there anything

235
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:13,640
in this world that you can't do?

236
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:16,240
At least now,

237
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,520
I still can't recover my memory on my own.

238
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,060
I can

239
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:30,940
handle this.

240
00:15:57,730 --> 00:15:59,130
Your neck is injured too.

241
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:00,870
How could it be?

242
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,550
I'd better ask Qin Sang to help me.

243
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:09,310
Qin Sang.

244
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,830
Come in.

245
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,050
Young Madam.

246
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:13,170
You want to see me?

247
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:15,110
Qin Sang, help me apply the ointment.

248
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:15,870
Okay.

249
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,610
Young Madam.

250
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:22,600
I suddenly remembered

251
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,470
that I had an appointment with a friend

252
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:24,270
and I gotta go.

253
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:25,850
I can't apply the ointment for you.

254
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:26,730
I'm leaving.

255
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:28,550
Qin Sang.

256
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,570
I'll do it myself then.

257
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:01,890
Let me.

258
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:52,050
All right.

259
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:53,550
You can rest now.

260
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:42,990
Where is my hairpin?

261
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,860
Did I lose it at that time?

262
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:59,280
Is Shuoyun's pomegranate sweet?

263
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:00,980
Yes.

264
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:02,290
Young Madam likes it.

265
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,970
She should like it too.

266
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:06,840
Buy some more.

267
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,350
I'll bring it to her.

268
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:10,960
Young Master. Are you going to see her again?

269
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,420
Not only to see her,

270
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:14,400
I want to get back something

271
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,080
that might help Feng Yuan

272
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,550
regain her memory,

273
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:19,570
and also investigate the incident

274
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:20,390
from three years ago

275
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:22,250
to see if there are any loopholes.

276
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:24,680
I feel like something's wrong.

277
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,280
Understood.

278
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:31,950
Young Master.

279
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,670
I really hope

280
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:35,300
that Young Madam can recover her memory,

281
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,960
but if she remembers the past,

282
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:39,880
everything between you and her

283
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:41,520
will no longer exist.

284
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,610
No matter what happened three years ago,

285
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:48,030
everything now

286
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:49,400
is just an illusion.

287
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,860
It's something

288
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:53,030
not worth clinging to.

289
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,170
It's better to face it earlier.

290
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:58,540
Qin Sang.

291
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:02,660
After I go,

292
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:04,420
I'll leave Nanzhi Manor to you.

293
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,960
And don't tell

294
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:08,110
Feng Yuan about her yet.

295
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:10,260
You can rest assured.
