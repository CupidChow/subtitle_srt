1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:27,490
[Hard To Find]

3
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,410
[16]

4
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,110
Feng Yin hasn't found out

5
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:34,110
about the key yet.

6
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:36,270
Anyway,

7
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:37,150
I

8
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:38,880
have changed the pattern of the key.

9
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,640
Even if Feng Yin gets it,

10
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,160
he can't enter Linchuan.

11
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:44,590
But what about the baby?

12
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:48,030
I can fool Feng Yin for a while,

13
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:51,000
but even if I can give birth to the baby,

14
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:52,590
it may not

15
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:54,190
leave the palace safely.

16
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,100
Your Majesty.

17
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,039
Your Majesty, why are you here?

18
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:20,030
Aunt, it's all my fault.

19
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:21,530
I put you under house arrest by my father.

20
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:23,370
I'm here to apologize to you.

21
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:25,060
Your Majesty,

22
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,060
you don't have to apologize to me.

23
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:28,940
This has nothing to do with you.

24
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:31,900
My mother passed away after giving birth to me.

25
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:32,900
In the palace,

26
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:35,150
you are the kindest person to me.

27
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,560
Hua'e comes.

28
00:01:39,229 --> 00:01:40,180
She

29
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:41,370
is arrogant

30
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,950
and domineering in my father's favor.

31
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:44,289
Your Majesty, leave now.

32
00:01:44,289 --> 00:01:45,160
If she sees you, we'll be in trouble.

33
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,070
Okay.
Hurry.

34
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:00,750
I told you

35
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:02,820
not to bother me.

36
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,360
What are you doing here again?

37
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:06,650
Your Highness,

38
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:08,350
you seem to be in a good mood

39
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,820
for painting.

40
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,890
The fetus

41
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:21,790
is less than eight months, right?

42
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,400
What a pity.

43
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,310
What do you mean?

44
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:28,200
Pitifully,

45
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:29,940
the baby will never have the chance to see its father

46
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,820
after it's born.

47
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:36,110
What do you mean?

48
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,370
Helian Xi

49
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,240
came to the palace to see you.

50
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,710
What?

51
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,460
Where is Xi?

52
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:48,090
The Young Master of Linchuan came from afar.

53
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:49,150
Of course, we will give him a feast

54
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,590
in the palace.

55
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:52,910
Where is General Wu Jiu?

56
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,940
Why hasn't Yuan shown up yet?

57
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,020
I wonder

58
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,850
how many pieces would he be cut into

59
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:03,530
after the banquet?

60
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:08,040
Anyway,

61
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:10,840
I will dig out his heart

62
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,000
and give it to you.

63
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:26,970
What are you doing?

64
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:34,900
Give birth.

65
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:36,860
I'll take you there then.

66
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,120
I hope you and your baby

67
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:41,190
can see him for the last time.

68
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,160
I'm a subordinate of General Wu Jiu.

69
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,110
General told me

70
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,520
Yongzhao is indebted to you.

71
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,010
So I come to toast you.

72
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,080
How is General Wu Jiu?

73
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,430
He...

74
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,250
He died in a battle.

75
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,720
What?

76
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,390
To General Wu Jiu.

77
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:20,850
Helian Xi, Young Master of Linchuan.

78
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:27,760
Who are you?

79
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:29,240
I forgot.

80
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,830
I know you very well

81
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,440
but you don't know who I am.

82
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,130
I am Feng Yin,

83
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,040
the elder brother of Feng Yuan.

84
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:41,110
Catch him alive.

85
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:20,240
You were born safely.

86
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:22,980
That's great.

87
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:26,690
I will let you

88
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:28,170
leave here safely.

89
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,110
Be good.

90
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:46,840
This is the Nightfly Powder given by your father.

91
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,170
It can make you fall asleep and look like you're dead.

92
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,430
If you look alive,

93
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,120
I will have no way.

94
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,950
Don't be afraid.

95
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:11,910
Trust me.

96
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:21,160
Your Majesty, can you do me a favor?

97
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,660
After my baby is born,

98
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,110
no matter it's alive or dead,

99
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:30,380
bring it to a clinic

100
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:32,470
and give the baby

101
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:34,030
to a girl named Shi Ying.

102
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:38,220
I'll help you

103
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:39,470
protect your child.

104
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,120
Xi,

105
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,280
I'm sorry.

106
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:53,530
I didn't expect that our marriage

107
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,380
will end up like this.

108
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:00,970
Feng Yin is cunning and vicious.

109
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:03,500
To protect you and our baby,

110
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:06,070
I should be more ruthless than him.

111
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,280
I think

112
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:13,650
our marriage

113
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:17,350
is the beginning of this tragedy.

114
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,080
Now, I only have one way

115
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,840
to protect you.

116
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,050
I hope you can

117
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:28,440
live on

118
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,650
with our baby.

119
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,830
May the Divine Tree bless us.

120
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,720
Your husband is so tolerant.

121
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,950
He didn't even moan.

122
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:11,360
Alright, Yuan.

123
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:13,580
Tell me.

124
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:17,050
How can I enter Linchuan?

125
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:28,790
Your Highness,

126
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:31,020
their baby died.

127
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:37,260
As you see,

128
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,020
if I don't stop it,

129
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,900
they will continue

130
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,880
to cut his flesh.

131
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,510
By then, your husband

132
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,530
can't even

133
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:48,860
leave the whole body.

134
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,950
Okay,

135
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:58,040
I can tell you

136
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,650
how to enter Linchuan.

137
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,420
Give him

138
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:05,340
to me.

139
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:08,460
Do you want his body?

140
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,400
My baby was born prematurely.

141
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:17,550
It died

142
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,460
at birth.

143
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:22,580
Helian Xi is doomed

144
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:25,760
anyway.

145
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,250
I can't live on either.

146
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,020
How about

147
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:33,910
letting us three

148
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:36,540
die together?

149
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:43,740
Give me the baby.

150
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,420
Give it to me!

151
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:24,860
Splash salt water.

152
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:04,890
Yuan,

153
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:21,700
run!

154
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:29,790
Yuan, run!

155
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,420
Sorry.

156
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:12,710
Yuan,

157
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:14,320
why?

158
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,120
He is my husband.

159
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:57,370
I'd like him to die directly.

160
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:01,920
I heard that you were happy

161
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:03,190
in Linchuan.

162
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,950
But you made a deal with me without any hesitation.

163
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:07,630
Don't you care about

164
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:09,070
the Linchuan people?

165
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:18,190
I'm the Princess of Yongzhao.

166
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,620
Their lives

167
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,450
have nothing to do with me.

168
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:27,070
Good.

169
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:28,830
Very good.

170
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,660
The key to Linchuan

171
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,700
is here.

172
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,960
So this is it.

173
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:05,290
We are indeed siblings.

174
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,060
You're even crazier than me

175
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:08,830
when acting unscrupulously.

176
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,400
What are you waiting for?

177
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,400
He's mine.

178
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,530
Untie him now!

179
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,970
All the mistakes

180
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:10,700
began in this palace.

181
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,560
All I can do

182
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,310
is to end

183
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:20,590
the crime of Yongzhao against Linchuan.

184
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:23,520
I have to

185
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:27,190
sacrifice my body

186
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,360
for a miracle.

187
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:43,850
[I had a nightmare that made me sad about our parting]

188
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:43,850
[Luckily, our story isn't over yet]

189
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:54,050
Xi!

190
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,380
It's been two days.

191
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,060
Why hasn't Feng Yuan woken up?

192
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,420
Don't worry, Young Master.

193
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:49,850
The doctor checked her again this morning.

194
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:51,210
He said Young Madam is fine,

195
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:52,480
but a little weak.

196
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:54,390
She hasn't woken up yet

197
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,600
might because she was frightened

198
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,840
by the hit.

199
00:17:57,370 --> 00:17:58,370
Do Shuyun's imperial physicians

200
00:17:58,370 --> 00:17:59,600
know how to treat patients?

201
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,420
She hasn't woken up for two days.

202
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:03,680
But doctors said it was due to her weakness after being hit?

203
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,850
If it doesn't work,

204
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:07,710
Qin Sang,

205
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:08,360
find some

206
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,410
folk doctors.

207
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,150
Yes.

208
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:55,830
Xi!
