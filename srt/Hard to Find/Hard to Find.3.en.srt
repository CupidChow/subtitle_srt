00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,010
[Hard to find]

3
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:29,960
[3]

4
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:32,670
[Crown Prince's Residence]

5
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:35,190
Come in.

6
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:45,830
Are you okay?

7
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:46,940
Did you get hurt

8
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,760
other than your shoulder?

9
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:49,590
Does it hurt?

10
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,900
Don't worry.

11
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:51,810
I'm fine.

12
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,920
I have something to tell you.

13
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:56,750
Okay.

14
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:58,480
That man

15
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,360
was obviously targeting me.

16
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:02,520
I think

17
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:04,760
our marriage

18
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:06,550
should be canceled.

19
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:09,680
Are you afraid that your identity

20
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,950
will put me in danger?

21
00:01:11,789 --> 00:01:12,760
Is that why you want to cancel

22
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,910
our marriage?

23
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,510
My identity is unknown.

24
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,390
And that man is unusual.

25
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:20,180
He won't give up easily.

26
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,800
If he comes again, I...

27
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:22,920
That’s why,

28
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:25,000
Liang Chan,

29
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:27,120
I can’t cancel this marriage.

30
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,280
He did that

31
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:31,480
even you are the future princess of Shuoyun.

32
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,680
How can I leave you alone

33
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,910
in danger?

34
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,070
But...

35
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:35,910
Liang Chan,

36
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,330
don’t be afraid to put me in danger.

37
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:39,880
I defeated Shuo Yun

38
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,670
at the age of 16.

39
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:41,990
I'm the best warrior.

40
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:01,270
Young Master.

41
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:03,960
What is it?

42
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,430
The man in the dark alley that night

43
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,450
was not an ordinary robber.

44
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:07,800
Then who is he?

45
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:09,830
We can't identify his identity for now,

46
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:12,030
but he's definitely not from Shuoyun Tribe.

47
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,330
I checked the body.

48
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:14,320
He was fed

49
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,230
a kind of poison

50
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:16,829
that is for men of sacrifice.

51
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,560
He is not from Shuoyun Tribe,

52
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:19,960
and he is a man of sacrifice.

53
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,490
Apart from us,

54
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,320
other people are after her.

55
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:24,510
Young Master,

56
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:25,870
are we going

57
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,990
tomorrow?

58
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,110
Where?

59
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:32,079
They're getting married tomorrow.

60
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:46,270
Dong Li?

61
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:48,780
Did anything else happen in the city?

62
00:02:48,829 --> 00:02:50,150
Don't worry, Your Highness.

63
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:51,840
Today is your wedding day.

64
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:53,550
Sheng has deployed all guards

65
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:55,410
to guard every corner of the city.

66
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:10,850
In Shuoyun's wedding procedure,

67
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:12,190
the last step

68
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:13,320
is to exchange

69
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:14,850
your most precious thing

70
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,130
as keepsakes.

71
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:16,860
Your Highness,

72
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:17,750
are you going to give

73
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:18,920
this pomegranate hairpin

74
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,000
as a keepsake?

75
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,370
This is the only one I have.

76
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:25,790
Your Highness

77
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:27,050
is so beautiful today.

78
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,700
After searching for three years,

79
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,190
I still don't know who I am.

80
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:36,590
It's time to let go of the past.

81
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:41,870
[Happiness]

82
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,960
Congratulations

83
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,990
Congratulations!

84
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:44,880
Congratulations, Your Highness.

85
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,240
Congratulations, Your Highness.

86
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,990
Congratulations.

87
00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:51,760
Liang Chan.

88
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,890
I've been waiting for this moment for so long.

89
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:56,750
Usually,

90
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,320
I don't think this road is long.

91
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,240
Don't worry.

92
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:00,320
I’ve arranged guards

93
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,850
among people on the street.

94
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,360
Back then,

95
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:17,490
[Happiness]

96
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:15,520
if he hadn't saved me

97
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,990
back to the mansion,

98
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,310
I would be a lonely soul.

99
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,380
He gave me a chance to live,

100
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,280
and have a home again

101
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:26,730
in this world.

102
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:28,640
Your Highness.

103
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,480
This is one of Shuyun's wedding customs.

104
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,750
It is the wish from people of Shuoyun.

105
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,710
May the Crown Prince and the Crown Princess

106
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:35,240
live happily ever after.

107
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,360
Your Highness is picking you up in the west district.

108
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,500
You can't look back

109
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:40,150
before you cross the bridge.

110
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,460
I know.

111
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:53,140
[Happiness]

112
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:51,440
For a foreign woman like me,

113
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,510
Xi Jiu even broke ties

114
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:54,170
with the Great King of Shuoyun

115
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:56,270
and insisted on marrying me.

116
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,590
I have to repay him

117
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,770
for this.

118
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:06,270
May the Crown Prince and the Crown Princess

119
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:08,220
have bright day,

120
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,470
and live happily ever after.

121
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,660
Xi Jiu has prepared for so long

122
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,970
for today's wedding.

123
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,430
I should be happy.

124
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:22,130
The Crown Prince should exchange keepsakes with the Crown Princess.

125
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:30,580
Young Master, according to Shuoyun's custom,

126
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:31,440
they are married

127
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,330
after they exchange keepsake.

128
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:33,290
So what?

129
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,690
Pay attention to the surroundings.

130
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:36,820
She's still useful.

131
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,500
She must be safe.

132
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:39,960
Liang Chan,

133
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,170
you may appear fragile on the outside,

134
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:43,420
but you're

135
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:44,810
the smartest

136
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,760
and the most courageous woman I've ever seen.

137
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,360
The only thing you care about

138
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:49,820
is your past.

139
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,960
In this case,

140
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,000
this is the most suitable

141
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:55,640
keepsake for you.

142
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,180
Your Highness,

143
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:59,670
this is His Majesty’s planchette.

144
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:01,530
-How could you steal it?
-Shut up!

145
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,560
Planchette.

146
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,880
Xi Jiu. No.

147
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:07,650
Why not?

148
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:08,910
Shuoyun Tribe

149
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:09,790
has the rule.

150
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:10,720
Only the Great King

151
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,280
can use the secret planchette writing skill.

152
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,630
If it weren't for that rule, I'd have used it for you

153
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:14,690
to know your past.

154
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,620
It is said that the skill

155
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:18,770
can tell the future and know the past.

156
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,550
So it really exists.

157
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,510
Liang Chan,

158
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:22,330
take it.

159
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:23,310
When Great King comes...

160
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,040
Xi Jiu,

161
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,040
I don't care about my past anymore.

162
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,540
Your Highness.

163
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,360
His Majesty is so angry

164
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,020
that he even didn't come for your wedding ceremony.

165
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:31,830
If he knows...

166
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:32,870
So what?

167
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,159
Your Highness.

168
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,230
I remember

169
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:36,840
you have

170
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,380
an unparalleled luminous pearl.

171
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,190
How about

172
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:40,720
getting the luminous pearl?

173
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,980
You should complete the ceremony first.

174
00:07:45,659 --> 00:07:46,520
I'll go now.

175
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:53,040
Sheng has gone for the pearl.

176
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:55,550
How about giving your keepsake to me first?

177
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:06,030
This hairpin

178
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:07,340
is the only thing I had

179
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:08,830
when I came to Shuoyun.

180
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:11,300
I can only use it as a keepsake.

181
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,630
I can't believe she actually gives that hairpin

182
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:13,720
as a keepsake.

183
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,130
This...

184
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,440
This is the most precious thing.

185
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,350
You...

186
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:33,850
It's you again!

187
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:00,160
Help! Help!

188
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:09,080
Your Highness, take the sword.

189
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:25,920
Escort her back.

190
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:26,670
Yes.

191
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:41,890
There's an ambush!

192
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,840
It's obvious.

193
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,440
My Lord.

194
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,090
It's really him.

195
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,320
Watch out!

196
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,170
Oh no.

197
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,490
She's in danger.

198
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,350
I can stand up myself.

199
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,560
You can stand up.

200
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,020
But others

201
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,950
will continue to assassinate you.

202
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,860
Put me down!

203
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:05,660
What are you doing here?

204
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,280
Why do you keep

205
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,970
pestering my Crown Princess?

206
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,160
The Crown Princess you haven't married

207
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:16,510
is the Young Madam of Linchuan.

208
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,150
Who are you then?

209
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:22,330
Young Master Lin Chuan.

210
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,360
Helian Xi.

211
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:36,200
Why did you kidnap me again?

212
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,190
What are you doing?

213
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,690
Put me down!

214
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:41,840
Put me down!

215
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:43,510
Put me down!

216
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:46,740
Put me down!

217
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:56,270
What did you just say?

218
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:57,260
Young Master.

219
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,000
Young Madam.

220
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:00,660
What is our relationship?

221
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,050
What is the relationship

222
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:04,180
between Young Master and Young Madam?

223
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,860
We're a couple.

224
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,240
Couple?

225
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:08,970
Couple?

226
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,590
Haven't you always wanted to know

227
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:11,910
where the tree is?

228
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,170
What are you talking about?

229
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:26,120
What is this?

230
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:33,390
The heart of Linchuan Divine Tree.

231
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:34,700
Eternal night.

232
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:40,830
We're here.

233
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:46,230
Where is this?

234
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:47,860
Linchuan.

235
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,280
The tree you're looking for

236
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:53,830
is right here.

237
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:57,570
This is the Divine Tree of Linchuan.

238
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,440
Twinned branches.

239
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:02,890
How did they

240
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:05,160
become like this?

241
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,400
In the past,

242
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:07,630
they were luxuriant,

243
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:09,050
just like your painting.

244
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,360
They became this like

245
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:14,080
all because of you.

246
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,360
Me?

247
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,190
Yes.

248
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,690
Four years ago,

249
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,960
we got married under the Divine Tree.

250
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:24,290
We have completed

251
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,790
all the wedding ceremonies.

252
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:27,310
We're a couple.

253
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:29,750
I don't know who I am,

254
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,630
but I can't let you

255
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:31,720
make up a story.

256
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:33,070
There's a birthmark

257
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:34,500
under one inch of your chest.

258
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,900
It's cinnabar-colored.

259
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,500
Am I right?

260
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:39,720
This is ridiculous.

261
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,500
To me,

262
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,300
an unforgivable person

263
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:44,620
forgetting her evil deeds

264
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:46,550
is the most ridiculous thing.

265
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:03,980
You asked me

266
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:05,950
to hand over the twinned branch?

267
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,390
What is that?

268
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,060
There are two branches.

269
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,440
This is mine.

270
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:23,660
I gave you

271
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,290
the other one

272
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,970
on our wedding night.

273
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,600
What should I do

274
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:41,160
to make them

275
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,600
the way they used to be?

276
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,560
Just recall

277
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,070
where you hid the branch

278
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,100
and give it to me.

279
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:47,730
I can connect

280
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,130
two branches.

281
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:50,600
When they sprout again,

282
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,150
grow, interact and connect,

283
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:54,750
the Divine Tree will resurrect.

284
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,060
Do you understand?

285
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,100
Since this is Linchuan,

286
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:03,510
can I

287
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:05,120
go to other places to have a look?

288
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,360
This place is transformed from the heart of the tree.

289
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,020
The realm of spiritual sense.

290
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:09,270
You can't go anywhere else.

291
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:10,930
What about the real Linchuan?

292
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,990
The real Linchuan?

293
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:15,980
Thanks to you,

294
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:16,920
the real Linchuan

295
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:17,940
is now full of miasma.

296
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:20,280
There are no living creatures and no grass.

297
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,630
My people

298
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:23,310
were sealed underground

299
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:25,960
because of you.

300
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,020
Since we are a real couple

301
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:32,690
why didn't you tell me

302
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:33,680
before?

303
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,790
Why now?

304
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,630
I don't care about the relationship

305
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:38,080
between you and me.

306
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,190
If it weren't for finding the branch

307
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:41,070
and unlocking my people,

308
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,190
I‘d tear you

309
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:45,150
into pieces.

310
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,410
This is the realm of spiritual sense,

311
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:54,740
but it's full of miasma.

312
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:55,830
Go back.

313
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,040
Aren't you

314
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:28,300
letting me go?

315
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:29,310
What?

316
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,760
You want to go back

317
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,150
and marry the Prince of Shuoyun?

318
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:34,670
Since so many things have happened.

319
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:35,350
how can I

320
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:36,960
get married with him?

321
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:37,870
Previously,

322
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,820
I didn't understand why.

323
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:41,660
If I really took the branch

324
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:42,850
of Linchuan clan,

325
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,700
I will find it.

326
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:48,460
From now on,

327
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,360
you are mine.

328
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,870
You can't go anywhere.

329
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,760
As for how to find the branch,

330
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,280
we'll talk about it tomorrow.

331
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:02,520
Can you

332
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,600
let me go back to the mansion tonight?

333
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,540
Xi Jiu will be worried.

334
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:10,850
Don't even think about it.

335
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:13,450
You...

336
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:28,470
He doesn't seem to be lying to me.

337
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:30,200
Maybe my identity

338
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:32,590
is really unusual.

339
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:35,600
I'm worried about Xi Jiu.

340
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,730
How badly he's hurt?

341
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,440
What are you doing?

342
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,220
Young Master.

343
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:14,170
Young Madam hasn't eaten all day

344
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:15,390
and experienced all these stuff

345
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:16,760
this night.

346
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:17,640
I'm afraid she'll be hungry.

347
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,170
I didn't ask you to explain.

348
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:21,080
Why did you explain so much?

349
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:22,350
Young Master.

350
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:24,990
Young Madam is still wearing the wedding dress.

351
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:26,190
Maybe she got hurt.

352
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:28,210
Can I...

353
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,620
I understand.

354
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:19,080
Did he send these?

355
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:20,550
What kind of person

356
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,910
is he?
