1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,200
Uncle Helian, where is that?

3
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:47,310
That's Nanzhi Manor,

4
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,000
your Auntie's favorite place.

5
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,280
Where is Auntie?

6
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:53,750
Why didn't I see her?

7
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,430
Your Auntie

8
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:00,240
is tired.

9
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,170
She's sleeping.

10
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,150
Then we should not disturb her.

11
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:06,310
Let Auntie sleep more.

12
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:49,000
Yuan,

13
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,950
I take Shi Liu

14
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,350
to sit in your favorite place

15
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:55,680
and overlook Linchuan.

16
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,470
Helian Xi,

17
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,910
Shi Liu.

18
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,310
Shi Liu,

19
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,400
your Mom and your godfather are here.

20
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,280
Let's go down.

21
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,150
Shi Liu,

22
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,910
go to your Mom.

23
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,079
Here, let me hug you.

24
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:28,870
Uncle Helian,

25
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,079
Auntie will come

26
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:32,120
to see me again, right?

27
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,310
No matter where Auntie

28
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,960
and Uncle Helian are,

29
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,430
we will always

30
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:39,560
love you.

31
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,750
Grow up well.

32
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:55,280
I'll leave you to it.

33
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:56,850
We'll wait over there.

34
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,190
Let's go.

35
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,030
Come on.

36
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,330
The Twinned Divine Tree

37
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,800
is really like what she drew,

38
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,000
lush, green,

39
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,680
and fascinating.

40
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,630
At that time,

41
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:17,960
we

42
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,190
married

43
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:20,910
under the Divine Tree.

44
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:25,910
In the letter Feng Yuan left to us,

45
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,079
she said

46
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:29,120
she didn't leave us

47
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:30,750
but just integrated herself

48
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,150
with the whole Linchuan.

49
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,470
Every leaf

50
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,360
could be her.

51
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:39,750
I know.

52
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,240
Slow down.

53
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,190
Come here.

54
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:50,750
Helian Xi,

55
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,090
are you not going to

56
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:54,240
let Shi Liu know you are her father?

57
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:56,240
No.

58
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:58,150
Yuan said

59
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,630
Shi Ying is Shi Liu's mother.

60
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:01,910
You also promised that you would treat

61
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:03,170
my daughter as you own.

62
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:04,760
Only with you around

63
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,910
can she

64
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:07,750
live

65
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:09,960
a simple and happy life.

66
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,560
What if she asks us about her origin

67
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,240
when she grows up?

68
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:17,670
If she wants to come to Linchuan,

69
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,620
she can come back anytime.

70
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,950
Linchuan is her hometown.

71
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,830
The people of Linchuan

72
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:25,950
are her family.

73
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:32,960
If Linchuan needs any help,

74
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,300
write to me at any time.

75
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,200
People of the entire Shuoyun tribe

76
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,730
will do our best to help you.

77
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,830
Go back to Shuoyun earlier.

78
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,600
You've been away from home for a long time.

79
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,560
You have to go back.

80
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,390
Dad,

81
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,750
come and catch the butterfly with me.

82
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:56,040
I'll be right there.

83
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,060
Take care of yourself.

84
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:02,310
See you.

85
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:06,310
Mom, look at this.

86
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:08,270
Freeze.

87
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:09,160
Freeze.

88
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:18,240
He...

89
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,680
Is he okay?

90
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,190
Let's go.

91
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,560
Maybe he just wants to

92
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,410
spend more time under the tree.

93
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,390
Let's go, Shi Liu.

94
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,830
Shi Liu, let's go home.

95
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:48,390
Let's go.

96
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,170
Young Madam likes flowers.

97
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,070
I will prepare

98
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:58,730
the biggest and most beautiful flowers for her.

99
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,560
Qin Sang,

100
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,120
do you know where Young Madam is?

101
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,380
Why isn't she back yet?

102
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,710
Young Madam is not feeling well.

103
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:10,070
She's resting

104
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,510
in a beautiful place.

105
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:13,920
What's wrong with her?

106
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,250
Do I need to check on her?

107
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,240
I'm not sure.

108
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,360
Young Master.

109
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:33,510
We've prepared the flowers you're going to

110
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:34,510
give Young Madam.

111
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,070
When will you pick her up?

112
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,600
I'll pick her up now.

113
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:39,800
Great!

114
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:41,240
Granny Chun,

115
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:43,690
the Divine Tree has resurrected.

116
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,630
When I'm away,

117
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,120
please take care of all the people of Linchuan.

118
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,650
It's my duty, Young Master.

119
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:50,830
Wu Qing,

120
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:52,120
I've prepared a security drill book

121
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,240
for you in the room.

122
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:54,890
If you have any questions,

123
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,710
you can ask the Crown Prince of Shuoyun for help.

124
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:58,480
I see.

125
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:04,160
Qin Sang,

126
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,650
Linchuan will always be your home.

127
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,120
But you can go anywhere

128
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:09,870
you want.

129
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:10,950
Don't trap yourself

130
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:12,160
in a place.

131
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:19,680
Okay.

132
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,150
I'm going to pick up Yuan.

133
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,390
Young Master.

134
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:53,040
Go back.

135
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,480
Yuan,

136
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:28,960
I promised you

137
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,510
we will come back

138
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,960
when it snows,

139
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,830
and I'll watch the snow with you.

140
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,440
Yuan,

141
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:11,470
you've been through so much in your life

142
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,870
and had only a moment of joy.

143
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,600
I feel guilty about Linchuan

144
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,270
and let you down.

145
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,970
I could only fulfill my promise

146
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:26,030
to bring you back

147
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,720
when it snows.

148
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,720
I will never

149
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,320
let you alone wherever you go.

150
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:41,600
Yuan,

151
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,080
we will

152
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,440
be together forever.
