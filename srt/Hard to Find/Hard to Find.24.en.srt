[Hard To Find]

00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:30,180
[24]

4
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,750
My good friend is here.

5
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,440
You may leave.

6
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:57,960
Yes.

7
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:16,620
Since you're here,

8
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:19,780
why are you sneaking around?

9
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,130
You'd better stay here.

10
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,590
Young Master of Linchuan has nowhere to go

11
00:01:36,789 --> 00:01:39,200
and visit my bedroom?

12
00:01:39,229 --> 00:01:40,830
I came to get something.

13
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:42,729
My life?

14
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,120
Come and get it.

15
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:05,240
Do you think three's heart is something unimportant and

16
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:07,180
even you can own it?

17
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:26,630
The heart of the tree is mine.

18
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,440
Yuan,

19
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:54,470
is it because of

20
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:56,000
the half branch?

21
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:57,829
The branch

22
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,160
protects her heart.

23
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:01,430
If her heart is hurt,

24
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:03,710
she will also be in danger.

25
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,500
Xi, hurry.

26
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:09,830
Get the heart of the tree back.

27
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,250
Helian Xi.

28
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,440
Don't be afraid, Helian Xi.

29
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,880
Come on, kill me.

30
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,410
If I die,

31
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,510
she will die too.

32
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:20,010
Come on.

33
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,380
Come on!

34
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,670
Don't go.

35
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:26,670
Come on!

36
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,380
Kill me! Come on!

37
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:47,030
Yuan.

38
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:48,300
Yuan.

39
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:51,570
What are you doing?

40
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,190
Feng Yin.

41
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:54,829
Surprised?

42
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,290
If I get hurt, you'll get hurt.

43
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:58,120
You won't live even if I die.

44
00:03:58,230 --> 00:03:59,190
Yuan.

45
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:00,110
Don't hurt yourself like this.

46
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:00,870
This is the best chance

47
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:01,870
to kill him.

48
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:04,450
Get tree's heart and revive the Divine Tree.

49
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,820
What are you doing?

50
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:11,430
Your heart harbors vipers, evil and perversity.

51
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:12,600
You even want to kill Qing.

52
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,390
You don't deserve to be a father.

53
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:15,180
He doesn't dare to kill you,

54
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,750
but I can kill myself.

55
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:18,070
If you dare to touch

56
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:18,899
anyone,

57
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:20,760
we will die together.

58
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:21,910
You...

59
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:22,960
Are you threatening me?

60
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,550
We are all sinners.

61
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,390
We should atone together.

62
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:30,710
Yuan.

63
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:32,770
Don’t hurt yourself anymore.

64
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:37,330
Let's go home.

65
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:41,270
Who's inside?

66
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,180
Hurry! Surround here!

67
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:44,760
Protect His Majesty!

68
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:45,700
Hurry.

69
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,659
You haven't recovered yet.

70
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,540
Why is there a new wound?

71
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:03,300
Xi,

72
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,450
I was just trying to scare Feng Yin.

73
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:07,110
Just a minor injury.

74
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:10,790
Sorry.

75
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,540
I'll get a new gauze.

76
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:14,130
Xi.

77
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:35,830
What happened

78
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,390
here?

79
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,550
It seems like

80
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,380
something is inside my heart.

81
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,250
Fortunately, the connection is mutual.

82
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,870
I don't have to be controlled by Feng Yin anymore.

83
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,550
I can kill him anytime.

84
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,540
What are you doing?

85
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:19,880
Xi.

86
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:21,750
No matter what,

87
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:24,710
we have to retrieve the heart of the tree.

88
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:25,470
No.

89
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,570
If it's taken from Feng Yin by force,

90
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:29,980
you will die too.

91
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:31,030
Does this mean we we can't

92
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:32,540
get the heart just because of this?

93
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,070
What about reviving the Divine Tree?

94
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,270
What about Linchuan?

95
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,500
Don't worry about

96
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:41,630
tree's heart.

97
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:44,560
I'll think of another way.

98
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:51,040
Actually,

99
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:52,900
as long as I die,

100
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:56,340
you can take back the heart of the tree.

101
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:58,690
Don't even think about it.

102
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,310
What worries you

103
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,560
is the connection between me and Feng Yin.

104
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,690
As long as you get the heart of the tree,

105
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:14,420
you can revive the Divine Tree.

106
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:19,280
It's just possible that tree's heart

107
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,810
can revive the Divine Tree.

108
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,530
But you will definitely die,

109
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:23,870
if it's taken from Feng Yin's body.

110
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,070
I won't risk it

111
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:26,780
with your life.

112
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,740
There's no room for discussion.

113
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,550
Is there any other way?

114
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:31,750
The heart of the tree is

115
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,040
your only way.

116
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,520
Xi.

117
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,320
Don't touch these things

118
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,390
from now on.

119
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,530
Don't try anything stupid.

120
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:03,820
What are you doing?

121
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:05,060
From now on,

122
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:06,750
you are not allowed

123
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:07,790
leave my sight.

124
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:11,780
Today,

125
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:13,910
they even came here in person today.

126
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,810
Why didn't you just kill them?

127
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,540
Are you soft-hearted

128
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,170
or they have something on you?

129
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:26,130
Should I

130
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:26,910
report to you first

131
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:28,430
before I act?

132
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,540
That's not what I mean.

133
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:32,720
Your Majesty, you misunderstood.

134
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:35,840
Without my permission,

135
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:39,309
you cannot enter this place.

136
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,280
I am the Queen.

137
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,250
Why can't I step in?

138
00:08:58,510 --> 00:08:59,630
I see.

139
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:02,520
That's why You Majesty carries

140
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:06,590
a woman's fragrance recently.

141
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:09,000
It turns out...

142
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,270
What?

143
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:14,370
It turns out

144
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,090
you have a new lover.

145
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,700
But it doesn't matter.

146
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:24,940
I just want to be the Queen

147
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,420
and give birth to the prince of Yongzhao.

148
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,010
You can enjoy your time with anyone you like.

149
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:36,010
Get out!

150
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:44,930
Yes, Your Majesty.

151
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,470
How did I become

152
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,020
like this?

153
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:04,480
I am the only prince of Yongzhao.

154
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:07,270
Why?

155
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:10,430
Why did I become

156
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:11,920
like this?

157
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,000
Crazy.

158
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,320
I know you two

159
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:47,520
love each other very much.

160
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,230
But it's just a meal.

161
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,870
It is too much?

162
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:53,800
Let me go.

163
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,220
It's really inconvenient to eat like this.

164
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,760
It's indeed inconvenient to eat.

165
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:01,170
Let me feed you.

166
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:04,730
I can eat it myself.

167
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,310
Shi Ying.

168
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,460
I'm full.

169
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:14,470
Stop eating.

170
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,160
Let's go buy mung bean soup

171
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:17,520
to relieve the disgust.

172
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:19,180
Go by yourself. I'm busy.

173
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:20,310
You're busy?

174
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,910
Don't you go to the clinic at 13: 00?

175
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,820
It's only noon now.

176
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:28,350
I'm busy this afternoon. I won't go to the clinic.

177
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:29,580
Cousin, cousin-in-law.

178
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:30,960
Enjoy your meal.

179
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:36,860
As a doctor,

180
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:37,950
besides treating patients,

181
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:39,880
does she have any other businessn?

182
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,150
A matchmaker

183
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:42,550
introduced several men to Ying.

184
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:43,640
I guess she is going to

185
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,930
meet those men in the afternoon.

186
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:45,930
Blind date?

187
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:51,130
Shi Ying is going on a blind date.

188
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:52,430
Why are you so excited?

189
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,670
How could I be?

190
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:58,480
I'm...

191
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:00,040
just curious.

192
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:01,380
Curious?

193
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:09,740
Xi.

194
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:12,010
Let me see Qing again.

195
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:13,620
He's still a kid.

196
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:14,510
I haven't seen him

197
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:15,590
for days.

198
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:25,270
I just go to see Qing.

199
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:26,730
I won't do anything else.

200
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:27,630
No discussion.

201
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,070
Whatever you do,

202
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:30,830
I will be by your side.

203
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:42,310
Let go of my hand first.

204
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:43,910
Enjoy your meal.

205
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,390
You...

206
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:49,250
What's wrong with you two?

207
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:52,510
Aren't you going to get the heart of the Divine Tree?

208
00:12:58,550 --> 00:12:59,530
Your Highness,

209
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,840
the ceremony hasn't been performed.

210
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,140
It's inappropriate for you

211
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,300
to wear the gown for queen.

212
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,690
Forgive me, Your Highness.

213
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,260
Tomorrow, I will be the Queen

214
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:16,540
of Yongzhao tomorrow.

215
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,180
I'll decide the rules

216
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,990
in the future.

217
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:22,830
Yes.

218
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,240
I'll do my best to serve you,

219
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,140
Your Highness.

220
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:28,100
Long live Your Highness!

221
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:40,990
Helian Xi.

222
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:43,230
This is the strongest rope

223
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:44,190
in Shuoyun.

224
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,090
Change it.

225
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:46,750
Xi Jiu, how come you...

226
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:47,510
Feng Yuan,

227
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:48,150
Helian Xi did nothing wrong

228
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:49,480
in terms of this matter.

229
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:50,440
We can find another way

230
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,830
to recover the Divine Tree.

231
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:53,130
You can't sacrifice yourself

232
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:54,540
to get the heart back

233
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,230
for an uncertain thing.

234
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:08,160
Let's go.

235
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:10,470
I'll accompany you to see Qing.

236
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:16,900
Aunt. Uncle.

237
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:17,760
Your Highness.

238
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,000
Qing, what's wrong?

239
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:20,410
I saw this hairpin

240
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:21,480
in the palace.

241
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:29,220
His Majesty is dead.

242
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:31,640
Let's see who will support you.

243
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:33,430
As the daughter of a sinner,

244
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:35,370
you're even worse than an ordinary palace maid.

245
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:36,820
You deserve it.

246
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:45,340
What are you doing?

247
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,840
Your Highness,

248
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:49,220
Eunuch Mo,

249
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:51,090
we found her stealing in His Majesty's bedroom.

250
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:52,420
She's caught in the act.

251
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:54,180
Hua'e.

252
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:57,430
Why are you still here

253
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:58,630
in my father's bedroom?

254
00:14:58,630 --> 00:14:59,630
Your Highness,

255
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,740
His Majesty helped me a lot.

256
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,050
I

257
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,350
just came

258
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:05,840
to pack some things.

259
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,700
I'm sure what

260
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,960
Hua'e packed

261
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,550
was this hairpin.

262
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,110
The woman with the hairpin?

263
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:14,260
Hua'e.

264
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,420
Helian Xi,

265
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,150
have you said

266
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:17,570
as long as we find this hairpin,

267
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:18,160
we can find a way

268
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,690
to restore the Divine Tree.

269
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:27,750
Xi Jiu.

270
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:29,720
Keep an eye on Yuan.

271
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,470
I’m here. Don’t worry.

272
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,310
What happened?

273
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:19,430
What happened?

274
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:42,070
Don't worry.

275
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,120
Helian Xi will be okay,

276
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,760
and he should be back soon.

277
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,980
Only when I find that hairpin

278
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:49,640
can I feel relieved.

279
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,140
Speaking of the hairpin,

280
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,730
I forgot something.

281
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:00,930
Have you found Hua'e?

282
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:02,240
Is the hairpin hers?

283
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,730
She...

284
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,380
is dead.

285
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,849
What about the hairpin?

286
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:14,560
The hairpin is gone too.

287
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:20,569
How come?

288
00:17:22,349 --> 00:17:23,550
Hua'e.

289
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,230
Why didn't you listen to me?

290
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:27,970
Why didn't you

291
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,610
listen to me?

292
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:36,460
What a pity, my beauty.

293
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:43,310
Your Majesty.

294
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,310
What are you doing here?

295
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:48,350
What am I doing?

296
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:50,790
Can't you tell?

297
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,110
Stop!

298
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,040
If you become like this,

299
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,030
how can I be the Queen?

300
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:04,310
You can continue to be the Queen.

301
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:05,150
It's fine.

302
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:06,270
How can I become

303
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:08,190
the mother of the Crown Prince?

304
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,020
Is it because

305
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:12,060
the heart of tree in Linchuan?

306
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:12,550
Is that the reason that you become

307
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:13,870
so disgusting?

308
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,950
Now is not too late.

309
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:18,290
Go and destroy it.

310
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,450
Did you say

311
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,560
I'm disgusting?

312
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:31,230
Right?

313
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:36,780
Your Majesty.

314
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:39,900
I said something wrong.

315
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:41,810
I'll take my leave.

316
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,030
I'll take my leave.

317
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:49,840
Stop!

318
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,480
Why do you have

319
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:08,300
my mother's hairpin?

320
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:11,580
During the three years when you were away,

321
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,450
I found it

322
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:14,350
when cleaning.

323
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,320
I think it's pretty, so...

324
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:21,550
Here.

325
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,510
Let me see.

326
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:25,610
Is it beautiful?

327
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,690
Your Majesty.

328
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:30,710
I mean

329
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:34,400
I'm afraid that other people

330
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:37,330
won't accept you,

331
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:40,860
and you'll become a laughing stock.

332
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:43,590
It's indeed beautiful.

333
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:44,920
Here.

334
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,280
Let me help you.

335
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:36,650
Hua'e.

336
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:39,380
I told you

337
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,350
I don't need people

338
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,950
to love me in my life.

339
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,020
Power.

340
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:00,590
What I want is

341
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:02,630
power.

342
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:05,020
Anyone in the world

343
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:06,370
can hate me.

344
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,590
Only I

345
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,870
won't despise myself.

346
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:13,290
No matter who I am, how I look,

347
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:15,000
no matter I am a man or woman,

348
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:17,710
I will sit there

349
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:19,730
and be respected by the world.

350
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,150
No one can ever

351
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,620
stop me.
