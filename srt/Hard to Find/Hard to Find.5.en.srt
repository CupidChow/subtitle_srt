00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:40,770
Brush, ink, paper, and inkstone

00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:41,610
are all prepared

6
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:42,490
on your desk.

7
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:43,210
Okay.

8
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,690
Thank you, Miss Qin Sang.

9
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:46,350
You're welcome, Young Madam.

10
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,130
Why...

11
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,800
Why did you suddenly show up?

12
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:51,790
Young Master.

13
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:52,920
You may leave first.

14
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:57,670
Yes.

15
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:03,810
What are you doing?

16
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:04,739
Don't move.

17
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:31,080
Is the twinned branch

18
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:33,830
embedded in her?

19
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,680
Maybe she also embedded the twinned branch

20
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:39,420
into bones for me.

21
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:52,880
Is mine here?

22
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:56,490
You know what I'm doing?

23
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:58,330
I saw you taking

24
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:00,260
the twinned branch out from here.

25
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:01,330
Maybe

26
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,040
mine is also here.

27
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:07,140
Yours

28
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:09,370
can't be here.

29
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,930
Once it gets embedded,

30
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,780
it means you're willing to
trading your life for another.

31
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,570
How can I expect that?

32
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:25,860
I thought you'd do this for me.

33
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,230
Why is it?

34
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:30,270
Right.

35
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,510
If you did that,

36
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:35,660
you wouldn't be standing here alive.

37
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,110
This is the rouge you used before.

38
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:01,870
It's made from the pomegranate flowers of May.

39
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,720
Rouge made from pomegranate flowers.

40
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,630
Qin Sang gave me pomegranate too.

41
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,070
He also gave me

42
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:12,810
the pomegranate earring.

43
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,020
Why are they all pomegranate?

44
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,220
You've had enough rest,

45
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,220
and recovered.

46
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,270
Let's get down to business.

47
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:31,730
This is the brocade box

48
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:33,570
for storing the twinned branches.

49
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:35,540
Now that the Divine Tree has withered,

50
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,870
and the twinned branches inside are gone.

51
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,050
Of course I'll look for the branch.

52
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:44,900
Helian Xi.

53
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,400
I don't care

54
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,630
about the relationship between us before.

55
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:49,390
We don't know each other well now.

56
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:50,490
Men and women are different.

57
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:51,660
Can you knock on the door

58
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,260
before you come in next time?

59
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:05,240
Satisfied?

60
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:10,940
Helian Xi.

61
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,380
The pomegranate earring

62
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,980
you gave me last time is gone.

63
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:15,460
Did you take it?

64
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:18,250
Why are you asking about the
pomegranate earring?

65
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,209
You said

66
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,410
these were all

67
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:21,370
I used before.

68
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:22,770
Is the pomegranate earring

69
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:23,580
very special

70
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,770
in my past?

71
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:25,850
Can you...

72
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:27,100
Nothing special.

73
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,170
You don't need to think about

74
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:33,490
irrelevant things.

75
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,280
Just remember the part

76
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,010
related to the twinned branch.

77
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,640
Both the earring and branch

78
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:43,130
are all related to my past.

79
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:45,030
How is it not important?

80
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,930
I need to know all my past.

81
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,320
I think you forgot

82
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,100
why I kept you alive.

83
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:52,250
I'm not Xi Jiu.

84
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,960
I'm not here to help you regain your memory.

85
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:01,760
Are you avoiding something?

86
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,770
Our past

87
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,130
has nothing to do with finding the branch.

88
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:11,250
You are not me.

89
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,090
How can you make sure

90
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:14,470
whether is it related?

91
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,620
If you're sure it's not related,

92
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:17,210
why do you

93
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:18,290
keep me here?

94
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:21,150
If this is not avoidance,

95
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:22,800
then what do you call it?

96
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:39,180
Young Madam.

97
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:41,150
I'm here to send you the medicine.

98
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:44,810
Qin Sang, come in.

99
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:50,900
Young Master, Young Madam.

100
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:53,170
Miss Dong Li from Prince's mansion said

101
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:54,290
you need to take medicine every day.

102
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:55,620
Drink it while it's hot.

103
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,250
Why do you take medicine every day?

104
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,490
It has nothing to do with the twinned branch.

105
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:09,750
You don't need to know.

106
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:11,260
You...

107
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,050
Well,

108
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:22,270
Sheng from Prince's mansion is here.

109
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:23,440
He wanted to see you.

110
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,780
He should be here

111
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:27,170
to take the portrait of the gangster.

112
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:28,030
I'll go find him

113
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:29,690
and take the medicine later.

114
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:45,770
Qin Sang.

115
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,120
Keep an eye on her.

116
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,170
I'm going out.

117
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:48,909
Yes.

118
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:01,060
It's cold and hard to find.

119
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:01,890
No wonder the guards have searched

120
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:04,020
for a long time but haven't found them.

121
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,160
Sheng.

122
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:13,590
Your Highness.

123
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:15,410
Sheng, I've drawn

124
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:17,070
the portrait of the gangster.

125
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:19,250
Thank you, Your Highness.

126
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,170
Your Highness, I...

127
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:26,260
I can't tell anything from this.

128
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:29,460
Why not?

129
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,190
The outline of the mask, straw hat,

130
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:37,630
mouth and eyes are clear.

131
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:40,270
The clues are so clear.

132
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,240
What?

133
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,090
You guards still can't find him?

134
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:44,860
Sheng.

135
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:47,090
How is the Crown Prince?

136
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:49,500
Oh, right.

137
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:50,350
Your Highness.

138
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:53,350
Crown Prince is imprisoned
in the dungeon by the King.

139
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:07,500
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

140
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:11,410
It's none of your business.

141
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:12,530
Keep going.

142
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:14,010
I don't believe

143
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:16,200
he can kill me.

144
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,830
G ahead!

145
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:23,700
Who are you beating

146
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,170
with this whip?

147
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:25,780
Don't you know

148
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:26,800
the King loves the Crown Prince?

149
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,000
Just act like you did.

150
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,620
Commander Sheng.

151
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:31,780
The King said

152
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:32,960
I can't stop until the Crown Prince

153
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,150
agrees to break off the engagement.

154
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:34,860
You...

155
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:35,870
Sheng.

156
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:37,950
Young Master.

157
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,320
Let him continue.

158
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:42,030
I won’t break off the engagement

159
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,130
before Liang Chan regains her memory.

160
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:48,290
Sheng,

161
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:49,870
take me to see the King now.

162
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:50,570
OK.

163
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,000
Young Madam, Young Master asked me...

164
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,780
Qin Sang.

165
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,000
I have to go.

166
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:56,060
Let's go.

167
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:56,760
Go.

168
00:08:58,490 --> 00:08:59,790
I’ll go with you.

169
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:04,820
Your Majesty.

170
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:05,900
Someone wanted to see you.

171
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:06,890
If anyone pleads for him,

172
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:08,090
just put them in jail.

173
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:09,150
Your Majesty.

174
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,410
He's not here to plead.

175
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:11,530
He said

176
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,850
he's from Linchuan.

177
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,390
He must see you.

178
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:16,410
Linchuan.

179
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:34,950
You are...

180
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:41,600
I‘m Helian Xi

181
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,030
from Linchuan.

182
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:44,530
The King's temper

183
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:45,700
is just like the Crown Prince.

184
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:46,490
It's not easy to let him

185
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:47,950
release the Crown Prince.

186
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:56,510
My nephew,

187
00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:00,510
do you want to ask me to use
the secret planchette writing skill?

188
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:01,430
Yes.

189
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:03,860
If this is

190
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:06,520
very important to Linchuan's resurrection,

191
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:07,410
I'll

192
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:10,190
use the secret planchette writing skill.

193
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,250
I heard

194
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,100
all the Kings

195
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,030
can only use it once in their lives.

196
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,220
Are you really willing to use it?

197
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,680
I owe Linchuan a favor

198
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,840
for many years.

199
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:24,150
I should repay you with this.

200
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:26,770
Wait for me.

201
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:28,420
I’ll go get the planchette.

202
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:29,740
Wait, Your Majesty.

203
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,300
You seem to get something to hide.

204
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:37,020
Is it related to
the secret planchette writing skill?

205
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,490
The secret planchette writing skill...

206
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,750
The secret planchette writing skill

207
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,950
will backfire on the person who uses it.

208
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:11,490
I owe

209
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,080
Linchuan.

210
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:24,530
Saving you

211
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:25,860
was Linchuan's choice.

212
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:26,970
I didn't come here

213
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:28,390
to weaponize gratitude.

214
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:32,290
The disappearance of Linchuan has nothing to do with Shuoyun.

215
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:33,130
Of course

216
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:34,530
you don't need to

217
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:36,990
take the consequences of the resurrection.

218
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,330
How do you resurrect Linchuan?

219
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:45,730
It is my responsibility.

220
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,350
I will find a way.

221
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:48,920
Sorry to bother you.

222
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:50,630
I'll be going.

223
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,150
Why are you here?

224
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:03,540
Helian Xi.

225
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,730
Why are you here?

226
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:07,670
Your Majesty.

227
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:12,210
Liang Chan.

228
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:13,520
How do you

229
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:15,660
know the Young Master of Linchuan?

230
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,290
Your Majesty.

231
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:22,720
I’m here for something important.

232
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,080
Please spare the Crown Prince.

233
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,150
If he doesn't want to
break off the engagement,

234
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:25,970
I'll do it.

235
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:27,340
You? How?

236
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,430
What does she want to do?

237
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,040
I know my son.

238
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:34,720
If he was willing to
break off the engagement,

239
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,480
he wouldn't insist on marrying you.

240
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,880
And he wouldn't have been imprisoned by me.

241
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,230
In Shuoyun's marriage custom,

242
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,190
if one person insists on
breaking off the engagement,

243
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:44,910
then they can also break off the engagement.

244
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:46,500
I'll break off the engagement.

245
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,760
According to the rule,

246
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:48,920
the one who breaks off the engagement

247
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,960
will be punished for treachery.

248
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:52,890
You need to endure 3 days of exposure to sun and rain,

249
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:54,820
and deprivation of food and drink.

250
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:55,970
Do you know that?

251
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:57,870
I do.

252
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,300
Are you still willing to
break off the engagement?

253
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:05,000
The engagement

254
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,950
was agreed by me.

255
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:08,520
The chaos on the wedding day

256
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:10,050
was also caused by me.

257
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:12,100
If I want to break off the engagement,

258
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,080
I should

259
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,370
take the punishment.

260
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,900
Why are you here?

261
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:13,540
I don't care

262
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:15,320
whether you break off the engagement.

263
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,850
Why do you want to take this?

264
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,110
I'm not doing this

265
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:21,860
for you.

266
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:24,790
Since it's all because of me,

267
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:27,260
even if Xi Jiu hasn't been imprisoned

268
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:28,870
in the dungeon,

269
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,880
I still have to break off the engagement.

270
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,470
I can plead for you

271
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,630
and spare your punishment.

272
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,370
I'm just taking

273
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:45,090
what I should have.

274
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,510
People have to pay the price

275
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:49,920
for their choices.

276
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,890
It's just physical pain.

277
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,040
Feng Yuan.

278
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,300
Is the one who lost memory

279
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,060
the real you?

280
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,530
Have you ever

281
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:32,540
revealed yourself

282
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:33,890
in front of me?

283
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:27,660
If you were really like this,

284
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:29,780
why did you

285
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,220
do that 3 years ago?

286
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:34,430
How much

287
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,500
of your past

288
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,580
is real?

289
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:46,160
No stars.

290
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:48,310
I could accept it.

291
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:51,210
But how come

292
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:53,890
there's no moonlight?

293
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,190
Stars.

294
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:24,050
Go.

295
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:16,820
Your Highness!

296
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:18,670
Your Highness.

297
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:22,720
How did he treat you?

298
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:24,240
You should have gone easier on him.

299
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,200
You hit him so hard.

300
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:25,990
Sheng.

301
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,250
Don't open the lock.

302
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,750
I can take it.

303
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,620
Your Highness,

304
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:30,440
you misunderstood.

305
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,100
The King asked me to let you go.

306
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:33,830
Impossible.

307
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,800
He didn't get what he wanted.

308
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:38,990
He would never let me out.

309
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:40,410
Yes.

310
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,920
The Crown Princess came to
break off the engagement,

311
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,590
so he agreed to let you go.

312
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:47,490
Now,

313
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:49,980
she's taking the punishment for
breaking off the engagement.

314
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,550
No one can stop her.

315
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:52,990
Your Highness.

316
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:25,290
One more day.

317
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:27,810
Can you hold on?

318
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,800
Your Highness, the King's order.

319
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:33,670
If you don’t want to fight, move.

320
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,540
Whatever.

321
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:42,670
Take her away first.

322
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,590
What are you doing here?

323
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,060
Why are you here?

324
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:55,210
Her life is important to me.

325
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,130
Of course I have to stay here.

326
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,760
She is very important to you?

327
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:00,900
And you let her be punished here.

328
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,630
How much do you hate her?

329
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:03,590
Could it be

330
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:06,530
she who caused the extermination of your tribe?

331
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:09,030
It's between us.

332
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:10,640
What do you know?

333
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,320
This engagement

334
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:12,850
is

335
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:14,150
between us.

336
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:15,900
If you can't take care of her,

337
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,140
I can do it!
