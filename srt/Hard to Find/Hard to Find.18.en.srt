1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:27,480
[Hard to find]

3
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:30,470
[18]

4
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:46,020
Come in.

5
00:00:58,380 --> 00:00:59,140
Liang Chan.

6
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,530
What’s wrong with you?

7
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,550
You've been acting strange since you woke up.

8
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:05,890
This box

9
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:07,940
was used

10
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:09,670
to store the Twinned Branches.

11
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:11,460
Helian Xi

12
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:15,210
handed it over to me.

13
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,380
In order to revive Linchuan,

14
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:30,860
he looked for it for three years.

15
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,050
Unfortunately, there are no Twinned Branches anymore.

16
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,300
You are really

17
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:46,340
not Liang Chan anymore.

18
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:23,620
Your Majesty.

19
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,420
Your eyes...

20
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,400
Please take a seat.

21
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:39,620
Once Planchette is opened,

22
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,920
it can't be reversed.

23
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:43,100
Planchette can show the past

24
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,230
and future.

25
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:45,970
It requires blood as the catalyst

26
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:47,700
to solve your doubts.

27
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,140
Give it to me.

28
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:55,980
From now on,

29
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:58,820
think about the person you want to see.

30
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,000
Xi.

31
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,420
I'm sorry.

32
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,580
But only in this way

33
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,580
will Feng Yin let me take you away.

34
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,420
Don't worry.

35
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:16,899
I will

36
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,620
return you to Linchuan.

37
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,340
Twinned Branches.

38
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:37,840
Your Highness.

39
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,300
We're about to leave Yongzhao Realm.

40
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,020
Shuyun is just ahead.

41
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:43,820
According to the rules,

42
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,820
Yongzhao army can't enter Shuoyun.

43
00:04:47,159 --> 00:04:49,740
Search every inch.

44
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,780
Feng Yuan has no place

45
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:53,220
to hide.

46
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:54,260
Search!

47
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:55,340
Yes.

48
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:56,659
Search!

49
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,140
We have to distract them.

50
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:05,630
The further, the better.

51
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,230
Sister.

52
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,460
Stop it.

53
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,420
You can't escape.

54
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,060
Tell me where

55
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:50,190
Helian Xi's body is.

56
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:51,820
I'll spare your life

57
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,790
since you're my sister.

58
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:55,980
I've given you what you want.

59
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:57,580
You promised to let the three of us

60
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,700
to die together.

61
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:01,940
Feng Yuan,

62
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,020
you are really smart.

63
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,380
Do you think

64
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,740
I can't get in

65
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,820
just because you've changed the entrance?

66
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,390
If I'm not mistaken,

67
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,300
Yongzhao's cavalry

68
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,230
should have entered Linchuan.

69
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,500
What are you talking about?

70
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,980
Do you want to know

71
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:21,860
how I opened

72
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,320
the entrance of Linchuan?

73
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,060
Okay.

74
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:25,620
I'll tell you

75
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:26,980
before you die.

76
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:28,700
Even the General of Yongzhao State,

77
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,580
Wu Fei,

78
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,460
can get in.

79
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,140
How can I not be curious?

80
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,060
So,

81
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,850
I opened his tomb

82
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,260
and his coffin.

83
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:40,670
In his bones,

84
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,060
I found a small branch.

85
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:44,580
This branch

86
00:06:44,659 --> 00:06:46,260
must be very special, right?

87
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,860
So the entrance to Linchuan

88
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,140
was opened by it.

89
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,860
You resent our father

90
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:55,290
and me.

91
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,420
But why Linchuan?

92
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,310
Why did you invade Linchuan?

93
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,980
You said it was an invasion.

94
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,120
Do I need a reason to invade?

95
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,750
You're crazy.

96
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,780
I'm not just crazy.

97
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:14,860
I will soon be

98
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,900
the king of Yongzhao soon.

99
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:18,740
Your beloved father won't

100
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,060
pass the throne to me.

101
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:22,340
I'll get it myself,

102
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:25,150
and definitely do better and longer than him.

103
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:29,640
Enough, Feng Yuan.

104
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:31,290
Stop struggling.

105
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,380
You can't escape.

106
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:56,940
Xi is waiting for me.

107
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,940
I can't die in their hands.

108
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,280
Yuan.

109
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:06,730
What is that?

110
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,090
Yuan.

111
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:22,780
Yuan.

112
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,520
No!

113
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:29,380
These

114
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,100
are the past

115
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,270
of your beloved one.

116
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:54,780
The answer you're looking for

117
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:56,740
should be among them.

118
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:01,320
Everything of the past turned out

119
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,260
to be like this.

120
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:11,390
Thank you for your help. Your Majesty.

121
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:12,820
I will

122
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,420
never forget that.

123
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:23,840
So many things happened

124
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,090
between you two.

125
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:28,350
The branches are gone.

126
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:30,670
Linchuan

127
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:32,260
can't be revived.

128
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:34,650
Yin Qiao.

129
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:35,780
Wu Qing.

130
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:38,980
All the people can't come back.

131
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,740
But you did it to save him.

132
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:46,900
I can never

133
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,780
atone for my sins.

134
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,180
I'll make

135
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,680
some tea.

136
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,840
So you didn't die

137
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,360
because of half of the branch

138
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,810
is in your heart.

139
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:48,340
You sacrificed your life to save me.

140
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,180
Now,

141
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,580
we can meet again.

142
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,880
I won't let anyone

143
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,580
hurt you anymore.

144
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:52,660
What's wrong?

145
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,990
It must be painful

146
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:09,870
when the you got hurt by the needle.

147
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:17,470
When you were stabbed by that dagger,

148
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:23,110
was it painful?

149
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:26,650
I'm sorry.

150
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:29,580
I'm sorry.

151
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,660
The branch is gone.

152
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:36,100
The branch is gone.

153
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,440
I'm sorry.

154
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:41,160
I know.

155
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,140
I'm sorry.

156
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:47,000
I know.

157
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,360
Hurry, prepare the medicine.

158
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,780
Is there no other way?

159
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,460
What happened?

160
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:27,410
The king's eyes are injured.

161
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:28,660
The doctor said

162
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:31,790
he probably can’t gain his sight again.

163
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:37,530
What’s wrong with your eyes?

164
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:40,730
Why are you yelling at this hour?

165
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,220
You may leave.

166
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:45,900
What happened?

167
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,650
This is the price

168
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:52,070
of using secret planchette writing skill.

169
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:58,580
Father.

170
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,680
I'm sorry.

171
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,270
Why are you crying?

172
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,150
It's not a big deal.

173
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:06,780
I didn't lose my arms or legs.

174
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:08,580
But father,

175
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:09,990
you are blind.

176
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:23,880
You, you piss me off.

177
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:25,040
You bad son.

178
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,390
Be good to me in the future.

179
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:27,440
Don't make a fuss.

180
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,920
It's giving me a headache.

181
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:36,370
In the past,

182
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:38,750
I told you

183
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:41,250
The skill is forbidden by our ancestors,

184
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:43,140
which is used to tell the fortune of our country.

185
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,420
The price is paid.

186
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,290
This is telling the rulers

187
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:47,660
to work hard

188
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:49,260
and don't use this skill

189
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,460
randomly.

190
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:54,900
Son,

191
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:58,750
have you kept this in mind?

192
00:15:58,750 --> 00:15:59,900
Yes.

193
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,930
Yes.

194
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:24,380
Do you have no appetite?

195
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:30,470
Without Twinned Branches,

196
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,760
how can we revive the Divine Tree?

197
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,180
What about the people of Linchuan?

198
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:38,100
I didn't know

199
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,900
there was a second heart before.

200
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:41,820
The hope of reviving the Divine Tree was

201
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,100
on the branches.

202
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,140
Maybe

203
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:47,470
waking two hearts of trees at the same time

204
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,310
can resurrect the Divine Tree.

205
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:51,820
Really?

206
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:53,460
We can try.

207
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,260
The person who kidnapped me back in the Cloud Cliff

208
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,980
was Feng Yin.

209
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,660
I saw his face.

210
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,880
He stole the heart of the tree.

211
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:05,020
It seems that

212
00:17:05,849 --> 00:17:07,339
the person I killed

213
00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:08,540
in Yongzhao Palace

214
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:11,180
was just a substitute.

215
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:13,180
When my father was alive,

216
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:15,220
Feng Yin secretly

217
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:17,060
formed an army.

218
00:17:17,859 --> 00:17:18,990
It's something that

219
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,500
he would do that.

220
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:22,300
Xi,

221
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:23,540
let's go to the Cloud Cliff

222
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:24,290
to find Fengnan.

223
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:26,260
Then we can get the heart of the tree back.

224
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:26,940
No.

225
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,140
Me

226
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:31,840
Qin Sang,

227
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:32,880
and Xi Jiu

228
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,030
have all been there.

229
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:36,470
Feng Yin and those soldiers

230
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,780
have gone missing.

231
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,140
That place is just

232
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,350
between Shuoyun and Yongzhao.

233
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,300
Feng Yin wants to be

234
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,780
the king of Yongzhao so badly.

235
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:44,410
He will

236
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:45,740
keep an eye on Yongzhao.

237
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,220
He left Shuoyun,

238
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,980
and will definitively return to Yongzhao.

239
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,310
I'm going to pack up now.

240
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:52,650
Let's go to Yongzhao to find Feng Yin.

241
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:56,390
Since it's the tree heart of Linchuan,

242
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:58,740
I will get it back.

243
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:00,220
Yongzhao has brought you

244
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,350
too many disasters.

245
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:03,660
Besides, Feng Yin

246
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:05,060
is probably there.

247
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,050
Just stay in Shuoyun

248
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:08,140
and wait for me.

249
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:09,990
I will find a way to save

250
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,000
the Divine Tree and Linchuan.

251
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:13,380
You don't need to feel

252
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,590
this is your thing.

253
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:15,620
Trust me.

254
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,830
You haven't eaten anything

255
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:20,500
since last night.

256
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:22,540
Let's eat first.

257
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,580
But I'm the Young Madam of Linchuan.

258
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:28,380
I have to take responsibility

259
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:30,110
of Linchuan's past and future.

260
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:34,540
Xi,

261
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:37,610
for the past three years,

262
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,200
you've been traveling alone.

263
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:41,970
I'm your wife.

264
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:44,360
Let me stay by your side.

265
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,830
Always by your side.

266
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:47,340
Okay?

267
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:49,980
Okay.

268
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,580
Before we leave,

269
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:58,690
why did you want to come here?

270
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:00,500
I've lived here for so long,

271
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:02,780
and so many things have happened,

272
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:03,770
I also saw

273
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:05,660
the first snow in my life.

274
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,760
Suddenly having to leave,

275
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,990
I just feel a bit reluctant.

276
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:13,340
I'm worried this is like

277
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:15,070
leaving Linchuan at that time.

278
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:17,740
I hope it's not

279
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:20,820
leaving for good.

280
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,200
Next time it snows,

281
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,740
I'll bring you back

282
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:37,070
to watch the snow with you.

283
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,100
All right.

284
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:50,420
Let's go.

285
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:52,410
Let's go back and say goodbye to Xi Jiu.
