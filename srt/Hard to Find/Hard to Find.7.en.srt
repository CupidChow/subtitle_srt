00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:26,980
[Hard To Find]

3
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:30,000
[7]

4
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:31,160
Young Madam.

5
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:32,070
Today's pomegranates

6
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:33,310
are sweeter than yesterday's.

7
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:34,030
Try some.

8
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:38,270
Qin Sang.

9
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:39,770
You don't have to peel pomegranates

10
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:40,900
for me in the future.

11
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:42,550
I can do it myself if I want.

12
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:44,470
No, the Young Master is not here,

13
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:46,400
and I have to take good care of you.

14
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:47,790
Qin Sang.

15
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:50,100
Why are you

16
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,560
always so nice to me?

17
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:53,940
Because you gave me

18
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:55,090
true warmth.

19
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:56,680
Because you are

20
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,280
the Young Madam of Linchuan.

21
00:00:58,930 --> 00:00:59,730
Alright.

22
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:02,140
By the way,

23
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:04,120
where is Helian Xi?

24
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:05,269
I haven't seen him

25
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:06,480
for days.

26
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:09,070
I still have something to ask him.

27
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:10,690
The Young Master went to Yongzhao.

28
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:11,610
Yongzhao?

29
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:14,280
Why did he go there?

30
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:17,770
Please forgive me, Young Madam.

31
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:19,090
I can't say much.

32
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:22,470
It's okay.

33
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:24,440
When he comes back,

34
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:25,740
I'll ask him.

35
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,570
Young Madam.

36
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:32,220
Maybe you can regain your memory

37
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,080
when the Young Master comes back.

38
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:36,350
He's been trying to find a way to heal you.

39
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,370
The last time it rained so heavily

40
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,259
was the day that you called off the engagement

41
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:57,400
and were punished on the execution ground.

42
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,259
Did it rain a lot that day?

43
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:00,560
I remember

44
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:02,050
it only rained for a while.

45
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:06,270
Of course, there was no rain under the umbrella.

46
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,480
Under the umbrella?

47
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:46,630
Your Highness.

48
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,700
Should we also put away these hairpins?

49
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:52,490
For the past three years,

50
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:54,590
I never really know

51
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:55,950
what she really likes.

52
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:57,950
I could only give her

53
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:59,520
one hairpin after another.

54
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:01,070
Dong Li.

55
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,270
Any news from the Nanzhi Manor?

56
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:04,270
How is her injury?

57
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,550
Your Highness, please don't worry.

58
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:06,790
Miss Qin Sang told me

59
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:08,390
that Miss Liang Chan

60
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:09,470
was not seriously injured.

61
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:10,620
If you're worried about her,

62
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:11,750
you can go visit her.

63
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,000
Forget it.

64
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:16,340
You find an opportunity to check on her.

65
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:17,320
If she needs

66
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:19,000
those,

67
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:21,280
find some time to send them to her as well.

68
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:22,920
Yes.

69
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,630
When you came,

70
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,410
you only had this hairpin with you.

71
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,790
You really wanted to

72
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,220
give it to me, didn't you?

73
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:01,210
You saved me,

74
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:02,210
and I've been staying in your manor, disturbing you

75
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:04,100
for more than three months.

76
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,970
Now that I've recovered,

77
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,150
it's time to say goodbye.

78
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,590
Although you've recovered,

79
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:09,760
you're still weak.

80
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:11,200
You need to recuperate.

81
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:14,290
If I really want to recover something,

82
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:16,019
I want to regain my memory.

83
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:17,310
But now,

84
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:19,760
I don't even know

85
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:20,829
who I am

86
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:22,270
or my name.

87
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,300
Liang Chan.

88
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:49,490
Your eyes

89
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,050
are like the moon in autumn.

90
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,520
How about I give you a name,

91
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:53,990
Liang Chan?

92
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,250
It means the moon in the autumn.

93
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:02,220
Liang Chan.

94
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:06,260
But

95
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:09,050
I still don't know...

96
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:12,930
Your Highness!

97
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:14,170
Your Highness!

98
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:15,670
Your Highness!

99
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:18,470
Commander Sheng.

100
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:20,420
-Your Highness!
-We can't move him hastily.

101
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,670
Did he

102
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:23,210
have any emergencies?

103
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:24,560
The time about two months ago,

104
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,450
while hunting on the hunting ground,

105
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,490
the horse got frightened,

106
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:27,610
causing His Highness to fall down

107
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:28,920
and sustain some minor injuries.

108
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,630
And a few days ago,

109
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:30,930
he said he felt dizzy several times.

110
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,850
Dong Li, go get the physician!

111
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,640
Yes.

112
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:35,340
Commander Sheng.

113
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,000
Help me undress His Highness.

114
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,159
Hurry!

115
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:45,990
The extravasated blood has been inside him for a long time,

116
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:47,220
causing blockages in his meridians.

117
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,070
We can't wait for the physician.

118
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,710
Commander Sheng, give me the dagger.

119
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:50,350
What?

120
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:51,510
Hurry up!

121
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:54,820
Miss!

122
00:05:57,659 --> 00:05:58,540
Your Highness!

123
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:08,710
Your Highness.

124
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:09,640
What is it?

125
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:11,710
We caught the assassin.

126
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,010
Where did you catch him?

127
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:23,450
A noodle stall in the market.

128
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:24,540
The stall owner said

129
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:26,340
that he saw the mask next to him.

130
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:29,200
No honest person would wear a mask.

131
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:43,950
Tell us.

132
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:46,730
Why did you

133
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:49,630
keep assassinating my Crown Princess?

134
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,080
I didn't mean to kill her

135
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:53,200
but to look for her.

136
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,350
For what?

137
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:01,580
She is...

138
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,160
She is...

139
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,220
Tell me.

140
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,990
Who is she?

141
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:16,000
She is Feng Yuan,

142
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,020
the princess of our Yongzhao.

143
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,310
You are indeed not

144
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,800
one of us.

145
00:07:36,909 --> 00:07:37,670
Tell me.

146
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,270
Why are you looking for her?

147
00:07:40,909 --> 00:07:42,640
To kill Helian Xi.

148
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,190
Back then, Helian Xi

149
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,560
slaughtered the Yongzhao Palace.

150
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:47,810
He said

151
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:49,570
that he wouldn't let a single member

152
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:51,300
of the royal family of Feng off.

153
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:02,010
If you dare to make up a lie,

154
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,800
I'll cut off your tongue.

155
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,280
It's been days.

156
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,730
He hasn't come back yet.

157
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:51,520
Helian Xi.

158
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:55,110
Young Master

159
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,320
[Helian Xi; Twinned Branch; Young Master of Linchuan]

160
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,800
of Linchuan.

161
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:01,970
He called me

162
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:03,990
Feng Yuan.

163
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,220
If I am his wife,

164
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:16,700
my identity will be...

165
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,090
Remove her veil.

166
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,310
If she is the princess,

167
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:22,900
kill her on the spot.

168
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:31,250
[Helian Xi; Twinned Branch; Young Master of Linchuan; Feng Yuan]

169
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:32,880
Qin Sang?

170
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,720
Qin Sang!

171
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:44,380
Qin Sang?

172
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,780
That night,

173
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:56,550
you were the one who held an umbrella for me.

174
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:02,880
Why are you looking for Qin Sang

175
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,300
in such a hurry?

176
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,910
You will do.

177
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,160
I want to ask you.

178
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,860
Am I a princess of a state

179
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,020
before we got married?

180
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:17,290
Do you remember anything?

181
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,720
Nothing.

182
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:21,350
I just remembered

183
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:22,560
that the assassin that day

184
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,800
mentioned that I was a princess.

185
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,690
So, I wanted to ask you.

186
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:28,390
Your memory

187
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,350
can only be recalled by yourself.

188
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:32,830
I can't.

189
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:34,150
That's why I'm asking you.

190
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:35,020
Don't worry.

191
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,990
You'll remember soon.

192
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:40,710
What is this?

193
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,500
Amber of the Divine Tree,

194
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:44,390
formed from the sap of the Divine Tree, dripping to the ground,

195
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:45,870
where it has been buried for a thousand years.

196
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,250
Since there are only three pieces of Amber,

197
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,750
since the establishment of Linchuan.

198
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,300
This is the last one.

199
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,390
It can cure all kinds of difficult diseases.

200
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:54,720
Take it,

201
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:56,230
and you may

202
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:58,010
regain your memory.

203
00:11:58,270 --> 00:11:59,710
Maybe?

204
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:03,450
Has it cured amnesia before?

205
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:05,430
No.

206
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,130
But we can give it a go.

207
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:12,300
Liang Chan!

208
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,460
You can't eat anything from him.

209
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:15,390
Xi Jiu?

210
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:16,290
Why are you here?

211
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:17,090
Crown Prince.

212
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:18,970
The engagement between you and her has been canceled.

213
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:20,390
Why did you come here?

214
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:21,910
I said

215
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,600
that I would protect her

216
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:25,720
until she regained her memory.

217
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:27,280
Liang Chan,

218
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,240
even if we are not engaged anymore,

219
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,070
after three years of spending time together,

220
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:31,590
are we friends?

221
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,490
Of course, we are friends.

222
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:34,410
That's good.

223
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:35,910
As a friend of Liang Chan,

224
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:37,030
I

225
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,200
came to the Nanzhi Manor as a guest

226
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,310
to protect her.

227
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,810
What's wrong with that?

228
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,550
Stay if you want.

229
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:43,950
Give it back to me.

230
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:45,710
I want to use it

231
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:47,710
to help Feng Yuan regain her memory.

232
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,610
This thing of yours is very strange.

233
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:51,490
I

234
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:52,660
can only let her take it

235
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:53,610
once I test it nontoxic.

236
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:54,410
Crown Prince.

237
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,570
I have no time for this.

238
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:57,910
Give it back to me.

239
00:12:58,190 --> 00:12:58,950
Otherwise,

240
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:00,880
don't blame me for hurting you.

241
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,090
I'm not afraid of you.

242
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,620
Enough.

243
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:07,540
I want to regain my memory.

244
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:09,960
Whether I take it or not, or when I take it,

245
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:11,070
it's none

246
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:12,010
of your business.

247
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:13,470
I'll make my own decision.

248
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,670
Xi Jiu.

249
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,350
Give me the Amber.

250
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:18,250
I'll keep it.

251
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:19,390
Okay?

252
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:37,510
When the Amber helps her regain her memory,

253
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,580
the truth

254
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:42,350
will be revealed.

255
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:46,190
Liang Chan.

256
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:48,450
If you have anything to say,

257
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:49,380
just say it

258
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:50,140
in front of Helian Xi.

259
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,050
You don't have to be afraid of him.

260
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:52,380
I'm not.

261
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,720
I just want to ask

262
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:55,280
if something happened,

263
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,420
since you suddenly came here

264
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,020
and asked to stay.

265
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:01,630
Liang Chan.

266
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:02,910
You were...

267
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:07,820
Xi Jiu.

268
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,540
If Miss Liang Chan

269
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:11,100
is really Helian Xi's wife,

270
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:12,420
she would be Feng Yuan,

271
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,060
the Princess of Yongzhao.

272
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,230
Princess of Yongzhao, Feng Yuan?

273
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,200
Yes.

274
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:19,200
Three years ago,

275
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:21,080
the Linchuan clan disappeared mysteriously.

276
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,320
Yongzhao had a coup.

277
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,040
The late king passed away due to illness.

278
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,060
His eldest son, Feng Yin,

279
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,610
was slaughtered in the palace hall.

280
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:28,340
Princess Feng Yuan is missing.

281
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:30,940
[Note]

282
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,960
Yongzhao Palace Coup.

283
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:38,200
The royal family of Feng was slaughtered.

284
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:40,170
The Linchuan clan has fallen.

285
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:42,580
But Helian Xi is alive

286
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,980
and has found Liang Chan.

287
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:46,520
He wants to help her regain her memory

288
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:49,260
and retrieve the mysterious objects.

289
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,040
They must have

290
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:52,150
formed

291
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:53,510
an indelible grudge.

292
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,240
If Helian Xi wants to destroy the Feng clan,

293
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:58,280
he won't let Liang Chan off.

294
00:14:58,970 --> 00:14:59,730
Xi Jiu.

295
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,130
Xi Jiu?

296
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,060
What's wrong?

297
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:05,260
Nothing.

298
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,850
I'm here because I'm afraid

299
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,680
that Helian Xi might hurt you.

300
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:10,770
Don't worry.

301
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:11,870
After that,

302
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:13,290
he never hurt me again.

303
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:15,970
And he's watching out for my well-being.

304
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:17,890
That's because he has an ulterior motive.

305
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:18,810
No matter what,

306
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:20,160
I must protect you here.

307
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,010
Crown Prince,

308
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,680
since you're a guest at my Nanzhi Manor,

309
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,680
why did you bring

310
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:33,040
so many guards with you?

311
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:34,890
Your Nanzhi Manor?

312
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:37,230
Every mountain in Shuoyun,

313
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:38,550
every piece of land, and every river

314
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:39,830
belong to me.

315
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,270
Since the Nanzhi Manor

316
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:42,430
is located in Shuoyun,

317
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:43,110
do I need to report

318
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,550
how many people I'm bringing

319
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:46,010
and what I want to do to you?

320
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:46,870
Liang Chan.

321
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:47,710
Let’s go.

322
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:48,510
I...

323
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:53,690
Young Master.

324
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:54,840
Qin Sang.

325
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:56,780
Go check

326
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,020
if something unknown

327
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,030
happened

328
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:00,270
when I was away.

329
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,050
Yes.

330
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,890
Helian Xi, are you asleep?

331
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:26,220
Helian Xi?

332
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:27,550
Are you there?

333
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:40,940
Qin Sang.

334
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,660
Where is Helian Xi?

335
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,680
Young Master didn't go out today.

336
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:49,110
He must be in his room.

337
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,450
I didn't see any light in his room.

338
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,600
Is he asleep?

339
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:55,970
Young Master doesn't like...

340
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:02,920
Young Master likes to sleep in the dark.

341
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:06,180
But he won't go to bed

342
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:07,520
at this hour.

343
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:09,010
You can check it out again.

344
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:11,319
Okay, I'll look for him again.

345
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:22,760
Helian Xi.

346
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:25,099
If you don't make a sound,

347
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,500
I'll just come in.

348
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,610
What are you doing here?

349
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:47,290
I think

350
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:48,310
you may not want to

351
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:49,290
have dinner with Xi Jiu at the same table.

352
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:50,140
So,

353
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,790
I brought you some food.

354
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:55,270
Why did you

355
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:56,710
bring me food today all of a sudden?

356
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:57,790
Nothing.

357
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:00,910
It's just a reciprocity for your courtesy.

358
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:02,270
What do you mean?

359
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,950
The

360
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:06,170
osmanthus-flavored soap.

361
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:08,170
Or maybe there are things

362
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:09,790
I don't know about,

363
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,160
like someone holding an umbrella for me.

364
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,550
It's so dark. How can you eat?

365
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:46,510
You go out first.

366
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:47,670
I'll eat out later.

367
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:08,490
Young Master.

368
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:09,640
What did you find?

369
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,490
Sheng caught the assassin long ago

370
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:12,800
and locked him up in the dungeon.

371
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,330
Xi Jiu caught the assassin?

372
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,000
Why didn't he say something?

373
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,660
He didn't even tell Feng Yuan.

374
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,480
I stole this

375
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:23,440
from Sheng.

376
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:39,160
Why is the Crown Prince of Shuoyun

377
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,030
investigating the Yongzhao Palace Coup

378
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:44,070
that occurred three years ago?

379
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:47,020
Since

380
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:48,620
we want to eat together,

381
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:50,340
let's get along.

382
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,370
Wait!

383
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,360
What's wrong?

384
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:02,470
Test if the food is poisoned.

385
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:05,230
You don't need to roast it on a candle to test it.

386
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:06,700
And silver needles can only detect poisons

387
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:07,820
like arsenic.

388
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:09,570
If I really want to poison you,

389
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:11,450
you won't be able to find out.

390
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:13,510
No poison

391
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:15,710
is more harmful than your sharp tongue.

392
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,660
All right, let's eat.

393
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:32,450
I don't want to.

394
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:34,060
I'll go get some tea.

395
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:36,350
You guys eat. I'll go.
