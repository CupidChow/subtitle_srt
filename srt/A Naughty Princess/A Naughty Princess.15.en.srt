1
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,600
Strong.

2
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,400
Lianxiang!

3
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,840
Your Highness!

4
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,840
Why are you here?

5
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,280
What is it?

6
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:15,880
Lianxiang.

7
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,600
Are you alright?

8
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,840
I'm fine.

9
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:24,400
Your Highness, my jade pendant is with the Princess.

10
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,360
It was Qin Ziyuan.

11
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,080
He bought the pendant from the pawnshop.

12
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,810
And gave it to Princess Yongyi.

13
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,039
This Qin Ziyuan

14
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,090
has truly betrayed us completely.

15
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,560
But Princess Yongyi,

16
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:41,320
why is she so interested in this case?

17
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,880
What exactly happened at Cuiyu Manor?

18
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,800
Your Highness, you look cute when you're serious.

19
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,040
I...

20
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,440
I know, you can't tell me.

21
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,320
It's alright.

22
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,320
Lianxiang.

23
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,640
I came here to tell you something.

24
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,800
Qin Ziyuan already knows that Wang Bo is in our custody.

25
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,120
So you must be careful

26
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,690
and don't tell her where Wang Bo is hidden.

27
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,840
Yes, I understand.

28
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,120
Don't worry.

29
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,079
Tomorrow is the Princess's birthday.

30
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:32,040
Then I can return to your mansion with you.

31
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,360
What's wrong?

32
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,120
You couldn't be

33
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,740
missing me, could you?

34
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,720
I do miss you.

35
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,610
You must take good care of yourself

36
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,840
until I come to take you back tomorrow.

37
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,640
Let me do it.

38
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,920
You may go now.

39
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:36,200
Yes, madam.

40
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,480
Han'er, come have something to eat.

41
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,000
Mother, I'm not hungry.

42
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,760
How can you not be hungry?

43
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,040
You've barely eaten for two days.

44
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,160
Come, drink this bowl of soup.

45
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,640
Tomorrow we'll go to Princess Yongyi's birthday celebration.

46
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,040
You'll be able to see her then.

47
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,440
Mother, I wasn't thinking about Lianxiang.

48
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,040
I didn't say it was Lianxiang.

49
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,760
I was talking about Yaoyao.

50
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,860
The Qin family is spreading rumors everywhere now.

51
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,380
They're trying to force you to marry her.

52
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,720
I understand all of this.

53
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,320
Her spreading rumors doesn't matter much.

54
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,000
I won't give in to her wishes

55
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,570
because of some gossip.

56
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,080
But Han'er,

57
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,000
don't be too protective of Lianxiang anymore.

58
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,080
After all, when rumors spread enough,

59
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,010
people will start to believe them.

60
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,080
I don't care what others think.

61
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,120
So do you like Princess Yongyi

62
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,760
or Qin Yaoyao?

63
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:54,720
Mother, I'm not considering marriage yet.

64
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,800
Lianxiang

65
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,280
Princess.

66
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,960
Is everything for my birthday party

67
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,840
ready?

68
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,400
Yes, Princess,

69
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,800
everything is ready.

70
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,520
Did you see anyone tonight?

71
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,720
Tonight, I saw Young Master Qin.

72
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,720
He brought you lots of fruit.

73
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,000
I'll bring them to you shortly.

74
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,600
Are you playing dumb with me?

75
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,560
Come here.

76
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,320
Please calm down, Princess.

77
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,280
You went to see the Prince today, didn't you?

78
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,120
What did he tell you?

79
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,800
He told me to serve the Princess carefully.

80
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,800
And not to be lazy.

81
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,080
Really?

82
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,400
You think I don't know?

83
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,200
You're investigating cases with the Prince.

84
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,320
If I report this to Father Emperor,

85
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,850
you could be sentenced to death immediately.

86
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,680
Please spare my life, Princess.

87
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,600
I can give you a chance to live.

88
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:12,400
Just tell me where Uncle Wang is hiding.

89
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,080
So the Princess and Qin Ziyuan are indeed

90
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,140
investigating the Cuiyu Manor case.

91
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,320
Your Highness.

92
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,280
I truly don't know.

93
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,040
You're quite loyal, aren't you?

94
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,980
But what you don't know is,

95
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,480
the case the Prince is investigating is extremely dangerous.

96
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,040
If he continues investigating,

97
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,400
his life could be in danger.

98
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,600
So the Princess summoned me

99
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,120
just to find out Uncle Wang's whereabouts.

100
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,520
I grew up with the Prince since childhood

101
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,360
and know him better than anyone.

102
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,960
Once he's committed to an investigation,

103
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,890
he ignores all dangers around him.

104
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,240
At times like these,

105
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,560
those close to him should remind him to be careful.

106
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,220
The Princess is right.

107
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,840
So if I tell you

108
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,280
Uncle Wang's whereabouts,

109
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,400
will the Prince be safe from danger?

110
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,640
Of course.

111
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,760
Tell me, and the Prince will be safe.

112
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,240
The Princess has arrived!

113
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:22,480
Wishing Your Highness a happy birthday and good fortune.

114
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,320
I've invited only close friends today.

115
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,960
Let's gather for a dinner banquet.

116
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,039
No need for formalities. Please be seated.

117
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:35,039
Thank you, Your Highness.

118
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,760
Prince, why aren't you sitting down?

119
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,760
Have you prepared a surprise for me?

120
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,440
This is a birthday gift for Your Highness.

121
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,160
Prince, do you remember

122
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:38,760
the unfinished portrait between us?

123
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,040
Yes, Your Highness, I remember.

124
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,560
But the subject wasn't present.

125
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,680
I cannot paint from imagination alone.

126
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,240
So I couldn't complete the portrait.

127
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:50,080
Please forgive me.

128
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,020
Your Highness.

129
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,400
I also have a gift to present to you.
