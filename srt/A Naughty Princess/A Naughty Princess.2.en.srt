1
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,600
No.

2
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,760
Don't be afraid.

3
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,090
We'll get married sooner or later anyway.

4
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,640
The Grand Preceptor's daughter breaks her promises

5
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,240
and has no shame.

6
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,970
What do you mean by that?

7
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,440
Yaoyao.

8
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,240
Why are you in the Prince's room?

9
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:24,920
Brother,

10
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,280
why are you here?

11
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,810
I have important matters to discuss with the Prince.

12
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,720
Why did you come to the Bai residence again?

13
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,520
I'm staying at the Bai residence for a few days.

14
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,280
Lady Bai has already agreed.

15
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,840
Coming here for a short stay

16
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,700
and acting like you own the place.

17
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,560
Alright, go back to your room now.

18
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,160
Be good.

19
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:49,880
Fine.

20
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,680
Brother Yihan.

21
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,900
Remember to drink your chicken soup.

22
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,560
Why are you in such a hurry

23
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,960
to see me? What happened?

24
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,240
I should be the one asking you that.

25
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,680
The Emperor summoned you privately.

26
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,840
What did he tell you?

27
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,880
The Emperor also summoned you privately.

28
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,040
What did he tell you?

29
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,680
Forget about it.

30
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,360
About the murder case at Cuiyu Manor,

31
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,079
have you found any clues?

32
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:41,480
Cuiyu Manor.

33
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:46,240
Lianxiang, you actually have a father.

34
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,640
I have a father?

35
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:49,840
Mother.

36
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,120
Didn't you tell me my father died before I was born?

37
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,079
No.

38
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,370
Your father is still alive.

39
00:02:58,079 --> 00:03:01,640
Six months ago, I had someone deliver a letter to him.

40
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,720
This is your token of recognition.

41
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,640
Take it.

42
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,480
Go to Cuiyu Manor in the capital

43
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,800
to find your father.

44
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,480
Move! Hurry up!

45
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,680
Move faster!

46
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,380
Behave yourselves. You two, move along. Quick!

47
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,120
Go find some people

48
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,520
to pose as manor staff.

49
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,079
When that young lady arrives,

50
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:34,540
capture her immediately.

51
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:35,880
Yes, sir.

52
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,560
Under our strict protection,

53
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,720
everyone at Cuiyu Manor was murdered overnight.

54
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,480
Someone must have known our plans in advance.

55
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,690
The most urgent task is to catch the mastermind behind this.

56
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,680
Bai Yihan,

57
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,040
what do you mean by that?

58
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,440
The Cuiyu Manor case

59
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,120
is only known to you and me.

60
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,120
Are you suspecting that I leaked the information?

61
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,640
I've said all I needed to say.

62
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,080
Bai Yihan, I could tolerate how you brushed off my sister,

63
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,320
but I am the eldest son of the Grand Preceptor's family.

64
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,579
How dare you treat me with such attitude?

65
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:21,040
And you even dare to suspect me?

66
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,120
These two are truly siblings,

67
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,680
equally unreasonable.

68
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,360
If I were implying that you are the mastermind,

69
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,080
why would I tell you all this?

70
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,610
I would have already reported to the Emperor.

71
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,280
When the investigation makes progress,

72
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,080
I will discuss it with you again.

73
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,480
Fine.

74
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,480
Princess Yongyi.

75
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,380
His Majesty will soon arrange a marriage for the Princess.

76
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,800
What's the situation?

77
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,680
Among the noble families being considered for the marriage,

78
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,810
our Qin family is at the top of the list.

79
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,240
None of the other noble families can compete with me.

80
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,440
Furthermore, among all the eligible noble families,

81
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,980
His Majesty has not mentioned the Bai family at all.

82
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,380
Nothing has been decided yet.

83
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:18,180
There's no need to speculate on His Majesty's intentions so soon.

84
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,360
If we're talking about suitable matches,

85
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,480
no one can compete with me, Qin Ziyuan.

86
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:26,480
Bai Yihan, you'd better back down while you can.

87
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,840
So these two are love rivals.

88
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,840
They both love the princess.

89
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,080
He's injured.

90
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,600
Who's there? Come out!

91
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,240
It's you.

92
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,680
We've met before.

93
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:50,920
Do you remember?

94
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,800
Come out.

95
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,000
Hurry!

96
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,400
Well, I

97
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,200
have been hard of hearing since childhood.

98
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,040
Especially when I'm hungry,

99
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,130
I might as well be completely deaf.

100
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,520
Whatever you just said,

101
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,200
I didn't hear a single word.

102
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,200
Really,

103
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,720
I truly didn't hear anything.

104
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,280
I'm hard of hearing, you see.

105
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,400
Who are you?

106
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,920
Why are you sneaking into the Prince's mansion at night?

107
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,320
Why are you in my chamber?

108
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,080
Tell me the truth,

109
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,440
or I'll throw you in prison

110
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,240
and have you severely tortured.

111
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,080
Please spare me, Your Highness!

112
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,610
I'm really not a bad person.

113
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,940
It was that lady from the mansion.

114
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,440
She said if I helped her retrieve her purse,

115
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,840
she would buy me food,

116
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,840
but she went back on her word.

117
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,040
I was so hungry

118
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,080
that I snuck in here.

119
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,600
Your Highness, everything I've said is true.

120
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,530
Please spare me!

121
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,040
Raise your head.

122
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,960
If you dare lie to me,

123
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,580
I can take your life right now.

124
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,120
Do you believe me?

125
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,280
I believe you.

126
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,600
Then, Your Highness, this has been a misunderstanding.

127
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,920
I'll take my leave now.

128
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,560
Did I say you could leave?

129
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,140
Eat first, then go.

130
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,400
Just eat it.

131
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,080
Then I won't hold back.

132
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,640
Is it that delicious?

133
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,400
Delicious.

134
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,250
I'm sorry. Let me wipe that for you.

135
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,440
No need.

136
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,400
You're injured.

137
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,400
Don't tell anyone about my injury,

138
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,160
or else.
