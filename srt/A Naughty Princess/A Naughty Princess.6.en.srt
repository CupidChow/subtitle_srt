1
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,600
Fine.

2
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,360
I have always had a good memory.

3
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,500
I remember everything, big or small.

4
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,920
You ate even less than I did just now.

5
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,180
You must be hungry too.

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,560
What's going on here?

7
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,720
Brother Yihan.

8
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,970
Why is he fooling around with that little beggar?

9
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,560
Could it be

10
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,320
that Brother Yihan already knows him?

11
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,720
Why did you give something so important

12
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,979
to that woman just now?

13
00:01:41,039 --> 00:01:42,759
You mean the jade pendant?

14
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,000
If I hadn't done that,

15
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,259
how would she trust us?

16
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:48,880
But you had no idea what case I was investigating

17
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,740
yet you took such a risk giving her the jade pendant.

18
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,490
What if I couldn't guarantee Liu Niang's safety?

19
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,090
I never thought of that.

20
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,440
How could you be so reckless?

21
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,600
I believe you wouldn't harm Liu Niang

22
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,000
and you'd keep your word.

23
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,220
Why do you trust me?

24
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,380
Because you're a good person.

25
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,720
When I return to the prince's mansion,

26
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,920
I'll pay you back double for your money.

27
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:19,880
No need.

28
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,560
That's all Miss Qin's money.

29
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,290
You spend money without a care.

30
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,720
Qin Yaoyao paid you.

31
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,460
No, she didn't.

32
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,160
You took her money.

33
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,960
How are you planning to hurt me this time? Tell me now.

34
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,079
No, it was just that one time.

35
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,820
Just that one time?

36
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,040
I swear it's true.

37
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,320
Take a rest.

38
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:11,960
Your Highness.

39
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,640
Are we really going to that

40
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,960
Ghost Valley Manor?

41
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,170
After Liu Niang left Baihua House,

42
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,720
she likely went to Ghost Valley Manor to find Mr. Wang.

43
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,520
Mr. Wang?

44
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,240
Who exactly is he?

45
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,360
Don't ask about this.

46
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,360
It's not something you should know.

47
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,040
It's not that I don't trust you,

48
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,600
but this matter is extremely important.

49
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,240
I cannot betray my duty as a subject

50
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,640
by revealing His Majesty's secret orders.

51
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,320
What are you talking about?

52
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm just curious.

53
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,760
Why would Mr. Wang

54
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,720
go to that

55
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,360
haunted manor?

56
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,160
What?

57
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,930
Ghost Valley Manor is haunted?

58
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,040
Yes,

59
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,400
I heard no one has lived there for a long time.

60
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,440
It's because it's haunted.

61
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,320
Who told you that?

62
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,520
I heard the rumors.

63
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,960
Nonsense.

64
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,760
Prince, aren't you afraid of ghosts?

65
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,040
I am.

66
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,690
I didn't expect you to be so honest.

67
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,520
Even if I'm afraid, I must go.

68
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,800
I understand.

69
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,360
Alright.

70
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,560
Let's continue our journey.

71
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:42,159
Stop right there!

72
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,040
Who are you?

73
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,520
A dead man walking.

74
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,120
You don't need to know that much.

75
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:46,680
Get him!

76
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,640
Watch out!

77
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,380
Your Highness!

78
00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:00,690
Your Highness, be careful!

79
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,520
Look out!

80
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,400
Go quickly!

81
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,160
After them!

82
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,200
Stop!

83
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,880
I'll draw them away. You go now.

84
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,130
You're injured. You can't fight them.

85
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,240
Just go!

86
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,360
Your Highness, I promised you

87
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,560
I wouldn't tell anyone about your injury.

88
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,840
That's why I won't let Miss Qin get close to you.

89
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,520
That day she drugged you.

90
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,200
I drugged her too.

91
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,800
As for everything else,

92
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,560
I have no more secrets from you.

93
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:47,020
Your Highness.

94
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,980
Thank you for taking care of me all this time.

95
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,159
Let's meet again in our next life.

96
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,120
What are you doing?

97
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,450
Giving your last words?

98
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,320
Yes, indeed.

99
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,159
I thought you could beat them.

100
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,530
How dare you underestimate me.

101
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,540
Your Highness.

102
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,860
Thank you for taking me in.

103
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,880
You go ahead.

104
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,760
Wait for me!

105
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,640
Don't leave me behind!

106
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,400
This fool.

107
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,840
Where's the person who was with you?

108
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,600
Him? I'm looking for him too.

109
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,000
Why don't we split up and search?

110
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,560
You look over there.

111
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,159
I'll check this area.

112
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:39,560
You little trickster, I'll kill you first.

113
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,040
Retreat!

114
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,160
Your Highness, are you all right?

115
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,120
Are you okay?

116
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,000
I'm fine.

117
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,730
What are you doing here?

118
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,760
I've been following you all

119
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,300
and you never noticed.

120
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,120
I did notice.

121
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,650
You've been following us since Baihua House.

122
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,320
Then why didn't you expose me?

123
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,520
I thought our journey would be remote,

124
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,520
and we'd likely face obstacles.

125
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,240
With you following us secretly,

126
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,559
wouldn't we be much safer?

127
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,360
You...

128
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,120
You actually used me!

129
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,320
You chose to follow us yourself.

130
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,600
I just saved you,

131
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,250
and this is how you treat me?

132
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,760
Bai Yihan, do you have any conscience left?

133
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,360
Thank you for saving us just now, Young Master Qin.

134
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,160
However,

135
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,760
following us without saying a word

136
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,760
isn't quite right either, is it?

137
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,600
I suggest we all take a step back.

138
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,200
Let's put the unpleasant things behind us.

139
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,000
For my sister's sake,

140
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,640
I won't hold it against you.

141
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,440
Bai Yihan.

142
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,280
You went to Baihua House.

143
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,120
Did you find any clues there?

144
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,360
Baihua House is a place for pleasure and entertainment.

145
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,420
Who would go there looking for clues?

146
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,620
You really went there for fun?

147
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,160
You, Bai Yihan, aren't that kind of person.

148
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,720
Of course I'll go.

149
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,520
The Prince took me there to broaden my horizons.

150
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,200
I never expected

151
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:35,800
that every girl there would be so beautiful.

152
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,840
If that's the case,

153
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,040
after leaving Baihua House,

154
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,680
where are you heading now?

155
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:46,200
This road leads outside the city.

156
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,000
Well, actually...

157
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Miss Qin mentioned she wanted fresh grapes,

158
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,450
so the Prince offered to pick some from the countryside.

159
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,360
Bai Yihan,

160
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,200
when did you start caring about my sister?

161
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,600
Feelings develop over time.

162
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,760
It's all about growing affection with time.

163
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,890
That's for the best.

164
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:06,920
This way, the two of us

165
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,640
won't have to harbor ill feelings toward each other

166
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,200
over the Princess's matter,

167
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,520
and can better serve the court.

168
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,040
Matters of the heart

169
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,720
should take their natural course.

170
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,520
Besides,

171
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:19,160
serving the court is our duty as officials.

172
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,520
Why bring personal relationships into it?

173
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,160
Hey, you!

174
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,520
If we don't hurry,

175
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,200
the sun will set soon.

176
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,160
Let's quickly go pick grapes for Miss Qin.

177
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,640
Let's go.
