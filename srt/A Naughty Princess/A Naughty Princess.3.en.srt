1
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,560
Qiang.

2
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,160
Don't tell anyone about my injury.

3
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:05,960
Otherwise,

4
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,360
I won't say anything.

5
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,560
I'm full.

6
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,280
Thank you, Your Majesty.

7
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,280
Goodbye.

8
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,200
All right.

9
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,479
Why did you come back?

10
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,280
Buy me chicken.

11
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:57,960
Just take it as a reward.

12
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,660
Take care of yourself.

13
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,960
Don't worry.

14
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,160
I won't say anything.

15
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,760
Goodbye.

16
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,770
Where are you going?

17
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,039
I don't know.

18
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,480
I've been busy lately.

19
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,860
I'm short of hands.

20
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,680
Stay and be my attendant.

21
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:20,920
Really?

22
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,880
I can live here

23
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,480
and eat here.

24
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:29,160
What’s your name?

25
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,400
My name is Lianxiang.

26
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,480
Lianxiang?

27
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,700
Why did you give her a girl’s name?

28
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,560
My mother always wanted a girl.

29
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,760
So she gave me this name

30
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,560
and gave me this name.

31
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,640
Oh no.

32
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,600
You should make up a boy's name.

33
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,960
You did what your mother wanted.

34
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,800
and grew a girl.

35
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,880
Although he has a bad temper,

36
00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:28,560
but he's kind-hearted.

37
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,360
I can feed him as his attendant.

38
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,960
Maybe I can find out

39
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,280
what happened in Cuiyu Villa.

40
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,760
Mother.

41
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,560
Don't worry.

42
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,960
I finally found a place to stay.

43
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,560
Mother, why are you still up?

44
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,079
I miss you.

45
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:23,400
I'll sleep with Xiang'er.

46
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,680
Lianxiang, I’m leaving.

47
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,760
Mom, where are you going?

48
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,520
Seeing you like this,

49
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,200
I'm relieved.

50
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,520
I'm leaving.

51
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,440
Mother, don't go!

52
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,320
Mother, don't go!

53
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,640
Mother, don't go.

54
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,200
Mother.

55
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,409
You're injured and you're still working out.

56
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,100
So self-disciplined.

57
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,800
Brother Yi Han.

58
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:44,960
Miss Qin.

59
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,000
I thought you were back.

60
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,640
Do you really not want to see me?

61
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,360
I'm afraid that you miss your daughter too much.

62
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,840
and blame me for not sending you back to the Grand Preceptor's Mansion.

63
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,040
Do you really not want to see me?

64
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,680
If you know, leave.

65
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,240
Do you really want me to leave?

66
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,800
Of course not, Miss Qin.

67
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,400
His Highness praised your chicken soup

68
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,460
is very delicious.

69
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,440
Really?

70
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,240
Yes

71
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,640
The meat is tender and fresh.

72
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,840
Miss Qin,

73
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,840
you should prepare

74
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,800
for Duke Zhao.

75
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,440
Duke Zhao will like it.

76
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,760
It's you.

77
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,960
Little beggar.

78
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,159
Brother Yi Han.

79
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,760
Why is he here?

80
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,000
I took him in

81
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:45,090
as my attendant.

82
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,040
He will be

83
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,040
from now on.

84
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,000
Brother Yi Han.

85
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,440
The weather is so nice today.

86
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,600
Why don't we go out for a walk?

87
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,260
I have something to deal with.

88
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,400
Let's talk about it another day.

89
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,760
Brother Yi Han.

90
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,480
Listen.

91
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,040
You have to listen to me.

92
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,880
Ms. Qin, it's not appropriate.

93
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,840
Duke Zhao...

94
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,640
is very fierce.

95
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,880
If he finds out,

96
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,360
and put me in jail,

97
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,840
What should I do?

98
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:31,080
What are you afraid of? My father is the Grand Preceptor.

99
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,000
My brother is a general.

100
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,400
You...

101
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,200
Even if you go to jail,

102
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,400
even if you go to jail.

103
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,080
I don't believe you.

104
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,760
You little liar.

105
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,159
Work for me.

106
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,560
I won't treat you badly.

107
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,160
Thank you, Miss Qin.

108
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,200
Have a rest and have some tea.

109
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,299
Your Highness, the dishes are ready.

110
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,340
Thank you, Your Highness.

111
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,360
Amazing.

112
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,280
Mrs. Bai, Ms. Qin.

113
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,760
Is Han'er drawing in the room?

114
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,360
No.

115
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,600
Duke Zhao is writing.

116
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,760
Seriously, since General Bai Su passed away,

117
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,760
Brother Yi Han stopped drawing.

118
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,060
Brother Yi Han is good at drawing.

119
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,330
but he never drew a portrait for me.

120
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,360
So you can draw.
