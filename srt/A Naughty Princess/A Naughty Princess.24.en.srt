1
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:14,280
Qinfu Pukun.

2
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:14,810
Qinfu Pu.

3
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,680
Qinfu Pukun.

4
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,720
Binqi.

5
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,560
Xinxinke.

6
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,360
Qingxin Sike.

7
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,400
Li Shu.

8
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,800
I'm very weak now.

9
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,880
Can I speak to Lianxiang alone?

10
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,800
I won't do anything to her.

11
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,650
Your Highness, I suddenly want to eat hawthorn cake.

12
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,680
I grew up living with my mother.

13
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,920
Now I'm all alone.

14
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,890
That's the only reason I didn't end up as a beggar.

15
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,240
I was actually quite content.

16
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:47,920
I'm no longer alone.

17
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,160
I know you despise me.

18
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,960
But the Prince is very important to me too.

19
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,600
The Prince and I grew up together.

20
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,080
I saw love in his eyes.

21
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,120
I fear you'll take away what I have now,

22
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,080
my status and the Emperor's favor.

23
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:50,480
Especially when I noticed the Prince's affection for you.

24
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,810
Yet you risked your life to save me.

25
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,880
I can't understand why.

26
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,120
I know my status isn't worthy.

27
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,320
I'm willing to be your sister.

28
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,520
I want us to be good sisters.

29
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,640
Are you traveling alone, miss?

30
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,440
Dressing as a man would be safer.

31
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,530
No one is allowed to punish Lianxiang.

32
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,820
I will not marry Princess Yongyi.

33
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,480
How do I look? Am I pretty?

34
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,000
Why do you keep staring at me?

35
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,300
Because I need to confirm something.

36
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,960
The one I'm marrying is Princess Lianxiang.

37
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,290
Perhaps we can't be together anymore.

38
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,800
No matter who you are,

39
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,160
I will petition the Emperor.

40
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,920
I don't care even if it costs my life.

41
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,960
Your Highness, on this joyous day,

42
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,560
don't talk about death. It's bad luck.

43
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:26,440
I only wish to hold your hand from now on.

44
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,160
I wish to spend all my days with Your Highness.

45
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,680
Withered leaves.

46
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:31,840
Thousands of withered leaves have fallen.

47
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,480
Countless withered leaves fall from the sky.

48
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,000
A longing deep in my bones.

49
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,040
Do you know how deeply I yearn for you?

50
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:38,240
Who speaks of the past?

51
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:38,880
Who speaks

52
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,760
Gentle sounds drift into the cold autumn.

53
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,560
Flute melody.

54
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:45,840
Breaking branches.

55
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,440
Break the branch, don't look

56
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,690
Break the branch, don't look back.

57
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,640
Still remember.

58
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:50,040
Those delicate hands of years past.

59
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,120
Withered.

60
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:52,160
All.

61
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,160
The lamp runs out of oil.

62
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,480
As the lamp runs out of oil.

63
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,120
Whether still good.

64
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,720
Wondering if things remain as good as before.

65
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,280
Wondering if things are still as they were.

66
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:01,960
Enjoying a glass of crystal light.

67
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,360
Green lamp illuminates the night.

68
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:05,440
Green lamp lights the night.

69
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,840
Green lamp lights the night as fireflies flow.

70
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,840
Flowers dance at the bridge's end.

71
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,600
Rain shatters sorrow.

72
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,640
Rain breaks the sorrowful heart.

73
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,440
Rain shatters sorrows flooding the lonely boat.

74
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,000
The beloved suddenly turns.

75
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,280
The beloved suddenly looks back.

76
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:15,640
The beloved suddenly turns around.

77
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,840
The person suddenly.

78
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:15,640
The beloved unexpectedly looks back.

79
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:18,880
Dim lights bring sorrow.

80
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,240
Fading lights.

81
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:18,880
If one worries.

82
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,760
Cold wind flows freely.

83
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,560
Making one grow thin.

84
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,520
Causing one to waste away.

85
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,200
The refined person sighs softly.

86
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:32,840
A trace of sword spirit wanders far.

87
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,770
A trace of sword spirit wanders to the edge of the sky.

88
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:36,920
Like old days.

89
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,000
Forgetting who to share the rising clouds with.

90
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,280
Forgetting who.

91
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,000
To share.

92
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,650
Forgetting who to share life with.

93
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:45,400
Looking at shadows alone.

94
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:45,640
Gazing at one's shadow.

95
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,360
Looking at shadows while holding a cup of intoxicating wine.

96
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,960
Gazing at shadows greedily.

97
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:48,920
A thousand miles of cold mountains with wind flowing through empty skies.

98
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:49,120
Romance in the crystal-clear sky.

99
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,240
A thousand miles of cold mountains, with moon and wind in the crystal sky.

100
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,240
A thousand miles.

101
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,480
Why turn

102
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,600
Why turn the music into evening bells?

103
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,060
Music into evening bells.

104
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:53,600
Why make

105
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:55,560
Stealing half a life to stay.

106
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:55,840
Stealing half a fleeting life to keep a dream.

107
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,900
Stealing a moment of this fleeting life to keep a dream.

108
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,640
Who declares to get drunk?

109
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,200
A promise is like

110
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,600
the wind that freely stays with you.

111
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:04,880
is your promise.

112
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:04,600
Like a gentle breeze

113
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:04,960
your promise remains.

114
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:04,880
Like the wind

115
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,520
A promise to you is like a breeze that lingers.

116
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:06,840
[Coarse cloth as wide as sleeves]

117
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,100
Seeing your sleeves of old coarse cloth.

118
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,080
A thousand sorrows,

119
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:11,800
yet none compare to this feeling.

120
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,720
A thousand worries under the moon, yet nothing compares.

121
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,800
A thousand kinds of sorrow, yet none surpass this feeling.
