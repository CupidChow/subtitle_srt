1
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,600
Strong.

2
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,160
Why did you save me?

3
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,000
Wouldn't my death please you more?

4
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,039
I have many wishes,

5
00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:33,000
but none of them involve your death.

6
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,840
Let's go.

7
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,039
But I've been keeping you from reuniting with your father.

8
00:01:38,039 --> 00:01:39,440
Now you know everything.

9
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:41,160
Don't you hate me?

10
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,400
I haven't thought about that.

11
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,640
Then think about it now.

12
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,960
I'm thinking...

13
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,420
Let's run away first and talk about it later.

14
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,160
Let's go, hurry!

15
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,120
Where do you think you're going?

16
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,240
This gentleman is quite handsome.

17
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,360
You two know each other?

18
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,440
Then you two chat first.

19
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,560
I'll be going now.

20
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,800
Do you think I'm stupid?

21
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,440
The Emperor just recognized you.

22
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,920
Perhaps your ransom will be higher.

23
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,640
You...

24
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,020
You're quite the calculator.

25
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,000
Stop talking.

26
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,800
Move.

27
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,040
Now we're really doomed.

28
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,600
Aren't you afraid?

29
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,160
I believe the Prince will definitely come to save us.

30
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,560
How do you know?

31
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,280
When I left,

32
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,210
I hung my jade pendant outside the Prince's mansion.

33
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:01,960
That jade pendant

34
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,560
is the token for my family reunion at Cuiyu Manor.

35
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,520
When the Prince sees it, he'll surely guess

36
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,450
that we're here.

37
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,040
Are you that confident?

38
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:10,840
Yes,

39
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,360
I trust him.

40
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,760
I understand.

41
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:32,160
Lianxiang left this jade pendant to tell us

42
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,730
that she was kidnapped too.

43
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,200
This is outrageous!

44
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,360
I have sent guards to search the entire city.

45
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,040
We must catch this criminal.

46
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,920
Your Majesty, Prince.

47
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,400
A letter was found in the courtyard.

48
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,040
There's a fast horse outside the mansion.

49
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,600
Tie 100 taels of gold to the horse's back.

50
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,860
No following allowed.

51
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,760
Or the princess's life will be in danger.

52
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,320
This audacious traitor!

53
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,880
How dare they!

54
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,120
Your Majesty.

55
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,080
The letter doesn't mention Lianxiang.

56
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,760
This means General Li didn't kidnap her.

57
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,220
Your Majesty, I'll prepare the gold right away.

58
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,920
Princess.

59
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,450
His Majesty is quite generous.

60
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:56,200
Your ransom has arrived.

61
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:00,680
I'm afraid you won't live to spend it.

62
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,720
You look down on me.

63
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,400
Whether I live to spend it

64
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,320
is none of your concern, Princess.

65
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,520
Such a beautiful face.

66
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,040
How could Bai Yihan not appreciate it?

67
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,600
You dare!

68
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,440
Guess whether I dare or not.

69
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,640
You monster! Let her go!

70
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,720
Let her go!

71
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,320
You!

72
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:45,159
Don't worry, you're next.

73
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:52,760
Do you believe I'll kill you right now?

74
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,640
Don't!

75
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,240
Not to enjoy such beauties today

76
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,520
would be such a waste.

77
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,320
What are you doing? Stay away!

78
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,040
Stay back!

79
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:18,920
Run!

80
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,400
Go!

81
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,450
Are you alright?

82
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,650
Don't be afraid.

83
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,280
I won't let him hurt you.

84
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,960
Let's go back to the Prince's mansion together.

85
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,680
Go.

86
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,480
None of you will escape.

87
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:50,920
Is that so?

88
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,440
That depends on whether

89
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,800
you can outrun me.

90
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,240
Run!

91
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,640
Stop!

92
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,640
She saved me.

93
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,280
Your Highness!

94
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,360
Princess!

95
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,540
Your Highness!

96
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,800
Are you all right?

97
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,560
You...

98
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,280
Are you okay?

99
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,450
Where's Lianxiang?

100
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,680
Why isn't she with you?

101
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,440
Commander Li is chasing her.

102
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,800
Stop!

103
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:31,880
You run pretty fast.

104
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,340
You're not slow yourself.

105
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,320
Your Grace.

106
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,039
Damn it.

107
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,120
Your Highness is not alone.

108
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,650
Everyone has been rescued.

109
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:45,760
Ziyuan,

110
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,480
give all that gold to them as a reward.

111
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,780
Your Highness means those 100 taels of gold?

112
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,240
I almost got them killed.

113
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:59,160
This will serve as compensation for them.

114
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,640
Yes, Your Highness.

115
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,920
Thank you, Princess.

116
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,520
Stop right there.

117
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,120
I wonder how much money

118
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,700
your emperor father will pay to ransom his commoner daughter.

119
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,520
You'll definitely never find out.

120
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,320
What did you say?

121
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,600
Because you

122
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,720
are about to be in big trouble.

123
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,160
You're asking for death!

124
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,080
Watch out!

125
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,380
Take them away.

126
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,400
Are you okay?

127
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,000
I'm fine.

128
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,040
I knew you would come.

129
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,930
I'm sorry you were frightened, Princess.

130
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,200
I've been running for too long.

131
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:24,960
My feet hurt.

132
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:35,320
Then allow me to carry you back to the palace.
