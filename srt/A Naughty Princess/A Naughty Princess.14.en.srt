1
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,600
Strong.

2
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,140
Let me tell you.

3
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,200
I've been engaged to the Princess for a long time.

4
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,280
Don't get any ideas.

5
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,280
Your marriage is none of my business.

6
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,800
As for my marriage,

7
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,000
I make my own decisions.

8
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:11,800
You!

9
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,600
The Princess has arrived!

10
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,720
Greetings, Your Highness.

11
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,080
No need for formalities.

12
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:40,920
I came out of the palace today for a casual visit.

13
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,520
I was passing by the Bai residence on my way back

14
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,440
and thought I'd drop by

15
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,280
to invite Madam Bai and the Prince

16
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,340
to my birthday banquet in three days.

17
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,530
Since Ziyuan and Yaoyao are also here,

18
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,479
I won't need to notify the Grand Tutor's residence separately.

19
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:57,680
Thank you, Princess.

20
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,760
My brother and I will certainly attend on time.

21
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,600
Your Highness, for such a small matter,

22
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,600
why trouble yourself to come in person?

23
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,600
You could have sent a servant

24
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,800
to inform us.

25
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,860
Speaking of servants,

26
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,680
my most capable attendant has fallen ill

27
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,340
and returned home to recover.

28
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,880
And I simply cannot find

29
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,740
someone suitable to replace him.

30
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,600
I suddenly remembered that the Prince's attendant is quite clever

31
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,000
and I'm quite fond of him.

32
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:27,060
I wonder if I might borrow him from the Prince for a few days?

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,860
Your Highness,

34
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,360
my attendant is clumsy

35
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,560
and knows nothing of palace etiquette.

36
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,560
I think it's best not to trouble with him.

37
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,560
Han'er's attendant is of common birth

38
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,240
and has only recently arrived at the Bai residence.

39
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,800
He hasn't even learned our household rules yet,

40
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,600
I'm afraid he won't serve Your Highness properly.

41
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,960
If Your Highness doesn't mind,

42
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,690
you could take my maid instead.

43
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,690
She's very good at serving people.

44
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,090
Thank you for your concern, Madam.

45
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,000
Don't worry, Prince.

46
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,760
I only need to borrow him to help prepare for the birthday banquet.

47
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,560
After my birthday celebration,

48
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,000
I will return him to you, Prince.

49
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,000
Thank you for your kindness, Princess.

50
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,640
I,

51
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,690
will return to the palace with you right away.

52
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,329
She's indeed sensible.

53
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,840
Prince, don't forget

54
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,570
to attend my birthday banquet.

55
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,460
I will certainly be there.

56
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,280
Farewell, Princess.

57
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,360
Someone protected you in the Bai residence.

58
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,600
But now you're going to the Princess's palace.

59
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,130
Who will protect you there?

60
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,080
Bai Yihan.

61
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,600
You've been investigating secretly lately.

62
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,660
Why don't you share the clues with me?

63
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,089
Because you don't deserve to know.

64
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,280
What gives you the right to say that?

65
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,840
The Emperor ordered us to investigate together.

66
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,000
But you leaked the case details

67
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,240
to Princess Yongyi.

68
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,010
It was your little attendant who told you.

69
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,480
He dared to eavesdrop on my conversation with the Princess.

70
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,880
How despicable!

71
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,800
The despicable one

72
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,600
is you.

73
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,640
You've betrayed the Emperor's trust.

74
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,770
What does the Emperor's trust matter?

75
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,800
Whatever the Princess wants,

76
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,760
I will give her.

77
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,760
Qin Ziyuan.

78
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,890
Have you lost your mind?

79
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You're the one who's lost your mind.

80
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,720
For the sake of a mere attendant,

81
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,720
you ignored my sister, which I could tolerate,

82
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,040
but now you dare to offend Princess Yongyi.

83
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,000
Qin Ziyuan, I'm talking about our duty as officials,

84
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:06,960
and all you can think about

85
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,040
is personal affairs.

86
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,120
You think I haven't been investigating?

87
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,800
Let me tell you, Bai Yihan,

88
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,400
your every move is under my surveillance.

89
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,480
Fine.

90
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,940
Tell me what you've found out.

91
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,760
I know about your visit to Baihua House.

92
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,080
You have Wang Bo, don't you?

93
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,600
Xin Wei De Ming.

94
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,200
Your Highness, please have some tea.

95
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,020
This tea is excellent.

96
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,170
The Prince always says you're clumsy,

97
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,060
but I think he just doesn't want to give you to me.

98
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,000
I'm still learning,

99
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
trying my best

100
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,600
to serve Your Highness well.

101
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,320
Sit down.

102
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,040
There's no one else here.

103
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,680
Sit down and chat with me.

104
00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:40,960
You truly are clever and quick-witted.

105
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,040
No wonder the Prince keeps you by his side.

106
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,120
The Prince is kind-hearted.

107
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,080
He knows about my tragic past

108
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,800
so he takes special care of me.

109
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,560
My relationship with the Prince

110
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,280
is not improper as Miss Qin suggested.

111
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,330
How are you and the Prince being improper?

112
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,560
The Prince and I grew up together.

113
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,000
I know his character very well.

114
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,380
He's just casual about formalities.

115
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You're very perceptive, Princess.

116
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,160
In your opinion,

117
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,320
does the Prince favor me

118
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,800
or Qin Yaoyao?

119
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,890
It's you, Princess, of course.

120
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,360
Everyone knows that.

121
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,200
After Old General Bai passed away,

122
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,080
the Prince never painted again.

123
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,960
But I saw

124
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,680
the Prince painting your portrait.

125
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,600
You're not lying to me, are you?

126
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,960
I wouldn't dare deceive Your Highness.

127
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,200
Princess?

128
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,800
Princess, what's wrong?

129
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,800
I'll call the royal physician.

130
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,730
There's no time.

131
00:07:58,159 --> 00:07:59,960
Pour some wine into your palm

132
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,560
and press it against my skin.

133
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,040
Quickly!

134
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,000
No, it's not enough.

135
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,320
Not enough.

136
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,600
You need to press it on my skin.

137
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,280
I...

138
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:21,840
Hurry!

139
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,240
Princess!

140
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,480
I'm sorry.

141
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,570
Are you feeling better, Princess?

142
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,200
Thank you.

143
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,800
You really saved me just now.

144
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,500
Your Highness,

145
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,760
let me help you back to bed to rest.

146
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,600
Come.

147
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,600
Take it easy.

148
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,480
Here.

149
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,660
Your Highness.

150
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,040
Let me make you some tea.

151
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:39,840
No need.

152
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,730
Then let me call for a royal physician.

153
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,440
I'll be fine after some rest.

154
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,080
You may leave now.

155
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:48,880
Yes.

156
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,840
I shall take my leave then.

157
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:31,600
How did my jade pendant end up with the princess?

158
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,360
Could it be that she went to the pawnshop

159
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,200
and redeemed my jade pendant?

160
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,840
No, that can't be right.

161
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,500
Why would a noble princess ever go to a pawnshop?

162
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,200
It doesn't make sense.

163
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,520
Unless...

164
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,360
Lianxiang.

165
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,200
Lianxiang.

166
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,720
Your Highness.

167
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,880
Why are you here?
