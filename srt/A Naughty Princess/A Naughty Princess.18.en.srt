1
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,600
Strong.

2
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,360
Race me.

3
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,600
Stop!

4
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,320
Young Master Qin.

5
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,759
You run pretty fast.

6
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:46,220
You're not slow yourself.

7
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,720
You're mocking me.

8
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,840
No, no.

9
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,520
I'm complimenting you.

10
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,080
We just had a race.

11
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,200
I lost, didn't I?

12
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,729
You're really impressive, Young Master Qin.

13
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,280
I have something to ask you.

14
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,600
What would you like to know?

15
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,680
What did you do before coming to the Prince's mansion?

16
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,720
Farming.

17
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,520
Farming?

18
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,400
It was just my mother and me.

19
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,880
My mother was in poor health.

20
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,480
So I had to do all the farming.

21
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,720
Why did you stop farming then?

22
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,940
My mother passed away.

23
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,200
She told me to sell the land for travel money.

24
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,160
And come to the capital to find my relatives.

25
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,290
Come to the capital to find relatives?

26
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,900
Where are your relatives?

27
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,600
At the north end of Chen Family Lane.

28
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,079
You probably don't know.

29
00:02:37,079 --> 00:02:38,740
There's a Wang Village there.

30
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,000
My uncle had been living there.

31
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,079
But by the time I got there, he had already moved away.

32
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:46,760
Poor me, I became homeless.

33
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,160
What's your uncle's name?

34
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,440
Wang Er.

35
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,600
Wang Er?

36
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,329
Is what you're saying true?

37
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,800
Absolutely true.

38
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,100
Your Highness.

39
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,780
Here's your paper.

40
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,800
Thank you.

41
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,810
Why did it take you so long to buy paper?

42
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,080
Qin Ziyuan came looking for me.

43
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,480
What did he want? Are you all right?

44
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,079
I'm fine. Listen to me.

45
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,120
How do I get to Chen family alley?

46
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:27,920
Go that way.

47
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:28,960
There?

48
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,640
Yes.

49
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,320
How do I get to Chen family alley?

50
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,450
Turn left up ahead and you'll be there.

51
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,000
That way?

52
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Yes, this way.

53
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,600
Hey!

54
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,280
Who are you looking for?

55
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,079
Is there someone named Wang Er around here?

56
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,240
Wang Er?

57
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,160
There are several people named Wang Er in this area.

58
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,820
Which one are you looking for?

59
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,400
I'm looking for the one who moved away.

60
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,460
Are you okay? Why look for someone who's already moved?

61
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,610
I'm looking for the one who lives here.

62
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,800
Past the bridge, in the east house,

63
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,960
there's a Wang Er.

64
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,480
At the third house around the corner,

65
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,760
there's also a Wang Er.

66
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,899
Since Lianxiang's relatives have already moved away,

67
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,560
the Wang Er living here can't be her relative.

68
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,420
There's no point in me asking.

69
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,960
Qin Ziyuan probably hasn't figured it out yet.

70
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:34,360
This is a paradox.

71
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,060
Never mind him.

72
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,320
With his intelligence,

73
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,380
he'll never figure out what's wrong.

74
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,480
But anyway, Lianxiang.

75
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,120
Hmm?

76
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,800
Where are your relatives, really?

77
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,720
I...

78
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,600
Perhaps I can help you find them.

79
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,340
Your Highness.

80
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,370
You have a mission to protect the secrets of Cuiyu Manor.

81
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,680
And I have my own secrets to protect.

82
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,480
I understand.

83
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,000
If you don't want to tell me,

84
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,400
I respect your decision.

85
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,860
Thank you, Your Highness.

86
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,159
Xin Wuideming.

87
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:33,620
You've been played by her.

88
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,200
That girl is so cunning.

89
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,460
That girl is no simple matter.

90
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,560
She can steal the Prince's heart,

91
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:55,000
so dealing with you is nothing to her.

92
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,720
However,

93
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,140
why did Father Emperor send you to investigate Lianxiang?

94
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,840
His Majesty said he doesn't trust Bai Yihan.

95
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,520
Don't tell me His Majesty has also taken a fancy to Lianxiang.

96
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,520
This is outrageous!

97
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,380
Your Highness.

98
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,320
Should I have someone arrest that girl

99
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,580
and teach her a lesson?

100
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:20,880
Forget it.

101
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,220
There are more important things to do right now.

102
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,520
Your Highness, please give your orders.

103
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,000
Has Uncle Wang been found?

104
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,520
Not yet.

105
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,440
Listen carefully.

106
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,240
I'm giving you one last chance.

107
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,520
I want you to find my father's daughter who lives among commoners.

108
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,159
Then bring her to me.

109
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,460
Your Highness.

110
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,880
Could it be that

111
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,720
you were behind the murders at Cuiyu Manor?

112
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,640
That's right. It was me.

113
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,800
I sent people to destroy Cuiyu Manor.

114
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,800
Then had my people impersonate the manor staff.

115
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,560
So when that commoner princess arrived seeking refuge,

116
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,890
they would capture her.

117
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:25,240
The Princess has known about this all along.

118
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,600
Your subordinate Commander Li told me.

119
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,560
Commander Li.

120
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,440
But

121
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,560
why would Your Highness do this?

122
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,320
She's your own sister!

123
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,520
I don't need a sister.

124
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,920
I don't need another person

125
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,360
to share Father's love.

126
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,760
I want to be his only daughter,

127
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,920
his only princess.

128
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,760
Ziyuan.

129
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,560
I've told you all my secrets.

130
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,200
Will you stand by my side?

131
00:07:59,080 --> 00:07:59,880
I...

132
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,280
You're the only person I can trust.

133
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,400
I only trust you.

134
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,039
Your Highness, I, Qin Ziyuan, swear

135
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:38,559
to serve only you for the rest of my life.

136
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,880
What's wrong? Come in and tell me.

137
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:26,040
Well, that servant's quarters you gave me

138
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,600
doesn't have any window coverings.

139
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,520
Is that so? Those workers must have cut corners.

140
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,770
I'll replace all of them tomorrow.

141
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,360
And then, my previous servant's quarters

142
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,080
Laifu has moved in there.

143
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,000
Oh no.

144
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,600
My mother must not have known you moved out

145
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,260
so she let Laifu move in there.

146
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,600
Yes.

147
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:52,840
So I have nowhere to stay now.

148
00:09:52,840 --> 00:10:00,520
Ah, what should we do then?

149
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:08,720
Could I make a bed on the floor in your room?

150
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,320
Well...

151
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,440
Alright then.

152
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,450
The weather has been so hot lately.

153
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,020
I'll sleep on the floor

154
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,730
and you can take the bed.

155
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,860
Thank you, Your Highness.

156
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,400
It's really hot.

157
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,770
Your Highness is so clever,

158
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,440
choosing the cooler spot for yourself.

159
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,560
Your Highness.
