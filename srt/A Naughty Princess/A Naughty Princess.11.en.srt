1
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,600
Strong.

2
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,280
What? Cuiyu Manor was attacked?

3
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,080
I have failed you, Your Majesty. Please punish me.

4
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,600
Enough.

5
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,200
Now is not the time for this.

6
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,000
Listen, both of you.

7
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,320
I am ordering you to do something.

8
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,160
This mission cannot fail.

9
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,039
Yes.

10
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,400
I await Your Majesty's orders.

11
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,759
My daughter is missing.

12
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,560
What happened to Princess Yongyi?

13
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,280
Not Yongyi.

14
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:45,960
Rise.

15
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,080
I have another daughter

16
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,560
living among common people.

17
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,000
I ordered you to protect Cuiyu Manor

18
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,760
where my daughter was supposed to seek refuge.

19
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,640
But today the manor was suddenly attacked,

20
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,480
all the guards were killed,

21
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,039
and my daughter has disappeared,

22
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,039
her fate unknown.

23
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,400
I command you to find her whereabouts.

24
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,560
Remember, before you find her,

25
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:20,600
not a word of this must be leaked.

26
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:23,880
Yes.

27
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,240
What did you say?

28
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,240
Father has another daughter living among common people?

29
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,360
Have you found her whereabouts yet?

30
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,040
Not yet. But

31
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,640
at Cuiyu Manor,

32
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,200
we didn't find Wang Bo's body.

33
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,530
He might still be alive.

34
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:47,840
So Wang Bo is a key lead now.

35
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,260
Your Highness is wise.

36
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,560
If we find Wang Bo,

37
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,079
we might discover the whereabouts of the civilian princess.

38
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,970
You must investigate thoroughly.

39
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,560
I can't wait

40
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,760
to meet my civilian sister.

41
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,880
Prince.

42
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,680
I'm going back now.

43
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,540
You're doing this on purpose.

44
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,560
No, I'm not.

45
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,800
I really want to go back.

46
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,890
Where are you going?

47
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,079
I'm going back to my room.

48
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,000
No.

49
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,770
Hey, what are you doing?

50
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,120
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

51
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,000
Gently, gently.

52
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,040
Why?

53
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,690
You can barely move now.

54
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,360
If you fall again,

55
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,930
you'll need to rest for many more days.

56
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,360
Who will attend to my daily needs then?

57
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,880
You wretched prince,

58
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,400
always bullying your poor attendant.

59
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,530
What did you say?

60
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,840
I said I need to heal quickly

61
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,160
so I can return to serve you soon.

62
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,159
My lord.

63
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,130
My lord, are you asleep?

64
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,080
Thank you

65
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,210
for saving me twice.

66
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,810
Please be careful when investigating cases.

67
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,420
I feel those villains have formidable martial skills.

68
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,400
Why don't you ask what case I'm investigating?

69
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,080
I am curious, actually.

70
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,760
But it's a confidential case,

71
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,820
and as an official, you can't tell me.

72
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,360
So I won't ask.

73
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,480
Although the relatives I sought were killed,

74
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,680
at least I've found

75
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,280
a safe place to stay,

76
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:58,400
and a master who is honorable and righteous.

77
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,140
I'm content with that.

78
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,880
Your Highness, we have captured Wang Bo.

79
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,960
Good. Investigate thoroughly.

80
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,640
You must find out the whereabouts of that civilian princess.

81
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:42,960
Prince, I...

82
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:13,920
Where is he?

83
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,080
Have you seen the Prince?

84
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,240
The Prince left early this morning.

85
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,760
The Prince loves vegetarian food.

86
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,440
And that idiot Qin Yaoyao...

87
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,880
She's not even cooking for the Prince anymore.

88
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,409
Now I'm dying for some meat.

89
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,890
This still smells good.

90
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,840
Qin Ziyuan?

91
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,400
This person...

92
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,860
Why is he sneaking around?

93
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,600
I can't hold it anymore.

94
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,160
I need to use the bathroom.

95
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,400
Ziyuan, you're here.

96
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,490
Yes, Your Highness.

97
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,200
Why would Your Highness choose such a place to meet?

98
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,730
It's beneath your station.

99
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,600
I think this place is fine.

100
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,690
I haven't really been to places like this before.

101
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,960
Where ordinary people live.

102
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,360
Oh no.

103
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,400
The Prince seems to have been played by the Princess.

104
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,600
Your Highness, I will definitely beat Bai Yihan

105
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,640
and solve the Cuiyu Manor case before him,

106
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,760
so I can earn merit

107
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,040
and make His Majesty see me in a new light.

108
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,960
No rush, sit down and tell me.

109
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,880
How is the investigation going?

110
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,600
Bai Yihan is secretly investigating the Cuiyu Manor case

111
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,800
and the whereabouts of the missing Uncle Wang.

112
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,080
He thinks I don't know.

113
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,800
But I've already

114
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,000
placed spies around the Bai residence.

115
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,760
This Qin Ziyuan,

116
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,120
he really has no self-control.

117
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,440
Just a little sweet talk and he spills everything.

118
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,000
I believe you will definitely

119
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,800
solve the case before Bai Yihan.

120
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,200
When you do, don't forget to tell me first.

121
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,160
Do you know?

122
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,600
Yes, I certainly will.

123
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,860
The case is solved.

124
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,340
Shouldn't we tell the Emperor first?

125
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,800
Why tell Princess Yongyi?

126
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,610
Something's wrong.

127
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,280
Their meeting is too suspicious.

128
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,960
I must inform the Prince immediately.
