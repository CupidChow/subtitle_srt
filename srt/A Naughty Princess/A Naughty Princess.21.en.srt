1
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,400
Strong.

2
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,440
Wang Bo.

3
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,560
Wang Bo.

4
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,400
Wang Bo.

5
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,200
I'm leaving.

6
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,970
Leaving the Prince's mansion.

7
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,440
Leaving the capital.

8
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,600
But I don't know where else I can go.

9
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:12,300
My mother told me to bring this to Cuiyu Manor to find my relatives.

10
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,520
But all my relatives are dead.

11
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:23,940
Whether you understand me or not.

12
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,240
I consider you my family now.

13
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,400
Take care of yourself, Mr. Wang. I'm leaving.

14
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,640
Found them!

15
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,160
Found them!

16
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,440
Mr. Wang!

17
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,200
You can speak again!

18
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,640
You're healed!

19
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,920
So you've been hiding in the Prince's mansion.

20
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,300
Today will be your last day alive.

21
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,000
Run!

22
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,720
Stop!

23
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,080
Qin Ziyuan, don't be impulsive!

24
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,080
Shut up!

25
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,080
Once I kill you all,

26
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,680
the princess will change her mind about me.

27
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,080
Qin Ziyuan, as the son of the Grand Tutor,

28
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,880
how can you kill without reason?

29
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,440
There might be some misunderstanding.

30
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,570
It's all your fault.

31
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,960
You made the princess angry.

32
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,920
That's why she impulsively married Bai Yihan.

33
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:21,640
I'll kill you first,

34
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,600
then I'll kill Bai Yihan.

35
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,480
Are you okay?

36
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,560
Bai Yihan!

37
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,240
I'm fine.

38
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,560
Stop Qin Ziyuan quickly!

39
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,020
He's going to kill Wang Bo!

40
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,320
Bai Yihan!

41
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,720
First you seduced and abandoned my sister,

42
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,680
then you kept a secret lover in your mansion,

43
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,560
and now you want to marry Princess Yongyi.

44
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,760
You fickle hypocrite!

45
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,120
I will never let Her Highness marry you.

46
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:45,920
Move!

47
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,760
Stop!

48
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,040
Your Majesty.

49
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,840
What are you doing?

50
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,640
Drawing swords on this joyous day.

51
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,320
How dare you!

52
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,650
Your Majesty, I deeply love Princess Yongyi.

53
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,440
She is the love of my life.

54
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,680
I beg you to reconsider your decree

55
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,960
and bestow her hand in marriage to me.

56
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,920
I, Qin Ziyuan, swear to love the Princess forever

57
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,080
and to serve the court loyally.

58
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:03,880
Insolence!

59
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,160
Qin Ziyuan,

60
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:08,120
you dare ask me to revoke my decree?

61
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,440
Your Majesty, my heart already belongs to someone else.

62
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,240
I cannot marry Princess Yongyi.

63
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,520
Please forgive me.

64
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,930
This is outrageous!

65
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,760
Qin Ziyuan has always been reckless,

66
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,490
so his wild words are one thing.

67
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,480
But you, Bai Yihan, a dignified prince who has always been prudent,

68
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,520
dare to speak such absurd words!

69
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,120
Do you

70
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,400
truly believe I dare not punish you?

71
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,600
I have failed Your Majesty's trust.

72
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,560
I would do anything else for Your Majesty,

73
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,720
but this one thing,

74
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,520
please show mercy.

75
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,520
Bai Yihan,

76
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,600
how dare you humiliate me!

77
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,720
Father,

78
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,320
kill her!

79
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,000
Bai Yihan,

80
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,280
so it's because of this woman

81
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,850
that you dare abandon my princess?

82
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,880
Your Majesty, everything is my fault.

83
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,530
I accept whatever punishment you decree,

84
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,240
but I beg you to spare Lianxiang.

85
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,560
Han'er!

86
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,720
Quickly beg the Emperor and Princess to spare you!

87
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,040
Stop saying such reckless things!

88
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:15,920
Fine.

89
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,200
Bai Yihan,

90
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,240
I shall grant your wish.

91
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,400
Guards!

92
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,560
Here!

93
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:26,240
Take Bai Yihan and that girl Lianxiang

94
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,640
and throw them in prison!

95
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,000
No!

96
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,360
Stop! You can't!

97
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,120
You mustn't, Your Majesty!

98
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,400
You!

99
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,800
Lianxiang is the person you've been looking for!

100
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,800
She's the one you've been searching for all this time!

101
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,240
Wang Yuan!

102
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,680
Your madness is cured?

103
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,640
What did you just say?

104
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,480
This old servant escaped death

105
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,240
and finally found Lianxiang.

106
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,040
Your Majesty,

107
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:03,840
look!

108
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,440
This is Lianxiang's jade pendant.

109
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,200
Indeed!

110
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,560
This is exactly

111
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,890
the jade pendant I gave to Yuzhu years ago!

112
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,520
Guards!

113
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,920
Take Wang Yuan away and treat him well.

114
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,240
Thank you, Your Majesty.

115
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,720
Yuzhu...

116
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,000
that was my mother's name!

117
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,200
Come.

118
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,080
Come.

119
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,040
What's your mother's name?

120
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,520
Your Majesty,

121
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:51,440
my mother's name was Huang Yuzhu.

122
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,320
No wonder.

123
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,980
No wonder you look so similar.

124
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,200
How is your mother doing now?

125
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,200
My mother is dead.

126
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,660
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

127
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,880
Before she died, my mother left me this jade pendant.

128
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,960
She told me to come to Cuiyu Manor in the capital to find my relatives.

129
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,490
But I couldn't find anyone.

130
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,840
For safety reasons,

131
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,720
I had to disguise myself as a man.

132
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,960
Later I ran out of money

133
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,120
and ended up on the streets.

134
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,800
Fortunately, the Prince took me in.

135
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,720
He didn't know I was a woman,

136
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,360
which led to all those ridiculous situations.

137
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,000
It was all my fault,

138
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,159
not the Prince's.

139
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,679
My daughter,

140
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,919
you've suffered so much.

141
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,040
I have failed both you and your mother.

142
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,360
Your Majesty.

143
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,800
What did you say?

144
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,400
I am your father.

145
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,200
You...

146
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,680
are my daughter.

147
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:08,840
You...

148
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,120
You are my father?

149
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,200
Eighteen years ago, your mother and I

150
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,460
met and fell in love in the southern city.

151
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:22,320
When we parted, she was already pregnant.

152
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:26,640
I told her I would send for her after I returned to the palace.

153
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,060
But unexpectedly, the late Emperor arranged for me to marry the Empress.

154
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,080
Your mother was devastated

155
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,800
and refused to see me.

156
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,960
So I built Cuiyu Manor

157
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,240
and ordered Wang Yuan to wait there.

158
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,160
After eighteen years,

159
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,120
your mother finally sent a letter

160
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,360
saying our daughter would come to seek me out.

161
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,480
I am truly delighted

162
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,880
to have people waiting at the manor

163
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,640
but unexpectedly, the manor was attacked.

164
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,000
So

165
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,920
I had Bai Yihan and Qin Ziyuan

166
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,450
secretly investigate your whereabouts.

167
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,400
To my surprise

168
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:07,600
you've been at the Prince's mansion all along.

169
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,720
But my mother never told me

170
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,920
that my father is

171
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,600
the current Emperor.

172
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,560
I suppose

173
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,120
your mother feared I would break my promise again

174
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,160
and therefore

175
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,480
kept the truth hidden all this time.

176
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,490
If he doesn't acknowledge you,

177
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,490
then just pretend you don't have a father.

178
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,160
You need to find a way

179
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,120
to support yourself.

180
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,960
Father, the auspicious time for the wedding has arrived.

181
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,360
The Prince and I should proceed with the ceremony now.
