1
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,640
and rich.

2
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,360
Bin Qi.

3
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,360
Qingxin Cardiology.

4
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:37,400
Bozhong.

5
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:37,800
Li Ju.

6
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,880
You can draw?

7
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,160
I asked you to inform me.

8
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:23,720
I was about to tell you.

9
00:01:24,039 --> 00:01:26,039
Duke Zhao said he wanted to eat beef and pumpkin soup

10
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,680
he wants beef and pumpkin soup.

11
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,920
To grab a man's heart

12
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,840
you have to grab a man's stomach first.

13
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,400
We need to find out from Princess Yongyi.

14
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,600
You like Princess Yongyi?

15
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,400
Who said you like Princess Yongyi?

16
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,640
Go and do something for me.

17
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,040
Put this in Brother Yi Han's tea.

18
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,440
These are all yours.

19
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,200
She actually asked me to poison you.

20
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,760
I've done everything for you.

21
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,440
Let’s see if he will agree to our marriage.

22
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,480
I can only use the best strategy.

23
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,320
I have to get him out.

24
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,360
It's not as complicated as you think.

25
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,280
Let's talk outside.

26
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,800
What are you playing with me?

27
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,400
I can't bathe with him here.

28
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,520
What happened just now?

29
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,200
I should be responsible for him.

30
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,080
Tell me the truth.

31
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,800
Ms. Qin gave me some money.

32
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:55,280
She said she wanted to be friends with you.

33
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,760
Then you have to obey her.

34
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:00,720
Qin Yaoyao drugged me.

35
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,520
What else have you done to betray me?

36
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,960
I just want to take a bath.

37
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,920
Just let me stay inside for a while.

38
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,880
Color is emptiness. Emptiness is color.

39
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,880
Braised fish, braised beef, braised egg fried rice.

40
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,240
How could this happen?

41
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,840
Let's talk tomorrow.

42
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,000
The withered leaves fall.

43
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:25,280
The withered leaves fall 3,000.

44
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:25,600
The withered leaves fall 3,000.

45
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,360
The withered leaves fall

46
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:27,880
I miss you so much

47
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,240
Acacia to the bone

48
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:30,920
Do you know how much I miss you?

49
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,400
Who says to sit in front?

50
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:32,800
Who says the past is old?

51
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,880
In short words, it's cold autumn

52
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:40,680
[The folding technique cannot be understood and looks back.]

53
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,360
The branches don't need to be cut.

54
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:41,960
No need to look back

55
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:43,880
I still remember how slim I was.

56
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,200
I still remember

57
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:43,880
The slim hands

58
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,720
Wit...

59
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,840
Flowers

60
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:46,880
The lantern is dry.

61
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,200
Is it better than

62
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,040
Is it as good as before?

63
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,520
The glass is gone

64
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,560
Lights shine on the night

65
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,800
Lights shine on the night

66
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,080
Floral dance.

67
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:01,680
The fragile flower dance.

68
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:01,920
The broken flowers dance on the bridge

69
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,400
Flowers dance on the bridge

70
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,560
The rain shatters my heart and my loneliness

71
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,120
The rain shatters my sorrow and loneliness

72
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:08,680
The person I love looks back

73
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,920
The person I love comes back

74
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,040
The lights are in the middle of the night

75
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:12,400
The lights are falling

76
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,600
The lights are falling and the people are sad

77
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:13,920
The lights are falling

78
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,200
Please freeze the wind

79
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,440
The breeze freezes the water.

80
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:18,720
It's a direct description.

81
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,200
Direct teaching means losing weight.

82
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:22,280
Beauty is light

83
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,040
Who sighs

84
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:23,360
Who sighs at the empty building

85
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,280
Who sighs

86
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:24,920
Who sighs at the empty tower

87
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,120
A thread of sword spirit wandering

88
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,520
A thread of sword spirit wandering all over the world

89
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,320
The old is the old

90
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,040
Who will spend the rest of his life together?

91
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,120
Who will be with us when we forget our lives?

92
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,040
Gu Ying Du.

93
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:40,600
Gu Ying has one cup and two wine.

94
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,160
Gu Ying, Du, one cup of wine.

95
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,120
A thousand miles away from the cold mountain, the wind and the glass.

96
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:42,400
A thousand miles away, the scenery is beautiful.

97
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:42,840
A thousand miles away, the wind, moon, and the glass sky.

98
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,160
The wind, moon, the glass sky

99
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:44,520
Cold?

100
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,040
Why did you

101
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,120
steal half of my life, leave one dream

102
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,400
Secretly

103
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:51,880
Secretly half a moment of life left a dream

104
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,400
I'll be drunk

105
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,200
Who says one gets drunk and sorrows

106
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:56,560
A promise is like the wind

107
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:56,840
A promise is like a wind.

108
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:57,560
The promise of the time seems to be kept by the wind.

109
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,160
A promise is like a letter of wind.

110
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,040
The wind brings joy to you

111
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:00,640
Like the old cloth on sleeves

112
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,520
It's as wide as a sleeve with thick cloth

113
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,040
Thousands of sorrows are better than love.

114
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,480
Thousands of sorrows are better than love.
