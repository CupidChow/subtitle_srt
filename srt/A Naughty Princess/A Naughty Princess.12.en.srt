1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,680
Qin Fu Pu Kun

2
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,280
Qin Fu Pu Di

3
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:18,000
Qin

4
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,360
Binqi

5
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:27,640
Da Jing Su Si Ke

6
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,960
Li Shu

7
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:37,400
Ben Shu

8
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,360
Their meeting was very strange.

9
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:06,520
I must tell the Prince immediately.

10
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,600
The Prince left early this morning.

11
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,000
The Prince isn't with me today.

12
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,140
Han'er didn't come to greet me this morning.

13
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,730
He would never leave without saying goodbye.

14
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:26,579
The palace sent word that His Majesty summoned the Prince.

15
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,200
He must be staying overnight at the palace.

16
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,579
The Prince will surely return tomorrow.

17
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,600
Madam, please rest early.

18
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,240
Quick, get me a fast horse.

19
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:31,080
Stop beating him! Please stop!

20
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:17,440
I don't know if he's really stupid or just pretending.

21
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,520
I beg you to spare him.

22
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,740
Where is that person who sought refuge at the manor?

23
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,840
The one next to him must be Liu Niang.

24
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,460
Please, I beg you to stop beating him.

25
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:58,180
He's the key person to solving the Cuiyu Manor case.

26
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,440
But who are these people who captured him?

27
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,130
How do you know all this so clearly?

28
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,120
If you don't speak up now.

29
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,299
I've had enough of knowing you in this lifetime.

30
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:44,600
I came all the way to Ghost Valley Manor to find you.

31
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,720
We were just following orders.

32
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,700
My mother sent me to Cuiyu Manor to stay with relatives.

33
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,810
I'm fine. What about the person you were chasing?

34
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,600
I'm worried it might be a diversion.

35
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Prince, you're so good to me.

36
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:58,010
I'm mainly concerned about Wang Bo's safety.

37
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,680
He acts like he doesn't understand.

38
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:06,800
Withered leaves, all gone.

39
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:06,880
Thousands of withered leaves have fallen.

40
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,210
All leaves have fallen.

41
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,360
A longing deep in my bones.

42
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,420
Do you know how deeply I yearn for you?

43
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,360
Who sits before me?

44
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,620
Who speaks of the moon?

45
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,720
The gentle sound lingers.

46
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,000
The lingering sounds by the fence enter the cold autumn.

47
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,360
The clear sounds linger on.

48
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,560
The loud sounds echo.

49
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,240
Do not.

50
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,480
Breaking a branch, do not look back.

51
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,040
Still remember when.

52
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,920
Still remember.

53
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:25,040
Those years.

54
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,730
The lamp burns out as the oil depletes.

55
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,680
Is it still as beautiful as before?

56
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,640
Is it still as wonderful as before?

57
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,520
Enjoying a glass of crystal.

58
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,240
Savoring a glass of colored glaze.

59
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:40,480
The green lamp illuminates the night.

60
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,920
Green lamp lights the night as fireflies flow.

61
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,920
Dancing flowers.

62
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,600
Rain shatters sorrow.

63
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,840
Rain breaks the sorrowful heart.

64
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,100
Rain fragments grief.

65
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,040
She is joyful.

66
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,200
She suddenly looks back.

67
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:51,560
Suddenly.

68
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,360
She turns around unexpectedly.

69
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,740
The dimming lights bring sorrow.

70
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,040
Cold wind flows freely.

71
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,800
Making one grow thin and frail.

72
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,720
Only someone lightly.

73
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,120
Who sighs softly at the passing emptiness?

74
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,480
Who sighs gently?

75
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:07,880
Wandering.

76
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,610
The sword's spirit wanders to the edge of the sky.

77
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:11,920
Old, old.

78
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,120
As before, as before.

79
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:13,930
Like one.

80
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,880
Who will share this forgotten life with me?

81
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,840
Who will share this life of oblivion?

82
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:17,920
In a life of forgetting, who will accompany me?

83
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,240
Who will share these forgotten clouds with me?

84
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,320
Looking at shadows.

85
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,800
Looking at my shadow, craving a cup of intoxicating wine.

86
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,120
A thousand miles of cold mountains, wind flowing through empty glass.

87
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,120
Cold.

88
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:24,120
August's colored glass sky.

89
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,380
Why turn those string instruments into evening bells?

90
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,000
Stealing half a life to keep one dream.

91
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,040
Stealing a moment of this fleeting life to hold onto a dream.

92
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,500
Stealing a moment of life.

93
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,920
Who declares to get drunk?

94
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,040
Promise like the wind itself.

95
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:38,680
Giving you a promise like the wind that stays for ten days.

96
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,200
Giving you a promise like asking the wind to stay.

97
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:40,480
A timely promise to you.

98
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:40,200
Like asking the wind itself.

99
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,720
Giving you a promise like asking the wind to linger.

100
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,440
Like sleeves of old coarse cloth.

101
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,640
Like raising sleeves of coarse fabric.

102
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:45,800
A thousand sorrows are better than having no feelings at all.

103
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,640
A thousand sorrows are better than this overwhelming emotion.

104
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,440
A thousand worries are better than this absence of feeling.

105
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:49,680
Your thousand ways and the moon king's lack of feeling.

106
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,080
Having a thousand sorrows is better than the moon's lack of emotion.
