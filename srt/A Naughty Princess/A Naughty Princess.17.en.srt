1
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,320
Strong.

2
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,400
Lianxiang, she’s a girl.

3
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:12,840
Lianxiang.

4
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,680
Yu-ju.

5
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,800
How is that possible?

6
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,000
Miss.

7
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,800
Why did you change?

8
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,720
You are a girl.

9
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,450
You two are together every day.

10
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,000
and even live together.

11
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,960
Bai Yi Han, how could you do this?

12
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:11,720
Your Majesty.

13
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,920
As you all saw,

14
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,380
Her Highness is not feeling well.

15
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,760
My attendant was eager to save her.

16
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,780
and acted recklessly.

17
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,400
Lianxiang.

18
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,120
She risked her life to save the princess.

19
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,680
That proves her loyalty to you.

20
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,720
Your Majesty, please forgive her

21
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:37,240
and spare her life.

22
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:41,280
But she stopped the imperial physician

23
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,880
and insisted on humiliating me.

24
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,079
In public,

25
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:48,800
in public.

26
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,800
Even if she is a woman,

27
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,930
she shouldn't be forgiven.

28
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,680
But now Her Highness

29
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,200
is fine now.

30
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,760
This means Lianxiang did save the princess.

31
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,720
So what?

32
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,280
She's disrespecting me because she's disrespecting me.

33
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,200
Guards, arrest her.

34
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,720
Wait.

35
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,280
Yongyi.

36
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,680
Today is your birthday.

37
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,600
It's a happy day. Don't use violence.

38
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,800
Let's

39
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,560
for now.

40
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,360
Father.

41
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,000
Father is right.

42
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,600
Today is a happy day.

43
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,840
Even if someone misspeaks,

44
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,680
he shouldn't be executed.

45
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,920
Your Majesty, my attendant made a big mistake.

46
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,840
Please allow me to take her back

47
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,100
and teach her a lesson.

48
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,720
to calm her anger.

49
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,440
No.

50
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,079
She has to stay here.

51
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,680
All right.

52
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,040
Let her go back with Duke Zhao.

53
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,960
Learn the rules from now on.

54
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:00,760
Leave.

55
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,960
Thank you, Your Majesty.

56
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,040
Ziyuan,

57
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:31,320
Find out the background of Bai Yi Han's attendant.

58
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,240
Her background?

59
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,970
The more detailed, the better.

60
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,320
Yes, Your Majesty.

61
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:38,040
Remember.

62
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,620
You're the only one investigating this.

63
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,640
Don't let anyone know.

64
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,280
Your Majesty, may I ask,

65
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,860
why don't you ask Bai Yi Han directly?

66
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,280
With Bai Yi Han's character,

67
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,360
he won't let a girl

68
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,600
to follow him.

69
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,040
There must be something wrong.

70
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,320
If I ask him,

71
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,480
I'm afraid he'll hide it from me

72
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,160
and create more troubles.

73
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,400
I understand.

74
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,800
I'll do it right away.

75
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,960
If this girl is really my daughter,

76
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,000
why didn't she

77
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,600
at such a critical moment?

78
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,080
Maybe I thought too much.

79
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,320
Duke, you may come in.

80
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,080
What do you think?

81
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,040
Am I pretty?

82
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,560
I've asked someone to arrange a superior room for you.

83
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,080
Don't live in the same room with me anymore.

84
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,880
No, no.

85
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,560
Nonsense.

86
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,600
Your identity as a woman has been revealed.

87
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,320
How can you live in the same room with me?

88
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,400
You think too much.

89
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,120
Who wants to live with you?

90
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,520
I mean,

91
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,810
you don't have to prepare a room for me.

92
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,880
I can stay in my former room.

93
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:35,960
No.

94
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,360
I thought you were a boy.

95
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,720
You don't need to pay attention to your place.

96
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,850
Since you're a girl,

97
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,120
you should live better now.

98
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,400
Say no more.

99
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,330
Just listen to my arrangement.

100
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,520
Got it.

101
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,020
Thank you, Your Highness.

102
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,360
Uncle Wang, how is he?

103
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,840
I've taken him home.

104
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,040
But he's still unconscious.

105
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,010
I don't understand.

106
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,400
why this princess

107
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,680
is so interested in this case?

108
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:21,120
The princess is not only interested in the case of Cuiyu Villa,

109
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,650
she even wanted to harm you.

110
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,440
Did you offend her in the Princess Mansion?

111
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,560
How dare I?

112
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,800
Unless...

113
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,320
Unless what?

114
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,600
Unless she believed Qin Yaoyao's nonsense.

115
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,460
she thinks you're siding with me.

116
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,120
because you were afraid

117
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,090
That's why she wants to kill me.

118
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,040
If she thinks that way,

119
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,100
if she thinks that way.

120
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:51,920
But it's okay.

121
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:53,400
I'm back.

122
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:58,360
And look what I brought back.

123
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,840
I've never seen

124
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,120
I've never seen Yi Han talk so much.

125
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,200
to speak for a servant.

126
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:22,120
Speaking of this attendant, your name is Lianxiang, right?

127
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,400
How despicable.

128
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,900
She disguised herself as a man and lied to us for so long.

129
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,720
I hit her because I thought she was a man.

130
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,840
Yi Han must have misunderstood that I was too cruel

131
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,440
That's why he hates me.

132
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:37,520
Use your brain.

133
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:40,159
Of course he knows you don't know.

134
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,559
He hates you

135
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,679
because of a misunderstanding.

136
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,920
Your Highness.

137
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,600
You mean...

138
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,640
Brother Yi Han

139
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,720
hates me for no reason.

140
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:05,400
He must like Lianxiang.

141
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,080
right?

142
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,480
It's getting late.

143
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,410
You should go back to the Grand Preceptor's Mansion.

144
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,360
Yes, Your Highness.

145
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,200
Get down.

146
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,520
Lianxiang.

147
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,160
You took away my beloved.

148
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,440
and let Father show you mercy.

149
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,520
I really underestimated you.

150
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:47,840
Your Majesty,

151
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,400
I've brought Uncle Wang to Duke Zhao's Mansion.

152
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,760
He's safe now.

153
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,560
He's still unconscious.

154
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,200
Only Uncle Wang's illness

155
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,880
can recover soon.

156
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:07,440
But Qin Ziyuan is working for the princess.

157
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,520
You must guard against him.

158
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,680
I understand.

159
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,640
As for your servant, Lianxiang,

160
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,880
when did Lianxiang come to your mansion?

161
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,010
Your Majesty, half a month ago.

162
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,160
How is her background?

163
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,840
Lianxiang came to the capital to look for her family.

164
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,800
But her family has passed away.

165
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,000
She dressed up as a man to be safe

166
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,840
and wandered in the capital alone.

167
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,560
I...

168
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,960
I took her in

169
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,400
so I took her in.

170
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,530
and came to the capital to look for her family.

171
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,800
Did she tell you where her family lives?

172
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,920
She never mentioned that.

173
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,240
What about her father?

174
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,360
Her father has passed away.

175
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,640
Duke,

176
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,880
Your priority now

177
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,960
is to find my lost daughter.

178
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,640
And you must find her before Qin Ziyuan does.

179
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,920
Yongyi already knows about this.

180
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,160
I'm worried that she'll hurt her.

181
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:25,920
Yes, Your Majesty.
