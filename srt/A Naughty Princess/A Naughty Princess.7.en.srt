1
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,600
Qiang.

2
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,840
Look how nice Yihan is to you.

3
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,760
He even went to the countryside specially to pick grapes for you.

4
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,600
Don't be suspicious of him anymore.

5
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,960
But he's always so indifferent to me,

6
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,730
while spending every day with a servant instead.

7
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,840
Yihan recently hired a new young attendant.

8
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,039
I don't know his background yet.

9
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,080
What background could he possibly have?

10
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,680
He's just a little beggar.

11
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,660
Brother Yihan took him in because he felt sorry for him.

12
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,600
This is how my son behaves.

13
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,000
He has a kind heart.

14
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,320
Mrs. Bai, you don't know.

15
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,850
That young attendant is not so simple.

16
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,479
What about him?

17
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,759
I dare not say.

18
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,400
I'm telling you to speak.

19
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:54,080
Prince, you got hurt because you saved me.

20
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,140
Let me apply medicine for you.

21
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,480
I'm fine.

22
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,800
But you're injured, aren't you?

23
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,440
I'm perfectly fine.

24
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,479
I'm not hurt.

25
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,760
Miss,

26
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,000
if you're traveling alone,

27
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,860
it would be safer to dress as a man.

28
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,040
So it was her.

29
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,480
How could she not be injured?

30
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,640
Come,

31
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,720
let me examine you.

32
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,130
No need, Your Highness.

33
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,079
I'm just a servant.

34
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,840
How could I let you examine my wounds?

35
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,560
Right?

36
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,680
We just went through hardship together.

37
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,410
That makes us brothers in arms.

38
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,400
Between brothers, there's no master and servant.

39
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,040
Come.

40
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,400
Let me see where you're hurt.

41
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,000
It's not necessary, I...

42
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,850
You'd better tell me the truth.

43
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:17,840
I'm done for.

44
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,160
There's no escape this time.

45
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,460
Your Highness.

46
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,210
The lady requests your presence with Lianxiang.

47
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,200
I understand.

48
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,400
Mother.

49
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,800
Lady Bai and Miss Qin.

50
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:51,880
That's him.

51
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,400
Han'er, sit down.

52
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,520
Yes.

53
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,200
I remember your name is Lianxiang, right?

54
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,400
Yes, my lady.

55
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,640
Mother,

56
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,600
why did you want to see us?

57
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,480
Nothing important.

58
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,640
Just wanted to chat with you.

59
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,680
I heard you hired a new attendant,

60
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,529
and I'd like to know about her background.

61
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,400
Where are you from?

62
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,280
Who's in your family?

63
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,080
My lady, I'm from South City,

64
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,280
and I'm all alone.

65
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,400
South City is far from the capital.

66
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,200
Why did you come here?

67
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,000
Remember,

68
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:45,320
before you see your father,

69
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,840
don't tell anyone.

70
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,680
About...

71
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,800
about your father's situation.

72
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,920
My lady,

73
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,720
my father passed away when I was young,

74
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,640
and I grew up with my mother.

75
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,720
Six months ago, my mother died of illness

76
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,640
and told me to come to the capital to find relatives.

77
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,280
But on my journey, I got lost

78
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,170
and even encountered bandits.

79
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,600
I finally made it to the capital.

80
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,920
But my relatives' home was already empty,

81
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,640
and I had spent all my travel money.

82
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,920
Fortunately, the Prince kindly took me in,

83
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,180
so I wasn't left homeless on the streets.

84
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:33,770
I'm deeply grateful to you and the Prince for your kindness,

85
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,400
and will serve you with all my heart.

86
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,800
Get up, child.

87
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,640
Please rise.

88
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,000
Good girl.

89
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,840
From now on, treat this mansion as your own home.

90
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,440
As long as you serve the Prince well,

91
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,080
I will treat you well.

92
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,200
Thank you, Madam.

93
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,920
I will serve the Prince with all my heart and strength.

94
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,560
Madam,

95
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,440
this servant doesn't know any manners at all.

96
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,320
She's too casual with the Prince.

97
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,080
Enough. They're about the same age.

98
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,440
It's normal for them to fool around together.

99
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,040
Don't overthink it.

100
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,240
No matter how playful they are,

101
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,700
a master and servant shouldn't be so reckless with each other.

102
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:26,880
Qin Yaoyao.

103
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,880
Did you witness this with your own eyes?

104
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,680
When and where did you see it?

105
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:37,600
I saw it in your room last night.

106
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,840
Why were you in my room at night?

107
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,280
What were you planning to do to me?

108
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,360
Once the deed is done,

109
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,080
he'll have no choice but to agree to marry me.

110
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:53,400
I'm sorry, Brother Yihan.

111
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,100
I don't remember clearly.

112
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,409
Perhaps it wasn't in your room.

113
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,200
If you can't explain yourself clearly,

114
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,800
then you're slandering my reputation.

115
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,200
Even if you're the Grand Tutor's daughter,

116
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,400
you won't escape punishment.

117
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,040
Enough arguing, both of you.

118
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,080
Go back to your rooms and calm down.

119
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,660
Let's end this matter here for today.

120
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,320
I'm tired. Let's go back.

121
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,580
I have failed in my duty

122
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:30,170
and couldn't stop Bai Yihan from going there.

123
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,720
I intended to kill him,

124
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,280
but Qin Ziyuan suddenly appeared.

125
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,480
I was no match for him,

126
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,440
and they got away.

127
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,920
You're quite bold

128
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,320
to dare touch the Prince.

129
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,080
Only by killing him can we stop his investigation.

130
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:43,880
Damn you!

131
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,000
If you dare harm Bai Yihan,

132
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,320
I'll kill you first.

133
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,130
I deserve to die.

134
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,720
Enough.

135
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,600
It seems Bai Yihan has also discovered

136
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,120
the clues about Wang Bo at Ghost Valley Manor.

137
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,520
You must capture Wang Bo before he does.

138
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,820
Do you know why I'm punishing you?

139
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,960
It's my fault your reputation was ruined.

140
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,330
Sit down and eat.

141
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,500
Thank you, Your Highness.

142
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,050
Why do you eat like that?

143
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,160
Not a trace of ladylike manners.

144
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,040
You already know.

145
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,040
Yes.

146
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,640
So I deceived you by dressing as a man.

147
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,440
You won't send me away, will you?

148
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,690
I can't blame you entirely.

149
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,840
After all, I was the one who asked you to dress as a man.

150
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,600
You remember now.

151
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,800
That day you saved me from the bandits.

152
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,600
Today you lured away the masked man to save me.

153
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,800
How did you discover I was a girl?

154
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,800
The food is getting cold. Eat quickly.

155
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,440
No, you have to tell me.

156
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,760
Your Highness, please tell me.

157
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,440
What gave me away?

158
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,520
Tell me, I really want to know.

159
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,680
Why exactly?

160
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,720
You don't need to know.
