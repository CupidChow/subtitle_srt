1
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,600
Qiang!

2
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,400
Are you hurt?

3
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:11,720
I'm fine.

4
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,039
I never expected

5
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,000
that the person who redeemed you would be an assassin.

6
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,880
Thanks to you two gentlemen for saving me,

7
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,240
I barely escaped with my life.

8
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,039
It's nothing.

9
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:22,940
By the way, Yanzhi.

10
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,000
I heard

11
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,840
you took this young master's jade pendant as collateral.

12
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,320
Now that I'm back,

13
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,890
you can return it to him.

14
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,720
Yanzhi, please give it to me.

15
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:34,680
I...

16
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,300
I pawned the jade pendant.

17
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,479
What?

18
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:40,120
You...

19
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:45,370
How dare you deceive us!

20
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,360
Where did you pawn my jade pendant?

21
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,960
Liu's Pawnshop

22
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,039
The jade pendant you're looking for

23
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:00,400
has already been purchased by someone else.

24
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,160
What kind of person bought it?

25
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,480
In our business,

26
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,360
we never ask for buyers' names.

27
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,720
Besides, even if we knew,

28
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,320
we wouldn't tell you anyway.

29
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,480
I am Bai Yihan from the Prince's mansion.

30
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,800
Oh, it's Your Highness. My apologies.

31
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,880
Shopkeeper, I won't make things difficult for you.

32
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,120
But if that buyer comes to Liu's pawnshop again,

33
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,000
please make sure to send someone to inform me at the Prince's mansion.

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,960
I understand.

35
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,090
I will follow Your Highness's orders.

36
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,280
Let's go.

37
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,480
Do you think this jade pendant belongs to

38
00:02:37,079 --> 00:02:38,720
that attendant Lianxiang who serves the Prince?

39
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,520
Indeed.

40
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,800
So Bai Yihan went to Baihua House

41
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,000
to investigate Wang Bo's whereabouts.

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,480
Lianxiang used this jade pendant

43
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,280
to get information from the women at Baihua House.

44
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,460
This jade pendant looks quite valuable.

45
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,040
How could a commoner like him possess such a treasure?

46
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,079
I heard it was left to him by his mother on her deathbed.

47
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,560
This attendant

48
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,800
is truly loyal to the prince.

49
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,760
Willing to give up something so precious

50
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,560
just to get a lead for the prince.

51
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,120
According to Yaoyao,

52
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,760
Bai Yihan trusts this attendant completely

53
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,220
and takes him everywhere.

54
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,880
Let's not talk about them anymore, Ziyuan.

55
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,800
Thank you for your hard work lately.

56
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,000
You must keep a close eye on everything.

57
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,880
I'm waiting for you to return with achievements and marry me.

58
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,440
Please rest assured, Princess.

59
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,770
I will not disappoint your expectations.

60
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,840
Then I'll take my leave now.

61
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,320
I will definitely help you find your jade pendant.

62
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,760
It's alright.

63
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,360
It's just a material possession.

64
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,890
But that's the keepsake your mother left you.

65
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,700
Actually, my mother didn't like that jade pendant.

66
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,080
Because it was a love token my father gave to her.

67
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,960
But my father betrayed my mother, so...

68
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,440
Such a sad story.

69
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,180
How can you talk about it so casually?

70
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,399
I don't really know what happened between them.

71
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,839
I've never even met my father.

72
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,839
And my mother never talks about him.

73
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,280
But whatever happened between them...

74
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,840
I believe they must have loved each other once.

75
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,500
And they both surely loved me.

76
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,290
They just had their difficulties.

77
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,400
You know.

78
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:34,570
Parents always have struggles that their children don't understand.

79
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,800
What's wrong?

80
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,080
Nothing.

81
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,920
You look like

82
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:46,000
Like what?

83
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,680
you're hungry.

84
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,760
You're the one who's hungry.

85
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,440
Yes, how did you know?

86
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,600
Hey, don't walk so fast.

87
00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:01,960
Here's your roast chicken. Enjoy.

88
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:03,940
Roast chicken!

89
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,020
How did you know I like roast chicken?

90
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,200
Another jar of wine, please.

91
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:09,960
Right away.

92
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,840
Didn't you mention before?

93
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,760
You were carrying roast chicken

94
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,960
when you ran into the sneaky Qin Ziyuan.

95
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,440
And to find me,

96
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,600
you didn't even eat

97
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,560
before rushing to Ghost Valley Manor.

98
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,720
As expected of the Prince,

99
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,720
you remember every word perfectly.

100
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,080
Prince, what's wrong?

101
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,000
Qin Ziyuan is actually

102
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,260
secretly meeting with Princess Yongyi.

103
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,560
From the looks of it,

104
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,840
they must have just started meeting.

105
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,120
What I mean is,

106
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,120
Qin Ziyuan

107
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,640
actually told Princess Yongyi

108
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,170
about the Cuiyu Manor case.

109
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,890
The Emperor trusts him so much,

110
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,420
yet he betrays that trust.

111
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,280
Exactly.

112
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,200
Enjoy your meal.

113
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,440
Thank you.

114
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,380
Prince, please calm down.

115
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,800
Don't get upset over someone like Qin Ziyuan.

116
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,640
We've already found Uncle Wang.

117
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,160
Once his madness is cured,

118
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,160
we can continue our investigation.

119
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,600
Hmm.

120
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,880
Let's have Uncle Wang stay at the clinic for a few days.

121
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,360
I hope his condition improves soon.

122
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,960
The men I sent you are dead.

123
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,440
Even Wang Bo was taken away by Bai Yihan.

124
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,320
I strictly followed your orders, Princess.

125
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,960
I didn't dare harm Bai Yihan in any way.

126
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,840
That's why I had to sacrifice the pawn to save the king.

127
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,640
Nonsense!

128
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,680
Are you blaming me?

129
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,610
I wouldn't dare.

130
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:43,520
It's just that if you could promote me soon,

131
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,920
I would be able to handle matters more effectively.

132
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,480
The tasks I gave you -

133
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,640
you haven't accomplished a single one.

134
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,570
Yet you dare ask me for a promotion?

135
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,000
Listen carefully.

136
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,520
If you still can't find Wang Bo,

137
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,920
don't bother showing your face to me again.

138
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:04,400
Yes. I will not fail this time.

139
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,880
Your Highness, let's eat together.

140
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,040
Let me get one for you.

141
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,760
This one is good.

142
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,720
Eat.

143
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,820
How did you know I went to Ghost Valley Manor?

144
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,600
That's easy.

145
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,720
You usually take me everywhere you go.

146
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,040
Then suddenly you went off alone.

147
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,360
It must be somewhere I'm not allowed to go.

148
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,520
I thought about it.

149
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,080
And Ghost Valley Manor was the only possibility.

150
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,560
You must have been afraid I'd be in danger.

151
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,200
So you didn't take me, right?

152
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,920
Don't flatter yourself.

153
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,560
That's not what I was thinking.

154
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,560
Oh, fine.

155
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,420
So I'm just being conceited then.

156
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
If you knew it was dangerous there,

157
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,200
why did you still come looking for me at Ghost Valley Manor?

158
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,960
Of course to call you home for dinner.

159
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:54,600
Why?

160
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,400
Oh.

161
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,440
Because I wanted to eat with you.

162
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,200
Food tastes better when you're around.

163
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,880
Come, eat.

164
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,480
See how much I'm enjoying it?

165
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,960
I almost choked.

166
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,880
Prince, that roast chicken was really delicious.

167
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,540
When can we go eat there again?

168
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,920
Han'er, you're finally back.

169
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,480
Lady Bai.

170
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,080
I was worried sick about you.

171
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,320
Mother, I'm fine.

172
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,920
Thankfully, Lianxiang was here to comfort me.

173
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,400
I was so anxious yesterday.

174
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,919
Mother, I'm a bit tired.

175
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,880
I'll go back to my room to rest now.

176
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:41,360
Han'er, Qin Ziyuan is here.

177
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,960
He's waiting for you.

178
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,380
Perfect. I have something to ask him too.

179
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,520
Why are you here?

180
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,520
Bai Yihan.

181
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,400
My sister is the noble daughter of the Grand Preceptor's household.

182
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,400
Yet in your mansion, she was bullied by a servant.

183
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,760
You must give me an explanation today.

184
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,620
What explanation?

185
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:17,250
Your sister beat my servant without permission.

186
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,520
The wounds haven't even healed yet.

187
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,680
I didn't pursue the matter with you.

188
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,920
Yet you come demanding an explanation from me.

189
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,120
Brother Yihan.

190
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,960
He's just a servant.

191
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,660
Yet you keep calling him your man.

192
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,440
What's so special about him anyway?

193
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,500
Why are you protecting him like this?

194
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,520
Bai Yihan.

195
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,920
My sister is living in your Bai residence.

196
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,180
Yet you let her suffer such humiliation.

197
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,040
Today,

198
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,840
you must drive this servant away.

199
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,760
Miss Qin, if you feel wronged

200
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,440
you're free to leave the Bai residence.

201
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,080
No matter what,

202
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,920
I will not drive Lianxiang away.

203
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,920
You're actually asking me to leave?

204
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,440
We have an engagement!

205
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,000
Madam Bai and my parents have already arranged it.

206
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,440
I make my own decisions about my marriage.

207
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,640
I will not marry you.

208
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,840
Bai Yihan.

209
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,960
Perhaps you're still thinking about Princess Yongyi,

210
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,720
which is why you're so cold to my sister.

211
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,560
Let me tell you,

212
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,360
I've been engaged to the Princess for some time.

213
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,520
Don't get any ideas.

214
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,560
Your marriage has nothing to do with me.

215
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,240
I decide my own marriage.

216
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,240
Hey!

217
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,560
The princess has arrived.
