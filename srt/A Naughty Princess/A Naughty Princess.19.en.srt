1
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,600
Strong.

2
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,280
Your Highness.

3
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,760
It's too hot up there.

4
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,160
I'm coming down to sleep.

5
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,520
Madam.

6
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,530
Madam, Yaoyao is here to pay her respects.

7
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,640
Yaoyao is here. Please sit down.

8
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,079
Madam.

9
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,800
Madam, is that Lianxiang still in the mansion?

10
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,360
Yes. Why do you ask?

11
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,960
Even though we now know she's a girl,

12
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,090
how can a girl serve as an attendant to the Prince?

13
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,040
I think we should give her some money and let her go.

14
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,520
Yaoyao, I will not send Lianxiang away.

15
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,480
Han would never agree to it.

16
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:23,079
I understand, but Madam, you see...

17
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,960
At the Princess's birthday banquet last time,

18
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,440
Lianxiang clearly offended Princess Yongyi.

19
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,120
If we keep her in the mansion,

20
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,160
what if

21
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,400
the Princess feels the Prince doesn't care about her feelings

22
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,960
and takes her anger out on the Prince's household?

23
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,400
That would be trouble.

24
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,920
I need to discuss this matter with Han.

25
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,000
Why are you here?

26
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,600
Well...

27
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,020
I'm sorry, Your Highness.

28
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,040
It was too hot last night.

29
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,600
I meant to get up early and go back to bed.

30
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,000
But I accidentally overslept.

31
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,680
Oh.

32
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,440
What's wrong?

33
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,960
Lady Bai,

34
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,600
I'm still too late.

35
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,240
Are you all that impatient?

36
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,440
Breakfast is ready.

37
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,440
Let's go get something to eat first.

38
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,520
Bai Yihan.

39
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,000
You pretend to be

40
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,159
a gentleman who stays away from women.

41
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,200
But behind everyone's back, you've kept a girl

42
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,930
disguised as a man by your side.

43
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,200
And engaged in such shameful behavior.

44
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,680
You're truly a cultured scoundrel.

45
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,720
Yaoyao, before things are clear,

46
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,040
don't talk nonsense.

47
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,100
The facts are right in front of us.

48
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,080
What else do I need to figure out?

49
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,140
How can we get married in the future if you're like this?

50
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,120
Miss Qin, I've already told you.

51
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,720
I make my own decisions about marriage.

52
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,600
No matter where you heard about

53
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,080
our supposed engagement,

54
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,680
Today I'm telling you seriously:

55
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,920
I will not marry you.

56
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,500
You want to marry her instead?

57
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,040
She's just a lowly servant.

58
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,360
If you marry her,

59
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,800
it will be the greatest disgrace to your Bai family.

60
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,520
Shut up!

61
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,520
If you continue with this nonsense,

62
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,180
I'll make you leave the Bai residence today.

63
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,080
Madam, just listen to this!

64
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,370
He's actually defending a servant

65
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,960
and repeatedly threatening to throw me,

66
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,360
his bride-to-be, out of the house.

67
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,960
Imperial decree!

68
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,640
Duke Bai Yihan, receive the decree.

69
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,640
Duke Bai Yihan,

70
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,040
a man of outstanding virtue and accomplished in both civil and military affairs,

71
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:44,720
is a perfect match with Princess Yongyi,

72
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,040
creating a union of talent and beauty.

73
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:53,600
We hereby decree that Duke Bai Yihan shall marry Princess Yongyi,

74
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,840
on an auspicious date.

75
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,360
By imperial order.

76
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,050
Why aren't you accepting the decree and expressing gratitude?

77
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,200
Yihan.

78
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,930
I accept the decree and express my gratitude.

79
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:32,610
Prince, aren't you coming back to the palace with me to express gratitude?

80
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,200
Allow me to make some preparations.

81
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,920
I will come to the palace later to express my gratitude.

82
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,720
Bai Yihan.

83
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,040
You don't want to marry me.

84
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,760
You want to marry her.

85
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,200
Now the Emperor has issued a decree.

86
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,880
Do you dare to defy the imperial edict?

87
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,410
Not marry Princess Yongyi,

88
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,060
but marry her instead?

89
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,440
This is truly amusing.

90
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,040
Guards!

91
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,240
Throw Qin Yaoyao out.

92
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,280
She is forbidden from ever setting foot in the Bai residence again.

93
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,080
Yes.

94
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,280
Bai Yihan, you can't stop me.

95
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,360
I will be back.

96
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,720
Haner, Qin Yaoyao is right.

97
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,159
The imperial edict cannot be defied.

98
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,440
Mother.

99
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,520
I will handle everything.

100
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,720
Lianxiang.

101
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,280
I'll take you somewhere.

102
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,400
Brother, why did this happen?

103
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,440
Didn't you say

104
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,280
the Emperor would arrange your marriage to Princess Yongyi

105
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,280
and mine to the Prince?

106
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,760
Why did it turn out like this?

107
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,000
What's really going on?

108
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,120
What's happening here?

109
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,320
How would I know?

110
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,370
I'm going to find the Princess.

111
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,000
Brother!

112
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,640
Brother!

113
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,840
This place is so beautiful.

114
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,460
Even the breeze smells sweet.

115
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,400
How did you find this place?

116
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,600
Don't tell me you've brought other girls here before.

117
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:02,960
Lianxiang, I'm sorry you had to suffer.

118
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,720
Well, I do feel a bit wronged.

119
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,080
But I know you've done your best.

120
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,680
You've always been protecting me with all your strength.

121
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,600
So enduring this small hardship

122
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,480
is definitely worth it.

123
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,160
If I can't protect you this time,

124
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,000
would you blame me?

125
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,280
No.

126
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,800
What did you say?

127
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,440
When the Prince heard about the Emperor's marriage decree,

128
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,040
he looked very reluctant.

129
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,170
Yes, Your Highness.

130
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,240
You may leave now.

131
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:57,000
Bai Yihan, you have humiliated me like this.

132
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,800
I won't let you have your way.

133
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,080
You are mine.

134
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,800
You will always be mine.
