1
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,600
Force.

2
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,720
The auspicious time for the wedding has arrived.

3
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,850
The Duke and I should proceed with the wedding ceremony.

4
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,280
Come.

5
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,250
This is your sister Lianxiang.

6
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,280
Lianxiang,

7
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,560
this is your sister Yongyi.

8
00:01:19,039 --> 00:01:19,840
Sister.

9
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,800
Father, if we don't start the ceremony now, we'll miss the auspicious time.

10
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,760
Your Majesty, please reconsider.

11
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,280
The one I truly love

12
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,289
is Princess Lianxiang.

13
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,759
Princess.

14
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:41,759
Didn't you tell me

15
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,080
that you were willing to marry Bai Yihan?

16
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,200
Father,

17
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,200
today is the most important day of my life.

18
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,120
You can't let your daughter live with regret.

19
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:51,920
Yongyi,

20
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,520
too much has happened today.

21
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,920
The wedding will be postponed.

22
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,320
I will take Lianxiang back to the palace

23
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,000
and announce her princess status to the world.

24
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,440
Father.

25
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,160
It's too hasty to recognize her as a princess

26
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,889
based on just one jade pendant.

27
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,680
I am your daughter.

28
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,280
Isn't my marriage important?

29
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,080
Enough!

30
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,280
Lianxiang.

31
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,400
You've suffered for so many years.

32
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,960
Tell me honestly,

33
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,800
do you truly love Bai Yihan?

34
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,840
Father,

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,800
enough.

36
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,000
Tell me.

37
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,560
Father.

38
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,640
I'm here.

39
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,740
This is the first time you've called me that.

40
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,840
I am truly happy.

41
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,800
I grew up in the countryside

42
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,440
always believing I was just a village girl.

43
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,560
My mother taught me from childhood

44
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,640
to know my place,

45
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,340
to understand propriety,

46
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,760
not to covet what doesn't belong to me.

47
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,530
I've always followed my mother's teachings,

48
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,440
never doing anything beyond my station.

49
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,600
Until I came to the capital

50
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,090
and entered the Duke's residence.

51
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,680
I discovered

52
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,690
I had fallen in love with someone beyond my reach.

53
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,640
I always concealed my feelings,

54
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,160
but he kept fighting for me.

55
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,760
He even risked his life

56
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,960
and repeatedly defied your will for me.

57
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,760
Today,

58
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,160
I want to be brave for him just once.

59
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,640
I like him.

60
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,240
He is the Prince of Bai.

61
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,280
Bai Yihan.

62
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,880
How shameless!

63
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,930
You dare to compete with me?

64
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,400
Yongyi.

65
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,920
Don't speak to your sister like that.

66
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,960
She is not my sister.

67
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,640
Enough.

68
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,540
I have decided.

69
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,140
The wedding between Yongyi and the Prince is canceled.

70
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:18,079
Lianxiang and the Prince shall be married instead.

71
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,100
Thank you, Father.

72
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,400
Guards!

73
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,760
Yongyi.

74
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,340
What are you doing?

75
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,159
Father, since you won't stand up for me,

76
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:42,040
I have to take matters into my own hands.

77
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,800
I am your only daughter.

78
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,860
I am the only princess in the kingdom.

79
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,460
You're being ridiculous!

80
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,000
Everyone, leave at once!

81
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,640
Guards!

82
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,440
Father,

83
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,040
I've dismissed all your guards.

84
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,810
Only my people remain here now.

85
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,600
Seize them!

86
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,000
Commander Li,

87
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,160
you dare betray me?

88
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,480
Young Master Qin, you can't blame me.

89
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,920
The Princess offered too high a price.

90
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,360
Enough talk. Do it.

91
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,200
As you command.

92
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,240
Commander Li, what are you doing?

93
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,440
Your Highness,

94
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,920
I destroyed Cuiyu Manor for you.

95
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,040
I stopped the Prince from investigating.

96
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,480
I searched for the commoner princess.

97
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,600
I've done so much for you.

98
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,660
But what about you?

99
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,760
Things have come to this point now.

100
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,920
I get nothing in return.

101
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,159
So,

102
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:38,000
don't blame me for no longer serving you.

103
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,040
How dare you!

104
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:39,840
Your Majesty,

105
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,000
if you prepare 10,000 taels of gold,

106
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,600
I will release the Princess.

107
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,280
Otherwise, don't blame us for being ruthless.

108
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,040
You insolent traitor!

109
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:53,100
Release the Princess at once and I will spare your life.

110
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:57,480
Your Majesty, I'll give you three days to consider.

111
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,280
We'll take the Princess with us for now.

112
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,280
Don't move!

113
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,040
Attack!

114
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,040
Bai Yihan,

115
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,080
you thought by forbidding me from coming to the Bai residence,

116
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,610
I wouldn't be able to get in?

117
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,800
What's happening here?

118
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,159
Assassins! Quick!

119
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,760
Have your men catch the assassins!

120
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,560
Someone come and catch them!

121
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,560
Catch them!

122
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,060
They've already escaped.

123
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,240
It's Lianxiang. Quickly, go get help!

124
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,040
Alright.

125
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,120
Move faster.

126
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:38,159
Move.

127
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,440
Go.

128
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,120
Move.

129
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,080
How dare you

130
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,920
take me hostage.

131
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,600
Princess.

132
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,300
Before the Emperor pays your ransom,

133
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,680
I will treat Your Highness with the utmost respect.

134
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,740
What are you doing?

135
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,680
Move.

136
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,240
Go.

137
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,400
This is Princess Yongyi.

138
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,520
Please spare us, Princess.

139
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,880
Mercy! Please

140
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,720
spare our lives.

141
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,580
Your Highness.

142
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,400
I knew you wouldn't honor

143
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,659
the position and rewards promised to me.

144
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:39,840
That's why

145
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,880
I spared a few servants from Cuiyu Manor.

146
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,400
In three days,

147
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,600
if the Emperor doesn't send the ransom,

148
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:50,040
I'll lock you up with them.

149
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,640
We'll see how

150
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,920
they'll take revenge on a princess

151
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,840
who wanted them dead.

152
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:57,840
You!

153
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:58,920
Move.

154
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,200
Your Majesty.

155
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,280
Well?

156
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,160
Have you found Princess Yongyi and Lianxiang?

157
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,640
We've searched everywhere,

158
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,640
but there's no trace of Lianxiang or Princess Yongyi.

159
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,040
We only found

160
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,780
Lianxiang's jade pendant outside the mansion.

161
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,640
Is that so?

162
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,840
Lianxiang treasures that pendant dearly.

163
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,240
She specifically asked for it back from me.

164
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:37,800
Why would she leave it outside the mansion?

165
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,920
Princess!

166
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,320
Commander Li has gone out.

167
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,780
I'm here to rescue you now.

168
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,480
Come.

169
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,370
How did you get here?

170
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,640
I've been following you all along.

171
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,240
Commander Li will be back soon.

172
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,880
We need to escape now.

173
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,520
Slow down.
