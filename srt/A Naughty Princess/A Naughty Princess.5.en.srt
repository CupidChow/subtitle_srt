1
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,400
Strong.

2
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,160
Why are you here?

3
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,240
As my attendant,

4
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,120
you get up later than I do.

5
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,840
I couldn't sleep last night,

6
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,320
so I overslept today.

7
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,000
I'll go prepare your breakfast right away.

8
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,880
Don't bother.

9
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,360
You're angry.

10
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,600
I promise I won't do it again.

11
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,700
Please don't send me away.

12
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,600
I'll do anything you ask,

13
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,360
really.

14
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,120
Whatever I ask you to do,

15
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,120
you always agree.

16
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,760
Get up quickly.

17
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,160
I'll take you somewhere.

18
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,440
Young Master Wang!

19
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,760
Come in, come in!

20
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,800
It's been so long since your last visit.

21
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,880
Young Master Wang.

22
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,740
Your Highness,

23
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:18,640
this is a brothel.

24
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,400
Young master, you're here.

25
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,440
Please come inside.

26
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:29,760
Come,

27
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,320
young master, hurry.

28
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:35,000
Gentlemen,

29
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,560
follow me to the private room.

30
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,760
This way, please.

31
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,130
Come in, young master. Please have a seat.

32
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,079
Girls, we have customers!

33
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:51,920
Coming!

34
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:54,960
Young master.

35
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,360
Young master.

36
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,040
You two,

37
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,480
take good care of these gentlemen.

38
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,960
If you need anything, come find Mama.

39
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,120
Yes, Mama.

40
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,960
Here, young master,

41
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,160
let me pour you some wine.

42
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,640
Let me help you drink it.

43
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,520
No need.

44
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,000
Oh my, this young master

45
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,840
why are you so shy?

46
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:17,960
Besides...

47
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,240
He looks so young and tender.

48
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,079
Young master,

49
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:21,920
I'll move over there.

50
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,250
It's a bit crowded here.

51
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,960
This young master is so handsome.

52
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,560
Let's have a drink together.

53
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,400
Young master,

54
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,040
why are you running away?

55
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,320
Um, it's a bit hot over there.

56
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,850
Come, young master. Here's to you.

57
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,600
Drink up.

58
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,320
You can really hold your liquor.

59
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,720
I wonder what kind of girl

60
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,400
you prefer?

61
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,530
What a coincidence.

62
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,640
I like girls just like you.

63
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,800
Did you hear that?

64
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,170
This handsome gentleman says he likes me.

65
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,040
Today,

66
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,600
I'll keep him good company.

67
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,730
How will you do that?

68
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,440
Except for you,

69
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,640
no one else catches my eye.

70
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,240
You're so annoying,

71
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,080
young master.

72
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:12,840
Have another drink.

73
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,040
I never thought that the mighty prince

74
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,880
would be such a womanizer.

75
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,880
What are you mumbling about?

76
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,400
I was saying these grapes look very fresh.

77
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,680
Do you like them?

78
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,200
Let me feed you then.

79
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,320
Is it sweet?

80
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,200
Sweet.

81
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,800
Then have another one.

82
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,840
Have some grapes, young master.

83
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,170
You have one too.

84
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,200
Thank you, young master.

85
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,060
Xiangqin would like to share a lovers' cup with you.

86
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,720
A lovers' cup?

87
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,000
Young master.

88
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,360
Have some grapes.

89
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,560
Your desserts here are delicious.

90
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,720
Try one.

91
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,560
I've tracked down

92
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,080
Wang Bo who escaped from Cuiyu Manor that day.

93
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,610
He's hiding at Guigu Manor.

94
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,000
I'll take men to capture him right away.

95
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,120
Very good.

96
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,520
You must proceed with caution.

97
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,200
Don't let him escape.

98
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,680
Yes, sir.

99
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,600
Young master,

100
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,360
you haven't tried the pear cake yet.

101
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,280
Have a taste of it.

102
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,340
I'll try some then.

103
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,440
How is it?

104
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,050
This one is the best.

105
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,400
Your Highness...

106
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,960
Where did they go?

107
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,480
Stop pretending.

108
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,480
Do you think men come to Baihua House

109
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,280
just for the food?

110
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,890
Could they possibly...

111
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,680
Prince.

112
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,480
Young Master.

113
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,120
Young Master.

114
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,800
Young Master.

115
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,640
Why are you leaving?

116
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,700
What are you doing?

117
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,450
Get out of my way.

118
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:04,760
No!

119
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,440
Young Master, I'm begging you.

120
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,240
Please don't.

121
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,720
What's going on here?

122
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,580
Close the door.

123
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,120
Are you acquainted with him?

124
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,520
Bai Yihan.

125
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,920
You're nothing special.

126
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,640
I don't know.

127
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,320
I am Bai Yihan from the Prince's mansion.

128
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,120
Tell me.

129
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,159
Where is he?

130
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,840
I don't know.

131
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,000
You've known Wang Bo for years.

132
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,530
Would he really not tell you his whereabouts?

133
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,760
Young master, you've mistaken me for someone else.

134
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,280
Wang Bo's close friend is Liu Niang, not me.

135
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,420
Where is Liu Niang?

136
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,920
She was redeemed some time ago.

137
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,040
Who redeemed her?

138
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,640
I don't know. Even Liu Niang herself doesn't know.

139
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,800
Did Liu Niang tell you

140
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,880
where she would go after leaving Baihua House?

141
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,680
No.

142
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:14,320
Since she left, there's been no news of her.

143
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,340
I need to inform Princess Yongyi.

144
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,960
Stop pretending.

145
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,760
I've already investigated.

146
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,280
You and Liu Niang are like sisters.

147
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,810
How could she not tell you where she was going?

148
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,140
Will you tell me or not?

149
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,860
Your Highness.

150
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,120
Don't be so harsh with the young lady.

151
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,850
Put your sword down.

152
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,840
Ah, that's right.

153
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,040
Stop right there.

154
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,760
Don't be afraid, miss.

155
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,200
My master has a bit of a temper,

156
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,680
but he's not a bad person, really.

157
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,200
Put the sword down.

158
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:01,880
Sit.

159
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,440
I just heard you saying

160
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,200
that this Liu Niang

161
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,140
was redeemed by someone she didn't know.

162
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,200
Yes.

163
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,440
Isn't that strange?

164
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,960
Why would someone redeem her if they don't know her?

165
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,220
There must be another purpose behind it.

166
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,480
And once Liu Niang left,

167
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,800
there's been no news at all.

168
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,000
Aren't you worried?

169
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,200
You can't leave Baihua House,

170
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,720
but you could tell us her whereabouts.

171
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,049
We can help you find her.

172
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,400
I promise you,

173
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,280
if we really find Liu Niang,

174
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:38,000
I'll definitely come back and let you know.

175
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,000
Can you promise not to harm Liu Niang?

176
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,039
I promise.

177
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:45,880
I...

178
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,440
This is all my money.

179
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,240
I offer my money as a guarantee.

180
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,400
This is the jade pendant my mother left me before she died.

181
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,920
I'm giving it to you now.

182
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,050
When I bring Liu Niang back,

183
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,840
you can return it to me then.

184
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,330
Is that acceptable?

185
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,280
I.

186
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,480
Take it.

187
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,600
Trust us.

188
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,160
Hmm.

189
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,200
Let me tell you.

190
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,760
You're walking so slowly. Didn't get enough to eat?

191
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,820
I left halfway through the meal. Of course I'm not full.

192
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,440
Snacks.

193
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,400
Prince, where did you get these snacks?

194
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,600
From Baihua House.

195
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,000
Delicious.

196
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,680
Consider it repayment from Qin Yaoyao.

197
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,200
Huh? What?

198
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,530
It's your reward for retrieving Qin Yaoyao's purse.

199
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,000
Wow.

200
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,840
You actually remember that?

201
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,000
I thought you were so busy every day

202
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,060
that you'd surely forget these little things about me.

203
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,880
I have always had a good memory.

204
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,240
I remember everything, big or small.
