1
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,600
Qiang!

2
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,720
Why are you still here?

3
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,960
Princess Yongyi, look.

4
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:13,960
This attendant is always

5
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,520
trying to curry favor with the Prince.

6
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:21,280
Enough. Stop making such a fuss.

7
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,890
Qin Yaoyao actually complained to the Princess.

8
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:28,280
The Prince usually doesn't like to bring attendants.

9
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,400
I pay my respects to Your Highness.

10
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,120
So you're Lianxiang?

11
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,080
Yes.

12
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,200
Your Highness has come to visit.

13
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,729
I, Bai Yihan, failed to welcome you from afar.

14
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,000
Please forgive me.

15
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,320
It was my sudden whim

16
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,860
to visit the Prince's mansion late at night.

17
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,160
How could you be at fault?

18
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,810
I came at an inconvenient time.

19
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,580
I must have disturbed Your Highness's meal.

20
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,680
A mere servant

21
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,240
dares to dine at the same table as the Prince?

22
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,000
He has no manners whatsoever.

23
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,480
Princess,

24
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,800
you should expel him from the Prince's residence.

25
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,920
This is the Prince's residence,

26
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,640
and Miss Qin has no right to speak here.

27
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,400
You!

28
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,320
I-

29
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,700
You're the one who lacks manners.

30
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,900
The Prince and I have matters to discuss.

31
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,200
You may all leave now.

32
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,040
Yes, Princess.

33
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,960
What? Do you have something else?

34
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,920
Let's go, Miss Qin.

35
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,680
Don't think that having the Prince's protection

36
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,960
gives you any reason to be smug.

37
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,020
I will eventually.

38
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,720
Miss Qin,

39
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,920
I'm not your opponent.

40
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,760
I heard you were injured.

41
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,160
How are you? Is it serious?

42
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,240
Your Highness, my injury is not serious.

43
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,840
There's no one else here now.

44
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,050
Why are you being so formal with me?

45
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,200
Let me see.

46
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,640
Your Highness, this is inappropriate.

47
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,800
What's inappropriate about it?

48
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:54,320
Haven't we always taken care of each other since childhood?

49
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,440
But we've grown up now.

50
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,260
We're no longer children.

51
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,930
We must observe propriety between men and women.

52
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,560
As soon as I heard from Qin Ziyuan that you were injured,

53
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,090
I rushed over immediately.

54
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,840
But you're being so distant with me.

55
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,760
It truly breaks my heart.

56
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,640
See? I knew Brother Yihan

57
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,480
has no interest in Princess Yongyi.

58
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,320
I'm the one he likes.

59
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,720
What? Don't you believe me?

60
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,120
I believe you. I really do.

61
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,520
Fine, let me tell you something, little attendant.

62
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,360
Brother Yihan's father,

63
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,740
When General Bai was still alive,

64
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,520
the Bai family was also a noble and prestigious house.

65
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,320
Haner,

66
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:47,060
look how beautifully your father performs this sword technique.

67
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,560
But ever since old General Bai passed away,

68
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,620
the Bai family has fallen from grace.

69
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,880
Although the Emperor granted Brother Yihan

70
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,010
the title of Prince of the Commandery,

71
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,880
he's still not truly aristocratic.

72
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,840
Compared to my Grand Preceptor's mansion,

73
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,700
his status is still far inferior.

74
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,290
Mother, I want some roast chicken.

75
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,080
Alright, I'll buy you some.

76
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,920
Shopkeeper, one roast chicken please.

77
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,400
Coming right up!

78
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,330
This one will do.

79
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,640
This one.

80
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,409
You dropped something.

81
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,450
You dropped something.

82
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,000
You dropped something.

83
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,080
Why are you crying?

84
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,360
My father died.

85
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,440
I'll never have a father again.

86
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,720
My mother said when I was very little,

87
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,040
my father passed away.

88
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,360
Have you ever seen him?

89
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,120
No.

90
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,560
But even without a father around,

91
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,000
we can still grow up just fine.

92
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,840
Really?

93
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,240
You must grow up well.

94
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,720
Remember to come find me later.

95
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,080
Okay, I will definitely come find you.

96
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,720
It's precisely because of the vast difference in our social status.

97
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,560
Yihan is afraid he's not good enough for me.

98
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,640
That's why he never dared to confess his feelings to me.

99
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,760
Did you hear that?

100
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,480
I heard it. The Prince likes you,

101
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,680
not the Princess.

102
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,210
It seems you don't want to see me at all,

103
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,400
nor do you want me to visit the Bai residence.

104
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,040
Your Highness, my injury is truly not serious.

105
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,520
I'm just wondering

106
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,159
why Qin Ziyuan would tell you

107
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:49,480
about my injury.

108
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,720
I heard that

109
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,360
Father gave you and Qin Ziyuan a secret order.

110
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,080
What was so dangerous

111
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,560
that you got injured?

112
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,540
Your Highness,

113
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,360
since it's a secret order from His Majesty,

114
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,160
it's absolutely confidential,

115
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,840
and I'm afraid I cannot disclose it.

116
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,800
Your Highness should not be inquiring about it.

117
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,130
I was just asking casually.

118
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,960
Why are you being so serious?

119
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,680
Yes, Princess.

120
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,480
You keep calling me 'Princess'

121
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,600
over and over again.

122
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,480
Has our relationship

123
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,840
become so distant?

124
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,960
No.

125
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,320
If not,

126
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,360
then don't be so distant with me.

127
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,720
Let's be close like we were

128
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,159
when we were young.

129
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,080
Alright?

130
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:57,840
Shh!

131
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,400
Don't make a sound or we'll be discovered.

132
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,410
Do you remember when we were children?

133
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,120
When General Bai brought you to the palace?

134
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,640
We caught butterflies together in the garden.

135
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,040
You said even the most beautiful butterfly

136
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,520
wasn't as beautiful as me.

137
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:26,320
You also said that when we grew up,

138
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,850
you would come and marry me.

139
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,039
Calm down. Let's wait and see.

140
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,760
There might still be a chance.

141
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,920
You must trust your Yihan.

142
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,760
Your Highness, childhood promises shouldn't be taken seriously.

143
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,220
But I've kept every word you said in my heart,

144
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,640
like vows I dare not forget.

145
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,280
But since my father passed away,

146
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,780
the Bai family has lost much of its standing.

147
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,320
My humble status

148
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,820
is no longer worthy of Your Highness.

149
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,560
Even my title as a prince

150
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,480
was granted only because you begged the Emperor.

151
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,920
I have nothing but respect for you,

152
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,500
and no inappropriate feelings whatsoever.

153
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,440
How could you say such heartless words to me?

154
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,600
I...

155
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,960
I knew you would belittle yourself,

156
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,620
that's why I begged my father.

157
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,920
A prince and princess are a perfect match.

158
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,120
Who would dare say we're incompatible?

159
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,880
But if

160
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,800
you no longer have feelings for me,

161
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,640
then I will leave.

162
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:15,600
And I won't appear before you again.

163
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,400
Princess.

164
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,400
Princess.

165
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:35,840
I...

166
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,680
It's all over now.

167
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:48,000
From now on, we'll stay together.
