1
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,320
Strong.

2
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,720
Bai Yihan.

3
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,879
You've humiliated me like this,

4
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,520
I won't let you have your way.

5
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,200
You are mine,

6
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,680
you will always be mine.

7
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,860
Your Highness.

8
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,090
What are you doing here?

9
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:22,120
Your Highness, didn't you promise to marry me?

10
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,640
Why did the Emperor issue

11
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,570
a decree for you to marry Bai Yihan?

12
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,480
What else?

13
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,960
I've given you tasks many times

14
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,360
but you've never completed any of them properly.

15
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:35,720
Your Highness, I've truly been trying my best.

16
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,759
But Wang Bo is now

17
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,039
in the Prince's hands.

18
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,160
He works harder than you.

19
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,259
Your Highness.

20
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,120
Is this matter the reason

21
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,600
you married Bai Yihan?

22
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,360
You may leave.

23
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,220
Your Highness.

24
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,200
I've already given you a chance.

25
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:58,800
You didn't take it.

26
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,329
I used to come here often when I was little.

27
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,060
My father brought me here.

28
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,440
Look at that tree over there.

29
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,600
The tree wasn't this tall back then.

30
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,040
He...

31
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,320
At that time, he

32
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,380
brought me here to learn horseback riding and archery.

33
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,640
He also took me bug hunting.

34
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,560
I don't know how to ride horses or shoot arrows.

35
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,360
But I can go bug hunting with you.

36
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,360
After my father passed away,

37
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,120
whenever I need to make an important decision,

38
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,480
I come here alone to think quietly.

39
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,600
Wondering

40
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,040
if he were still here,

41
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,770
what would he do.

42
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,160
I wish I had a father.

43
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,000
Then I could understand how you feel.

44
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,090
From now on, you have me.

45
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,120
I'll always be with you.

46
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:21,280
Okay, I understand.

47
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,920
From now on, I'll just

48
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,360
be a good maid in the Bai household.

49
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,820
I'll serve Madam Bai well.

50
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,040
This way we can always be together.

51
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,410
I won't marry Princess Yongyi.

52
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,400
Lianxiang.

53
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,320
I love you.

54
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,560
She's just a lowly servant.

55
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,640
If you marry her,

56
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,620
it will be the greatest disgrace to your family.

57
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,480
I'm just a commoner's daughter.

58
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,840
I'm truly not worthy of a prince.

59
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,360
You are such a wonderful person.

60
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,920
I don't want to be your flaw.

61
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,880
Don't speak so lowly of yourself.

62
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,480
Whether commoner

63
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,280
or prince,

64
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,120
as long as two people in love

65
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,080
are sincere and honest enough,

66
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,480
nothing else

67
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,360
matters.

68
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,800
But what about Princess Yongyi?

69
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,840
I can see that

70
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,720
she truly cares for you too.

71
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,160
You grew up together

72
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,570
and were betrothed.

73
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,080
Now the Emperor has decreed your marriage.

74
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,080
I can't let you defy imperial orders because of me.

75
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,540
Listen to me first.

76
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,120
Yes.

77
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,880
After my father died, she did

78
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,760
ask the Emperor to grant our family the princely title.

79
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,320
She has been kind to our family.

80
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,650
She has feelings for me.

81
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,770
But I only feel respect and gratitude toward her.

82
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,080
You're the one I've always loved.

83
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,580
When did you draw this?

84
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,760
It looks terrible.

85
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:29,720
I drew it the first night you dressed as a woman.

86
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,080
Didn't you say you couldn't draw someone

87
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,520
unless they were in front of you?

88
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,320
Qin Ziyuan was right this time.

89
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:47,159
As long as the person you're drawing is in your heart,

90
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,970
you can draw them even when they're not before your eyes.

91
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,560
I...

92
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,920
I've kept you in my heart for a long time.

93
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,920
Even when I close my eyes,

94
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,040
I still see you.

95
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,000
So cheesy.

96
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,560
I will definitely explain everything clearly to the Emperor

97
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,180
and ask him to withdraw his order.

98
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,250
No matter what happens,

99
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,180
I will stand by you through it all.

100
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,160
Oh no!

101
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,880
Congratulations on your wedding, Prince.

102
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,920
Han'er, you just left,

103
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,280
and a new imperial decree has arrived.

104
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,720
It orders you to marry Princess Yongyi today.

105
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,720
The princess is already waiting in your room for the ceremony.

106
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,720
This is absurd!

107
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,280
Are they forcing me into this marriage?

108
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,360
Lower your voice.

109
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,680
The Emperor is here too,

110
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,200
waiting in the inner hall.

111
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,159
My son,

112
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:39,360
news of your marriage to the princess has spread throughout the city.

113
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,520
What's done is done.

114
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,320
You have no choice but to comply.

115
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,280
Prince.

116
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,400
I just had such a peaceful sleep

117
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,240
and a beautiful dream.

118
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,080
I'm content with my life.

119
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,370
Prince, please go ahead with your wedding

120
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,200
and live happily.

121
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,980
Don't make your mother worry.

122
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,760
This child is so understanding.

123
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,120
Lianxiang, I want to make you my goddaughter.

124
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,720
You'll become Han'er's sister,

125
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,440
and no one will gossip about you anymore.

126
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,280
Thank you, madam.

127
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,130
I'll go help in the kitchen now.

128
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,640
Han'er.

129
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,040
Has the Prince returned?

130
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,120
Your Majesty.

131
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,160
Groom,

132
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,480
hurry up

133
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,080
and change for the ceremony.

134
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,240
You're back, Prince.

135
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:42,880
Look,

136
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,680
how do you like my makeup?

137
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,480
Why did you do this?

138
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:52,960
What's wrong?

139
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:57,440
Is my makeup too heavy?

140
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,450
You know my heart belongs to someone else.

141
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,080
And Qin Ziyuan loves you deeply.

142
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,700
Why did you ask the Emperor to arrange our marriage?

143
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,960
Why?

144
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,240
Don't you know why?

145
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,040
Because I like you.

146
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,440
You liked me too.

147
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,970
You're the one who changed.

148
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,280
But that doesn't matter.

149
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,880
Because we're destined to be together.

150
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,620
I will explain everything to the Emperor

151
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,520
and ask him to cancel our marriage.

152
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,080
Go ahead then.

153
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,840
The whole country knows about our wedding now.

154
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,760
If you back out,

155
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,320
the royal family will lose face

156
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,580
and your entire family will be executed.

157
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,280
Have you thought about Lady Bai

158
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,520
and that little attendant of yours?
