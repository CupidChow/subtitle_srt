1
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,440
Strong.

2
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,200
What?

3
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,880
Cuiyu Manor has been attacked.

4
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,080
I have failed you.

5
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,480
Please punish me, Your Majesty.

6
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,520
Listen, both of you.

7
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,520
I now command you

8
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,760
to carry out a task.

9
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,920
You must succeed. Failure is not an option.

10
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,240
Yes.

11
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,370
I await Your Majesty's instructions.

12
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,080
I have another daughter

13
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,520
living among common people.

14
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,479
I command you

15
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,720
to find her whereabouts at all costs.

16
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,160
Remember,

17
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,759
before you find her,

18
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,560
this matter

19
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,289
must not be revealed to anyone.

20
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,220
Yes, Your Majesty.

21
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,280
Buns.

22
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,450
I couldn't find Father.

23
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,720
Our money is all gone.

24
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,240
If this continues,

25
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,840
forget about the fare back to Nancheng,

26
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,079
we might not even have enough to eat.

27
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,440
I'm sorry for putting you through this.

28
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,760
Are you blind?

29
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,760
Don't you watch where you're going?

30
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,079
I was standing right here.

31
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:46,480
You bumped into me.

32
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,840
You little beggar, how dare you talk back to me.

33
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:51,320
Do you know who I am?

34
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,960
I'm sorry about earlier.

35
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,880
Please forgive me, miss.

36
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,720
Are you alright, miss?

37
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,250
My purse!

38
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,160
Where's my purse?

39
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,480
Stop right there!

40
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,600
Did you steal our lady's purse?

41
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,080
This is my purse.

42
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,280
It must be you.

43
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,210
Give it back now.

44
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,680
Or I'll have you arrested.

45
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,840
I've never even seen your purse.

46
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,400
I didn't take it.

47
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,360
What are you doing?

48
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,560
Where did you hide it?

49
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,260
Is that your purse over there?

50
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,600
Wenzhu!

51
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,560
That's my purse!

52
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,760
Go after him!

53
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,240
Miss!

54
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:27,200
Why should I?

55
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,570
That's ridiculous.

56
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,320
If you help me get my purse back,

57
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,400
I'll reward you.

58
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,360
Will you buy me two steamed buns?

59
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,760
Forget about two buns.

60
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,560
I could buy you the whole bun shop if you want.

61
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,600
Now hurry up and go!

62
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,640
You promised! Stop!

63
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,560
Hurry!

64
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,480
Stop!

65
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,680
Out of my way!

66
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,720
Got you! Still trying to run?

67
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:48,720
Stop!

68
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,800
Stop running! Halt!

69
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,000
It's him.

70
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,160
What are you doing?

71
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,000
What do you think I'm doing?

72
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,640
My attendant will be back soon.

73
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,240
He's very skilled in martial arts.

74
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,320
Attendant?

75
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,640
Do you think I'm a three-year-old? Attendant, huh?

76
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,320
Help!

77
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,360
Please spare me, sir!

78
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,320
How dare you!

79
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,920
Harassing a woman in broad daylight!

80
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,800
Arrest him and take him to the authorities.

81
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,520
Sir! Sir!

82
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,560
I was wrong, sir!

83
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,240
Let's go.

84
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,400
Move along!

85
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,120
Miss.

86
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,520
Are you traveling alone?

87
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,400
Yes.

88
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,800
If you're traveling alone,

89
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,659
it would be safer to dress as a man.

90
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,760
I understand.

91
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,450
Thank you for saving me.

92
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,130
You insolent thief!

93
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,960
How dare you steal in broad daylight!

94
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,920
Please spare me, sir!

95
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,160
I made a foolish mistake.

96
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,090
I beg you to let me go just this once.

97
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,760
There's no need to beg.

98
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,360
The authorities will decide your punishment.

99
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,760
Young man.

100
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,920
This should be your money pouch.

101
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,280
Look out!

102
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,960
Are you all right?

103
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,680
Yihan.

104
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,480
I got your pouch back.

105
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,800
Yihan.

106
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,720
You're back.

107
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,800
I thought you'd return tomorrow.

108
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,800
I was about to go to the Prince's mansion to find you.

109
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,760
This is the pouch I brought for you.

110
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,320
Don't leave yet.

111
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,360
Do you like it?

112
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,600
This young man seems a bit embarrassed.

113
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,840
He just helped you get your pouch back.

114
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,200
We should properly thank him.

115
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,200
Don't worry, Yihan.

116
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,800
I'll have Wenzhu reward him.

117
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,680
Yes, Miss.

118
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,040
Wait.

119
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,680
Stop shouting.

120
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,000
Don't disturb my lady's pleasant outing with the Prince.

121
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,680
She said if I helped get her pouch back,

122
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,140
she would buy me some buns.

123
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,840
Did you really retrieve the pouch?

124
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,960
The thief was clearly caught by our Prince.

125
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,690
What does it have to do with you?

126
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:38,960
You're being completely unreasonable.

127
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,480
Stop following us.

128
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,960
Some lady she is.

129
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:47,600
Hmph!

130
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,140
Prince's Mansion.

131
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,400
Have you prepared the things

132
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,360
I asked you to get for Yihan?

133
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,800
Yes, I have, miss.

134
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,380
You broke your promise first,

135
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,320
so don't blame me for taking extreme measures.

136
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,890
This royal mansion in the capital is truly magnificent.

137
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,720
Where's the kitchen?

138
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,280
I got it.

139
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,480
I'm going right now.

140
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,920
It's been so long since I've had such delicious pastries.

141
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,600
Brother Yihan.

142
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,000
Brother Yihan.

143
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,100
You must be hungry.

144
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,540
I specially asked someone to save chicken soup for you.

145
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,600
You must try it.

146
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,720
Miss Qin, there's no need for such courtesy.

147
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,400
You should go back and rest early.

148
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:03,920
What's wrong?

149
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,760
I, the daughter of the Grand Preceptor,

150
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,840
personally cooked for you,

151
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,720
and you're still so dismissive.

152
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,570
Miss Qin, as the daughter of the Grand Preceptor,

153
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,800
you should especially observe the propriety between men and women.

154
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,860
It's late at night.

155
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,640
A man and woman alone together

156
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:21,920
is improper.

157
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,300
What are you afraid of?

158
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,440
We'll be married sooner or later anyway.
