1
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,600
Excellent.

2
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,370
It's beautiful.

3
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,480
Much better than the Prince's work.

4
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,400
At least you have good taste, little attendant.

5
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,060
My brother knew nothing about painting before.

6
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,960
But to paint the Princess's portrait,

7
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,490
he practiced diligently for quite some time.

8
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,520
It's my honor

9
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,220
to paint for Her Highness.

10
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,520
Brother, the Princess isn't even here.

11
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,250
How did you manage to paint her?

12
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,600
As long as the person in the painting is in your heart,

13
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,660
even if they're not before your eyes,

14
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,080
you can still paint them.

15
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,570
What does the Duke think

16
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,400
of Ziyuan's reasoning?

17
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,480
Qin Ziyuan is correct.

18
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,440
May I ask, Princess,

19
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,320
has your personal attendant recovered?

20
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,080
At my birthday banquet,

21
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,610
why does the Duke bring up my attendant again?

22
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,680
What's all this excitement about?

23
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,360
Your Majesty.

24
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,760
Father, why are you here?

25
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,720
Today is my precious daughter's birthday.

26
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,680
How could I not come?

27
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,600
Rise.

28
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,760
Thank you, Your Majesty.

29
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,680
Continue.

30
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,079
Just as the Duke predicted,

31
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:59,810
the Princess has indeed been looking for Wang Bo.

32
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,720
Tell us,

33
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,240
and the Duke will no longer be in danger.

34
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,560
The Duke has hidden Wang Bo in a medical clinic.

35
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,640
A clinic?

36
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,090
You're not lying to me, are you?

37
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,960
How would I dare?

38
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,360
The Duke said he wanted to cure Wang Bo's madness first,

39
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,420
before questioning him thoroughly.

40
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,440
Which clinic?

41
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,770
That wasn't mentioned,

42
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,960
only that it's a clinic in the city.

43
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,640
A clinic in the city.

44
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,600
Very good.

45
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,280
It seems they will make their move soon.

46
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,960
Lianxiang, come here.

47
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,600
Coming.

48
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,960
Father, this is my new attendant.

49
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,600
Let him serve you.

50
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,579
Greetings, Your Majesty.

51
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,120
Han'er, you've been distracted.

52
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,480
Have something to eat.

53
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,880
This boy...

54
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,480
How does he look so similar to Yuzhu?

55
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,640
What's your name?

56
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,440
I am called Lianxiang.

57
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,360
Are your parents still alive?

58
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,440
My parents passed away long ago.

59
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,320
Do you have any siblings?

60
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,159
I'm the only son in my family.

61
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,880
You look like someone I used to know.

62
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:42,920
So be it.

63
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,000
Come.

64
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,320
Come talk to me.

65
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,409
Let's pretend I'm catching up with an old friend.

66
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,440
Yes.

67
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,560
Go investigate the medical clinics in the city.

68
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,400
Wang Bo is hiding in one of them.

69
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,600
Your Highness, where did you get this information?

70
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,480
The information is absolutely reliable.

71
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,360
Once you catch Wang Bo, kill him.

72
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,090
Don't let him fall into Bai Yihan's hands.

73
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,740
Killing Wang Bo...

74
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,180
His Majesty will surely blame us.

75
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,920
What? Are you afraid to die?

76
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:23,000
I'm not afraid to die, but...

77
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,200
His Majesty trusts me so much.

78
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,530
I've given you my whole heart for nothing.

79
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,320
If I had known it would be like this,

80
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,180
I wouldn't have let my father arrange our marriage.

81
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,560
What?

82
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,940
His Majesty has already arranged our marriage.

83
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,800
Your Highness, it's all my fault.

84
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,520
From now on, I'll do whatever you say.

85
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,140
I'll send someone to find Wang Bo right away.

86
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,360
Tonight,

87
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,200
I will eliminate all obstacles.

88
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,080
All of you,

89
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,120
go search all medical clinics in the city immediately.

90
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,440
Remember, you must find Wang Bo.

91
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,400
Yes, sir.

92
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,400
Qin Ziyuan,

93
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,180
you've indeed betrayed the imperial order.

94
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,200
I have not.

95
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,010
The princess's orders are also imperial orders.

96
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,760
I thought you still had some principles.

97
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,920
It seems I overestimated you.

98
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,400
Bai Yihan, who are you to judge me?

99
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,000
Aren't you yourself

100
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,520
secretly hiding Wang Bo

101
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,450
without reporting to the Emperor?

102
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,880
How do you know the Emperor isn't aware of this?

103
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,000
I...

104
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,760
Princess.

105
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,320
Your Majesty, let me tell you a joke.

106
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,000
Sure.

107
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,800
Once upon a time, two men were walking by a river.

108
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,680
Suddenly, they both fell into the water.

109
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,760
But neither of them knew how to swim.

110
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,680
One of them drowned.

111
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,800
He was called Dead Man.

112
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,440
The other one didn't drown.

113
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,040
Guess what he was called?

114
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,400
I suppose he was called Living Man?

115
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:21,920
No.

116
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,760
He was shouting 'Help! Help!'

117
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,960
Yes, he should be calling for help.

118
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,320
Lianxiang is so clever.

119
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,720
Everyone who meets her will like her.

120
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,520
Indeed.

121
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,300
This young attendant is so smart and quick-witted.

122
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,600
I even want to keep her by my side.

123
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:46,159
Then take her into the palace.

124
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,680
I cannot make this decision on my own.

125
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,940
We still need to see if the Prince agrees.

126
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:57,920
Yihan, this young attendant is clever and quick-witted.

127
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,720
How about I take her back to the palace?

128
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,740
Your Majesty, my attendant comes from humble origins.

129
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,820
How could she be worthy of serving Your Majesty?

130
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,160
I felt an immediate connection with her.

131
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,220
We had such a pleasant conversation.

132
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,160
I have an idea.

133
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,240
I think...

134
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,720
I shall adopt her as my goddaughter.

135
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:41,840
Father.

136
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,360
Yongyi!

137
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:44,880
Yongyi!

138
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,720
Yongyi, what's wrong?

139
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,200
Yongyi, what's happening to you?

140
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,120
I'll go call the royal physician!

141
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,050
There's no time.

142
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,360
Pour the wine into your palm.

143
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,760
Press it against my skin.

144
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,960
Physician! Summon the physician!

145
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,400
No, there's no time!

146
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,560
How dare you!

147
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:17,560
Guards!

148
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,320
No, Your Majesty!

149
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,320
Lock her up!

150
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,440
How dare you take liberties with the Princess!

151
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,840
I want your life for this!

152
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,240
No, I was helping her!

153
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,440
Bai Yihan, are you defying my orders?

154
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:38,640
Prince, what are you doing?

155
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,560
Your Majesty,

156
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,960
making a judgment before investigating the matter

157
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,890
would be unjust.

158
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,680
This attendant of yours openly harassed the Princess.

159
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,080
What more is there to say?

160
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,680
Your Majesty,

161
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,840
the Princess has experienced chest pains recently.

162
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,480
I wanted to call the physician then too,

163
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,280
but the Princess said there was no time

164
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:05,680
and told me to press wine against her chest with my hand.

165
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,680
Only then did the Princess slowly recover.

166
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,760
I saw that the situation just now was the same as before,

167
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,600
and I was concerned for the Princess's safety,

168
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,120
so I took the initiative.

169
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,000
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

170
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,160
Nonsense!

171
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,920
You took advantage of my weakness

172
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,920
to commit indecent acts against me.

173
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,400
Father, don't spare her!

174
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,320
Come here!

175
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,880
Bai Yihan, are you rebelling?

176
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,400
How dare you!

177
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,040
Your Majesty, Lianxiang did not harass the Princess.

178
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,480
She...

179
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,080
Lianxiang is a girl.
