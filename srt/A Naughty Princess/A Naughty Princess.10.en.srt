1
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,600
Strong.

2
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,440
Miss Qin.

3
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,600
Every word I've said today is true.

4
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,200
Since this is your first offense,

5
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,060
I won't pursue the matter for now.

6
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,640
But if Lianxiang is ever hurt because of you again,

7
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,730
I will hold you fully accountable.

8
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,680
Brother Yihan.

9
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,640
Please let me in to apologize to you in person.

10
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:25,680
No need.

11
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,640
I need to rest.

12
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:29,960
You should go now.

13
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:35,520
Fine, I'll leave then.

14
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,000
Brother Yihan actually treats me so coldly

15
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,479
for the sake of a mere attendant.

16
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,520
This is absolutely outrageous!

17
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,440
Until your wounds heal, you'll stay in my room.

18
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,700
You can't move around easily now.

19
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,460
It would be terrible if someone discovered you're a woman.

20
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,560
Oh, I understand.

21
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,840
Lady Bai, you've seen it too.

22
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:33,800
Yesterday, Yihan openly in front of so many people

23
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,840
only cared about protecting his little attendant

24
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,320
and didn't even escort Princess Yongyi when she left.

25
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:41,200
I hope Princess Yongyi won't blame us for this.

26
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,640
Don't talk nonsense. The princess is generous.

27
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,320
She won't blame anyone for such a small matter.

28
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,250
This matter is already in the past.

29
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,920
Don't mention it again.

30
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:32,280
Thank you, Your Highness. I appreciate your help.

31
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,530
I'm full and satisfied now.

32
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,970
All you do is eat all day.

33
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,360
Of course.

34
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,160
Eating is the most important thing in life.

35
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,800
When your stomach is full,

36
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,200
your brain works better.

37
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,640
Now that you're full,

38
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,040
tell me what good ideas you've come up with.

39
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,440
I have one right away.

40
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,970
Something's suspicious about Young Master Qin.

41
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,769
Tell me about it.

42
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,240
Last night, the Princess said

43
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,160
Young Master Qin told her you were injured.

44
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,210
That's why she visited your mansion at night.

45
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,040
How is that a problem?

46
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,800
It's a big problem.

47
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:36,200
Think about it.

48
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,000
Considering the relationship between you,

49
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,560
Young Master Qin, and Princess Yongyi,

50
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,960
why would Young Master Qin be so kind

51
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,720
as to tell Princess Yongyi

52
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,840
that his love rival was injured?

53
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,520
If I were him,

54
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,180
I would have told the Princess

55
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,940
that you went to Baihua House.

56
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,560
I know you were there investigating, of course.

57
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,480
But Young Master Qin might not think that way,

58
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,200
right?

59
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,520
You make a good point.

60
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,900
Qin Ziyuan is indeed suspicious.

61
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,360
But what concerns me more is how

62
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,280
Princess Yongyi knew I was injured in the first place.

63
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,120
There's another thing I can't figure out.

64
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:14,880
What is it?

65
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,480
Yesterday Young Master Qin saved us,

66
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,280
why didn't you tell him

67
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,280
we were going to Ghost Valley Manor?

68
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,000
I didn't want to tell him.

69
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,080
Oh, I get it.

70
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,560
Because you both like Princess Yongyi,

71
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,200
you dislike him, so you didn't tell him.

72
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,000
I, Bai Yihan, am not someone who mixes personal feelings with duty.

73
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,320
Besides, this mission was entrusted by the Emperor himself.

74
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,680
If I told Qin Ziyuan too early,

75
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,080
I was afraid he might leak the information.

76
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,040
Ziyuan, I'm here.

77
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,520
Ziyuan, you're here.

78
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,000
Yes.

79
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,480
Come sit here.

80
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,200
What's wrong? You don't want to?

81
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,290
I wouldn't dare.

82
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,640
Come sit here.

83
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,400
I have something to tell you.

84
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,920
Why haven't you been coming to see me lately?

85
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,280
I even had to send someone to invite you.

86
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,080
I...

87
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,880
I've wanted to visit you, Princess, for a long time.

88
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,810
But His Majesty assigned me tasks.

89
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,760
I simply couldn't be in two places at once.

90
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,960
I don't believe that.

91
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,760
You must not want to see me.

92
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:34,000
So you made up a lie to deceive me.

93
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,320
I swear.

94
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,480
I would never deceive you, Princess.

95
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,340
It's just that His Majesty gave secret orders. I...

96
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,240
I can't speak of it.

97
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,520
Father will arrange our marriage soon.

98
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,050
What matters could you have

99
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,280
that you can't tell your future wife?

100
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,960
Really? The Emperor has arranged our marriage?

101
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,200
I am my father's only princess.

102
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,320
As long as I make the request,

103
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,760
I can choose my own husband.

104
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,680
Your Highness, I, Qin Ziyuan, swear

105
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,880
to love only you for all eternity,

106
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
even if it means sacrificing my life for you.

107
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,560
Then tell me quickly,

108
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,880
what secret investigation

109
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:28,210
did my father assign to you and the Prince?

110
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,040
One year ago,

111
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,920
the Emperor sent me and Bai Yihan

112
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,780
to secretly protect Cuiyu Manor.

113
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,960
It seems we were waiting for a guest.

114
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,600
Wang.

115
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,400
Yes?

116
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,440
The Emperor has sent us to secretly protect Cuiyu Manor.

117
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,920
From now on, all external communications

118
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,490
will be handled by designated personnel.

119
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,780
Except for orders from me and Qin Ziyuan,

120
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,960
remember that none of you

121
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,040
are allowed to leave the manor without permission.

122
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:17,840
Yes.

123
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,960
I will follow the Prince's orders.

124
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,440
You may leave.

125
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,520
What do you think about this Cuiyu Manor?

126
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,980
What's so special about it

127
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:41,010
that the Emperor specifically assigned us to protect it secretly?

128
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,440
The Emperor has his reasons.

129
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,240
We need not speculate on His Majesty's intentions.
