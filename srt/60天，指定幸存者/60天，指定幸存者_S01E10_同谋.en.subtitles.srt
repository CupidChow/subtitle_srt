1
00:00:53,720 --> 00:01:00,602
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
PLACES AND EVENTS ARE FICTIONAL

2
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:04,814
Excuse me.

3
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:11,029
Sir.

4
00:01:11,112 --> 00:01:13,239
Evacuate immediately with Mr. President.

5
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:15,533
I'll tell you what's going on
when I get there.

6
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:19,537
There's no time to lose, sir.

7
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:21,247
Please hurry.

8
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:23,541
You have to trust me on this, sir.

9
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:34,594
It's me. I can't make it today.

10
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:38,056
-It's me. I can't make it today.
-This stop is the National Assembly.

11
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:39,390
I'm disappointed.

12
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:42,185
I wanted to see you in the dress.

13
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,565
THERE WILL BE A SPEECH
AT THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY

14
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:53,822
Stay quiet, okay?

15
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:56,699
A civil servant must follow
public etiquette rules.

16
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:02,122
What the hell!

17
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:13,925
What's going on?

18
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:32,861
God damn it.

19
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,241
If he was alive all this time,

20
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:23,536
why didn't he show himself to you?

21
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,289
I mean, his belongings were found
at the scene.

22
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:27,624
You're the one who told me that.

23
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:30,251
You said Agent Kim Jun-o's phone
was found at the scene.

24
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:34,672
I thought they'd stop

25
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:37,884
trying to track me down
if my phone and other belongings

26
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:40,053
were found at the scene

27
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:43,681
because they'd assume I'm dead.

28
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:47,936
So you've been pretending to be dead

29
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:51,940
this whole time just to report this to me?

30
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:54,567
This time,

31
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:56,486
I had to fulfill my duty,

32
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:59,239
which I had failed to do in the past.

33
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:08,456
I didn't realize it back then,

34
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,710
but he tried to send me a signal

35
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:14,087
from somewhere nearby.

36
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:18,132
Don't you want to find out
how Assemblyman Oh Yeong-seok

37
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:19,342
survived?

38
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:24,764
Find Room 119 in the blueprint

39
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,307
of the National Assembly Building.

40
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:28,810
Then you'll find out how Assemblyman Oh

41
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:30,728
managed to survive.

42
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:44,158
You think Agent Kim
was the man who called?

43
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:45,702
How can you be so sure?

44
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:47,495
Because he...

45
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:50,832
Because Agent Kim knew.

46
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:52,250
Knew what?

47
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:05,763
He knew about the explosion
at the National Assembly Building

48
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,641
beforehand.

49
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:16,190
This is a video simulation
of the explosion at the National Assembly.

50
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,820
It was made a year ago, sir.

51
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:27,827
Who created this file?

52
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:30,705
President Yang Jin-man, sir.

53
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:38,212
The whistle-blower sent an e-mail
to all the media outlets just now.

54
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:41,424
Is this the details of the scandal?
Is it related to his family?

55
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,134
Let me see.

56
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:46,387
The whistle-blower
has decided not to disclose it.

57
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:50,099
The e-mail states that he's decided

58
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:52,769
to respect Mr. President's leadership
for national stability's sake.

59
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:55,480
It just looks like a courtesy e-mail
to put an end to this fiasco.

60
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,607
Can we really trust this e-mail though?

61
00:05:57,815 --> 00:06:00,026
What's with this sudden change
of attitude? I'm confused.

62
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:01,069
You see,

63
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:04,822
it makes sense if exposing the scandal
wasn't their goal in the first place.

64
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:06,532
If they were after something else,
that is.

65
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,495
A year ago,

66
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,748
when the discussion with North Korea
regarding the peace treaty began,

67
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:15,083
President Yang told us

68
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:18,669
to be prepared for any attacks
and provocations that might occur.

69
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,676
Is that why this was created?

70
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:28,137
As a preventative measure
for national security?

71
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,264
It was a top secret project

72
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:32,225
spearheaded by a special committee
under the NSC.

73
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:35,144
I was stationed
at the Blue House at the time,

74
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:38,523
so I took part in encrypting
the video file. Then,

75
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:42,193
when I returned to the NIS

76
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:44,278
in February,
I received a report from HUMINT.

77
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:48,157
They informed me about a company that
had illegally obtained Semtex explosives.

78
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:51,410
And my investigation

79
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,412
revealed that the company

80
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:55,623
was the communications
network services firm

81
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:57,708
that installed the cables
at the Assembly building.

82
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,628
A network cabling company

83
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,256
bought Semtex explosives?

84
00:07:04,423 --> 00:07:06,134
I could tell

85
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:09,971
that someone was planning to bomb
the National Assembly Building,

86
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:14,600
using the exact same method
demonstrated in this video simulation.

87
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:20,690
But if you knew about it
in advance, why...

88
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:24,193
My report with a warning
regarding a possible attack

89
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:26,529
was systematically buried

90
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:28,739
in the NIS as well as in the Blue House.

91
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,369
Then,

92
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:37,540
are you saying the person
who handed this top secret file

93
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:40,334
over to those who orchestrated the attack

94
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:44,297
was someone
inside the Yang administration?

95
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:48,342
The members of the NSC
who participated in this project

96
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:51,053
were President Yang, the Minister
of National Defense at the time,

97
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:53,014
the Director of the NIS,

98
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:56,142
and the Commander of the DSSC.

99
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:00,771
But all of them

100
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:04,525
lost their lives due to the explosion.

101
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:06,819
No. One of them

102
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:09,989
is alive.

103
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:17,163
Who is

104
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:18,956
that person?

105
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:22,418
The commander of the DSSC at the time,

106
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,797
General Lee Gwan-muk.

107
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:35,973
LEE GWAN-MUK
BORN IN 1961 IN SEOUL

108
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:49,654
2017-2018, COMMANDER OF THE DSSC

109
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:59,622
DAY 40: ACCOMPLICE
EPISODE 10

110
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:12,593
I heard

111
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:14,887
that the whistle-blower

112
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:17,473
decided not to expose any details
regarding the scandal.

113
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:20,643
Thankfully,
it ended up being a mere happening.

114
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:23,396
Right, it did.

115
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:29,068
If we couldn't stop Ms. Woo
from running her story,

116
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:30,778
I bet every media outlet

117
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:33,823
would be launching a fierce tirade
against Mr. President now.

118
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:36,075
We owe it all to you, Mr. Cha.

119
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:43,374
Thank you.

120
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:50,298
I did exactly what you wanted me to do.

121
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:53,426
So are you going to compliment me or what?

122
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,429
-No, I'm--
-Then what?

123
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:59,265
I'm the Chief Presidential Secretary.

124
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:02,143
Are you evaluating my performance
when you are a mere secretary?

125
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:05,605
Because you're
Mr. President's only confidante?

126
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,695
Do you not know what "Thank you" means?

127
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:14,697
What's the problem?

128
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,408
Do you not understand because
it doesn't have a subject or an object?

129
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:21,329
I'm saying I'm grateful to you
for your help.

130
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:27,460
Thanks for teaching me that even
political affairs are handled by people.

131
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:30,713
And I'm so grateful to have learned that
you're a better person than I thought.

132
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:33,549
It's neither a compliment
nor an evaluation. Okay?

133
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:38,137
Why are you grateful to have learned
that I'm actually a good person?

134
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:42,016
I mean,

135
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:45,519
if it's not a compliment

136
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:48,981
or an evaluation...

137
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:50,733
Then is it...

138
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:54,195
Well...

139
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,198
Are you confessing your feelings for me?

140
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:00,493
Right now?

141
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,164
Right here?

142
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:13,673
That pub near Gwanghwamun
will probably be open tomorrow.

143
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:20,638
Answer wisely.
There won't be a third time.

144
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:36,153
How about today?

145
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:39,698
You'd better

146
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:41,367
answer wisely,

147
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,661
before I change my mind.

148
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:45,204
Of course I'm available

149
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:47,206
today.

150
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,251
I don't want you to change your mind.

151
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,464
Isn't it great?

152
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,925
Oh, there you are.

153
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:05,474
A regular size frappuccino minus
the whipped cream. Right?

154
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,854
I'll let Mr. Han know
that everything's been sorted out

155
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:11,480
with regard to the whistle-blower.

156
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,858
-Okay.
-Take this...

157
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:17,153
That's...

158
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:24,827
If I say

159
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:29,331
that I feel as if I lost

160
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,000
before I could even enter the stadium,

161
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,043
I'm probably being too sensitive, right?

162
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:38,883
No, I'd say you have good instincts.

163
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:42,887
What?

164
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:44,263
What?

165
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:06,285
Did you say you're a stickler for rules?

166
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:10,122
I'll never divulge any information
that became known to me while on duty.

167
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:13,209
You don't need to be concerned, sir.

168
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:15,669
About Agent Kim Jun-o...

169
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:18,631
We should protect him
at the safe house for the time being.

170
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:21,634
Until we verify the tip-off

171
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:25,221
and confirm the identity of
the accomplice inside the BH.

172
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:28,474
I'll dispatch security agents
that we can trust.

173
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:49,453
This is the thallium found during
the search and seizure

174
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:50,746
of Agent Han Na-gyeong's place.

175
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:54,166
It's the same chemical that was used

176
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,709
to poison Myung Hae-joon.

177
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:58,837
Our internal investigation revealed

178
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,757
that Agent Han Na-gyeong
had colluded with Agent Jeong Han-mo

179
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,008
to poison Myung Hae-joon.

180
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:04,593
We're speculating

181
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,220
that she ran away when we found out.

182
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:08,806
But why would an agent
who works for the NIS kill him?

183
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:10,975
Does she have a motive?

184
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:14,311
NAME: HAN NA-GYEONG

185
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:16,939
Her fiance died in the bombing.

186
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:19,775
I believe

187
00:14:19,858 --> 00:14:22,319
Myung Hae-joon's unabashed attitude
during the interrogation

188
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,030
led her to make such a rash decision.

189
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:27,324
Sir, the report Agent Han had
about why Assemblyman Oh

190
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:28,909
should be disqualified as a nominee...

191
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:31,412
Do you think we can still trust it
given the situation?

192
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:34,832
We're dealing with Assemblywoman Yun,
the leader of the opposition party.

193
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:38,419
I don't see why Agent Han
would want to give a false tip-off.

194
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:41,839
Did they find out anything else

195
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:43,799
during the internal investigation?

196
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:47,887
Do we know what kinds of suspicions
Agent Han had about Assemblyman Oh?

197
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,347
We transferred all the materials
she was investigating

198
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:52,683
to the State Bureau of Investigation
and reviewed them,

199
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:56,103
but there was nothing on Assemblyman Oh.

200
00:14:57,354 --> 00:14:59,231
And even if we find something,

201
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,108
we can't trust the information, sir.

202
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:06,363
After all, she is no longer an agent.

203
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:09,283
She is nothing
but a suspect in a murder case.

204
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:20,586
The NIS has pinned you as an accomplice
in the murder of Myung Hae-joon.

205
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:23,964
Someone must've planted evidence.

206
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:25,841
I heard people from the SBI

207
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:27,843
found thallium at your place.

208
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:35,976
So they dug a hole to trap Han-mo

209
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:38,979
and planted evidence to get me as well?

210
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:40,397
Now, we know for sure

211
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:42,775
that the person
who colluded with the bombers

212
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:43,943
is someone inside the NIS.

213
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:46,111
Do you think the NIS is the only one
with a mole?

214
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:49,031
Then...

215
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,203
Now, I understand

216
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:58,791
why Agent Kim had to pretend
to be dead since that day.

217
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,587
Whether it was the NIS
or someone who was higher up,

218
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,715
he couldn't trust anyone.

219
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:11,887
Because of the people
who colluded with the bombers?

220
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,107
What scares me

221
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,567
isn't the fact that I'm being framed.

222
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,529
Over 250 innocent people died

223
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:31,240
in the middle of the capital
of this country,

224
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:33,283
and yet we still don't know

225
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:35,661
who did such a horrifying thing
for what reason.

226
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:39,289
We can't even gauge the scope of it yet.

227
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,835
The North Korean defector, Myung Hae-joon,

228
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:45,295
insisted that he planned
and executed the attack,

229
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:47,006
but he was just a puppet.

230
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:51,176
The bombers made Oh Yeong-seok
a national hero,

231
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,761
and unless something major comes up,

232
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:56,432
he'll be appointed Minister of National
Defense and become a core Cabinet member.

233
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:57,641
Then what?

234
00:16:58,475 --> 00:17:00,269
What do you think they want?

235
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,194
Can you even imagine?

236
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:12,114
Let's proceed with that.

237
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:13,449
Understood, sir.

238
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:16,410
Well, the investiture
for the new ministers,

239
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:19,580
which we've been putting off,
needs to be held, sir.

240
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:24,960
We're announcing the nonparty cabinet
for the presidential election.

241
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,379
Assemblywoman Yun announced
that she's running for President,

242
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:31,216
and Mayor Kang will also announce soon
that he's joining the race.

243
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,803
Postponing it further
will stall things politically

244
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:36,847
and administratively.

245
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,642
We don't have a reason
or even an excuse to put it off further.

246
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,811
As for the suspicions
about Assemblyman Oh,

247
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:45,147
it's been confirmed
that they have no credibility.

248
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:50,527
Assemblyman Oh's survival
was planned from the get-go.

249
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:56,241
Are you saying
he has a connection with the bombers?

250
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:59,953
Everyone who tried to uncover the truth
has either fallen into a trap

251
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:02,581
or is in a dangerous situation.

252
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:07,002
That is why I had no choice but to
speak to you directly like this, sir.

253
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:10,756
No matter who it is,

254
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:14,593
you can't trust anyone, sir.

255
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:19,681
And that being said,
how about we hold the investiture

256
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:22,184
at the National Assembly Building
instead of the Blue House?

257
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,481
Are you suggesting
that we hold the investiture

258
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:29,191
at the National Assembly Building
tomorrow?

259
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:30,192
Yes, sir.

260
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,278
We can promote it actively
through our social media accounts.

261
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:36,740
It should be open to the public
so that the people can attend it as well.

262
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:38,700
We'll remove the barricades
and show the people

263
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:41,703
that we're working on restoring
the building after the tragic incident.

264
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,038
I think it's a great idea.

265
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,836
Inviting the public to the investiture

266
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:52,923
will send a message that
they're part of this administration too.

267
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:55,551
We can also check
their reaction in real-time.

268
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:59,138
Sounds good to me too.
I was worried about their interest

269
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:01,765
since the investiture
was already postponed.

270
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:04,434
We'll send a message of hope
saying that the nonparty cabinet

271
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:06,228
is the start of something new.

272
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:07,688
It's not bad

273
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:11,567
although it'll be a nightmare
in terms of security.

274
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:15,028
Mr. President?

275
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:32,421
Let's

276
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:34,673
do that.

277
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,860
We have 40 days

278
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,530
until the election day.

279
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:03,994
Government officials
who will announce their candidacy

280
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:07,998
must resign from their current posts
30 days before the election.

281
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:10,042
That's in 10 days.

282
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:19,468
When will I be able
to hear your answer, sir?

283
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,517
Sir.

284
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,900
Mr. Cha,
we'll continue this some other time.

285
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:37,152
Yes, sir.

286
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,021
Agent Kim Jun-o was telling the truth.

287
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:16,358
Last April, when President Yang
began talking to the North,

288
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:18,318
he formed a Special Committee of the NSC
to draft

289
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:21,446
a threat assessment regarding possible
attacks that could target the Blue House,

290
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:24,032
the National Assembly Building,
and nuclear power plants.

291
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:25,492
The accomplice

292
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:28,870
might not be
a high official of the government.

293
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:32,416
Can anyone who worked on the draft,

294
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:35,877
including those who helped design
and build the models, access it too?

295
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:40,382
Those involved
in the NAB's cable maintenance

296
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:41,633
have been found dead

297
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:44,636
either from an accident or an illness.

298
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:49,224
Out of those who were aware of this file,

299
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:50,642
only one

300
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:52,477
still stands.

301
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:13,999
What is this about, President Park?

302
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:17,044
Has North Korea finally provoked us?

303
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:23,842
Why am I alone here though?

304
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:28,263
I thought we were in a crisis
since you called in

305
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:30,932
the elderly general you personally fired.

306
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:36,104
General Lee,
there's something I must verify.

307
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:56,833
Is this a recreation
of the National Assembly Building bombing?

308
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,752
What is it that you need to verify?

309
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:03,799
I'm sure you know what this is all about.

310
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:06,676
It's a simulation of an attack

311
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:09,554
that was drafted by
the Special Committee of the NSC.

312
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:11,681
Operation code

313
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:16,019
OP 5015-18, a top secret file
regarding national security.

314
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:24,361
And right at this moment,
weeks after the attack,

315
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:29,324
you are

316
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,078
the only one alive
who knows about this file.

317
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:35,247
No, you're wrong.

318
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:40,252
I'm also the only one
who hasn't actually seen this file.

319
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:44,089
I wasn't given the clearance.

320
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:47,801
The day the file was finalized,

321
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:50,470
the Minister of National Defense

322
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:55,976
revoked my security clearance.

323
00:23:57,644 --> 00:23:58,562
Is this really true?

324
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:03,900
I wanted to ask him that myself.

325
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:08,029
Revoking the security clearance
of the Commander

326
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:09,865
of the Defense Security Support Command?

327
00:24:10,448 --> 00:24:12,701
I'm pretty sure that's unprecedented.

328
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:15,120
It's why I still remember it clearly.

329
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:19,916
OP 5015-18.

330
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:22,544
If it had never been done before,

331
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:26,131
why did the minister do such a thing?

332
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,468
I hate to speak ill of the deceased,

333
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:36,016
but I highly doubt that a soldier
who's been working in an office for long

334
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:37,726
had the conviction

335
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,478
or the authority

336
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:43,356
to do so.

337
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:47,110
As a former minister, you know very well

338
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:50,655
how powerful the call
from the Blue House is.

339
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:54,034
From what I hear,

340
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,914
the Minister of National Defense
received one.

341
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:05,462
Did the order

342
00:25:06,087 --> 00:25:08,506
to revoke your security clearance

343
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:11,551
come from the Blue House?

344
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:20,810
When it came to our views
on the North and national security,

345
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:22,896
I was always the odd one out.

346
00:25:26,274 --> 00:25:27,400
Are you saying that

347
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:31,571
an accomplice of the bomber
who leaked these plans

348
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:34,407
is an inside man?

349
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,623
It's still not too late

350
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:44,417
to reinstate me.

351
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:49,589
Now is the time for the military
and intelligence agencies

352
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:53,760
to work together
so that we can find the mole.

353
00:25:56,471 --> 00:25:59,224
An even more dangerous situation
than a bombing may occur.

354
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:05,522
Will you be able to handle it,
President Park?

355
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,290
Until we verify

356
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:28,378
what you said today,

357
00:26:29,587 --> 00:26:32,173
you will be put under house arrest...

358
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:36,845
for the sake of national security.

359
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:52,277
I'd like the Chunchugwan
to discuss publishing articles

360
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:55,864
that focus on the building reconstruction,
the new cabinet,

361
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:58,325
and the public's response regarding them.

362
00:26:58,408 --> 00:26:59,576
-Sure thing.
-Good.

363
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:01,786
Okay.

364
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:16,217
Oh, I thought you had more orders for me

365
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:18,636
considering how you came here

366
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,598
to this noisy place instead of staying at
the Chief Secretary's Office.

367
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:24,601
The President is calling.

368
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:28,855
I didn't get a call.

369
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:31,858
Maybe it's because of
tomorrow's investiture.

370
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:33,943
I guess I should get going.

371
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:36,196
Well,

372
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:37,781
I...

373
00:27:38,948 --> 00:27:42,077
have a meeting with
the ministerial candidates soon.

374
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:46,498
It's for a run-through of the event.

375
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:51,002
It won't end too late though.

376
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:55,715
My meeting probably won't either.

377
00:27:56,132 --> 00:27:57,258
Right.

378
00:27:59,302 --> 00:28:01,554
Then how about we get some
fried chicken and beer later?

379
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:02,639
-No.
-No.

380
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:07,185
I hate to keep the President waiting.

381
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:10,105
I'm going to be late. Damn.

382
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:19,489
I was only suggesting that we
help out small business owners,

383
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:21,408
but they just won't cooperate.

384
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:29,958
Is it me who they hate
or just the fried chicken and beer?

385
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:47,600
So you're saying that the accomplice

386
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:49,519
who handed over this file to the attackers

387
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:53,231
is in the Blue House, right?

388
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:59,904
Assemblyman Oh
is involved with the bombing,

389
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:02,073
but Agent Han who can prove it
is the prime suspect of

390
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:03,783
Myung Hae-joon's murder.

391
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:06,244
Meanwhile, the investiture

392
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:08,288
is tomorrow.

393
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:12,083
I need your help

394
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:14,502
for we are the only two people

395
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:18,131
who didn't work at the Blue House
at the time of the bombing.

396
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:21,468
What do you need me to do?

397
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:22,761
There was someone

398
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:25,472
who revoked

399
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:27,974
General Lee Gwan-muk's security clearance.

400
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:32,687
We need to find the Blue House personnel

401
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:34,773
who gave the order.

402
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:38,401
I'll check the call history
and report back to you.

403
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:49,204
Mr. President,

404
00:29:50,997 --> 00:29:51,915
is there someone

405
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:54,918
you're particularly suspicious of?

406
00:29:57,003 --> 00:29:58,171
Someone who can control

407
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:01,257
the Minister of National Defense
with a single phone call.

408
00:30:02,258 --> 00:30:04,344
Someone who had free access to

409
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:08,139
top secret files
within the administration.

410
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:10,016
So it's someone

411
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:12,685
close to President Yang.

412
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:19,275
Ministers of Strategy and Finance,
National Defense,

413
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:21,027
and Interior and Safety.

414
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:24,364
Certificates will be presented
in that order.

415
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:29,077
I guess that's everything then.

416
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:31,788
Thank you all for coming,
and I'll see you tomorrow.

417
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:33,373
-Good job.
-You too.

418
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:34,666
Please check your seats.

419
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,918
-Sure thing.
-Right.

420
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:43,466
-Good job.
-Goodness.

421
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:46,511
I guess I must thank President Park.

422
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:48,805
There's really no need, sir.

423
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:52,267
Anyway, I'll see you tomorrow.

424
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,190
Is President Park

425
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:02,110
finally over any suspicions he has of me?

426
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:05,697
The Presidential Secretary
of Civil Affairs has finished vetting you,

427
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:10,827
and Agent Han, who brought up the doubt,
can no longer be trusted.

428
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:15,456
I'll see you tomorrow then.

429
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,541
I heard that...

430
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:22,630
it was you who moved up
the ceremony to tomorrow.

431
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,508
You also suggested that it take place

432
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:28,052
at the reconstruction site.

433
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:34,100
We just did our jobs
in our rightful places,

434
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:36,436
didn't we, Assemblyman Oh?

435
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:45,028
CERTIFICATE OF APPOINTMENT
OH YEONG-SEOK

436
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:57,206
Sir,

437
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:01,336
we found out something
while looking into Agent Kim Jun-o.

438
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:06,090
It's about Agent Han's fiancé
NIS Deputy Director Ji mentioned.

439
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:09,135
I remember.

440
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:12,096
He was a victim of the bombing.

441
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:15,183
Yes, but the fiancé turns out to be

442
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,143
Agent Kim.

443
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:25,485
To the outside world, I'm a dead man.

444
00:32:25,568 --> 00:32:26,653
That day,

445
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,030
I was there during the bombing.

446
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:31,658
Her fiance died in the bombing.

447
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:33,910
I believe

448
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:36,537
Myung Hae-joon's unabashed attitude
during the interrogation

449
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:39,248
led her to make such a rash decision.

450
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:48,925
Before the ceremony,

451
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:52,929
I might be able to find a way to withdraw
Assemblyman Oh's appointment.

452
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:57,725
Contact Agent Kim.

453
00:32:58,267 --> 00:33:00,103
Ask if he knows Agent Han's whereabouts.

454
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:02,146
Yes, sir.

455
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:16,786
SEND

456
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:18,162
EMAIL SUCCESSFULLY SENT

457
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:35,138
How's Agent Han?

458
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:36,806
Oh, right.

459
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:38,975
Not much happened.

460
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:42,770
She didn't leave the house even once.

461
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:47,650
Someone just came by
to read the gas meter though.

462
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:48,943
The gas meter?

463
00:33:50,236 --> 00:33:52,405
Is it a routine inspection
for the whole building?

464
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:55,241
Hold on.

465
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:10,965
It doesn't seem that way.

466
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:13,593
Maybe they had a leakage.

467
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:47,543
Agent Kim snuck past our people
and left the safe house, sir.

468
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:53,216
Why?

469
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:56,761
Where did he go at this late hour?

470
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:59,597
Get out of there.

471
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:02,308
You shouldn't stay, so get out of there!

472
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:04,852
Who is this?

473
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:09,398
Identifying yourself comes first.
Who the hell are you?

474
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:13,986
Jun-o, it's you, isn't it?

475
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:17,740
It's me.

476
00:35:19,158 --> 00:35:20,159
Where are you right now?

477
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:46,727
Everybody, hurry up!

478
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:47,770
What's going on?

479
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:53,359
My goodness!

480
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:11,335
My gosh.

481
00:36:16,215 --> 00:36:19,969
How is this possible? How did you know?

482
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:21,387
How did you know?

483
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:37,630
My goodness.

484
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:54,355
Oh, dear.

485
00:38:08,327 --> 00:38:09,787
Call an ambulance.

486
00:38:18,587 --> 00:38:19,422
No...

487
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:28,306
No...

488
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:31,934
No...

489
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:44,238
No...

490
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,554
Please don't die.

491
00:39:19,398 --> 00:39:20,983
There's been a problem.

492
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:45,257
My parents raise chicken
in the countryside,

493
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:47,051
and field mice keep messing up the coop.

494
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:50,304
I told them to leave out a trap
to catch them,

495
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:51,931
and they caught a badger.

496
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:56,310
This will need some work.

497
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:02,400
What do you think?

498
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:05,361
People say

499
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:07,738
that I...

500
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:10,783
am the biggest beneficiary of the bombing.

501
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,995
That I was a miracle survivor...

502
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:18,290
and will become a minister.

503
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:21,252
The media may believe so.

504
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:23,587
You went from a nonpartisan assemblyman

505
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:26,340
to one of the front-runners
for the presidential candidacy.

506
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:30,010
Isn't President Park

507
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:32,096
the biggest beneficiary?

508
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:36,434
After the bombing,

509
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:41,188
he has gained the greatest power in Korea.

510
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:43,524
After tomorrow's investiture,

511
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:47,278
you will be the biggest beneficiary.

512
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:52,283
The VIP also believes so.

513
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:04,420
Could you tell me which department

514
00:41:04,503 --> 00:41:08,340
called the Ministry of National Defense
around June 20 last year?

515
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:10,885
The Ministry of National Defense

516
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:12,761
is 748 so...

517
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:14,555
Here it is.

518
00:41:20,227 --> 00:41:21,520
This is the list of the calls

519
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:23,814
made to and from the Blue House
on June 20th, last year.

520
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:29,445
Only one call was made
to the Ministry of National Defense

521
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:31,655
from the Blue House that day.

522
00:41:32,698 --> 00:41:33,866
Was it the secretary's office?

523
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:37,453
Sir,

524
00:41:38,704 --> 00:41:40,080
at the time,

525
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:44,335
Secretary Han and Secretary Cha...

526
00:41:45,127 --> 00:41:47,338
had been sharing the same number.

527
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:52,301
Secretary Han and Secretary Cha

528
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:55,679
have been working harder than anyone
since the bombing.

529
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:57,806
How could this be?

530
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,310
Can you believe this, sir?

531
00:42:06,732 --> 00:42:10,069
Secretary Jeong asked
for the call history.

532
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:13,030
Did I make a mistake?

533
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:18,827
What was the date of the call history

534
00:42:18,911 --> 00:42:20,955
she asked for?

535
00:42:21,413 --> 00:42:23,332
It was June 20 of last year.

536
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:25,793
Okay, thank you.

537
00:42:37,471 --> 00:42:39,974
LUNCHEON, MOU SIGNING,
VISIT KOREAN ASSOCIATION, OP 5015-18

538
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:50,192
Hey.

539
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:51,819
Are you done?

540
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:55,698
How much time do you need?
Grab your things. Let's go together.

541
00:42:56,782 --> 00:42:59,994
I don't think we should today.

542
00:43:00,327 --> 00:43:02,162
Do you have work left?

543
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:03,956
Take your time. I'll wait.

544
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:07,418
No, don't wait. You can go. I'm tired.

545
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:12,715
I meant

546
00:43:12,798 --> 00:43:14,258
you'll be tired

547
00:43:14,341 --> 00:43:15,968
with the investiture tomorrow.

548
00:43:19,221 --> 00:43:20,139
I'm sorry.

549
00:43:21,473 --> 00:43:22,558
Do you remember?

550
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:25,644
I told you I won't ask you three times.

551
00:43:27,563 --> 00:43:30,357
You'd better ask me next time to get

552
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:31,775
chicken and beer with you.

553
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:33,777
Okay.

554
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:39,116
I'll see you tomorrow then.

555
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:48,626
Agent Kim...

556
00:43:50,336 --> 00:43:51,378
is dead.

557
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:57,134
According to the security team
that was chasing him,

558
00:43:57,718 --> 00:43:58,802
a car fled the site quickly

559
00:43:59,595 --> 00:44:01,263
after shots were heard.

560
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:06,226
We questioned people

561
00:44:06,685 --> 00:44:09,688
and learned that someone who looks like
Agent Han was there.

562
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:12,483
When our agents arrived,

563
00:44:12,941 --> 00:44:15,110
she was already gone.

564
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:38,217
I'm sorry.

565
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:40,928
I didn't even let you say goodbye.

566
00:44:43,889 --> 00:44:47,267
Agent Kim wouldn't want you
to put yourself in danger.

567
00:44:58,779 --> 00:45:00,072
Are you hungry?

568
00:45:01,323 --> 00:45:02,866
I'll get you a snack.

569
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:10,791
Here, just in case.

570
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:14,336
Call me immediately if something happens.

571
00:45:26,515 --> 00:45:28,725
NEW MAIL

572
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:31,979
INBOX

573
00:45:32,479 --> 00:45:35,065
FROM KIM JUN-O
TO NA-GYEONG

574
00:45:42,781 --> 00:45:45,284
I'm sorry, Na-gyeong.

575
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:50,789
I believe you now understand
why I made such a rash decision

576
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,251
and why I had to stay away from you.

577
00:45:56,295 --> 00:45:57,379
I regretted it every day

578
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:01,341
at the thought that I put you in danger.

579
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:04,678
I have no one else to blame,

580
00:46:05,637 --> 00:46:06,597
but me.

581
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:20,777
What I regret more

582
00:46:21,361 --> 00:46:23,739
is the time when I was your supervisor.

583
00:46:37,961 --> 00:46:39,254
I can't do this anymore.

584
00:46:39,338 --> 00:46:40,839
I'm terrible at this.

585
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:43,258
Agent Han Na-gyeong, number 122937.

586
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:44,176
Yes.

587
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:46,845
Yes?

588
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:51,517
You can do anything from now on

589
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,185
as an agent of the NIS.

590
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:55,812
By any ways or means,

591
00:46:55,896 --> 00:46:58,106
beyond the limits of the law and system,

592
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:00,776
you can do anything necessary
for this country.

593
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:04,029
However,

594
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,907
there is one thing you can't

595
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:08,534
and shouldn't do.

596
00:47:09,576 --> 00:47:10,536
It's...

597
00:47:12,287 --> 00:47:13,455
to say "I can't."

598
00:47:53,912 --> 00:47:55,122
Again.

599
00:48:15,517 --> 00:48:17,686
It goes for all agents, right?

600
00:48:19,479 --> 00:48:21,898
The one thing NIS can't say.

601
00:48:22,774 --> 00:48:24,026
"I can't."

602
00:48:25,819 --> 00:48:28,405
Then the same must go for you.

603
00:48:29,364 --> 00:48:30,532
Of course.

604
00:48:32,367 --> 00:48:33,535
Will you marry me?

605
00:48:46,923 --> 00:48:48,759
Forget everything I said.

606
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:01,229
I can't watch you
get in danger any longer.

607
00:49:04,983 --> 00:49:07,444
I'll do everything from now on,

608
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:10,280
from catching the bomber

609
00:49:10,572 --> 00:49:12,574
to finding the accomplice within us.

610
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:16,536
All you have to do is rest

611
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:18,413
and wait for me.

612
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:25,462
Na-gyeong,

613
00:49:26,546 --> 00:49:27,798
let's...

614
00:49:28,548 --> 00:49:29,800
do our best

615
00:49:30,926 --> 00:49:32,052
to be happy.

616
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:30,485
Have you contacted Agent Kim's family?

617
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:32,446
Legally,

618
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:34,990
his death has already been registered.

619
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:38,910
Agent Kim has made a great sacrifice

620
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:41,037
to fulfill his responsibility.

621
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:45,000
However,

622
00:50:46,793 --> 00:50:49,129
I can't even send the family

623
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,840
my condolences or flowers.

624
00:50:56,845 --> 00:50:57,929
Oh, right.

625
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:00,474
I should have said this sooner.

626
00:51:01,641 --> 00:51:03,393
You've risked your life

627
00:51:03,477 --> 00:51:05,103
to carry out your responsibility.

628
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:07,063
Thank you for that.

629
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:14,863
Dedication

630
00:51:15,614 --> 00:51:17,282
isn't an agent's virtue.

631
00:51:19,117 --> 00:51:21,119
It's our duty, sir.

632
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:35,509
Could you find a way...

633
00:51:37,636 --> 00:51:39,346
for his funeral to be held

634
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:41,223
as formally as possible?

635
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:43,141
Yes, sir.

636
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:05,038
Do you

637
00:52:05,372 --> 00:52:06,790
always go home this late?

638
00:52:06,873 --> 00:52:09,251
What brings you here this late?

639
00:52:09,334 --> 00:52:11,294
You're getting off work late,

640
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:13,880
but I'll have to bother you.

641
00:52:21,012 --> 00:52:22,430
I regret it.

642
00:52:26,434 --> 00:52:29,437
I should have had the investiture
at the Blue House.

643
00:52:30,856 --> 00:52:33,400
I heard everything is ready at the venue.

644
00:52:34,651 --> 00:52:37,153
What seems to be the problem?

645
00:52:40,198 --> 00:52:43,577
The person behind the bombing
is still in the dark.

646
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:46,037
And we haven't even started

647
00:52:46,371 --> 00:52:49,249
looking into
why this bombing even happened.

648
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:52,127
The attack...

649
00:52:53,211 --> 00:52:55,297
is still going on,

650
00:52:56,298 --> 00:52:58,300
but I'll stand there tomorrow

651
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:01,428
saying that it's a reconstruction site

652
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:03,138
with a smile on my face.

653
00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:08,059
The rabbit left its liver behind

654
00:53:08,393 --> 00:53:10,687
when it visited the underwater kingdom.

655
00:53:11,313 --> 00:53:13,732
Do you know what politicians leave behind

656
00:53:14,357 --> 00:53:16,818
when they go to Yeouido?

657
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:19,654
Shame.

658
00:53:20,989 --> 00:53:22,198
Sir,

659
00:53:23,658 --> 00:53:25,243
you're far...

660
00:53:25,785 --> 00:53:26,912
from being a politician.

661
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:31,082
Who do you think the mastermind
behind the bombing is?

662
00:53:33,084 --> 00:53:35,045
Why did he plan the bombing?

663
00:53:35,128 --> 00:53:36,254
What was it for?

664
00:53:37,255 --> 00:53:38,840
Can you imagine

665
00:53:39,215 --> 00:53:40,342
how someone could plan this?

666
00:53:40,926 --> 00:53:42,928
Is something wrong, sir?

667
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:46,056
Someone commits these attacks,

668
00:53:46,806 --> 00:53:48,558
and others sacrifice themselves

669
00:53:48,642 --> 00:53:50,310
to stop the attacks.

670
00:53:52,312 --> 00:53:53,772
What does Korea...

671
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:56,107
mean to them?

672
00:53:58,443 --> 00:54:00,362
Do they even think of it
as the same country?

673
00:54:04,032 --> 00:54:06,117
What kind of country is Korea...

674
00:54:07,369 --> 00:54:08,787
to you, Secretary Han?

675
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:15,377
I believe you are obligated

676
00:54:16,044 --> 00:54:19,089
to answer that question, not me.

677
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:23,426
The person with the most power
and biggest say

678
00:54:23,635 --> 00:54:24,928
in this nation...

679
00:54:26,513 --> 00:54:27,430
is you, sir.

680
00:54:30,392 --> 00:54:31,685
What does Korea...

681
00:54:32,852 --> 00:54:34,562
mean to you, sir?

682
00:55:12,183 --> 00:55:14,102
I told you to get some sleep.

683
00:55:15,854 --> 00:55:17,480
You really won't listen, will you?

684
00:55:18,398 --> 00:55:20,567
You haven't slept all night.

685
00:55:21,317 --> 00:55:22,819
Do you know how long you've been awake?

686
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:26,114
Na-gyeong.

687
00:55:27,115 --> 00:55:28,199
I found him, Ji-won.

688
00:55:30,118 --> 00:55:31,661
The murderer from yesterday.

689
00:55:33,496 --> 00:55:34,456
I found him.

690
00:55:39,919 --> 00:55:42,922
This is the security footage I got
from the building's security office.

691
00:55:43,923 --> 00:55:45,675
The man that came to check the gas...

692
00:55:47,969 --> 00:55:50,513
He was disguised as a police officer

693
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:52,974
at the scene of the accident
on the day of the hearing.

694
00:55:54,267 --> 00:55:55,310
They are the same person.

695
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:57,520
He must be working with Tae-ik.

696
00:55:58,188 --> 00:55:59,314
Kim Jun-o's murderer...

697
00:56:06,112 --> 00:56:07,614
We can catch him

698
00:56:07,697 --> 00:56:09,074
if we find Tae-ik.

699
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:11,826
If I find out who Tae-ik is,

700
00:56:13,078 --> 00:56:14,996
I can catch him myself.

701
00:56:15,497 --> 00:56:16,748
Right, Ji-won?

702
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:23,254
I didn't say anything wrong.

703
00:56:23,338 --> 00:56:26,341
You saw them yesterday.
They're capable of anything.

704
00:56:26,925 --> 00:56:28,384
The two of us aren't enough.

705
00:56:28,676 --> 00:56:31,387
We need to ask the NIS for help
or call the police.

706
00:56:31,471 --> 00:56:34,474
Ask the NIS for help
when they framed me as a killer?

707
00:56:34,724 --> 00:56:37,143
And what are we supposed
to tell the police?

708
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:39,896
He's already reported as dead.

709
00:56:39,979 --> 00:56:42,774
There could be people
that can help us at the agency.

710
00:56:42,857 --> 00:56:45,485
Even you are getting tired of me, Ji-won.

711
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:47,403
Who can I trust?

712
00:56:50,365 --> 00:56:52,700
I'm worried you'll get hurt!

713
00:56:52,784 --> 00:56:54,953
He died in front of my eyes.

714
00:56:55,703 --> 00:56:56,913
Because of me.

715
00:56:58,748 --> 00:57:01,084
Do you think this could get
any worse for me?

716
00:57:01,167 --> 00:57:02,043
No!

717
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:06,256
Agent Kim didn't die because of you.

718
00:57:07,382 --> 00:57:09,884
He died because we're digging up
the truth about the bombing.

719
00:57:14,889 --> 00:57:16,558
Yes, that's right.

720
00:57:17,142 --> 00:57:18,685
So whether it's Tae-ik or someone else,

721
00:57:19,185 --> 00:57:20,895
I'm going to find him.

722
00:57:21,896 --> 00:57:23,064
I'll...

723
00:57:23,648 --> 00:57:26,985
catch the bombers myself
and take them to court.

724
00:57:28,945 --> 00:57:32,031
I want to see for myself
that the country he devoted himself to

725
00:57:33,825 --> 00:57:37,328
isn't that corrupt yet.
I want to show people that.

726
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:41,833
Then his death won't be in vain.

727
00:57:58,641 --> 00:57:59,934
Show me too.

728
00:58:01,978 --> 00:58:04,481
Let's find out if this country...

729
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:07,484
isn't that corrupt.

730
00:58:13,114 --> 00:58:14,115
Get in.

731
00:58:31,841 --> 00:58:34,344
-Hello?
-Please help me.

732
00:58:34,427 --> 00:58:36,346
Please help Jae-min.

733
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:38,640
Please save him.

734
00:58:38,932 --> 00:58:40,266
Is this Jae-min's mother?

735
00:58:49,943 --> 00:58:51,778
They promised they would send Jae-min back

736
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:54,864
if Han-mo turns himself in.

737
00:59:08,169 --> 00:59:09,170
Excuse me, sir.

738
00:59:12,882 --> 00:59:13,925
Please let me...

739
00:59:15,969 --> 00:59:18,054
call my family just once.

740
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:22,767
I just want to check if my son is well.

741
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:24,769
I'm worried.

742
00:59:29,023 --> 00:59:29,899
But...

743
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:35,196
they still haven't sent my boy back.

744
00:59:36,072 --> 00:59:37,782
What should I do?
I'm worried about Jae-min.

745
00:59:38,366 --> 00:59:41,744
When was the last time
you heard from Jae-min?

746
00:59:45,081 --> 00:59:46,291
Two days ago.

747
00:59:48,793 --> 00:59:50,795
They sent me a video of him.

748
00:59:52,213 --> 00:59:53,464
They said he was doing well.

749
00:59:55,508 --> 00:59:58,177
I like ice cream.

750
00:59:58,261 --> 00:59:59,721
Can I have one more?

751
01:00:01,014 --> 01:00:03,266
-He seems to be fine.
-It's a train!

752
01:00:06,227 --> 01:00:07,061
Wait.

753
01:00:07,562 --> 01:00:09,606
What is it? Did you find something?

754
01:00:21,618 --> 01:00:22,452
It's Tae-ik.

755
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:29,250
Phone calls in the Blue House?

756
01:00:30,501 --> 01:00:31,836
Why are you suddenly asking?

757
01:00:31,919 --> 01:00:35,173
I was just wondering if President Park's
phone calls are also recorded

758
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:37,634
and sent to
the Presidential Secretary for Records

759
01:00:37,717 --> 01:00:38,926
just like the other Presidents.

760
01:00:40,011 --> 01:00:41,012
Of course.

761
01:00:42,972 --> 01:00:47,060
Then what about the phone calls between
the Secretaries and each department?

762
01:00:47,435 --> 01:00:49,437
Are they recorded and kept too?

763
01:00:52,523 --> 01:00:55,151
This is my first time
working in the Blue House, so...

764
01:00:56,402 --> 01:00:59,947
Of course they are recorded and saved,
as they're important for security reasons.

765
01:01:00,865 --> 01:01:03,242
We keep every single one of them

766
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:06,788
including phone calls that you have made,
Ms. Jeong.

767
01:01:10,124 --> 01:01:12,001
What? They were damaged?

768
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:16,422
Yes. When the Blue House got hacked
the other day, the firewall collapsed,

769
01:01:16,506 --> 01:01:18,758
and all the voice files got damaged.

770
01:01:20,968 --> 01:01:22,220
Can't we restore them?

771
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:24,514
The data processing team will work on it,

772
01:01:24,597 --> 01:01:25,682
but it will take some time.

773
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:32,939
Please help me. This is really important.

774
01:01:33,314 --> 01:01:35,066
The faster, the better.

775
01:01:35,483 --> 01:01:37,402
When they're restored, I'll contact you.

776
01:01:44,242 --> 01:01:46,160
What brings you
to the Data Processing Office?

777
01:01:48,579 --> 01:01:49,872
Secretary Jeong.

778
01:01:50,957 --> 01:01:52,041
It's nothing important.

779
01:01:54,335 --> 01:01:55,545
Within this Blue House,

780
01:01:56,170 --> 01:01:59,006
there is something going on that I,
the Chief Secretary, don't know about.

781
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:02,301
The Private Secretary even refuses
to report that fact.

782
01:02:04,011 --> 01:02:06,514
Do you think anything can be
more serious than this?

783
01:02:08,683 --> 01:02:11,978
Has President Park privately
assigned you a task?

784
01:02:19,485 --> 01:02:20,903
We'll talk about this

785
01:02:21,487 --> 01:02:23,281
after the ceremony.

786
01:02:23,364 --> 01:02:25,241
We can't just let it slide.

787
01:02:28,995 --> 01:02:30,663
Secretary Jeong.

788
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:33,875
You're making a mistake right now.

789
01:02:35,168 --> 01:02:36,377
Both as an employee...

790
01:02:39,255 --> 01:02:40,590
and as a human.

791
01:02:57,231 --> 01:02:58,941
I like ice cream.

792
01:02:59,025 --> 01:03:01,402
-The ice cream shop he's in...
-Can I have one more?

793
01:03:03,613 --> 01:03:04,864
is right here.

794
01:03:07,158 --> 01:03:08,993
It's a train!

795
01:03:09,744 --> 01:03:11,913
And the intersection
with the train tracks...

796
01:03:12,413 --> 01:03:14,540
It's over there. Do you see it?

797
01:03:18,169 --> 01:03:19,086
YONGSHIN MILL

798
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:21,672
There aren't many mills
that are next to a railroad track in 2019,

799
01:03:21,756 --> 01:03:23,299
so it wasn't hard to find it.

800
01:03:24,342 --> 01:03:26,344
This is the place, right?

801
01:03:26,844 --> 01:03:30,431
YONGSHIN MILL

802
01:03:32,225 --> 01:03:33,601
YONGSHIN MILL

803
01:03:37,104 --> 01:03:38,314
Na-gyeong...

804
01:04:05,466 --> 01:04:06,676
Damn it.

805
01:04:06,926 --> 01:04:09,554
Seriously? Stop crying.
You are pissing me off.

806
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:11,973
Hey.

807
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:31,826
Have you seen this boy?

808
01:04:32,410 --> 01:04:35,121
I'm not sure.
Lots of kids come into our store.

809
01:06:33,906 --> 01:06:37,493
I had hoped we could find a lead
on the accomplice before the investiture.

810
01:06:38,953 --> 01:06:41,664
Will it be okay if Assemblyman Oh
becomes Minister of National Defense?

811
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:46,085
The security level
of all the confidential information

812
01:06:46,627 --> 01:06:48,421
regarding national security
has been adjusted,

813
01:06:49,255 --> 01:06:51,632
so the Minister of National Defense
can't access it at will.

814
01:06:52,967 --> 01:06:54,510
Please find Agent Han Na-gyeong.

815
01:06:55,469 --> 01:06:57,263
Before NIS or Internal Affairs does.

816
01:06:58,180 --> 01:07:00,850
It's the only way to drag down
Assemblyman Oh.

817
01:07:02,184 --> 01:07:03,477
Yes, sir.

818
01:07:13,487 --> 01:07:15,239
There's nothing much to worry about.

819
01:07:16,449 --> 01:07:18,826
As long as I, the Commander-in-Chief,
stands here,

820
01:07:19,910 --> 01:07:23,122
Assemblyman Oh can't do things
as he likes.

821
01:07:38,012 --> 01:07:41,223
I have never imagined
a day like this would come.

822
01:07:41,807 --> 01:07:42,767
Lieutenant Commander Oh.

823
01:07:43,476 --> 01:07:44,769
I mean,

824
01:07:44,977 --> 01:07:47,813
Minister Oh, you are the honor and pride
of me and my comrades.

825
01:07:48,314 --> 01:07:50,566
Please make the new Korea

826
01:07:51,650 --> 01:07:52,985
that our comrades dreamed of.

827
01:08:08,125 --> 01:08:11,921
The long-awaited Investiture of Ministers
of the nonparty cabinet

828
01:08:12,004 --> 01:08:14,715
is going to take place
at the National Assembly building today.

829
01:08:15,424 --> 01:08:18,594
People expect the nonparty cabinet
established by both parties

830
01:08:18,677 --> 01:08:22,348
to be the cornerstone of
the reconstruction of the administration.

831
01:08:22,431 --> 01:08:24,600
The Department of Civil Affairs
in the Blue House

832
01:08:25,392 --> 01:08:30,106
has confirmed that the doubt on
Assemblyman Oh is not credible.

833
01:08:32,233 --> 01:08:33,109
Interesting.

834
01:08:34,026 --> 01:08:35,319
They're holding the investiture

835
01:08:35,402 --> 01:08:37,780
of cabinet members
right in front of legislation.

836
01:08:39,824 --> 01:08:42,118
A nonparty cabinet established
by both parties.

837
01:08:43,202 --> 01:08:45,955
Do you think President Park
wanted to emphasize this?

838
01:08:48,916 --> 01:08:51,961
I'm sure Secretary Cha was the one
who planned it out.

839
01:08:52,878 --> 01:08:56,715
Just like the site of the attack
is being reconstructed,

840
01:08:59,510 --> 01:09:04,348
he's trying to portray the message that
President Park has the leadership required

841
01:09:05,391 --> 01:09:07,143
to rebuild this nation.

842
01:09:08,227 --> 01:09:09,186
That's correct.

843
01:09:11,814 --> 01:09:13,107
Isn't he pretty much holding

844
01:09:14,567 --> 01:09:16,694
his election campaign beforehand?

845
01:09:44,889 --> 01:09:48,267
INVESTITURE OF KOREA'S MINISTERS

846
01:10:24,929 --> 01:10:28,557
My fellow Koreans, it's nice to meet you.

847
01:10:29,475 --> 01:10:31,727
I am the acting president, Park Mu-jin.

848
01:10:36,732 --> 01:10:37,983
This is a key to a door lock.

849
01:10:38,067 --> 01:10:40,861
Eunsan Building in Yeouido uses this.

850
01:10:41,570 --> 01:10:44,240
It's on the 13th floor. It's Room 1306.

851
01:10:44,323 --> 01:10:48,244
-Do you think it's Tae-ik's hideout?
-Yeouido? Where in Yeouido?

852
01:10:48,911 --> 01:10:50,579
It's near the National Assembly Building.

853
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:53,666
It's about 450m away.

854
01:10:56,961 --> 01:10:58,462
The investiture of ministers is today.

855
01:10:59,630 --> 01:11:01,632
Did they say
it was at the reconstruction site?

856
01:11:03,634 --> 01:11:05,970
Find out where the window of 1306
is facing.

857
01:11:06,053 --> 01:11:08,055
Is it towards the National Assembly
or the Han River?

858
01:11:14,186 --> 01:11:15,771
It faces the National Assembly Building.

859
01:11:21,151 --> 01:11:23,153
A distance of 450m is enough

860
01:11:23,237 --> 01:11:24,071
for a sniper.

861
01:12:57,039 --> 01:12:58,749
EUNSAN BUILDING

862
01:12:59,249 --> 01:13:02,127
INVESTITURE OF KOREA'S MINISTERS

863
01:13:15,724 --> 01:13:17,601
Congratulations.

864
01:13:25,192 --> 01:13:26,276
Jeong Su-jeong speaking.

865
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:27,736
This is the Data Processing Office.

866
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:29,822
We've restored the call logs.

867
01:13:31,323 --> 01:13:33,784
Could you send the file to me right now?

868
01:13:33,867 --> 01:13:35,661
June 20, 2018, the call

869
01:13:35,744 --> 01:13:38,414
between the Chief Secretary Office
and National Defense Office, right?

870
01:13:39,331 --> 01:13:40,499
I just sent it to you.

871
01:13:41,333 --> 01:13:42,668
Thank you.

872
01:14:12,781 --> 01:14:17,327
BLUE HOUSE DATA PROCESSING OFFICE

873
01:14:17,411 --> 01:14:18,996
Are you the Minister of National Defense?

874
01:14:19,621 --> 01:14:21,498
This is Secretary Cha Yeong-jin.

875
01:14:22,666 --> 01:14:26,545
Please revoke Commander Lee Gwan-muk's
security clearance

876
01:14:26,670 --> 01:14:28,964
for the file titled OP 5015-18.

877
01:14:41,018 --> 01:14:42,519
CERTIFICATE OF APPOINTMENT
OH YEONG-SEOK

878
01:14:49,151 --> 01:14:51,695
Please do your best in your position.

879
01:14:52,613 --> 01:14:53,947
I will do my best.

880
01:15:11,173 --> 01:15:13,008
We spotted someone suspicious.

881
01:15:29,274 --> 01:15:30,108
She has a gun!

882
01:15:39,034 --> 01:15:40,661
Shit!

883
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:20,242
