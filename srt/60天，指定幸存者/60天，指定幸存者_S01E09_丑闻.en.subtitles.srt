1
00:00:53,720 --> 00:01:00,727
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
PLACES AND EVENTS ARE FICTIONAL

2
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:07,609
The anonymous whistle-blower has claimed

3
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:09,277
that they also have scandals related

4
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,906
to Acting President Park Mu-jin.

5
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:15,075
They weren't after Yang Jin-man's cabinet.

6
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:16,701
President Park was their target.

7
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:19,370
Sir.

8
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:22,582
Is there anything

9
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:26,377
you can think of?

10
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:30,465
Whether it's related to your work

11
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:32,258
or your private life.

12
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:36,596
If you tell us first, it'll be better.

13
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:38,097
If we make a move first,

14
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:41,810
we can prevent this from blowing up.

15
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:49,567
In addition, the whistle-blower stated
that they will release the scandals

16
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:52,529
related to President Park Mu-jin tomorrow.

17
00:01:58,618 --> 00:01:59,619
Sir.

18
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,334
Will you please tell us?

19
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,098
I'm sorry.

20
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:26,104
At the moment,

21
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:28,481
I can't think of anything.

22
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:31,651
Nothing that may require explanation.

23
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:34,237
There's nothing.

24
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,996
Then those of us in the Secretariat

25
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:45,832
will count on that.

26
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:13,067
Just a moment.

27
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:17,572
Ms. Jeong,
you can't think of anything either?

28
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:21,701
Any speculations?
Is there anything that comes to your mind?

29
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:26,623
Unless you're planning
to sort things out on your own

30
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,542
to save President Park's face
and protect his honor,

31
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:31,711
which would be awfully foolish by the way,

32
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:32,795
you'd better tell me now.

33
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,298
He spent all his time at school.

34
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,926
I don't know what the whistle-blower has,

35
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:41,554
but it won't be like the scandals
caused by the politicians you're used to.

36
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:44,140
I wouldn't even worry
if he were like those politicians.

37
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,517
Do you even know
the kinds of things they do?

38
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,896
Even if their only son
ends up breaking his knees,

39
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:52,815
they'll submit a petition to the MMA
to have them enlisted.

40
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,360
They'll force their injured sons
to serve in the military?

41
00:03:58,279 --> 00:03:59,781
To reduce the chance of being bashed?

42
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:03,243
In Korea, nothing can cause more damage
than avoiding military service.

43
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:05,745
That's what seasoned politicians do.

44
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:07,121
I'm glad

45
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:10,083
-that I didn't grow up in such a family.
-What?

46
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,711
I mean, with political newbies
like President Park,

47
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:15,713
you can never know what will happen

48
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:18,549
no matter how well behaved they seem.

49
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:21,552
Can't you tell?

50
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:24,347
I just want to protect him. That's all.

51
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,140
I'm sure what you want to protect

52
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:29,435
is the approval rating of
the presidential candidate, Park Mu-jin.

53
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:34,190
You haven't given up
on keeping the ruling party in power

54
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,485
or on Mr. President, for that matter.

55
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:49,956
Sir.

56
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:54,544
This is from Article Nine
of the Presidential Security Act.

57
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:57,964
"No public official
of the Security Service

58
00:04:58,047 --> 00:05:00,341
shall divulge confidential information."

59
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:04,470
I'm a man who follows rules.

60
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:07,682
I really wanted you to know that, sir.

61
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:12,562
Thank you.

62
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:14,981
Well, then.

63
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,614
Mr. Kang.

64
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:26,326
Yes, sir.

65
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:36,002
The public is in commotion about

66
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:39,756
how President Park's scandals
will affect this country.

67
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,925
The Blue House
has not released a statement yet...

68
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:51,059
Have we heard anything
from the Secretariat?

69
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:52,310
No, nothing yet.

70
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:55,563
Is there anything
you'd like to tell them, ma'am?

71
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:07,075
Si-wan, you're back early today.

72
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:09,494
Are you hungry?

73
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:11,829
Let me get changed first.

74
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:13,206
Mom.

75
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:18,377
You know something, right?

76
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:28,971
Si-wan, look!

77
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,390
-I--
-Si-jin, let's play in the room.

78
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:32,642
Come on.

79
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:34,936
Do you have anything

80
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:38,981
to say to me?

81
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,993
Is President Park keeping his guard up

82
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:54,038
because he doesn't consider us his people?

83
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,124
Even if that's the case,

84
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,292
he should at least tell you.

85
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:00,419
I mean,
you are the chief presidential secretary.

86
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:03,005
I understand
why he doesn't trust any of us.

87
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,050
It was a Blue House staffer.

88
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:10,429
The whistle-blower must've been one
of Civil Affairs' internal investigators.

89
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:13,683
Please find out who the whistle-blower is
as soon as possible.

90
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:16,185
We must act
before any media coverage is released.

91
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:20,731
Someone who has claimed to know about
President Park's scandal has appeared.

92
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:22,650
-Seriously?
-She'd like to speak with you, sir.

93
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:24,110
-Mr. Cha.
-All right.

94
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,361
Let's go.

95
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:30,575
So what's going on, Ms. Woo?

96
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:41,836
President Park's scandal.

97
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,464
The information that was supposed
to be released tomorrow.

98
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:53,264
CERTIFICATE OF MARRIAGE

99
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:56,350
The thing is,
the whistle-blower's plan won't work

100
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:59,604
because I'll run an exclusive story on it
before he talks.

101
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:03,149
CERTIFICATE OF MARRIAGE

102
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:11,908
This photo.

103
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:14,952
I'm in it too, right?

104
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:16,871
With you.

105
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:20,958
-What?
-The scandal about Dad on the news.

106
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:23,211
Isn't it about me?

107
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:26,339
Not at all, Si-wan.

108
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,091
This photo has

109
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:31,385
nothing to do with you.

110
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:33,429
It's just between adults.

111
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,556
What were you even thinking?

112
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,474
I'm

113
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:38,684
not a kid.

114
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:41,229
Am I

115
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:43,523
really...

116
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:45,358
Dad's biological son?

117
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:52,031
Yes, of course.

118
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:54,659
You let your imagination run wild
and jump to your own conclusions

119
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:56,827
just like your dad does.

120
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:58,162
Who else could your father be?

121
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:01,791
Like father, like son.

122
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,209
Come here.

123
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:07,088
You are

124
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:10,299
our one and only son.

125
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,094
Have I ever lied to you?

126
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,319
Yes.

127
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:31,279
Hello, Mr. Cha.

128
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,573
Sure, I'll meet you there.

129
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:36,951
Sir.

130
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:39,078
-Is this--
-Sir...

131
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:41,998
Shit.

132
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:47,253
This...

133
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:49,213
Is this true?

134
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,511
This is

135
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:58,889
Si-wan's birth certificate, and this shows

136
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:01,559
all the details regarding
the marriage and divorce

137
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:04,145
between Ms. Choe and her ex-husband.

138
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:07,773
According to these documents,

139
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:09,275
Ms. Choe,

140
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:12,194
who was already married,
had Si-wan with you,

141
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:15,406
who was single at the time.

142
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:18,367
Is it true he was born out of wedlock?

143
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,175
Was her reason for divorce...

144
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:35,843
I mean, did her marriage fall apart

145
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:37,219
because of you?

146
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,138
This is ridiculous.

147
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,931
Is this true?

148
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:42,642
Sir.

149
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:11,212
It's...

150
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:16,175
true.

151
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:35,236
DAY 41: SCANDAL
EPISODE 9

152
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,909
Your phone will probably be traced.

153
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:44,161
Oh, one more thing.

154
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:52,962
REGISTER A NEW SHARED VEHICLE

155
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:53,921
SYNC DIGITAL KEY

156
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:04,056
I told you.

157
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:07,810
This car hasn't even been paid off yet,
so please...

158
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:10,980
Be careful this time.

159
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,898
No surprises, please.

160
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:22,783
I won't say "Thank you" anymore.

161
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:25,828
Why not? It doesn't cost you anything.

162
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:30,624
You'll have to keep helping me out
for the time being.

163
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,543
I can't be there for you as your senior.

164
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:35,880
Words alone can't express my gratitude.

165
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:44,138
Right, try to get the security footage
from the scene of the accident.

166
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:47,224
We have to check the face and make sure
it is the one in the composite sketch.

167
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:48,350
Okay, I will.

168
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:51,270
You said you're headed
to Han-mo's place now, right?

169
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:53,022
-Yes.
-Just a second.

170
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:57,943
I just sent you a photo of his family.
You might need it.

171
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:08,245
There's got to be a reason
why he suddenly confessed to killing him.

172
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:23,135
Are you on a hunger strike or what?

173
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,846
Why are you refusing to eat?

174
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:31,769
Turn off the cameras for a few minutes.

175
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,104
Don't record or monitor our conversation.

176
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:35,439
Just for ten minutes.

177
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:48,077
Han-mo.

178
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:52,665
Now, you and I are really
the only ones in this room.

179
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:55,209
Hey, look at me.

180
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:10,683
You know what this is, right?

181
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,017
Thallium.

182
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,311
It was used to poison Myung Hae-joon.

183
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:19,108
The guys from the SBI found this somehow.

184
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:21,277
At Na-gyeong's place.

185
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:25,281
It'll be used as conclusive evidence
to prove that you two did it together.

186
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:28,659
What...

187
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,913
What are you talking about?

188
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:35,833
I did it alone, sir.

189
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:37,209
All by myself.

190
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:38,836
When? And how?

191
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:42,256
Listen, my friend.

192
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:44,508
At the DSSC,
you guys were together the whole time.

193
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:46,176
Even Na-gyeong admitted to that.

194
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,597
Sir, you know fully well how Na-gyeong is.
She is...

195
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,516
Agent Han is not someone

196
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:57,271
who would commit such a crime.

197
00:14:57,354 --> 00:14:58,647
All the circumstantial evidence

198
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,190
and this proof says otherwise.

199
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:04,236
No, this is... Something's gone wrong.
This means...

200
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:06,947
We've fallen prey to someone's scheme.
I'm sure of it, sir.

201
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:08,699
Yes, exactly.

202
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,540
Na-gyeong said the exact same thing.

203
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,793
She said you'd never do such a thing,
and that it must be a trap.

204
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:30,638
If it's true that you guys have fallen
to someone's scheme,

205
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:35,267
I'm the only person that can help
the both of you, you fool.

206
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,021
Don't you know how Na-gyeong is?

207
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:42,566
She'll try to prove your innocence
at all costs, which will only hurt her.

208
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:45,569
Those who entrapped you
won't leave her alone.

209
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:47,655
It's much safer that we protect you guys.

210
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:54,078
Where do you think

211
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:56,121
Na-gyeong is right now?

212
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:57,998
Try to think.

213
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:02,002
No one knows her whereabouts
since the attack better than you do.

214
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:18,310
Think it over

215
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:21,939
and don't hesitate to let me know
if you need my help.

216
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:26,735
I'm...

217
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:28,821
your mentor, you know.

218
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,289
Over there.

219
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:07,169
Where's my kid?

220
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:13,926
That is not what you promised.

221
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:19,598
Please... Please send Jae-min home.

222
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:22,184
He suffers from severe allergies.

223
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:25,354
He might go into respiratory distress

224
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:28,732
if he eats certain kinds of
dairy products or bread.

225
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:32,444
Please, I implore you.

226
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:33,946
I beg you.

227
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:35,697
Please send Jae-min...

228
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:39,993
Hello?

229
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:44,915
Hello?

230
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:06,186
It was because of your son.

231
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:08,605
That's why Han-mo turned himself in.

232
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,875
I'm Agent Han Na-gyeong
from the Terrorism Task Force.

233
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:32,629
Who is the person that kidnapped your son?

234
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:36,800
I'm not sure what you're talking about.

235
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:39,261
I need you to cooperate, ma'am.

236
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:42,222
I would like to help you find your son

237
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:44,308
and prove your husband's innocence.

238
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:47,436
When was your son kidnapped?

239
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,396
-Did you hear from--
-I don't know anything!

240
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:52,316
All I want is

241
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:56,028
for our family to live
a normal life like before.

242
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:07,623
Han Na-gyeong is over there.

243
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:12,419
Han Na-gyeong.

244
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:13,837
Stop there.

245
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:15,357
Ji-won, we need the footage from
security cameras near Han-mo's place.

246
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:18,277
I need to find out
what happened to his son.

247
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:24,283
It's about his son, right?

248
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:26,451
You know something, right?
You were with him.

249
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:28,537
You said you heard
everything about the scandal.

250
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,497
Ask Secretary Cha, not me.

251
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,168
To that devastated man?

252
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:36,420
You're so mean.

253
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:40,215
Think about it. The informer says
they'll release it to the press tomorrow,

254
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:43,510
and Woo Sin-yeong is constantly looking
for her next scoop.

255
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:45,512
So...

256
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:48,849
I don't know.

257
00:21:48,932 --> 00:21:52,311
I'm the one who will be surrounded
by a bunch of reporters.

258
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:54,062
What am I, BTS?

259
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,064
I need to know at least something

260
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:57,607
to be prepared

261
00:21:58,692 --> 00:21:59,943
or die an honorable death.

262
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:01,737
Okay?

263
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:14,958
Good.

264
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:18,879
Mr. Kim.

265
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:22,758
You know, right?

266
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,218
What did Reporter Woo say
about the scandal?

267
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:26,845
Secretary Cha says

268
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:30,599
we need to get the whistle-blower
before it's released to the press.

269
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,185
You know,

270
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:35,979
different matters are
treated by different authorities.

271
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:39,524
If we know what the scandal is about,

272
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:42,110
we can find the whistle-blower
much more quickly.

273
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:45,697
Don't you think?

274
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:53,038
I'm the last person
you want to keep it a secret from.

275
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:57,751
Then make sure you keep it to yourself.

276
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:29,825
I thought you needed to know this.

277
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:34,496
The Secretariat can stop the press, right?

278
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:37,290
Sir?

279
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:39,835
Well...

280
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:42,379
It's not going to be easy.

281
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:44,131
Excuse me?

282
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:46,591
Although President Park doesn't have
any political experience,

283
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:48,969
he became the strongest candidate.
Do you know why?

284
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:50,137
Because...

285
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:53,557
he did a pretty good job at
stabilizing the country after the attack.

286
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,724
Morality.

287
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:58,895
It's what our people
always seek from politicians,

288
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:02,107
but no one could provide.

289
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:03,900
They found it from President Park.

290
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:08,446
He's so upright and honest

291
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:11,116
that he even confessed that
he was dismissed.

292
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:12,742
Besides,

293
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:15,162
he's a new politician.

294
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:20,041
Actually, people are calling him
"Man of good stories" on the internet.

295
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,210
It means there are only good stories
to tell about him.

296
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:28,008
A scandal that is about President Park,
the man of good stories.

297
00:24:28,758 --> 00:24:30,260
The press will have a field day.

298
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:34,097
I guess it's much more fatal to him
than to other politicians.

299
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:37,767
This is why morality is
a double-edged sword to politicians.

300
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:41,271
President Park has raised

301
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:44,024
the people's expectations too high.

302
00:24:48,486 --> 00:24:51,198
So my husband...

303
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:53,283
No, the Acting President...

304
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:59,664
Ms. Kim, how am I supposed to address him

305
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:01,666
in this case?

306
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:04,377
You can call him by any name you like.

307
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:07,339
I see.

308
00:25:08,965 --> 00:25:09,883
So...

309
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:14,679
he admitted everything?

310
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:16,097
Yes.

311
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:19,017
He admitted to everything,
including the fact

312
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,311
that he had an affair with you,
a married woman,

313
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:23,438
had Si-wan out of wedlock,

314
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:26,441
and destroyed a family
by making you divorce your ex-husband.

315
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:34,574
I'm sorry if I upset you.

316
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:41,248
Can I...

317
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,502
see him now?

318
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:52,550
Well.

319
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:56,805
I had no idea you would visit me.

320
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:01,726
-Please have a seat.
-Secretary Kim told me that

321
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:05,981
the Chief Presidential Secretary
protects the Acting President

322
00:26:06,564 --> 00:26:07,691
like...

323
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:11,444
the Secretary of Security
in terms of politics.

324
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:14,447
What brings you here?

325
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:20,161
It's not true.

326
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:25,875
What you know

327
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,794
is not...

328
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:30,255
true.

329
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:41,975
It's not true.

330
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:43,560
SPRING 2006

331
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:47,188
It's hard to say the diseases
that the workers

332
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:49,566
of Naseong Electronics have are
directly related to

333
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:51,776
the chemicals
from the semiconductor factory.

334
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:57,032
Which one are you?

335
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:58,241
Pardon?

336
00:26:58,325 --> 00:27:01,161
Did Naseong Electronics
offer to fund your research?

337
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:03,663
Or did they offer you a job?

338
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:14,591
It's not from me. It's from the data.

339
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:16,760
If you have further questions,
ask them yourself.

340
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:36,863
Please help them.

341
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:39,866
So it can be deemed
as an industrial accident.

342
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:45,080
You can make them talk.

343
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:51,044
Are you telling me
to change the test result

344
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:52,879
and misrepresent the data?

345
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:58,301
Do you even hear yourself? My goodness.

346
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:00,053
You're dangerous.

347
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:06,017
In the end, it's a good cause.

348
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:08,561
A wrongly set experiment is

349
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:10,480
nothing but a failure.

350
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:13,149
The ends don't justify the means to me.

351
00:28:15,318 --> 00:28:17,028
Don't people tell you that you're uptight?

352
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:18,363
Don't people tell you

353
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:20,698
that you're rude?

354
00:28:25,286 --> 00:28:26,496
For the past five years,

355
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,833
there are 100 people who claim
to have gotten lung cancer, renal cancer,

356
00:28:30,291 --> 00:28:32,252
lupus, and leukemia
due to industrial accidents.

357
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:35,588
And 60 of them have

358
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:37,674
already lost their lives.

359
00:28:40,343 --> 00:28:42,178
And yet you say there's no correlation.

360
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:43,847
You want me to believe that?

361
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:49,102
Am I rude?

362
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:52,439
Who's at fault is obvious,

363
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:54,441
but yet you're hiding behind the data.

364
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,526
So, am I the rude one?

365
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:03,366
You don't have to help me.

366
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:05,243
I won't give up.

367
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:40,153
Don't people say you're impatient?

368
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,323
I never told you to give up the trial.

369
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:48,119
Isn't it a win if the people who got sick
was issued a compensation

370
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:50,622
by having it recognized
as an industrial accident?

371
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:54,042
I'd take on the Korea Workers'
Compensation and Welfare Service

372
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:56,544
under the Industrial Accident
Compensation Insurance Act.

373
00:29:58,379 --> 00:30:00,173
Naseong Electronics
made their symptoms worse,

374
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:03,510
but it was the government that didn't
recognize it as an industrial accident.

375
00:30:12,685 --> 00:30:15,563
6 MONTHS LATER

376
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:19,025
Following the Industrial Accident
Compensation Insurance Act,

377
00:30:19,108 --> 00:30:21,528
if the causation of the injury or illness
can be proven

378
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:24,906
not only from a medical
or a biological standpoint,

379
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:28,993
but also from a legal or normative one,

380
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:31,162
it is recognized as
an industrial accident.

381
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:33,832
-My gosh.
-Goodness.

382
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:36,251
-Thank you.
-Thank you so much.

383
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:38,586
-Thank you dearly.
-Thank you.

384
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,130
Thank you so much.

385
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:43,842
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

386
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:45,635
-Thank you.
-Thank you, ma'am.

387
00:30:45,718 --> 00:30:47,929
Thank you, Attorney Choe.

388
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:01,943
What's with the glum face?

389
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:04,821
One might think you lost the case.

390
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,159
You won, Attorney Choe.

391
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:13,037
You worked hard and even won the appeal.

392
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:18,126
Mun Hyo-jeong is suffering
from systemic sclerosis.

393
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:23,047
She hasn't been able to hold her daughter
after giving birth to her.

394
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:28,511
We may have won the trial,

395
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:33,099
but that won't help her
hold her daughter though.

396
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:36,769
So how is that...

397
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,398
a win?

398
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:42,150
Still,

399
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:45,528
I believe it's a win.

400
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:50,658
The fact that they're not alone

401
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:54,370
has been made known to Naseong Electronics
as well as the world.

402
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:59,000
Thank you.

403
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:02,128
I was able to get this far
thanks to your help.

404
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:06,174
I guess I wasn't alone either.

405
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:11,888
Would you like to grab a bite to eat?

406
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:21,564
If it's to celebrate the win, then yes.

407
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,776
I have one condition. It will be my treat.

408
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:30,239
Is the reason important
when it comes to having a meal together?

409
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:33,576
It does to me.

410
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:38,247
Sorry.

411
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:39,999
Excuse me.

412
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:45,421
Hi, son!

413
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:47,924
Si-wan, it's your mom.

414
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:54,430
Yes, I'm on my way home now.

415
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:56,182
Right.

416
00:32:56,766 --> 00:32:57,684
Thank you.

417
00:32:58,518 --> 00:32:59,477
Sure thing.

418
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:04,565
So you have...

419
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:06,985
a son.

420
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:11,489
I didn't know you were married.

421
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:13,950
I'm also divorced.

422
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:18,329
So now you know

423
00:33:19,288 --> 00:33:23,292
why the reason for grabbing that meal
is important to me.

424
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:29,507
Then...

425
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:33,052
how about a date instead of a meal?

426
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:46,441
Let's go on a date.

427
00:34:15,928 --> 00:34:17,138
Mr. President,

428
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:21,309
nor the informant or Ms. Woo
will be able to write the story on you.

429
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:25,813
The Blue House will issue a statement
before any of them.

430
00:34:26,272 --> 00:34:30,276
We'll get ahead of the media about this
and tell the truth.

431
00:34:31,652 --> 00:34:32,695
The truth?

432
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:36,324
The First Lady came by to see me.

433
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:39,410
Why--

434
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:42,872
Why didn't you tell me the truth, sir?

435
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:43,831
Okay,

436
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:45,500
so here's how it is.

437
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:49,253
Si-wan, is in fact,

438
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:52,090
the son you fathered from your heart.

439
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:55,718
The First Lady and Si-wan
wasn't treated fairly by her ex-husband,

440
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:57,720
but they met you.

441
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:00,056
You were unmarried at the time,

442
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:03,142
and despite your family's disapproval
and the society's prejudice,

443
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:04,811
-you loved them--
-Mr. Cha.

444
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:05,937
Sir.

445
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:08,856
Your family history isn't a scandal.

446
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:10,650
It depicts another good deed.

447
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,448
I thought I should tell you.

448
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:21,119
To me, you are like my own

449
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:23,830
Chief Presidential Secretary.

450
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:27,792
After arriving at the Blue House,

451
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:32,964
I was contacted by my ex
for the first time after the divorce.

452
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:36,968
If I didn't solve his financial problems,

453
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:38,219
he threatened

454
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:41,514
to expose Si-wan

455
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,600
as the son I had

456
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:47,728
out of an affair.

457
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,777
What we only need
is Si-wan's DNA test result.

458
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:56,279
That will end any doubts

459
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:58,531
the media spins on you and your family.

460
00:35:59,031 --> 00:36:02,618
You want my son to undergo a DNA test?

461
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:04,287
Your nonbiological relationship

462
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:06,706
will prove that you didn't have an affair.

463
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:09,792
It's the fastest and most certain way
to have this story benefit us.

464
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:12,587
Sir, this is a risk we should gamble on.

465
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:16,090
It'll help improve your approval ratings
which went slightly down recently.

466
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,718
I don't agree with you.

467
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:22,096
I'm sorry, but you can't stop
Ms. Woo or the informant

468
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,807
from revealing your family history
to the public.

469
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:27,226
We only have two options.

470
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:29,187
Let it be a scandal or a good deed.

471
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:31,063
If you won't allow
for the truth to come out,

472
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:34,817
the President of this nation
will be painted

473
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:36,986
as a man
who fathered a child in an affair.

474
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:39,697
Then so be it.

475
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:42,783
I won't use my son

476
00:36:43,826 --> 00:36:46,287
just to show everyone that we aren't

477
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,872
biologically related.

478
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:51,584
Sir, think of the politics
and not just your family.

479
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:53,085
My family history and affairs

480
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:55,463
does not hinder my ability

481
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:58,132
to serve this country as acting President.
Don't you agree?

482
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:02,053
The media and opposing party
will question your morals every second.

483
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:04,680
It'll be easier,
and they'll have a good reason

484
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:06,098
to attack you in that way.

485
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:09,352
How supportive and trusting
do you think the people will be

486
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:11,687
with a president with questionable ethics?

487
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:14,941
So is politically exploiting
an innocent child

488
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:17,443
any more ethical?

489
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:22,615
I...

490
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:27,662
may have made the decision
to accept this position,

491
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:31,874
but my son never had any say in this.
From the beginning.

492
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:42,134
Is your choice final then?

493
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:48,307
Well, Si-wan...

494
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:53,229
has one decent father.

495
00:37:56,857 --> 00:37:58,442
You're right, sir.

496
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:03,155
I'm afraid you will never be

497
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:06,367
a presidential candidate
who has a chance to win.

498
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:11,914
The seat you currently occupy
isn't really reserved for good men.

499
00:38:31,892 --> 00:38:33,728
Did President Park approve?

500
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:37,356
In order to stay ahead of Ms. Woo,

501
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,525
we should issue a statement
later this afternoon.

502
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:40,985
I'll contact the Chunchugwan.

503
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:42,611
There's no need.

504
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:44,196
Sorry?

505
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:46,699
President Park disapproves.

506
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:52,663
And what do you think?

507
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:54,999
I will accept his wishes.

508
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:56,334
Does this mean

509
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:59,378
that you've given up on President Park?

510
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:15,978
This doesn't make sense.

511
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:19,023
Secretary Cha's given up,

512
00:39:19,106 --> 00:39:21,525
and you've decided to wait
for the media to strike first?

513
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:24,236
That's why I'm reporting this to you, sir.

514
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,446
You.

515
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:26,697
Yes?

516
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:28,407
Secretary Jeong.

517
00:39:29,241 --> 00:39:31,619
What the Secretariat of the Blue House
must do right now

518
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,080
isn't just relaying reports.

519
00:39:42,254 --> 00:39:44,256
Where is President Park?

520
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:17,206
Is it your goal to master these books

521
00:40:17,706 --> 00:40:21,544
and fight the press in person?

522
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:24,547
Or are you

523
00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:27,174
avoiding a problem you can't solve

524
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:31,512
by hiding out
at a place you feel comfortable in?

525
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:46,360
We're running out of time.

526
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:48,821
By tomorrow morning,

527
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:52,658
the choice will no longer

528
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:54,743
be ours.

529
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:00,040
Do you know

530
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:04,128
that since the moment I stepped in here,

531
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:07,590
I always had to choose between two options
just like now.

532
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:11,635
It was either one I couldn't accept

533
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:16,348
or one that I'd only accept
over my dead body.

534
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:24,857
Choosing the lesser evil

535
00:41:25,941 --> 00:41:27,026
is politics.

536
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:30,613
I believe

537
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:33,824
that you have made wise choices so far.

538
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:38,954
Why on earth must you
make things harder on yourself?

539
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:42,166
Si-wan.

540
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:44,210
-Si-wan, please.
-Mommy.

541
00:41:44,293 --> 00:41:45,503
She's right there.

542
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:47,296
Why don't you look at me?

543
00:41:47,796 --> 00:41:50,799
-Mommy!
-Si-wan, please.

544
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:53,010
I'll take him.

545
00:41:53,385 --> 00:41:56,639
It's all right, Mommy's here.

546
00:41:56,722 --> 00:41:58,641
I'm so sorry.

547
00:42:01,977 --> 00:42:03,521
Si-wan's behavior...

548
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:06,815
isn't your fault.

549
00:42:07,399 --> 00:42:08,943
It's because of his father.

550
00:42:14,823 --> 00:42:16,200
To him,

551
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:20,246
you're the scariest person

552
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:23,999
just by being an adult male.

553
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:30,548
I...

554
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:33,300
promised myself

555
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:38,138
that I would never

556
00:42:39,515 --> 00:42:41,475
hurt Si-wan again.

557
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:54,655
Yes, Gang-yeon. The nanny just left.

558
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:55,739
Are you on your way home?

559
00:42:56,448 --> 00:42:57,324
I'm sorry.

560
00:42:57,825 --> 00:42:59,994
I'm still not prepped enough
for the trial,

561
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:02,162
so I'll be another 30 minutes.

562
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:03,998
Will you be all right?

563
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:06,250
Don't worry about Si-wan
and take your time.

564
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:19,179
It'll be all right.

565
00:43:19,346 --> 00:43:20,347
Excuse me.

566
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:21,890
I've got you.

567
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:24,560
Doctor!

568
00:43:24,643 --> 00:43:26,312
-What's wrong?
-His eyelid!

569
00:43:26,395 --> 00:43:27,771
-He cut his eyelid.
-That must hurt.

570
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:28,981
Hi, there. May I take a look?

571
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:30,399
Goodness.

572
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:33,110
It's just a little tear.

573
00:43:33,193 --> 00:43:34,528
-Sorry?
-He'll only need

574
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:35,779
-a few stitches.
-Please hurry.

575
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:37,239
Gosh.

576
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:39,408
Can you lie down here?

577
00:43:39,491 --> 00:43:40,951
-Let's lie down.
-Si-wan, come on.

578
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:41,952
There you go.

579
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:44,538
I'm afraid the dad
will just have to hold him.

580
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:45,956
Sorry?

581
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,499
Just hold your son for us.

582
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:55,507
-Okay, let's see. Does it hurt?
-Mommy!

583
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:57,259
Can you let me see?

584
00:43:57,343 --> 00:43:59,470
Gosh, does it hurt that bad?

585
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,055
You're okay.

586
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:02,848
Mommy!

587
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:04,475
It's okay.

588
00:44:25,704 --> 00:44:26,830
Mu-jin?

589
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:29,875
Gang-yeon?

590
00:44:35,422 --> 00:44:36,757
You must've been worried.

591
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:41,929
My gosh.

592
00:45:21,301 --> 00:45:23,429
You said you promised Si-wan

593
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:25,722
that you'd never hurt him again.

594
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:34,857
Will you let me

595
00:45:36,733 --> 00:45:38,360
keep that promise too?

596
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:48,620
I promised her

597
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:52,166
that I'd never hurt him again.

598
00:45:55,043 --> 00:45:56,962
He's at a sensitive age,

599
00:45:57,379 --> 00:45:59,214
and his whole world
has been turned upside down.

600
00:46:01,884 --> 00:46:03,802
Just to be lauded by the public,

601
00:46:03,886 --> 00:46:04,970
must I

602
00:46:05,971 --> 00:46:07,639
push my son into hell?

603
00:46:11,351 --> 00:46:13,145
Is that what politics is?

604
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:22,905
Over here, ma'am!

605
00:46:22,988 --> 00:46:24,072
Here you go.

606
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:25,532
Ma'am, can you look over here?

607
00:46:26,992 --> 00:46:28,952
-There you go.
-Ma'am, one more, please.

608
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:30,746
All right. Please enjoy.

609
00:46:31,413 --> 00:46:32,289
Thank you.

610
00:46:32,372 --> 00:46:34,166
-Do you like sausages?
-Yes.

611
00:46:34,249 --> 00:46:35,834
Enjoy then.

612
00:46:36,376 --> 00:46:37,252
Enjoy.

613
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:42,132
You should eat a lot
so that you can grow taller.

614
00:46:45,177 --> 00:46:46,261
This afternoon,

615
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:49,556
we plan to do a live broadcast

616
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:53,018
on social media and video streaming sites

617
00:46:53,101 --> 00:46:55,103
to officially announce
your presidential candidacy.

618
00:46:55,687 --> 00:46:59,024
Don't be picky with what you eat
and enjoy everything on your plate.

619
00:46:59,107 --> 00:47:00,901
People are predicting

620
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:04,363
that your approval ratings
will exceed President Park's

621
00:47:04,446 --> 00:47:05,864
by tomorrow.

622
00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:07,950
It'll only be a temporary convention bump
due to

623
00:47:08,033 --> 00:47:09,368
my candidacy announcement.

624
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:10,410
But ma'am,

625
00:47:10,869 --> 00:47:13,872
President Park's approval ratings
have gone down for the first time.

626
00:47:14,706 --> 00:47:16,792
The delay in appointing ministers

627
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:19,169
must've hit him hard.

628
00:47:20,879 --> 00:47:22,130
Let's put the nail on the coffin

629
00:47:22,214 --> 00:47:25,717
so that he never even dreams
of running for office.

630
00:47:27,386 --> 00:47:29,304
I heard about his scandal

631
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:32,224
from my source at the Blue House.

632
00:47:36,186 --> 00:47:37,771
You want me

633
00:47:37,854 --> 00:47:40,065
to announce my candidacy
and attack President Park

634
00:47:40,315 --> 00:47:42,568
for adultery,
which is no longer a crime in Korea?

635
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:45,696
For women between the ages of 20 and 40,

636
00:47:45,779 --> 00:47:48,240
this scandal is considered to be huge.

637
00:47:50,075 --> 00:47:53,078
His approval ratings
are the highest in that demographic group.

638
00:47:53,161 --> 00:47:54,413
They are also

639
00:47:54,997 --> 00:47:56,498
your main voters as well.

640
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:03,088
Assemblyman Min, how many times
have you been to your kids' school?

641
00:48:03,672 --> 00:48:05,173
-Sorry?
-Field day,

642
00:48:05,257 --> 00:48:07,134
entrance ceremony, graduation ceremony,

643
00:48:07,259 --> 00:48:08,719
Children's Day events, and others.

644
00:48:09,177 --> 00:48:10,554
I haven't been to any of them.

645
00:48:10,637 --> 00:48:12,931
I had too many of my own events

646
00:48:13,015 --> 00:48:14,141
to attend any of them.

647
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:15,851
That's right.

648
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:18,228
We spent our time
applauding other children

649
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:20,230
that we made our own children lonely.

650
00:48:20,314 --> 00:48:22,190
That has been our policy so far.

651
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:24,276
So why would you

652
00:48:24,818 --> 00:48:26,028
want to make this a country

653
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:29,031
that cares about what goes on
in the privacy of one's own home?

654
00:48:30,115 --> 00:48:33,619
That isn't the Korea
I wish to lead as President.

655
00:48:36,538 --> 00:48:40,334
SEONJIN REPUBLICAN PARTY
WILL LOOK AFTER YOUR CHILDREN

656
00:48:47,883 --> 00:48:49,801
I heard Assemblywoman Yun

657
00:48:49,885 --> 00:48:52,387
is announcing her candidacy
for the presidential election.

658
00:48:54,306 --> 00:48:56,058
She's a strong candidate

659
00:48:56,141 --> 00:48:57,684
with her approval rating and experience.

660
00:48:58,977 --> 00:49:01,229
I guess this means
transfer of political power.

661
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:06,485
You never know.
The most popular presidential candidate

662
00:49:06,943 --> 00:49:08,153
is still President Park.

663
00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:10,364
He won't stand a chance.

664
00:49:11,948 --> 00:49:14,159
He isn't a trained politician,

665
00:49:14,743 --> 00:49:16,203
and like you said,

666
00:49:16,286 --> 00:49:18,330
he is an independent candidate.

667
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:22,417
The soup is salty today.

668
00:49:25,545 --> 00:49:27,589
If Assemblywoman Yun becomes president,

669
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:30,175
she will go for strict
North Korean policies, right?

670
00:49:30,926 --> 00:49:34,304
Then the peace treaty
President Yang Jin-man wanted so bad

671
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:36,098
will go down the drain, right?

672
00:49:41,978 --> 00:49:42,979
Enjoy your lunch.

673
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:50,779
What is with you today, Ms. Jeong?

674
00:49:50,862 --> 00:49:52,239
You won't even let him eat.

675
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:55,200
I'm doing my job as secretary.

676
00:49:55,867 --> 00:49:56,952
What?

677
00:49:57,035 --> 00:49:58,537
I know...

678
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:01,957
what it takes to make Secretary Cha move.

679
00:50:06,878 --> 00:50:09,047
You need to meet Mayor Kang.

680
00:50:09,548 --> 00:50:10,424
Why?

681
00:50:10,966 --> 00:50:15,053
-He's close to Mr. Kim of TBN.
-And?

682
00:50:16,138 --> 00:50:18,724
I think that's where he heard
the scandal about President Park.

683
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:24,187
No, it's not.

684
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:27,315
It really isn't me this time.

685
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:29,025
It doesn't matter.

686
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:32,404
The whole world will know tomorrow.

687
00:50:32,904 --> 00:50:34,406
Are you okay with that?

688
00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:40,245
As Mayor Kang announces
his presidential candidacy,

689
00:50:40,328 --> 00:50:41,872
he plans to start a no-confidence motion

690
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:44,374
against President Park.

691
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:52,340
Welcome, Secretary Cha.

692
00:50:53,091 --> 00:50:56,136
The Blue House and the city hall
are so close yet so far.

693
00:50:56,219 --> 00:50:57,512
It'll become further

694
00:50:57,596 --> 00:50:59,890
if you start your presidential campaign

695
00:50:59,973 --> 00:51:01,683
on President Park's scandal.

696
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:05,854
You know our party supporters
hate domestic squabble.

697
00:51:11,276 --> 00:51:13,278
MAYOR KANG SANG-GU

698
00:51:13,361 --> 00:51:14,696
Mayor for three consecutive times?

699
00:51:15,697 --> 00:51:17,866
I'm merely a politician for this district.

700
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:21,745
I have no choice if I want
to go nationwide,

701
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:25,248
but to attack President Park,
who has the highest approval rating.

702
00:51:27,667 --> 00:51:31,713
Is that why
you are criticizing him on social media

703
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:34,591
for postponing the minister investiture?

704
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,343
"No brains for government,

705
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:38,553
terrorist of administration
President Park."

706
00:51:38,637 --> 00:51:41,473
The malicious comments
get worse as it goes

707
00:51:41,556 --> 00:51:43,517
-as time passes.
-Malicious comments?

708
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:50,315
It's part of my character
to make comments others can't.

709
00:51:50,398 --> 00:51:53,151
It's what made me who I am.

710
00:51:53,735 --> 00:51:57,405
What other content do you have
other than criticizing President Park?

711
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:04,621
Why don't you work with me?

712
00:52:05,455 --> 00:52:07,249
Chief An told me

713
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:10,293
you're the one responsible

714
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:12,754
for President Park's approval rating.

715
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:17,843
When I officially announce
my presidential candidacy,

716
00:52:18,426 --> 00:52:21,096
I'd like to have you by my side.

717
00:52:21,179 --> 00:52:23,598
The successor of President Yang Jin-man.

718
00:52:24,349 --> 00:52:25,600
It will look good.

719
00:52:27,102 --> 00:52:30,021
Did you say your malicious comments
are your content and strategy?

720
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:33,316
Haven't you considered

721
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:35,360
that your malicious comments

722
00:52:36,111 --> 00:52:37,362
only promotes the notion that

723
00:52:38,196 --> 00:52:40,490
politics is loud, ugly,
and focused solely on gaining power?

724
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:43,410
Thus increasing the hatred towards it?

725
00:52:45,412 --> 00:52:47,247
This isn't a winning strategy.

726
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:48,707
It'll pull everyone under.

727
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:58,300
Don't burn your bridges Secretary Cha.

728
00:52:59,759 --> 00:53:02,137
If things don't go your way,

729
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:03,972
you might have to cross it again.

730
00:53:09,102 --> 00:53:11,813
It's only 10 days
until the candidate registrations.

731
00:53:11,897 --> 00:53:14,566
President Park,
who is nothing more than a survivor,

732
00:53:14,649 --> 00:53:17,569
will have his ethics questioned

733
00:53:17,944 --> 00:53:19,654
tomorrow because of the scandal.

734
00:53:21,489 --> 00:53:23,575
You will have no choice...

735
00:53:26,786 --> 00:53:29,331
but to come back to me.

736
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:34,753
-Yun Chan-gyeong.
-Yun Chan-gyeong.

737
00:53:34,836 --> 00:53:37,505
-Yun Chan-gyeong.
-Yun Chan-gyeong.

738
00:53:37,589 --> 00:53:39,758
-Yun Chan-gyeong.
-Yun Chan-gyeong.

739
00:53:39,841 --> 00:53:42,260
-Yun Chan-gyeong.
-Yun Chan-gyeong.

740
00:53:43,595 --> 00:53:46,348
Here, in front of the War Memorial,

741
00:53:46,431 --> 00:53:48,433
I declare my candidacy

742
00:53:48,516 --> 00:53:52,187
for the 21st presidential election
of the Republic of Korea.

743
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:55,023
WOMEN ARE THE FUTURE OF THIS COUNTRY!

744
00:53:55,899 --> 00:54:00,320
-Yun Chan-gyeong.
-Yun Chan-gyeong.

745
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:03,698
We have now realized

746
00:54:03,782 --> 00:54:06,826
after experiencing a horrible tragedy

747
00:54:07,452 --> 00:54:09,871
that peace cannot be bought

748
00:54:09,955 --> 00:54:11,790
through collusion or deals
of political parties.

749
00:54:15,627 --> 00:54:17,212
I never imagined

750
00:54:17,295 --> 00:54:20,548
she'd announce her candidacy
at The War Memorial Of Korea.

751
00:54:21,132 --> 00:54:23,885
It's to make up for failing to recruit
Assemblyman Oh.

752
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:26,763
She's facing the preconceived notion that
her position

753
00:54:26,846 --> 00:54:28,807
on national security is weak, head on.

754
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:30,475
Seonjin Republican Party

755
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:33,103
won't beg for peace.

756
00:54:33,395 --> 00:54:34,312
I, Yun Chan-gyeong,

757
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:37,649
will not make deals using the
national security as bargaining chips.

758
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:42,654
The Blue House is delaying
the investiture of ministers.

759
00:54:42,737 --> 00:54:45,490
Do you think President Park's capability
of crisis management

760
00:54:45,573 --> 00:54:48,743
and administration has reached its limits?

761
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:50,912
No, it's the opposite.

762
00:54:51,871 --> 00:54:54,165
No one is perfect.

763
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:56,710
The same goes for the government
and leaders.

764
00:54:56,793 --> 00:54:59,587
There can be problems
in selecting personnel.

765
00:55:00,088 --> 00:55:00,964
However,

766
00:55:01,506 --> 00:55:03,675
not everyone has the courage

767
00:55:03,758 --> 00:55:06,511
to admit that.

768
00:55:06,594 --> 00:55:09,931
President Park has that courage.

769
00:55:11,433 --> 00:55:15,770
It's true that President Park Mu-jin
is my biggest rival.

770
00:55:15,854 --> 00:55:17,188
He's lead the country

771
00:55:17,272 --> 00:55:20,525
to stability much better than I expected
since the bombing.

772
00:55:21,693 --> 00:55:23,194
In these tough times,

773
00:55:23,695 --> 00:55:26,031
President Park has been working hard,

774
00:55:26,614 --> 00:55:29,826
and I'd like to applaud him
with encouragement and support.

775
00:55:31,369 --> 00:55:35,540
It's time for us to give him a gift.

776
00:55:36,124 --> 00:55:38,710
Let's allow him to return to school
and enjoy comfortable afternoons

777
00:55:39,294 --> 00:55:41,880
once his term is over.

778
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:43,965
This will be possible

779
00:55:44,215 --> 00:55:47,218
since you have President Yun Chan-gyeong.

780
00:55:49,804 --> 00:55:51,181
She doesn't mean that, does she?

781
00:55:51,806 --> 00:55:53,683
She wanted him impeached.

782
00:55:53,767 --> 00:55:56,561
-Yun Chan-gyeong for president!
-Gosh.

783
00:55:56,644 --> 00:55:58,188
Snap me out of this hypnosis.

784
00:55:58,271 --> 00:56:00,065
It feels like
she's telling the truth to me.

785
00:56:00,148 --> 00:56:03,151
-Yun Chan-gyeong for President.
-Yun Chan-gyeong for President.

786
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:06,613
Can you find someone

787
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:09,824
to fight against her in 10 days?

788
00:56:15,705 --> 00:56:17,999
You gave up on President Park,

789
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:21,461
and it seems you've also
given up on the change in administration.

790
00:56:38,603 --> 00:56:40,605
You said I should

791
00:56:40,814 --> 00:56:43,900
play the role of secretary
to the secretary,

792
00:56:45,276 --> 00:56:47,070
but I must not be fit for it.

793
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:50,323
By tomorrow,

794
00:56:50,573 --> 00:56:52,992
President Park will have to put up
with the scandal,

795
00:56:53,827 --> 00:56:56,746
and the change in administration
Secretary Cha dreamt of...

796
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:59,040
It will become impossible.

797
00:57:13,346 --> 00:57:14,639
I heard.

798
00:57:17,142 --> 00:57:18,560
So the Secretariat...

799
00:57:20,353 --> 00:57:23,398
wants a paternity test for Si-wan?

800
00:57:24,649 --> 00:57:26,067
Is this necessary...

801
00:57:27,235 --> 00:57:28,820
for you?

802
00:57:31,739 --> 00:57:32,907
I'll take care of it.

803
00:57:44,419 --> 00:57:47,505
You didn't have to step in.

804
00:57:50,633 --> 00:57:52,469
I couldn't just sit back and watch you

805
00:57:53,261 --> 00:57:55,472
get undeserved criticism...

806
00:57:57,056 --> 00:57:58,850
because of us.

807
00:58:00,101 --> 00:58:01,394
Am I not...

808
00:58:02,061 --> 00:58:02,896
part of "us"?

809
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:08,276
Do you think I'll accept
Secretary Cha's suggestion?

810
00:58:09,194 --> 00:58:10,612
Is that why you're asking?

811
00:58:13,198 --> 00:58:14,532
I can't let Si-wan...

812
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:18,536
live as the son of someone like that...

813
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:20,663
for even a day.

814
00:58:21,956 --> 00:58:22,957
He's my son.

815
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:26,794
More importantly,

816
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:31,591
I won't let Si-wan be anxious
about something that isn't his fault

817
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:34,886
and worry what the whole world
will think about him

818
00:58:34,969 --> 00:58:37,138
just because of my position.

819
00:58:39,807 --> 00:58:40,975
Not like I did to you.

820
00:59:23,268 --> 00:59:24,852
Is President Park inside?

821
00:59:24,936 --> 00:59:26,437
-Mr. President!
-How pretty.

822
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:29,190
Mr. President,

823
00:59:29,274 --> 00:59:31,859
the First Lady is on the news and...

824
00:59:31,943 --> 00:59:34,362
You should turn the TV on. Goodness.

825
00:59:36,114 --> 00:59:37,657
Mr. Park.

826
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:38,950
-Mr. Park?
-Yes.

827
00:59:41,786 --> 00:59:43,288
You can brief me in the office.

828
00:59:43,371 --> 00:59:45,748
But you should watch it now...

829
00:59:45,832 --> 00:59:47,333
Si-wan, go have breakfast.

830
00:59:58,219 --> 01:00:00,763
There is no need for you to watch it now.

831
01:00:00,847 --> 01:00:02,390
I should brief you in the office.

832
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:07,228
Mr. President.

833
01:00:08,146 --> 01:00:11,232
The news is covering the First Lady--

834
01:00:11,316 --> 01:00:12,400
It's Mom.

835
01:00:12,483 --> 01:00:13,818
Mom is... Wait, "Mom"?

836
01:00:14,068 --> 01:00:15,653
Si-jin.

837
01:00:15,737 --> 01:00:17,447
President Park Mu-jin's wife

838
01:00:17,530 --> 01:00:20,325
and the First Lady Choe Gang-yeon's
style is causing a sensation.

839
01:00:21,743 --> 01:00:24,621
This is the first time

840
01:00:24,704 --> 01:00:26,789
for a working mother
to become the first lady.

841
01:00:27,582 --> 01:00:30,335
Working women in their 30s and 40s

842
01:00:30,418 --> 01:00:33,504
relate to her natural and comfortable
style while showing great interest.

843
01:00:34,422 --> 01:00:35,340
What?

844
01:00:35,923 --> 01:00:37,717
Where did all those photos come from?

845
01:00:39,677 --> 01:00:42,138
Your fashion style is a political message.

846
01:00:42,889 --> 01:00:46,768
It could mean much more than a scandal.

847
01:01:11,209 --> 01:01:13,544
Say whatever is on your mind.

848
01:01:20,635 --> 01:01:22,011
Si-wan.

849
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:28,434
Are you using the ointment I gave you?

850
01:01:29,811 --> 01:01:32,480
I told you looks are crucial to men.

851
01:01:38,027 --> 01:01:40,947
That was a long time ago.
My scar has healed now.

852
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:43,074
See?

853
01:01:54,085 --> 01:01:55,586
It's pretty obvious that I'm handsome.

854
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:03,219
I'm...

855
01:02:04,971 --> 01:02:06,013
your son.

856
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:43,760
Did you stop the news
of President Park's scandal?

857
01:02:45,636 --> 01:02:46,637
Of course not.

858
01:02:46,721 --> 01:02:47,889
What?

859
01:02:47,972 --> 01:02:51,225
There's only one person here
at the Blue House...

860
01:02:52,935 --> 01:02:55,563
that can stop that tenacious woman.

861
01:02:56,355 --> 01:02:57,190
What?

862
01:02:58,107 --> 01:02:59,650
It seems that one person

863
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:02,904
has yet to give up on President Park.

864
01:03:15,666 --> 01:03:16,709
Please tell me...

865
01:03:19,712 --> 01:03:21,339
what I have to do.

866
01:03:29,263 --> 01:03:30,765
I have no one that can...

867
01:03:33,518 --> 01:03:35,102
fight against Assemblywoman Yun...

868
01:03:37,939 --> 01:03:39,524
other than President Park.

869
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:42,568
I told you.

870
01:03:45,321 --> 01:03:46,447
I'm against...

871
01:03:47,448 --> 01:03:48,533
President Park.

872
01:03:49,116 --> 01:03:50,451
Secretary Han.

873
01:03:56,666 --> 01:03:57,708
Secretary Han.

874
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:00,044
Secretary Han!

875
01:04:11,556 --> 01:04:12,640
If I were you,

876
01:04:16,185 --> 01:04:17,895
I'd focus on winning over the candidate,

877
01:04:19,146 --> 01:04:20,481
not the approval rating.

878
01:04:22,608 --> 01:04:26,404
That is, if it's a candidate I'm sure of.

879
01:04:28,823 --> 01:04:29,907
Do you think...

880
01:04:30,575 --> 01:04:31,701
you've got this?

881
01:04:33,327 --> 01:04:35,246
Are you sure...

882
01:04:36,747 --> 01:04:37,832
about President Park?

883
01:04:42,753 --> 01:04:46,299
The air pollution level test result
provided by the EPA...

884
01:04:46,841 --> 01:04:48,676
There’s an error in the numbers.

885
01:04:48,759 --> 01:04:50,052
From my calculations...

886
01:04:58,644 --> 01:04:59,812
Now,

887
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:03,900
you just completed
your first official matter

888
01:05:04,483 --> 01:05:07,111
as Acting President, President Park.

889
01:05:09,405 --> 01:05:11,324
Isn't it the nation's duty

890
01:05:11,407 --> 01:05:13,534
to save its people's lives?

891
01:05:15,036 --> 01:05:17,622
Today, we failed to do so.

892
01:05:17,705 --> 01:05:21,042
However, you still have a chance.

893
01:05:23,836 --> 01:05:25,087
I will issue...

894
01:05:26,714 --> 01:05:27,965
an executive order.

895
01:05:29,258 --> 01:05:32,887
Within the order I am bound by
as Acting President,

896
01:05:34,305 --> 01:05:36,974
the discrimination policy didn't exist.

897
01:05:39,143 --> 01:05:41,103
Please answer me, Mr. President.

898
01:05:42,229 --> 01:05:43,564
Is it true?

899
01:05:44,982 --> 01:05:46,150
Yes, it's true.

900
01:05:48,611 --> 01:05:50,154
What I believe in...

901
01:05:50,237 --> 01:05:53,199
are the principles and system
of our administration.

902
01:05:53,282 --> 01:05:55,534
It is what has controlled our nation
so far.

903
01:05:58,579 --> 01:06:00,331
You want me to be
a presidential candidate?

904
01:06:00,414 --> 01:06:01,499
Yes.

905
01:06:02,083 --> 01:06:05,002
I can't be the candidate that has
a good chance of winning...

906
01:06:06,629 --> 01:06:08,339
like you want me to be.

907
01:06:46,669 --> 01:06:47,878
Secretary Cha,

908
01:06:49,255 --> 01:06:51,966
-The story Ms. Woo--
-Could you reconsider?

909
01:06:56,220 --> 01:06:58,222
Please become Korea's...

910
01:06:59,974 --> 01:07:00,891
21st president.

911
01:07:05,771 --> 01:07:06,689
The owner of this seat.

912
01:07:10,735 --> 01:07:12,361
Even you told me

913
01:07:12,987 --> 01:07:15,239
that I'm not cut out for this.

914
01:07:20,119 --> 01:07:21,912
I want to see...

915
01:07:24,999 --> 01:07:26,751
the good person win at least once.

916
01:07:38,721 --> 01:07:39,889
What do you think?

917
01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:43,768
Will President Park run for president?

918
01:07:49,690 --> 01:07:50,858
Who knows?

919
01:07:52,109 --> 01:07:54,111
I'm more curious about something else.

920
01:07:57,448 --> 01:07:58,824
I wonder how

921
01:07:59,575 --> 01:08:01,202
Mu-jin will react

922
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:05,289
once he finds out that

923
01:08:07,041 --> 01:08:08,751
he was a part of the bombing.

924
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:24,809
PRESS PASS

925
01:08:26,727 --> 01:08:29,021
It must've been hard
to give up the exclusive.

926
01:08:29,897 --> 01:08:30,981
Thank you, Ms. Woo.

927
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:34,985
Give me something worth a story...

928
01:08:35,277 --> 01:08:37,196
like an exclusive interview

929
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:39,615
with President Park announcing
his candidacy.

930
01:08:40,366 --> 01:08:42,660
-Keep your promise.
-I will.

931
01:08:48,082 --> 01:08:49,333
Now, tell me.

932
01:08:51,919 --> 01:08:53,629
Who was the one who reported the scandal?

933
01:08:54,213 --> 01:08:55,714
Who is the whistle-blower?

934
01:08:57,800 --> 01:09:00,094
We need to stop that person

935
01:09:00,636 --> 01:09:02,596
for your news article not to take a blow.

936
01:09:03,806 --> 01:09:05,015
What do you mean?

937
01:09:05,099 --> 01:09:07,810
My source wasn't the whistle-blower.

938
01:09:08,686 --> 01:09:10,479
Ms. Choe Gang-yeon's ex-husband.

939
01:09:11,105 --> 01:09:14,358
He gave me the exclusive personally.

940
01:09:16,944 --> 01:09:19,530
Have you not identified
the whistle-blower yet?

941
01:09:23,033 --> 01:09:24,034
Secretary Cha.

942
01:09:24,118 --> 01:09:25,369
Yes, sir.

943
01:09:26,036 --> 01:09:27,371
We found it.

944
01:09:28,205 --> 01:09:31,584
We found the worker
from the special crime investigation team

945
01:09:31,750 --> 01:09:34,545
who prepared the verification documents
regarding Minister Park.

946
01:09:34,628 --> 01:09:36,714
VERIFICATION DOCUMENTS:
NEEDED FOR HR VERIFICATION

947
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:39,175
MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENT PARK MU-JIN

948
01:09:39,258 --> 01:09:40,593
Are you saying this worker is

949
01:09:41,427 --> 01:09:43,762
the whistle-blower?

950
01:09:46,891 --> 01:09:49,185
This person was sent to the Blue House
from the NIS.

951
01:09:49,268 --> 01:09:50,436
I see.

952
01:09:50,519 --> 01:09:53,063
But they died during the bombing.

953
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:55,649
What?

954
01:09:55,733 --> 01:09:58,485
Who is this whistle-blower?

955
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:03,157
Did you find the whistle-blower?

956
01:10:04,742 --> 01:10:05,784
Who is it?

957
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:10,915
There's a more important matter
right now, sir.

958
01:10:12,666 --> 01:10:14,501
As you've requested,

959
01:10:14,585 --> 01:10:17,004
the Civil Affairs Office
investigated discreetly so that

960
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:19,757
neither Si-wan nor your family's matters
would be disclosed.

961
01:10:20,591 --> 01:10:22,718
With the help
of the Blue House's security agents,

962
01:10:22,801 --> 01:10:24,011
we tracked the IP address

963
01:10:24,595 --> 01:10:26,388
and found the whistle-blower.

964
01:10:27,181 --> 01:10:31,060
That whistle-blower wants to meet you
in private.

965
01:10:32,603 --> 01:10:34,688
He used that scandal as bait,

966
01:10:34,772 --> 01:10:36,941
so you would have no choice
but to look for him.

967
01:11:05,052 --> 01:11:06,220
I found it!

968
01:11:07,429 --> 01:11:09,556
I found the security camera footage
from your accident.

969
01:11:17,564 --> 01:11:18,649
Isn't this Tae-ik?

970
01:11:33,539 --> 01:11:34,498
Look here.

971
01:11:35,291 --> 01:11:37,251
I think this person helped you.

972
01:11:59,064 --> 01:12:01,567
Ji-won, zoom in.

973
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:04,278
Why?

974
01:12:05,154 --> 01:12:06,405
Do you recognize him?

975
01:12:09,950 --> 01:12:11,827
The whistle-blower wanted to meet you
at a place

976
01:12:11,910 --> 01:12:13,579
where no one
from the Blue House knew about,

977
01:12:14,538 --> 01:12:16,081
so I brought you to the safe house.

978
01:12:36,018 --> 01:12:37,519
Mr. President is here.

979
01:13:18,143 --> 01:13:19,103
It's him.

980
01:13:29,446 --> 01:13:30,989
I'm from Espionage Team Two of the NIS.

981
01:13:31,782 --> 01:13:33,117
My name is Kim Jun-o.

982
01:13:39,248 --> 01:13:40,249
It's Kim Jun-o?

983
01:13:41,834 --> 01:13:42,793
This is him?

984
01:13:45,754 --> 01:13:46,964
He was alive.

985
01:13:48,674 --> 01:13:49,883
He was alive.

986
01:14:06,775 --> 01:14:08,652
I'm a dead man.

987
01:14:09,403 --> 01:14:10,487
Everyone thinks I am.

988
01:14:11,822 --> 01:14:12,823
What do you mean?

989
01:14:12,906 --> 01:14:14,032
On that day,

990
01:14:15,242 --> 01:14:16,827
I was at the scene.

991
01:14:18,829 --> 01:14:22,332
I was going to report the conspiracy
behind the attack to the president myself.

992
01:14:24,251 --> 01:14:25,711
Because

993
01:14:26,295 --> 01:14:28,338
no one from the Blue House
wanted to report the truth.

994
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:38,348
You can't believe anyone, sir.

995
01:14:39,683 --> 01:14:41,268
The accomplice

996
01:14:42,936 --> 01:14:44,354
is in the Blue House.

997
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:15,177
If he was alive all this time,

998
01:15:16,470 --> 01:15:18,222
why didn't he show himself to you?

999
01:15:18,305 --> 01:15:22,351
Agent Han is nothing
but a suspect in a murder case.

1000
01:15:23,310 --> 01:15:25,562
So you're saying that the accomplice

1001
01:15:25,646 --> 01:15:28,482
who handed over this file to the attackers
is in the Blue House, right?

1002
01:15:28,565 --> 01:15:31,151
An even more dangerous situation
than a bombing may occur.

1003
01:15:31,235 --> 01:15:33,737
Will you be able to handle it,
President Park?

1004
01:15:33,820 --> 01:15:37,032
We have 40 days until the election day.

1005
01:15:37,115 --> 01:15:40,160
No matter who it is,
you can't trust anyone, sir.
