1
00:00:53,636 --> 00:01:00,602
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
PLACES AND EVENTS ARE FICTIONAL

2
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:02,395
REGIONAL FORCES UNDER MARTIAL LAW

3
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:05,398
There's a chance
that the military will use force,

4
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:08,568
led by General Eun Hui-jeong,
Minister Oh Yeong-seok,

5
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:10,403
and NIS Deputy Director Ji Yun-bae.

6
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:13,740
In other words, there's a sign of a coup.

7
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:17,327
The H-hour is 11:00 p.m.

8
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:22,207
The troops near the metropolitan area will
assemble near the Capital Defense Command.

9
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:30,799
What we need to do now is appoint
someone in the military we can trust

10
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:32,884
and quell the rebel forces

11
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:34,010
before 11:00 p.m.

12
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,391
But do you think
there's someone reliable in the military

13
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:44,145
that will listen to the Blue House?

14
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:47,774
Someone we know for sure
is on Mr. President's side.

15
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:00,370
There's one person

16
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:05,458
who can stand against General Eun.

17
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,796
I'm not sure
if he'll take my side, though.

18
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,059
General Lee Gwan-muk

19
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:26,104
is a risky choice, sir.

20
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,107
General Eun

21
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:32,694
is using General Lee's dismissal

22
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:36,114
and detention to justify the coup.

23
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:38,533
That's why.

24
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:43,496
If General Lee decides
to join hands with us,

25
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,624
they will lose their justification
to exercise force,

26
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,628
and their coup attempt will lose momentum.

27
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,631
But General Lee Gwan-muk...

28
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:56,801
Are you sure
that he'll join hands with us?

29
00:02:57,552 --> 00:02:59,387
He doesn't trust the Blue House.

30
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:03,683
He might have already agreed
to collude with General Eun.

31
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:04,851
-Then--
-Then,

32
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:09,898
General Lee will be prosecuted
for insurrection before anybody else

33
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,734
according to the Military Criminal Act.

34
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:19,866
It is the decision I made
as the Commander-in-Chief of the military,

35
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:21,576
Secretary Han.

36
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:43,097
At the moment,

37
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:47,852
there is no military official whom
we can trust to side with President Park.

38
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:51,189
If General Lee is a possibility,
we should give it a shot.

39
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:54,192
General Lee is the most elite member
of the ROK Army.

40
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:58,696
And President Park hurt his pride

41
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:00,573
in the most humiliating way.

42
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:08,539
Do you think he'll side with us?

43
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:16,047
What if I turn you down?

44
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:20,551
What are you going to do

45
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:24,555
if I even join General Eun?

46
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:28,142
Then this offer

47
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:32,981
will basically be suicide for you.

48
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:36,985
You don't know anything about the military

49
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:42,031
to be called Commander-in-Chief.

50
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:55,878
Where did you say we'd be meeting?

51
00:04:57,255 --> 00:05:00,174
General Lee has just arrived.

52
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:05,513
MILITARY POLICE

53
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:17,984
Welcome, sir.

54
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:19,610
We were waiting for you.

55
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:26,868
General Lee has arrived

56
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:29,287
at the Capital Defense Command.

57
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,460
I believe he has joined hands
with General Eun.

58
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:44,135
REGIONAL FORCES UNDER MARTIAL LAW

59
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:48,139
Sir.

60
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,767
Would you like to issue the order now?

61
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:56,189
The Tenth Fighter Wing is on standby
as you had requested, sir.

62
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:59,025
The Special Task Force
at the Capital Defense Command

63
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:01,569
is awaiting your orders, sir.

64
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:06,532
If General Lee did indeed join them,

65
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:09,952
the troops gathered at the CDC
will be on the move soon.

66
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:12,330
We must make a move to quell them
before that happens

67
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:13,998
in order to minimize casualties.

68
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:20,963
Sir.

69
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:39,607
I have...

70
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:43,653
already given my orders.

71
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:05,925
As per the order of President Park,
the Commander-in-Chief of our military,

72
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:08,386
General Eun Hui-jeong is under arrest

73
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:12,181
for plotting a military coup
according to Article Eight

74
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:15,143
of the Military Criminal Act.

75
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:16,978
What are you talking about?

76
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:35,705
Why are you doing this?

77
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,169
-He should have arrived by now.
-All right.

78
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:42,170
Let's go.

79
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:44,755
Hands up!

80
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:47,925
Who the hell are you?

81
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:09,197
President Park humiliated you.

82
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,656
Not once, but twice!

83
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:12,116
So why?

84
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:16,829
Because the honor of the ROK Army
is more important

85
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,040
than my personal honor.

86
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,793
The most shameful moments
in the history of our army

87
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:27,006
was when we had to aim guns
at our own people.

88
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:28,424
Did you think

89
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:30,927
I'd repeat that?

90
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:00,873
I need to hear your answer, sir.

91
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:05,836
Did you think
I'd join hands with you right away

92
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,714
if you offered to reinstate me
as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff?

93
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:11,008
Is that why you came all the way here?

94
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:17,932
In front of the generals under
my leadership, you took away my authority

95
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:19,976
and doubted my patriotism.

96
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:23,729
My honor as a soldier
matters the most to me,

97
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,232
and you humiliated me.

98
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:29,944
Are you really naive enough to believe
that I will help you?

99
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:31,404
I calculated your move.

100
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:33,906
In a clever manner.

101
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,994
You thought I humiliated you twice,

102
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,245
you neither rebelled

103
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,414
nor exercised force.

104
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,460
Hence, I thought
the law and order of this country

105
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:51,465
mattered more to you
than your personal honor.

106
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,135
Thus,

107
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:56,178
I believed

108
00:09:57,138 --> 00:10:00,975
that you'd want our military
to be remembered honorably

109
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:03,060
by our children.

110
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:08,733
I do not know much about the military.

111
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:10,568
However,

112
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:15,489
I felt like I could tell
what kind of person you were.

113
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:19,577
Was I

114
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:21,996
wrong about you?

115
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:32,882
Mr. President.

116
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:37,428
General Lee has arrived
at the NSC situation room.

117
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:17,510
As of 22:05

118
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,762
on March 31, 2019,

119
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:23,933
the Military Police and prosecutors
have successfully completed

120
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:28,854
quelling the military coup attempt

121
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:32,024
led by Army Chief of Staff Eun Hui-jeong.

122
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,569
All associated personnel
have been sent to the DSSC.

123
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:43,035
I hereby report the progress to you,
the Commander-in-Chief of our military,

124
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:46,705
sir.

125
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:48,100
DAY 32 : THE TRAP
EPISODE 15

126
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:00,654
EUN HUI-JEONG

127
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:06,827
General Eun Hui-jeong.

128
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:11,165
When we found out that you were the mole

129
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:13,959
who leaked OP 5015-18,

130
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:15,711
you started plotting a military coup.

131
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:19,006
It was
because you were afraid you might be held

132
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:20,925
solely accountable for the bombing.

133
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:26,055
We can't condone such injustice.

134
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:28,807
Now, tell me.

135
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:32,311
OP 5015-18.

136
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:34,480
Who did you give it to?

137
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:44,573
The VIP.

138
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:51,705
I asked you who inside the Blue House
shared the plan for the attack

139
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:53,374
with you.

140
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:55,918
What do you mean by "the VIP"?

141
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:57,795
That's right.

142
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:00,464
All of us

143
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:05,678
simply followed the instructions
given to us by the VIP.

144
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:12,768
That is not something the former
head of a government agency should say.

145
00:14:12,851 --> 00:14:15,813
So you simply followed
the VIP's instructions

146
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:17,815
and bombed
the National Assembly Building...

147
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:24,405
Who is it?

148
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:26,907
The VIP.

149
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:32,454
I don't know. I have no idea.

150
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:39,795
We don't know what he looks like,
what his name is, or who he is.

151
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:42,172
We

152
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:45,634
have never met the VIP.

153
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:48,429
This person was an accomplice
in the massive attack,

154
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:50,723
and yet you've never met him?

155
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:53,225
Mr. Kim.

156
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:56,729
I always met

157
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:00,149
with Mr. Kim,

158
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,443
the VIP's representative.

159
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:07,781
He always passed on
the VIP's instructions to us

160
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:10,117
and informed him of our requests.

161
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:13,579
He is the faithful middleman.

162
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:16,832
Who is Mr. Kim?

163
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:21,003
It's common, you know.

164
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:24,798
When the VIP has too much to lose

165
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:27,760
by revealing himself,

166
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:29,428
his right-hand man acts on his behalf.

167
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:31,263
Where is

168
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:33,724
Mr. Kim now?

169
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:39,563
That's Mr. Kim.

170
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,274
He was caught on a camera
near the tailor shop.

171
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:46,278
Ji-won, do you have his name yet?

172
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:51,450
I've been going through
all the security footage to find his face

173
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:54,495
since the second I got here
without even going to the bathroom

174
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:57,748
thanks to you two, my incredible mentors.

175
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:03,003
Okay, so...

176
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:05,965
You can find out
more information about him, right?

177
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:09,385
Some say he was one of our spies
sent to the North.

178
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:12,054
Some witnesses also said
that he used to do legal work

179
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:14,139
at Nadong Group's
Planning and Coordination Office.

180
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:16,517
A former South Korean spy

181
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,937
and Nadong Group's legal team
seem completely unrelated.

182
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:22,564
The two have something in common.

183
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:26,276
They're both fixers
who can pull off anything.

184
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,572
It does seem like Mr. Kim can do anything.

185
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:33,575
From personnel matters to money,

186
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:36,495
they never had to reiterate their requests
regardless of what it was

187
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:39,039
because he always resolved
them effectively

188
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:40,833
using the VIP's power.

189
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:45,045
Are you saying

190
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:47,631
that's why they could put their trust
in Mr. Kim

191
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:49,133
without knowing his name or identity

192
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:52,553
and conspired with him
to commit the outrageous crime

193
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:53,971
together?

194
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:02,604
The entire nation is shocked by the news

195
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:06,525
that the Minister of National Defense,
Oh Yeong-seok, was shot and killed

196
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:09,403
last night by an officer
from the Ministry of National Defense.

197
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:14,116
According to the police,
Minister Oh and the officer...

198
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:15,409
It's me, Mr. Kim.

199
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:17,995
I'm sorry I couldn't call sooner.

200
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,165
I was trying to figure out

201
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:24,293
who'd have the most to lose

202
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:27,588
if I revealed myself now.

203
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,675
They arrived near Namhyeon-dong.

204
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:33,886
According to witnesses, the officer...

205
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:35,721
As all of you have probably heard,

206
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:37,473
Minister Oh

207
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:40,142
was shot and killed last night,

208
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:42,186
which is truly tragic.

209
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,939
Was it because of a personal grudge?

210
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:48,400
Was it due to a conflict over
his presidential bid?

211
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:52,488
We have issued a press embargo,

212
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:55,699
but I'd like to share this
with the two of you

213
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:57,951
as I consider you our partners.

214
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,538
Last night,

215
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:04,583
there was a conspiracy
for a military revolt

216
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:07,336
led by General Eun Hui-jeong.

217
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:11,840
And Minister Oh was on his way
to participate in the conspiracy.

218
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,050
Hold on.

219
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:15,844
A conspired revolt?

220
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:19,181
Do you mean

221
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:21,892
a coup d'etat?

222
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:28,816
General Lee Gwan-muk
and the military prosecutors

223
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:30,943
arrested all of them at the scene.

224
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:32,861
They were all transferred to the DSSC,

225
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:34,696
and the situation has been contained.

226
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:40,702
Why wasn't it reported to the media?

227
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:45,707
Once people learn of your quick efforts
to quell the coup,

228
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:49,378
it will only give you
a bigger advantage in the polls.

229
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:53,215
Those who plotted the coup

230
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:56,969
were also involved with
the National Assembly Building bombing.

231
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,805
Minister Oh,

232
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:03,559
General Eun Hui-jeong,
and even Director Ji Yun-bae.

233
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:04,810
Oh, my.

234
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:08,230
My goodness.

235
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:11,275
When the NIS Terrorism Task Force
got closer to the truth,

236
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:14,111
they believed their involvement
will soon be revealed.

237
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:17,990
That's why they plotted the coup.

238
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:25,539
Currently, we've yet to uncover
the true culprits behind the bombing.

239
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:29,251
If news of the coup got out,

240
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:33,172
it'll only aggravate the people's anxiety.

241
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:55,694
We believe he is one of the main players
of the bombing and coup d'etat.

242
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:10,417
You two are not only delegates
of the opposing and majority party,

243
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,085
but also the top presidential candidates.

244
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:15,547
That is why

245
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:17,966
I earnestly ask this of you.

246
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:22,971
Please do not let this
be turned into a political issue

247
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:25,724
or used to aid your campaign.

248
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,018
Will you please

249
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:30,562
keep this confidential?

250
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:43,242
Why do you think
Minister Oh made such a choice?

251
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:46,328
He got involved in the bombing

252
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:48,664
and even decided
to join the military coup.

253
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:52,000
He was probably desperate

254
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:55,087
and believed that
without taking such extreme measures,

255
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:59,216
there was no hope for this country
ever since the Battle of Baengnyeong.

256
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:03,387
Then you could say that
I was behind the bombing.

257
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:10,352
The practical politics
that only further discouraged him

258
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:14,564
has always been what I promoted.

259
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:31,039
During that Baengnyeong Battle,

260
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,458
where were you?

261
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,585
When the ones who survived

262
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:38,547
were suffering in pain

263
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:41,758
of the wounds
and the people's indifference,

264
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:44,469
where exactly were you?

265
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:47,848
-Mr. Oh--
-You were a member

266
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:50,726
of the National Defense Committee.

267
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,353
However, when we asked for your help,

268
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:56,273
you were never present.

269
00:21:57,691 --> 00:21:58,775
Not even once.

270
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:11,371
Living in South Korea

271
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:13,874
only ends in two ways.

272
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,127
You either become a victim one day

273
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,422
or the bereaved.

274
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:24,634
Due to ethnic background,

275
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:29,181
disability, nationality, affiliation,
race, religion,

276
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,558
and even beliefs...

277
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:34,102
In every way,

278
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:37,397
people have found a way
to discriminate against others.

279
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:43,445
It's how one can be at a slight advantage
in this dog-eat-dog world.

280
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:46,281
Underneath our masks, we're selfish beings

281
00:22:46,364 --> 00:22:48,158
who support discrimination
and oppose equality.

282
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:49,576
That's the ugly face

283
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:53,538
of the power

284
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:56,416
that propels the world.

285
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:06,301
GENERAL ELECTION POLLS

286
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:08,887
I thought there would be
a huge fluctuation in the polls

287
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:12,015
now that front-runner Minister Oh
was excluded.

288
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:14,101
I'm glad President Park is in the lead,

289
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:15,644
although it's only by a small margin.

290
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:18,897
This isn't a number we can be happy with.

291
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:22,859
Once supporters
of the major parties gather,

292
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:26,113
as an independent candidate,
President Park will be fighting

293
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:30,117
with one arm tied behind his back
against Mayor Kang and Ms. Yun.

294
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,703
Still, he has achieved something
no one can deny.

295
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:35,872
For a month since the bombing,

296
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:38,041
he completed an internship
in administration.

297
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:40,252
He passed given the circumstances.

298
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:41,419
All right.

299
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:42,796
His term

300
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,091
ends in four days. That's including today.

301
00:23:48,468 --> 00:23:50,095
Please

302
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:53,932
handle the reporters
and the media well until then

303
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:56,393
so that he can finish up his duties

304
00:23:57,853 --> 00:24:01,606
and end his term successfully.
I'm counting on you.

305
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:08,738
The polite Mr. Cha

306
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:12,325
isn't a douchebag,
but at the same time, he's not very fun.

307
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:14,119
Don't worry though.

308
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:19,374
You're not the only one
who supports President Park.

309
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:30,218
What does he want from me?

310
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:36,224
I saw the latest polls.

311
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:38,643
You've made progress.

312
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:42,647
Didn't you promise Secretary Cha
that you'd join the campaign

313
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:45,108
if I became the front-runner in the polls?

314
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:48,695
You don't have to keep that promise.

315
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:55,452
Join my campaign
when you finally see me as a candidate

316
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:57,454
who can win the election.

317
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:00,498
Is that confidence I detect in your voice?

318
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:07,380
You were right
to choose General Lee Gwan-muk.

319
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:09,591
When we first met,

320
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:14,346
I asked you to prevent
a military coup d'etat,

321
00:25:15,513 --> 00:25:17,015
and you kept your promise.

322
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:20,977
Thank you, President Park.

323
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:43,166
CHA YEONG-JIN

324
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:30,213
Call Mr. Kim.

325
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:32,382
They will contact you soon

326
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:35,552
since they'll need your help.

327
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:53,153
Are you saying

328
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:56,656
that Ms. Yun is involved with the bombers?

329
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:59,617
The photos indicate its possibility.

330
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:08,668
Who sent these photos?

331
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:10,503
They were sent to the office,

332
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:12,756
but there was no return address.

333
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:14,549
I'm sure they have an agenda.

334
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:18,595
Either it's to disclose her corruption
for the interest of the public,

335
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:22,265
or it's a political attack
designed to make the Blue House

336
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:24,059
suspect Assemblywoman Yun.

337
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:28,730
There's someone who could answer that.

338
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:48,166
The man in the photo is Mr. Kim,
one of the people behind the bombing.

339
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:53,546
During your internal investigation,

340
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:56,841
has Assemblywoman Yun come up
as a person of interest?

341
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:58,718
Not yet.

342
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:02,806
However, I believe
that nothing can be easily assumed

343
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:05,225
or stated about this Mr. Kim.

344
00:28:08,978 --> 00:28:12,065
We do not know anything about this man
including his name and identity.

345
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:14,943
However, General Eun, Director Ji,

346
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:17,529
and even Minister Oh

347
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:19,739
trusted him fully and followed his orders

348
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:25,954
because they were blinded by the wealth
and power the VIP could give them.

349
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:35,463
Then,

350
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:38,842
in your opinion--

351
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:40,677
Assemblywoman Yun

352
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:44,514
is also someone who needs
the wealth and power the VIP can provide.

353
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:48,685
I don't think we can rule out
the possibility.

354
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,064
I'd like to ask you for a favor.

355
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:57,736
Until you're done
investigating Assemblywoman Yun,

356
00:28:57,861 --> 00:28:59,612
I'd like these photos

357
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:01,948
and what we know of Mr. Kim
to be kept a secret.

358
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:06,244
Speculations

359
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:09,706
of a presidential candidate
colluding with the bombers

360
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:14,377
will cause irreparable harm
even if it's later proven to be false.

361
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:19,924
I'll try, sir.

362
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:26,848
They met at a Korean restaurant
in Gangnam,

363
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:31,394
and their meeting occurred
on February 21 at 5 p.m.

364
00:29:32,228 --> 00:29:34,981
That's all the information I can get
from these photos.

365
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:42,280
We should check
if there's anyone in her circle

366
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:45,033
who has a connection to this Mr. Kim.

367
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:48,995
Na-gyeong.

368
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:53,958
Could Assemblywoman Yun

369
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:57,086
be this so-called VIP?

370
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,298
Just think about it.

371
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:03,092
She left the National Assembly Building

372
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:05,929
just before the explosion
due to a sudden boycott

373
00:30:06,012 --> 00:30:07,347
and got out of harm's way.

374
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:10,683
Who has the ability and authority
to control the political arena

375
00:30:11,851 --> 00:30:13,061
other than her?

376
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:34,040
Mr. Kim, it's me.

377
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,335
Thank you for the photos.

378
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,255
I'll cut right to the chase then.

379
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:43,132
Is this your way of saying
you'll expose me?

380
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:44,676
Now?

381
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:45,677
By now,

382
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:50,682
those photos are probably in the hands
of Acting President Park as well.

383
00:30:53,142 --> 00:30:56,729
I'm considering sharing these
with every media company

384
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:58,481
as the next step.

385
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:00,233
Could you handle that?

386
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:08,241
He must have sent these photos
to President Park as well.

387
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,159
Sorry?

388
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:13,746
-Then...
-I only have

389
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:15,373
one option now.

390
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:17,333
But ma'am...

391
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:33,057
-Secretary Han.
-Yes?

392
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:39,564
The media is reporting breaking news.

393
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:48,865
Last night, a coup d'etat conspiracy
led by Army Chief of Staff Eun Hui-jeong

394
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:50,617
was quelled by the joint forces

395
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,911
of the military prosecutors,
DSSC, and the military police

396
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:56,414
under Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman
Lee Gwan-muk's command.

397
00:31:56,497 --> 00:31:59,292
Division equivalent forces
near the metropolitan area

398
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:01,878
were supposed to assemble
at the Capital Defense Command

399
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:04,380
along with the Special Ops
and the Army Air Command.

400
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:07,383
They were then planning to station
the mechanized infantry division,

401
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:09,928
-the armored brigades, and tank forces...
-Sir.

402
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:13,514
It was either Mayor Kang
or Assemblywoman Yun.

403
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:16,267
You should summon them over.

404
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:18,937
We must hold someone responsible.

405
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:21,522
The public sentiment will be important.

406
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:24,484
Quelling the coup could help your image

407
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:26,694
and that of this current administration.

408
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,405
President Park and the Blue House,

409
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:31,366
despite this being a coup d'etat

410
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:33,826
that poses a serious threat
to national security,

411
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,703
disregarded the people's right to know

412
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:38,498
and were only bent on
covering up the truth.

413
00:32:38,581 --> 00:32:41,876
One can only assume
that the current administration

414
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,879
were only focused on how it'll effect
President Park's approval ratings.

415
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:48,424
-He'll be blamed instead of praised.
-How the people will react...

416
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:51,886
The press will be out for blood yet again.

417
00:32:53,262 --> 00:32:54,639
-Over here!
-Here!

418
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:56,432
-Here!
-Mr. Kim!

419
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:58,393
Why did you hide the coup d'etat
conspiracy?

420
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:00,770
Was the administration worried
about it being

421
00:33:00,853 --> 00:33:02,814
directly tied
to President Park's competency?

422
00:33:02,897 --> 00:33:06,067
Was it because President Park
is running for office?

423
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,527
In case it would affect the polls?

424
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:10,488
Is the Blue House more concerned
about a candidate's standing

425
00:33:10,571 --> 00:33:12,991
at the polls
than the people's right to know?

426
00:33:14,575 --> 00:33:15,493
We'd like an answer.

427
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:18,121
-Mr. Kim!
-Here!

428
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:19,580
-Over here!
-Mr. Kim!

429
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:21,666
Please answer the question.

430
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:24,794
-Mr. Kim!
-What's the answer?

431
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:26,421
Ever since the bombing,

432
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:29,173
the Blue House has
continuously followed one principle.

433
00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:31,092
National security

434
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:35,680
takes precedence over
the people's right to know at times.

435
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:42,562
That is why the administration

436
00:33:42,645 --> 00:33:45,732
also could not tell the people
about the conspired military revolt.

437
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:47,275
Are you saying

438
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:50,695
that the government
is hiding other matters as well?

439
00:33:50,778 --> 00:33:54,365
Was it President Park
who decided to keep this from the public?

440
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:57,201
-Please tell us.
-Please answer the question!

441
00:33:57,285 --> 00:34:00,747
-Mr. Kim!
-Is any of this true?

442
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:04,000
-Please answer us.
-Mr. Kim, what's the answer?

443
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:12,341
Aren't you leaving?

444
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:14,218
Of course I am. Let's go.

445
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:17,764
Ms. Woo.

446
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:21,017
Don't you think they're hiding more

447
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,935
than the conspired coup?

448
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:26,355
-Another great job today.
-I'm getting a strong feeling.

449
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:27,815
I'm not sure.

450
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:29,901
If you know anything, do share.

451
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:31,444
Excuse me.

452
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:35,281
-I'll wait.
-Good job today.

453
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:44,373
Ms. Woo, just a moment.

454
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:58,346
Do you know

455
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:00,139
who the source is?

456
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:02,600
Well,

457
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:04,769
it's linked to national security.

458
00:35:06,562 --> 00:35:07,980
I believe

459
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:09,774
that the public should've been told

460
00:35:09,857 --> 00:35:11,984
about the coup d'etat
as soon as it was quelled.

461
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:14,737
The authorities haven't figured out
who was behind the coup d'etat.

462
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:16,823
It would only lead
to unnecessary speculation.

463
00:35:17,406 --> 00:35:19,867
That'll only shake
the stability of this nation

464
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:21,160
which we're trying to restore.

465
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:23,287
Yes, but the media and the people

466
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:27,208
would've distinguished rumors
from truth over time.

467
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:31,087
It may be noisy and chaotic,
but that's the process of democracy.

468
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:35,883
It's not like I don't understand

469
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:38,094
the Blue House's position.

470
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:42,473
Still, you shouldn't
have asked for our source.

471
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:45,893
It sounds to me
like you're trying to control the media.

472
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:47,895
How could you say something
so frightening?

473
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:49,147
When did I do that?

474
00:35:49,897 --> 00:35:52,400
Just accept whatever the people think.

475
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:54,986
It's how one takes responsibility.

476
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:01,033
I think you should get going.

477
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:08,499
"They always say it's national security.
Don't they care about the people?

478
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:10,877
Now, they're even concealing coup d'etats.

479
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,336
Where is the truth?"

480
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:15,381
"Concealing a coup d'etat
and suppressing the people's rights.

481
00:36:15,464 --> 00:36:17,842
President Park's administration
is an absolute failure."

482
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:20,178
Unbelievable.

483
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:23,598
This is like catching a burglar
that entered my home

484
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:26,684
but being criticized
for not reporting it to the police.

485
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:30,104
The media was kind enough
to give us a guideline.

486
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:32,148
They're saying that this administration

487
00:36:32,773 --> 00:36:36,235
ignores people's rights
and harbors too many secrets.

488
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:39,322
President Park is scheduled to resign
in four days.

489
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:42,241
Just like a soldier
days before his discharge,

490
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:45,411
he should be careful of every action.

491
00:36:45,953 --> 00:36:48,414
I can't believe his bad luck.

492
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:50,791
This will probably affect
the General Election Polls,

493
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:52,460
right?

494
00:36:53,961 --> 00:36:55,171
Secretary Min,

495
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:57,798
are you worried about President Park?

496
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:59,800
Are you worried about
the independent candidate,

497
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:01,427
President Park's standings in the polls?

498
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:04,180
You're the one who was worried first,

499
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:06,265
so I thought that was the trend.

500
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:11,812
You see,

501
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:16,067
I'm very conscious
when it comes to trends.

502
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:23,199
Sure. Okay.

503
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:30,331
These are the poll results
of the presidential candidates

504
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:32,625
after the press reported about the coup.

505
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:34,460
GENERAL ELECTION POLLS

506
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:37,630
Assemblywoman Yun Chan-gyeong
has passed you and taken the lead.

507
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:43,928
Now, it's clear

508
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:46,305
who tipped off the press

509
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:48,140
and why that person took such a risk.

510
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:50,726
Are you saying Assemblywoman Yun
tipped off the press

511
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:52,228
to beat the President?

512
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:54,105
Let's not jump to conclusions.

513
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:56,524
We don't have time.

514
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:58,901
We have three days
until the President resigns,

515
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:01,279
and we must fix this within that time.

516
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:04,573
So what alternative do you suggest?

517
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:11,580
I suggest we turn the internal
investigation on Assemblywoman Yun

518
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:14,292
into an open investigation.

519
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:17,628
You want to turn it
into an open investigation?

520
00:38:17,878 --> 00:38:19,463
If we do that,

521
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:22,675
the press will be busy
talking about Assemblywoman Yun.

522
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:26,095
The suspicion is regarding the bombing.

523
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:29,265
The votes that went to her

524
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:31,809
will naturally go to you, Mr. President.

525
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:35,771
Above all, no one will blame us

526
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:38,274
for our political attack on her.

527
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:40,151
We have a good cause.

528
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:43,487
We're responding to the people's request
for a transparent government.

529
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:46,824
You're wrong.
It's definitely a political attack.

530
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:51,078
You want to sway the votes
using an unconfirmed suspicion

531
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:53,372
against the leading candidate.

532
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:55,916
We can't betray our own principles.

533
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:59,003
-I'm against this, sir.
-But, sir--

534
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:00,046
Both of you.

535
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,382
Could you give us a moment please?

536
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:19,732
Mr. Han can't just

537
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:22,026
exclude us in the middle
of the discussion--

538
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:23,402
Obviously, he's making a mistake.

539
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:25,863
It was just two presidential secretaries

540
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:27,406
making counterarguments.

541
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:29,700
-It wasn't a quarrel--
-It wasn't a quarrel--

542
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:40,336
What are your plans after this?

543
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:44,924
I don't have any special plans.

544
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:48,052
Why do you ask?
Do you want to go another round?

545
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:49,470
No.

546
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:53,766
There are some things in my office
that I can't handle myself.

547
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:55,226
What are they?

548
00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:56,352
Ramyeon.

549
00:39:57,603 --> 00:39:58,854
Would you like to have some?

550
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:05,945
I do not.

551
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:10,950
Is it that hard to decide whether or not

552
00:40:11,992 --> 00:40:14,078
to open the investigation
on Assemblywoman Yun?

553
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:22,336
I was the one who begged
her and Mayor Kang

554
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:27,007
not to make national security
a political issue this morning.

555
00:40:29,301 --> 00:40:30,511
Just because my rating dropped,

556
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:33,556
I can't betray the principles
I have set myself.

557
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:37,935
Those who play in the Olympics

558
00:40:38,018 --> 00:40:41,188
don't compete in order to obey the rules.

559
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:45,234
They put in their best efforts
in order to win the medals.

560
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:52,908
Even after you lose in the elections,

561
00:40:53,492 --> 00:40:54,994
will you be proud of yourself

562
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,747
for sticking to the rules?

563
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:04,545
I heard...

564
00:41:06,088 --> 00:41:07,339
you said

565
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:11,677
you would enact the Discrimination Act
when you become President.

566
00:41:12,928 --> 00:41:14,013
Does that promise...

567
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:17,808
mean less than your principles?

568
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:39,622
Would you call
Assemblywoman Yun Chan-gyeong in?

569
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:41,832
Have you made up your mind, sir?

570
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:02,353
I don't know if this will
sufficiently explain these pictures,

571
00:42:02,728 --> 00:42:04,980
but it was just a meeting
with my supporters,

572
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:06,899
which is common during election season.

573
00:42:07,399 --> 00:42:08,817
Some call them election brokers

574
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:10,694
and some call them
self-employed politicians.

575
00:42:14,156 --> 00:42:17,743
If you blame me for not being
careful enough, I'd accept that.

576
00:42:17,826 --> 00:42:20,162
But the claims
that I'm behind the bombing is ridiculous.

577
00:42:20,454 --> 00:42:21,872
Even if it weren't for the bombing,

578
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:25,334
I would have successfully changed
the government through the election.

579
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:30,714
You're suspicious of me, aren't you?

580
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:32,633
Is that why you called me in?

581
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:36,679
The NIS Terrorism Task Force is conducting
an internal investigation on you.

582
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:40,474
And I'm planning to ask them to turn it

583
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:42,601
into an open investigation.

584
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:49,900
Every media outlet
will make this picture public.

585
00:42:51,193 --> 00:42:53,946
They will persistently question
everything you have done

586
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:56,031
after the bombing.

587
00:42:56,615 --> 00:42:58,534
Your credibility
as a presidential candidate

588
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:02,288
will drop to the point
where it can never recover.

589
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:04,623
Why are you saying this to me?

590
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:06,875
It's not like you need
my permission to do that.

591
00:43:07,876 --> 00:43:09,044
You are still

592
00:43:10,379 --> 00:43:13,299
a partner
in this government administration.

593
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:15,509
Do it. Make it an open investigation.

594
00:43:17,803 --> 00:43:21,098
Even if you do so,
they won't find anything on me

595
00:43:21,181 --> 00:43:22,391
because I'm innocent.

596
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:27,313
But turning it into an open investigation
will only show

597
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:28,856
you're admitting to yourself

598
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:32,401
you want the downfall of Yun Chan-gyeong
more than a truthful investigation.

599
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:43,495
I have sent the same picture

600
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:48,292
to President Park and Assemblywoman Yun
just like you have ordered.

601
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:51,211
I can't wait to see

602
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:56,216
what kind of decisions
these two will make.

603
00:44:16,278 --> 00:44:17,321
Mr. Cha.

604
00:44:17,571 --> 00:44:18,489
Yes, sir.

605
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:23,160
We're turning the investigation on Yun
into an open investigation tomorrow.

606
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:26,163
I'll relay the message.

607
00:44:35,798 --> 00:44:37,132
SEONJIN REPUBLICAN PARTY DELEGATE

608
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:44,890
Call Mr. Kim.

609
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:46,642
Ma'am.

610
00:44:46,725 --> 00:44:49,853
I must make him flee the country tonight.

611
00:45:29,601 --> 00:45:32,604
KILLED MYUNG HAE-JOON,
ABDUCTED HAN NA-GYEONG

612
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:40,904
-I found him.
-What?

613
00:45:43,198 --> 00:45:45,117
I identified Mr. Kim.

614
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:48,162
It wasn't a lie.

615
00:45:48,787 --> 00:45:51,290
Mr. Kim was a part of
the Military Intelligence Command,

616
00:45:51,373 --> 00:45:53,000
and he used to be an anti-North spy.

617
00:45:55,502 --> 00:45:56,503
Are you sure?

618
00:45:58,547 --> 00:46:02,092
At first, I thought
the bomber was just bluffing,

619
00:46:02,759 --> 00:46:05,637
but I gave him the benefit of the doubt
and searched the entire network.

620
00:46:06,638 --> 00:46:08,599
Then I found him. Mr. Kim.

621
00:46:08,682 --> 00:46:11,602
Age, 38. Name, Kim Su-hyeon.

622
00:46:11,685 --> 00:46:12,853
What has he done as a spy?

623
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:16,648
In 2010, he got selected
for the anti-North spy project.

624
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:19,860
He performed the best among his peers
in every skill.

625
00:46:20,402 --> 00:46:24,031
For the anti-North spy project,
those with big builds aren't preferred.

626
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:25,324
He was perfect for the job.

627
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:29,578
2010. 2010 means...

628
00:46:29,661 --> 00:46:32,498
It's when the inter-Korean relation,
strained by the Asan Port bombings,

629
00:46:32,581 --> 00:46:36,210
suddenly improved significantly
right before the general election.

630
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:37,294
You're right.

631
00:46:37,878 --> 00:46:39,046
At the time,

632
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:42,007
our government denied the existence
of anti-North spies. At the time...

633
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:43,217
KIM SU-HYEON

634
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:45,427
...Mr. Kim had already been
sent to the North.

635
00:46:46,512 --> 00:46:48,805
He was abandoned by our government

636
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:50,432
while in dangerous circumstances.

637
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:56,230
LEE GYEONG-PYO

638
00:46:58,023 --> 00:46:59,399
KIM SU-HYEON

639
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,075
These people here

640
00:47:08,575 --> 00:47:10,577
have something in common.

641
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:16,875
They dedicated themselves
to Korea in their respective roles,

642
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:19,461
but...

643
00:47:20,837 --> 00:47:22,214
they were all abandoned.

644
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:36,019
Do you think they wanted
to get revenge on Korea?

645
00:47:38,313 --> 00:47:40,649
We should ask them in person.

646
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:46,446
Mr. Kim will do everything he can
to get help from the VIP.

647
00:47:51,785 --> 00:47:53,579
I'll leave now, ma'am.

648
00:47:55,831 --> 00:47:57,457
You can't make any mistakes.

649
00:47:57,791 --> 00:48:00,127
My political career is on the line.

650
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:01,587
Yes, ma'am.

651
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:46,340
I'm here.

652
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:49,718
Where are you, Mr. Kim?

653
00:48:56,308 --> 00:48:58,435
I will go and escort you.

654
00:49:53,365 --> 00:49:54,241
Check him out.

655
00:52:39,447 --> 00:52:41,241
Get him.

656
00:53:34,628 --> 00:53:38,089
Mr. President,
we have succeeded in arresting Mr. Kim.

657
00:53:43,845 --> 00:53:44,971
Thank you.

658
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:48,183
We arrested Mr. Kim thanks to you.

659
00:53:56,191 --> 00:53:57,442
I'll give you a chance

660
00:53:58,443 --> 00:54:00,195
to prove your innocence.

661
00:54:11,539 --> 00:54:13,625
If you are innocent,

662
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:16,920
would you become a trap for us?

663
00:54:18,964 --> 00:54:21,800
A trap to catch the mastermind
behind the bombing.

664
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:28,056
It couldn't have been easy.

665
00:54:28,139 --> 00:54:31,101
Did you believe I was innocent
from the start?

666
00:54:33,228 --> 00:54:35,355
Ever since you saved yourself

667
00:54:36,272 --> 00:54:39,359
from my trap of an open investigation.

668
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:06,720
First, I'd like to ask
for your understanding.

669
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:09,514
There was a reason why the Blue House

670
00:55:09,597 --> 00:55:13,768
decided not to make a statement
about the conspired military coup

671
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:18,231
led by Army Chief of Staff Eun Hui-jeong
reported by the media yesterday.

672
00:55:22,235 --> 00:55:24,529
Some of the people
that plotted the coup d'etat...

673
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:28,950
were accomplices of the bomber
of the National Assembly Building.

674
00:55:29,034 --> 00:55:30,910
-Mr. Kim.
-Mr. Kim.

675
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:33,496
-Mr. Kim!
-I have a question.

676
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:36,583
Then are you saying
those involved in the coup d'etat

677
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:37,917
were behind the bombing?

678
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:40,503
Was the military involved in the bombing?

679
00:55:42,255 --> 00:55:45,800
While this is a time
where all things are possible,

680
00:55:45,884 --> 00:55:49,929
it is also a sensitive time where
we must refrain from making assumptions.

681
00:55:53,433 --> 00:55:54,642
However,

682
00:55:55,393 --> 00:55:59,147
we will share with you the progress made
with the investigation today.

683
00:56:02,233 --> 00:56:05,528
Kim Su-hyeon, also known as Mr. Kim,
who is believed to be

684
00:56:05,612 --> 00:56:07,697
one of the masterminds behind the bombing

685
00:56:09,074 --> 00:56:13,244
was arrested immediately before
he fled the country

686
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:17,665
by the NIS Terrorism Task Force
and the Joint Investigation Team.

687
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:28,968
As one of the main people
behind the bombing was arrested,

688
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:33,890
we believe we are a step closer
to the truth about the bombing.

689
00:56:36,142 --> 00:56:37,102
Here you go.

690
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:45,902
Every time there is progress
in the investigation,

691
00:56:45,985 --> 00:56:48,363
the Blue House will share it
with you quickly and precisely

692
00:56:48,446 --> 00:56:50,448
to satisfy the people's right to know,

693
00:56:50,532 --> 00:56:53,535
while doing its best
to create a transparent government

694
00:56:53,618 --> 00:56:55,453
that communicates with its people.

695
00:57:02,752 --> 00:57:05,463
The Blue House will do everything possible

696
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:07,882
-to settle the coup d'etat...
-Now the media

697
00:57:07,966 --> 00:57:11,719
won't be able to say the Blue House
is concealing information, right?

698
00:57:11,803 --> 00:57:13,263
You never know.

699
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:18,309
The number of views is more important
than the number of subscribers.

700
00:57:18,935 --> 00:57:22,564
Some could criticize
that the government is all show

701
00:57:22,897 --> 00:57:26,359
as it released a statement
when there hasn't been any progress

702
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:28,069
in the investigation this afternoon.

703
00:57:30,321 --> 00:57:34,576
How were you able to stay
at the Blue House for over a decade?

704
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:40,540
You can't survive elsewhere
once you get used to this battlefield.

705
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:43,460
You'll get too bored.

706
00:57:43,543 --> 00:57:44,752
Bored?

707
00:57:55,096 --> 00:57:56,389
I have nothing else to give you.

708
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:01,978
This is nice.

709
00:58:12,363 --> 00:58:14,574
President Park is a very weird person.

710
00:58:15,116 --> 00:58:16,451
Why?

711
00:58:16,576 --> 00:58:19,954
Isn't he whom you were looking for?
Someone who knows how to win.

712
00:58:20,705 --> 00:58:21,789
That's right.

713
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:25,460
Until now,

714
00:58:26,169 --> 00:58:29,756
I thought politics was all about winning.

715
00:58:30,298 --> 00:58:32,258
That there was a clear-cut
winner and loser,

716
00:58:33,259 --> 00:58:36,804
and that the winner takes it all.
A world monopolized by the winner.

717
00:58:37,931 --> 00:58:39,807
That was what I believed.

718
00:58:39,891 --> 00:58:42,602
What about now? Has it changed?

719
00:58:44,312 --> 00:58:45,855
President Park's politics...

720
00:58:47,857 --> 00:58:49,192
is different.

721
00:58:52,445 --> 00:58:56,199
He is always the winner, but it's weird.

722
00:58:57,784 --> 00:58:59,494
No one loses,

723
00:59:00,078 --> 00:59:02,288
including Chief An last time

724
00:59:03,081 --> 00:59:04,832
and Assemblywoman Yun.

725
00:59:09,087 --> 00:59:10,255
Secretary Han,

726
00:59:12,632 --> 00:59:16,052
do you still think he isn't qualified
to be the next President?

727
00:59:16,803 --> 00:59:17,845
Let's not...

728
00:59:19,597 --> 00:59:20,640
talk about that.

729
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:22,892
If it's President Park,

730
00:59:24,352 --> 00:59:25,728
wouldn't it be possible?

731
00:59:27,897 --> 00:59:29,232
A different government

732
00:59:30,775 --> 00:59:33,111
and a different Korea that you

733
00:59:34,654 --> 00:59:35,738
and President Yang Jin-man

734
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:38,950
dreamed of.

735
00:59:42,245 --> 00:59:43,955
Can't we hope for it again?

736
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:48,918
Must I, at this age,

737
00:59:51,671 --> 00:59:53,548
dream of such things again?

738
00:59:56,259 --> 00:59:58,011
The belief that it is possible to create

739
01:00:02,056 --> 01:00:05,852
a good world with a good person.

740
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:10,690
Must I put everything I have on the line
to torment myself with false hope

741
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:14,485
and ride on
that emotional rollercoaster again?

742
01:00:16,904 --> 01:00:18,656
I've already learned...

743
01:00:20,158 --> 01:00:23,369
that those fairytale endings
don't exist in real life.

744
01:00:31,961 --> 01:00:33,171
You're...

745
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:38,843
very cruel.

746
01:01:04,911 --> 01:01:06,329
I issue an executive order

747
01:01:07,538 --> 01:01:11,084
to carry out my duty
to maintain pre-existing orders.

748
01:01:11,167 --> 01:01:13,378
If you wish to issue an executive order,

749
01:01:14,003 --> 01:01:15,505
you will have to fire me.

750
01:01:16,923 --> 01:01:18,925
Wait, Secretary Han.

751
01:01:19,884 --> 01:01:21,761
Make your choice, sir.

752
01:01:28,226 --> 01:01:29,602
Secretary Cha,

753
01:01:31,354 --> 01:01:33,106
call a Cabinet meeting.

754
01:01:35,108 --> 01:01:38,111
The agenda
is the issue of an executive order.

755
01:01:40,613 --> 01:01:44,158
As of now,
Secretary Han is dismissed from his job.

756
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:47,453
Why me?

757
01:01:48,788 --> 01:01:50,957
Why did you recommend me to the President?

758
01:01:51,624 --> 01:01:54,293
Why did you bring me here when I had plans
to go back to school?

759
01:01:54,877 --> 01:01:57,588
Did something happen?

760
01:01:57,672 --> 01:02:00,299
Didn't you say I just needed to fulfill
my duties as a citizen?

761
01:02:01,342 --> 01:02:02,468
Then why...

762
01:02:03,177 --> 01:02:07,682
Why am I put in a position where
I take people's lives?

763
01:02:08,349 --> 01:02:11,394
Why?
Why do I have to do this because of you?

764
01:02:11,978 --> 01:02:12,979
Isn't the hearing

765
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:17,066
a verification process
of candidates by the National Assembly?

766
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:21,154
The opposing party
asked for a verification,

767
01:02:21,237 --> 01:02:23,698
and I just faithfully complied to it.

768
01:02:25,283 --> 01:02:26,868
Have I created a controversy

769
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:30,079
that you have to object to?

770
01:02:30,163 --> 01:02:33,166
Just to be lauded by the public,

771
01:02:34,041 --> 01:02:36,002
must I push my son into hell?

772
01:02:37,712 --> 01:02:39,589
Is that what politics is?

773
01:02:40,089 --> 01:02:42,258
Someone commits these attacks,

774
01:02:42,884 --> 01:02:46,429
and others sacrifice themselves
to stop the attacks.

775
01:02:48,389 --> 01:02:52,143
What does Korea mean to them?

776
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:56,230
Do they even think of it
as the same country?

777
01:02:58,024 --> 01:03:00,067
What kind of country is Korea...

778
01:03:01,444 --> 01:03:02,862
to you, Secretary Han?

779
01:03:36,354 --> 01:03:38,606
When you failed,

780
01:03:40,024 --> 01:03:41,567
I thought...

781
01:03:44,028 --> 01:03:46,864
we no longer had hope.

782
01:03:50,201 --> 01:03:51,702
Tell me!

783
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,502
Was I wrong?

784
01:04:24,694 --> 01:04:29,532
Did you say to join your campaign
if I decided

785
01:04:30,533 --> 01:04:31,993
you have a chance at winning?

786
01:04:34,078 --> 01:04:36,247
-Secretary Han.
-I've lived too long

787
01:04:36,330 --> 01:04:37,915
and been in politics for too long

788
01:04:38,165 --> 01:04:41,878
to be naive enough to believe
things will be different this time

789
01:04:41,961 --> 01:04:44,755
and that you'd be different.

790
01:04:47,383 --> 01:04:48,634
This place

791
01:04:49,427 --> 01:04:52,346
is hell, where nothing ends until everyone

792
01:04:52,972 --> 01:04:54,599
becomes a monster.

793
01:04:56,142 --> 01:04:57,393
Do you still plan

794
01:04:58,436 --> 01:05:01,022
to run for President and stay in politics?

795
01:05:03,482 --> 01:05:04,859
I found one person here.

796
01:05:05,985 --> 01:05:07,904
You still haven't turned into a monster.

797
01:05:13,117 --> 01:05:16,537
You were the one who taught me
about a citizen's duty.

798
01:05:17,288 --> 01:05:18,748
You taught me

799
01:05:18,831 --> 01:05:20,917
how to use my power and not be pressured

800
01:05:21,459 --> 01:05:23,044
by my position.

801
01:05:24,712 --> 01:05:27,632
Won't you help me?

802
01:05:29,884 --> 01:05:31,761
So that I won't turn into a monster.

803
01:05:33,512 --> 01:05:34,847
Help me

804
01:05:35,598 --> 01:05:36,641
sit behind that desk

805
01:05:38,059 --> 01:05:40,603
and govern this country as a civilian.

806
01:05:57,578 --> 01:05:59,372
Once the election campaign starts,

807
01:06:00,164 --> 01:06:01,749
we should do something

808
01:06:02,458 --> 01:06:04,001
about the color of your tie.

809
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:08,798
The length of your pants
needs some work as well.

810
01:06:11,092 --> 01:06:13,636
You need to look
as conservative as possible.

811
01:06:18,557 --> 01:06:20,226
Does that mean you will...

812
01:06:21,644 --> 01:06:22,853
Let's do this.

813
01:06:23,646 --> 01:06:25,147
We may be late,

814
01:06:26,232 --> 01:06:27,525
but let's try it again.

815
01:06:44,041 --> 01:06:45,626
Resident registration number.

816
01:06:45,710 --> 01:06:48,921
820517-109467.

817
01:06:49,797 --> 01:06:51,007
Kim Su-hyeon.

818
01:06:52,049 --> 01:06:54,719
Addressed as "Mr. Kim"

819
01:06:55,553 --> 01:06:56,762
or "Mr. Kim, the Tailor."

820
01:06:57,847 --> 01:06:59,265
You're incredible.

821
01:06:59,974 --> 01:07:04,353
Everyone from Assemblymen
to the Army Chief of Staff

822
01:07:05,438 --> 01:07:07,148
followed your orders blindly

823
01:07:07,231 --> 01:07:09,483
without even knowing your real name.

824
01:07:10,109 --> 01:07:11,110
Do you know why?

825
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:15,489
It was because of the VIP
who was supporting you.

826
01:07:18,492 --> 01:07:19,702
Tell me.

827
01:07:21,078 --> 01:07:22,038
Who is the VIP?

828
01:07:25,374 --> 01:07:28,002
Who is this person that is behind
the attack on the National Assembly

829
01:07:28,085 --> 01:07:31,422
and can go back and forth from North Korea
to recruit Myung Hae-joon?

830
01:07:31,964 --> 01:07:34,425
Who is this person
with immense wealth and power

831
01:07:34,508 --> 01:07:36,927
who can easily grant requests
made by anyone?

832
01:07:39,597 --> 01:07:42,558
Whose gopher are you?

833
01:07:45,978 --> 01:07:47,063
Who...

834
01:07:48,689 --> 01:07:49,690
is the VIP?

835
01:07:50,566 --> 01:07:51,650
President...

836
01:07:55,196 --> 01:07:56,447
Park Mu-jin.

837
01:08:05,873 --> 01:08:07,374
Bring him here.

838
01:08:08,709 --> 01:08:10,878
That is, if you want me to tell you

839
01:08:11,462 --> 01:08:12,463
who the VIP is.

840
01:08:14,298 --> 01:08:15,508
What?

841
01:08:16,258 --> 01:08:17,468
Until then,

842
01:08:18,385 --> 01:08:20,679
I won't say a single thing.

843
01:08:37,905 --> 01:08:40,699
Mr. Kim knows very well

844
01:08:41,492 --> 01:08:44,703
whom he needs to grab onto to survive.

845
01:08:46,497 --> 01:08:49,083
It won't be easy to make him talk.

846
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,586
MILITARY INTELLIGENCE COMMAND
KIM SU-HYEON

847
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:57,091
I thought I should report this to you.

848
01:08:57,758 --> 01:08:59,301
I don't know why,

849
01:08:59,385 --> 01:09:02,346
but he's demanding to see you.

850
01:09:07,143 --> 01:09:08,936
Why does he want

851
01:09:09,395 --> 01:09:10,604
to see me?

852
01:09:10,855 --> 01:09:14,775
He's adamant about disclosing the identity
of the VIP,

853
01:09:14,859 --> 01:09:18,445
whom we believe is the mastermind
of the attack, in front of you.

854
01:09:37,006 --> 01:09:40,134
Taking into consideration the protocol
and the current political situation,

855
01:09:40,217 --> 01:09:42,469
I understand that
this isn't an easy decision to make

856
01:09:42,553 --> 01:09:44,346
for both you and the Blue House.

857
01:09:45,097 --> 01:09:47,141
Feel free to discuss it and let me know.

858
01:09:53,189 --> 01:09:54,273
Agent Han.

859
01:10:02,865 --> 01:10:03,991
Tomorrow

860
01:10:04,533 --> 01:10:06,869
is the last day before my resignation.

861
01:10:07,786 --> 01:10:09,622
It's my last day as the Acting President.

862
01:10:12,708 --> 01:10:14,251
You might have assumed it already,

863
01:10:15,544 --> 01:10:17,296
but the secretarial staff
of the Blue House

864
01:10:19,798 --> 01:10:21,342
will most likely oppose this.

865
01:10:22,593 --> 01:10:24,053
Unnecessary speculations

866
01:10:24,136 --> 01:10:25,554
wouldn't help my election campaign.

867
01:10:29,308 --> 01:10:32,186
There's nothing I can do if they oppose.

868
01:10:34,939 --> 01:10:37,107
Yes, I understand.

869
01:10:38,150 --> 01:10:40,069
That's exactly why I should see him
right now.

870
01:10:40,569 --> 01:10:42,988
I won't discuss this with my staff.

871
01:10:43,572 --> 01:10:45,741
-Sir.
-Mr. Kang.

872
01:10:46,325 --> 01:10:48,327
Which article was it again?

873
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:55,042
"No public official
of the Security Service..."

874
01:10:56,502 --> 01:10:57,628
Article nine.

875
01:10:58,337 --> 01:11:00,297
"Shall divulge confidential information."

876
01:11:01,799 --> 01:11:02,967
Please, Mr. Kang.

877
01:11:29,034 --> 01:11:31,078
I heard that you wanted to see me.

878
01:11:32,204 --> 01:11:33,205
Why is that?

879
01:11:34,123 --> 01:11:36,792
Why did you say
that you'd only disclose it to me?

880
01:11:38,585 --> 01:11:40,129
Because you have power,

881
01:11:40,963 --> 01:11:42,589
and I need someone with power.

882
01:11:53,058 --> 01:11:54,601
Then keep your promise.

883
01:11:55,686 --> 01:11:56,729
The VIP.

884
01:11:59,481 --> 01:12:02,443
Who is the mastermind behind the attack?

885
01:12:04,361 --> 01:12:05,321
The VIP is...

886
01:12:11,493 --> 01:12:12,661
The VIP is...

887
01:12:13,579 --> 01:12:14,580
me.

888
01:12:19,084 --> 01:12:20,377
What did he say?

889
01:12:21,670 --> 01:12:23,130
It's me.

890
01:12:24,381 --> 01:12:26,258
It's no one else.

891
01:12:27,301 --> 01:12:30,179
It's me,
the person sitting in front of you.

892
01:12:38,062 --> 01:12:39,730
Are you saying that

893
01:12:39,938 --> 01:12:42,316
you single-handedly came up with
the Assembly Building bombing

894
01:12:42,858 --> 01:12:44,651
and put it into action?

895
01:12:48,197 --> 01:12:49,782
How was that possible?

896
01:12:50,532 --> 01:12:51,992
It was possible...

897
01:12:54,286 --> 01:12:56,288
because you were

898
01:12:57,331 --> 01:12:58,957
at the beginning and the end

899
01:12:59,792 --> 01:13:01,377
of the attack.

900
01:13:13,222 --> 01:13:14,348
Park Mu-jin.

901
01:13:16,225 --> 01:13:18,602
You helped complete the attack.

902
01:13:52,010 --> 01:13:53,262
What do you mean?

903
01:13:53,345 --> 01:13:55,556
How did I help complete the attack?

904
01:13:55,639 --> 01:13:59,852
That person completed the attack
through you.

905
01:14:01,103 --> 01:14:02,521
Who is this person?

906
01:14:02,729 --> 01:14:04,189
Should we request help from

907
01:14:04,273 --> 01:14:06,191
the police and prosecutors
and investigate openly?

908
01:14:06,275 --> 01:14:07,693
If it hadn't been concealed,

909
01:14:07,776 --> 01:14:09,695
it may never have happened.

910
01:14:10,654 --> 01:14:12,948
We could experience trial and error.

911
01:14:13,031 --> 01:14:16,160
Isn't all of that what we call

912
01:14:16,660 --> 01:14:17,911
history?

913
01:14:17,995 --> 01:14:19,997
