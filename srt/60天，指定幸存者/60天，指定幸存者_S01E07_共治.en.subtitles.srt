1
00:00:53,720 --> 00:01:00,727
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
PLACES AND EVENTS ARE FICTIONAL

2
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:20,580
I'd like to announce to you all that

3
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:24,167
Special Mission Troop 707
captured Myung Hae-joon,

4
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:27,295
the former commander
of the North Korean army

5
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:29,631
who claims to have committed
the National Assembly bombing,

6
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:30,965
after a shootout in Cambodia

7
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:32,675
and has transported him to Seoul.

8
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:40,099
Blue House officials stated

9
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:43,269
that Myung Hae-joon is being detained
at a facility in Seoul at the moment.

10
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,992
A joint investigative task force,

11
00:01:58,076 --> 00:02:01,037
which consists of officers
from the NIS and the DSSC,

12
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,123
will thoroughly investigate

13
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:06,084
the authenticity of the video
and find out who was behind the attack.

14
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:31,192
I didn't think

15
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:34,320
you'd recommend me
for Myung Hae-joon's interrogation.

16
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:36,781
It tells me that you still

17
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:38,950
don't believe the suspicions
I have about the attack.

18
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:40,201
Am I wrong?

19
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:45,540
Actually,

20
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:47,125
it's the opposite.

21
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:49,335
The interrogation will tell us

22
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:52,297
if North Korea was truly behind it
as he's claiming,

23
00:02:53,172 --> 00:02:54,340
or if someone else

24
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:56,467
was behind it like you said.

25
00:02:58,261 --> 00:02:59,888
Still no updates from the NIS?

26
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:02,348
When can we find out who was behind it?

27
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:04,058
Will a day be enough? Or two days?

28
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:06,144
Will Myung Hae-joon tell us the truth?

29
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:07,604
Mr. President.

30
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:19,115
I showed you all how anxious I am.

31
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:23,244
The interrogation

32
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,371
must've begun just now.

33
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:37,175
Myung Hae-joon,
the former head of the Operations Bureau

34
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:40,386
of North Korea's
Reconnaissance General Bureau.

35
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:44,807
Blah, blah, blah.

36
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,100
Jeez, there's too much stuff.

37
00:03:58,821 --> 00:03:59,906
You look better on screen.

38
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:02,408
I quite enjoyed the video.

39
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:06,871
Gosh, you tried so hard to fool us
with such complete bullshit.

40
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,962
The North Korean government did not order

41
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:17,006
the bombing
of the National Assembly Building.

42
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:18,883
Right?

43
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:20,969
The young chairman of the SAC wants

44
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:23,137
its label as a terrorist nation
to be removed

45
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:25,223
so that it can start functioning
as a normal country.

46
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:27,141
One that is internationally recognized.

47
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,021
The military reshuffle.

48
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:37,026
And I bet you couldn't accept the purge
of Choe Seo Ryong, your adoptive father,

49
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:40,989
because you didn't want to lose the honor
and social status you had been enjoying.

50
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:43,783
I'm sure you couldn't take it.

51
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:46,327
So you must've defected to Cambodia

52
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:48,079
and started planning the attack.

53
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:49,622
Why?

54
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,003
To get back

55
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:58,172
at the North Korean government
and its young leader

56
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:00,133
for deserting you and your father.

57
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:10,018
At this moment, there is only one thing
we can tell you for certain.

58
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:12,103
Since capturing him,

59
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:14,689
your approval rating has risen
to 48.5 percent,

60
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:16,232
which is the highest it's been.

61
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:18,860
Except at the very beginning,

62
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:21,321
the Yang administration never received
such a high rating.

63
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:23,990
This was achieved in just ten days.

64
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:26,075
Now, we can safely assume that the people

65
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,369
approve of you
as a legitimate interim president.

66
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,164
And Myung Hae-joon
is no longer a potential threat.

67
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:32,332
Did you all see this?

68
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:34,542
He is the most preferred
presidential candidate now.

69
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:36,919
He outranked Yun Chan-gyeong
and even Mayor Kang.

70
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,588
-If you look at this--
-Secretary Cha.

71
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:41,591
Contact the NIS.

72
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,927
Whether it's an accomplice,
a wire-puller, or the objective,

73
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:48,264
I want the officer in charge
to report directly to me in person.

74
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:51,267
You mean, the agent
who is interrogating Myung Hae-joon, sir?

75
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:53,144
Yes.

76
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:54,687
Well...

77
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,858
That will shake up
the NIS' reporting structure, sir.

78
00:05:58,941 --> 00:05:59,776
We made

79
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:03,946
a big sacrifice to capture Myung Hae-joon.

80
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,283
That

81
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,118
is all that matters to me now.

82
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:13,081
Did you want to provoke our government?

83
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:17,251
To be a force to be reckoned with
in the North Korean military?

84
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:20,505
You wanted to go against the leader
who's willing to denuclearize

85
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:22,965
and get in the way of the peace treaty
between the two Koreas.

86
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,842
That is why you planned the attack!

87
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:27,220
That's...

88
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:30,431
called "disgrace," not "peace."

89
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:34,435
Our nuclear weapons are the fruits
of all the hard work of our people.

90
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:36,354
During the famine,

91
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:39,398
our people had to shed tears

92
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:41,526
while seeing their children
starve to death.

93
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:43,194
And our soldiers were dispatched

94
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:47,198
as mercenaries to earn foreign currency
and secure supplies.

95
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:50,827
That is how our nuclear weapons were made,

96
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:55,915
and yet the Chairman is saying he will
hand them over to American imperialists

97
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:58,209
because he's blinded by capitalism.

98
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:01,462
Denuclearization?

99
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:05,216
That means he will surrender
without even fighting.

100
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,717
But we're different.

101
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:10,805
The Korean People's Army
inherited the honorable spirit

102
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:13,850
of the anti-Japanese armed struggle.

103
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:16,978
Even if it'll cost us our lives,

104
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,940
we'll never get down on our knees.

105
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:25,153
So I guess

106
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,613
you just admitted

107
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:31,993
that the North Korean government
and the Chairman of the SAC

108
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:36,205
did not order you to commit the bombing.

109
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:41,502
Who was it, then?

110
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:43,838
Who is the person

111
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:47,341
that ordered the attack,
hiding behind you?

112
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:49,594
The real mastermind.

113
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:09,363
DAY 49: GOVERNANCE
EPISODE 7

114
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:13,201
Why haven't we heard anything?
It's been a while.

115
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:17,121
This is why I said the DSC should...

116
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:20,833
I mean, this is why I said the DSSC
should interrogate Myung Hae-joon.

117
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,293
Well,

118
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:24,795
the DSSC will be taking over from here on.

119
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:27,548
We'll make him confess
that North Korea ordered the attack.

120
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:28,841
You'll make him confess?

121
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:31,594
A mere confession can't serve
as evidence in this day and age.

122
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:32,803
What will you do?

123
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:36,724
Will you coerce and torture him
if he doesn't talk?

124
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:40,311
National security precedes human rights.

125
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:41,854
Don't you know?

126
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:45,483
The DSC is still the DSC even if
it changes its name a hundred times.

127
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:48,027
Even cleaning this place
with the cleanest water won't help

128
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:50,112
as it's still run by the same people.

129
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:55,076
Those of you in the NIS
should keep your mouths shut!

130
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:59,997
Was the anti-terror law made for you guys
to illegally monitor ordinary citizens?

131
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:02,875
You should've prevented the attack!

132
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:06,629
I'll give you 12 hours.

133
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:10,258
Tell your agents to find out
who the mastermind is before time's up.

134
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:11,968
If they fail to do so,

135
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:14,971
the military will have to step in
and interrogate Myung Hae-joon.

136
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:26,023
Tell us.

137
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:30,403
Who is behind you?

138
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:36,033
You're a mere defector
without any means of livelihood.

139
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:38,953
You neither had the money
nor the technology

140
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:42,123
required to obtain and handle
all the explosives needed for the bombing.

141
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:51,007
The explosive demolition method
doesn't require a lot of explosives.

142
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:55,428
The Internet cables,
which South Korea is so proud of.

143
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:58,931
They acted as great detonating cords.

144
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:02,602
How could I know these things
if I didn't do it myself?

145
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:08,232
All you people in the South
enjoy the luxury of eating well,

146
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,693
but you're nothing after all.

147
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:15,239
And the great army of the DPRK

148
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,241
made a big mistake.

149
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:20,536
Even though the building collapsed
due to the explosion,

150
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,664
there was a survivor
in the plenary chamber.

151
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:30,379
A mere bomb attack
can't take down South Korea.

152
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:35,718
But you know what?
You'll die all alone on our soil,

153
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:38,387
after serving as the instigator's puppet.

154
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,848
You'll die a lonely death here.

155
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:50,149
Without reaping any rewards or benefits.

156
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:55,488
You people just mooch off
the American imperialists.

157
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:57,948
Don't you dare raise your voice
at this revolutionary warrior.

158
00:10:58,032 --> 00:11:00,117
I can make your National Assembly Building

159
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:02,662
go up in flames thousands of times.

160
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,538
On the day of the revolution,

161
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:07,750
I'll start by killing that lucky bastard
who survived the attack.

162
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:09,502
And you'll be next.

163
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,295
You too.

164
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:13,464
What did you just say?

165
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:19,387
The one who survived...
I mean, you will kill the survivor,

166
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,097
Assemblyman Oh Yeong-seok?

167
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:26,519
The Korean People's Army can do anything.

168
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:31,524
That is precisely why you can't be
the real culprit behind the attack.

169
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:33,859
You still don't know

170
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:36,904
the bomber made an air raid shelter

171
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:38,864
in the National Assembly Building

172
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,534
so that the survivor of the bombing,
Assemblyman Oh,

173
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:45,037
would live.

174
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:34,044
Did you say
we should change the world together?

175
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:39,592
That outcasts like us can change
the world because we're living

176
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,595
in a revolutionary era?

177
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:49,852
I'll give you my answer.

178
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:55,524
I bet the person has a connection
with Assemblyman Oh.

179
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,401
The one who plotted the attack,

180
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:59,195
using Myung Hae-joon as a puppet.

181
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,280
Hey, move.

182
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,080
That's a dangerous remark.

183
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:14,335
Do you think Myung Hae-joon knows

184
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:15,961
who the mastermind is?

185
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,839
Even if he does, he won't tell us easily.

186
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:21,759
Whoever it is, it's the only person

187
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:24,261
whom he can trust and rely on
at the moment, don't you think?

188
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:27,097
He won't betray him easily.

189
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:31,519
First, let's contact the headquarters
and find out where Myung's family is.

190
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:33,979
Whether it has to be the carrot
or the stick,

191
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:35,773
we must figure out a way to make him talk.

192
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,403
-Hurry!
-What's going on?

193
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:45,658
God damn it.

194
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:50,788
Shit.

195
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:52,122
What...

196
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,043
He's dead.

197
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,128
What's going on?

198
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:02,925
What happened?

199
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,343
He's dead.

200
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:05,594
How, all of a sudden?

201
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:09,265
He was already dead
when we came to pick up his mess tray.

202
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:13,644
Damn it.

203
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,695
I can't believe how careless
the military intel command is.

204
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:24,238
What did you just say?

205
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,036
Lock down all exits.
No one can leave the building. Hurry.

206
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,121
Yes, ma'am.

207
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:34,582
You take care of the rear exit.
You, the main entrance. Hurry.

208
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:35,791
-Yes, sir.
-Quick.

209
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:16,373
He's in there, right?

210
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,168
Yes, he's talking with Ms. Jeong.

211
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:23,213
How's that possible?

212
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:26,884
Myung Hae-joon was detained
in our military intel command's facility.

213
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:28,469
How could this happen?

214
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:30,554
What do we say to the people?

215
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:32,848
Nothing. We cannot make this public yet.

216
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:36,101
Until we track down who did it
and find out what happened...

217
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,316
It's neither for your approval rating
nor for your political career.

218
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:44,818
Our military and intel agencies.

219
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,696
This could shake
the foundations of this country.

220
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:52,743
Perhaps...

221
00:15:56,705 --> 00:16:00,000
Someone more frightening than North Korea
may have been behind the bombing.

222
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:15,516
Based on what we can see around his mouth,

223
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:17,726
I'm assuming he was poisoned

224
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,436
through food.

225
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:24,108
We can't say anything for certain
until we have the results from the NFS.

226
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,403
But for now, yes.

227
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:31,073
It must've been very painful.

228
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,409
Every single finger is severely abraded.

229
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:06,150
Pain cannot absolve him from his crimes.

230
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:09,987
I'll check the security footage first

231
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,197
to see if the culprit's face
was caught on camera.

232
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,668
What is it? What's the matter?

233
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:29,006
Myung Hae-joon left a message for us,
a dying message.

234
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:32,885
DYING MESSAGE: WORDS OF
A MURDER VICTIM JUST BEFORE DEATH

235
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:37,222
E, H, O?

236
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:39,016
What does this mean?

237
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,769
These are not letters of the alphabet.

238
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:44,396
This is Korean.

239
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,318
"Tae,

240
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:51,987
ik"?

241
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:58,494
It started with

242
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:01,246
the bombing.

243
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:04,917
The President and the Administration
were annihilated,

244
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:07,461
and now the bomber has been murdered.

245
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:08,629
And it happened

246
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:11,465
on the most elite
intelligence agents' watch.

247
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:16,386
We have no idea
who the next target will be.

248
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,641
What if the Blue House is next?

249
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:23,977
What happens then?

250
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:52,631
Mr. Han.

251
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:56,009
I invited him.

252
00:18:57,678 --> 00:19:00,264
I asked him to come back
to the Blue House.

253
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:01,348
From now on,

254
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,934
he will be the Policy Advisor.

255
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:11,066
We have only one option now.

256
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:14,736
What we need right now is the cabinet.

257
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,239
A nonparty cabinet.

258
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:19,992
NONPARTY CABINET: A CABINET
THAT DOESN'T BELONG TO A CERTAIN PARTY

259
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:21,410
A nonparty cabinet?

260
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:23,036
A nonparty cabinet is a neutral cabinet

261
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,456
that consists of Ministers appointed
by the ruling and the opposition party.

262
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:28,750
What the terrorist organization wants

263
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:31,461
might have been clear from the beginning.

264
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:34,423
The collapse of Korea's state system.

265
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:37,676
Their ultimate goal must be PE.

266
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:39,469
The Presidential Election.

267
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:43,765
Confusing the presidential election
and causing internal conflicts

268
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,767
is probably what they want.

269
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:50,439
We need to establish a firm government

270
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:53,942
and prove to them
that Korea is still on its feet.

271
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:58,739
We need to show them
they can't get anything from attacking us.

272
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:02,868
This is the only way we can offend them
and defend ourselves.

273
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:06,163
Having the opposition party involved
in the state affairs

274
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:08,457
will reduce unnecessary
political conflicts.

275
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:13,420
And it will calm down
the confused people too.

276
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:18,217
In 2011, when Greece was
in an economic crisis,

277
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:22,179
they settled the government
through a nonparty cabinet too.

278
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:33,273
-Mr. Cha.
-Yes, sir.

279
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,693
Let's start with making
a nonparty cabinet first.

280
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:40,447
Please organize a cabinet
with the Ministers...

281
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:41,865
that are related to the election.

282
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:45,035
JUSTICE, NATIONAL DEFENSE

283
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:46,870
The Ministries
that deals with the election

284
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:49,456
are Interior and Safety,
Strategy and Finance, Justice,

285
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:53,210
and National Defense
that will redeem the security vacuum.

286
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:55,921
The personnel department
is getting recommendations.

287
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:57,464
MINISTER OF PERSONNEL

288
00:20:57,547 --> 00:20:58,715
Here you are.

289
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:03,887
Strategy and Finance.

290
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:05,013
Interior and Safety.

291
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,390
Strategy and Finance.

292
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:08,850
Ministry of Justice,
Ministry of the Interior and Safety.

293
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,561
Ministry of National Defense

294
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:12,646
OH YEONG-SEOK

295
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:13,855
MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE

296
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,232
This goes here.

297
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,279
"Undercover agent"?

298
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:22,990
He should have lived more righteously.

299
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:25,158
The Chief of Civil Affairs
will verify the candidates.

300
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:26,827
Thank goodness.

301
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:31,248
Then we will discuss the verified
candidates with the opposing party.

302
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:33,709
WRITTEN REPORT FOR THE PRESIDENT

303
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:34,793
MINISTER CANDIDATES

304
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:36,712
MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE

305
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:39,298
Will Assemblyman Oh accept it?

306
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:45,429
He even turned down
the position of Prime Minister.

307
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:47,889
He is not politically ambitious.

308
00:21:48,598 --> 00:21:49,891
He will take the offer.

309
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,019
You sound sure.

310
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:54,479
Do you know Assemblyman Oh that well?

311
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:58,150
It's not that he's not ambitious,
he just wants to hide it.

312
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:00,402
He knows what people are like.

313
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:02,904
It's the best virtue
a star politician can have.

314
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:07,117
He turned down
the position of Prime Minister,

315
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:10,370
but the position
of Minister of National Defense?

316
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:12,622
Why?

317
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:14,458
Without the frame
of a miraculous survivor,

318
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:17,961
Assemblyman Oh is nothing
but an independent new assemblyman.

319
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:19,963
He must know that well himself.

320
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:23,050
The Prime Minister is responsible
for government administration,

321
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:25,677
which is a lot of pressure,
but Minister of National Defense isn't.

322
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:27,888
In a way, it's the best position for him

323
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:30,932
to use his area of expertise
and settle into national politics.

324
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:33,435
I'm sure he'll accept it.

325
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:38,023
Mr. President.

326
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:40,984
It's time to interview
the Minister candidates.

327
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:42,110
Oh, right.

328
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:48,658
Hopefully you were right, Mr. Cha.

329
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:51,745
He will be of great help to us.

330
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:03,298
Thanks.

331
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:04,674
I thought

332
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:08,303
you and I were one team.

333
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:12,349
I thought I was the only one
who knows you well.

334
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:15,352
But you always surprise me.

335
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,107
You're overthinking this.

336
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:24,486
I was just embarrassed
to say I was coming back.

337
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:26,571
I was afraid I wasn't acting my age.

338
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:29,699
Are you back
because of the Presidential Election?

339
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:34,579
Do you want to make Acting President Park
our candidate?

340
00:23:35,413 --> 00:23:37,290
-Is that why--
-Do you still believe

341
00:23:37,874 --> 00:23:38,875
that an election

342
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:41,962
can change the world?

343
00:23:44,005 --> 00:23:46,424
We can merely change
the owner of the Blue House.

344
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:51,680
To begin the meaningless fight again,
my life is...

345
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:54,141
too short.

346
00:23:56,977 --> 00:23:59,104
Then why...

347
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:03,150
President Park said I should finish

348
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:04,901
what I have started.

349
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:07,612
Have you

350
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:10,198
found the next Presidential candidate?

351
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:13,994
Is it Assemblyman Oh?

352
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:16,037
Am I right?

353
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:20,333
Is he the person you've been looking for?
The person who knows how to win.

354
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:49,654
It's Myung Hae-joon's dying message.

355
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:52,115
It's a list of people with the name Tae-ik

356
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:53,658
who were also involved

357
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:56,912
in illegal anti-government activities
or violated National Security Law.

358
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:01,041
See if anyone with that name
stayed in Cambodia

359
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:02,626
while Myung Hae-joon was staying there.

360
00:25:03,501 --> 00:25:04,502
"Tae-ik."

361
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:08,381
We need a list of people whose last name
is Tae and first name starts with Ik too.

362
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:11,009
Is this a dying message
or twenty one questions?

363
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:13,011
Don't we have other clues?

364
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:17,474
This is basically
like finding a needle in a haystack.

365
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:20,685
Let's find him.

366
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:22,646
We should find him.

367
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:25,106
We will try until we find him.

368
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:35,951
You said you wanted to work here
for a long time, right?

369
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:43,667
Did I just go over the line
and I need to quit?

370
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:47,504
We failed to prevent the bombing.

371
00:25:47,837 --> 00:25:50,131
And the bomber died
during the interrogation.

372
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:55,178
Do you think people will still trust us?

373
00:25:57,264 --> 00:25:59,266
Wouldn't they think
their taxes are wasted?

374
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,646
Tae Ik-joon.

375
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:07,565
Tae Ik-hyeon.

376
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:12,737
It will take a long time.

377
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:14,656
Go get some food.

378
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:18,118
Don't eat things like gimbap or
a sandwich.

379
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:19,995
Have some warm soup.

380
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:33,758
Tae-ik.

381
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:36,261
Whose name could it be?

382
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:38,888
He must be related to this, right?

383
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:41,683
During the whole interrogation,
Myung Hae-joon seemed confident

384
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:43,435
as if he had someone who has his back.

385
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:46,896
The moment he died, he felt betrayed...

386
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:49,107
and wanted to accuse him, desperately.

387
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:54,195
For now, this is the only
and the most important clue we've got.

388
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:59,826
I'll report all this.

389
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:02,746
I'll report the documents
about Assemblyman Oh too.

390
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:08,793
Wait, Han-mo.

391
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:18,011
Someone in our agency...

392
00:27:21,264 --> 00:27:23,266
knew there was going to be a bombing...

393
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:27,812
at the National Assembly building.

394
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:29,022
What?

395
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:36,196
What are you talking about?

396
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:52,170
How... Are you kidding me right now?

397
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:53,588
He should've told me sooner!

398
00:27:57,258 --> 00:27:58,426
We could've stopped this.

399
00:27:59,135 --> 00:28:00,261
He would've been disregarded.

400
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:05,975
Jun-o was devoted
to this agency and his country.

401
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:07,102
If he had known,

402
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:09,729
he would've reported it.

403
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:12,857
So you're saying

404
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:15,819
that

405
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:19,864
someone in our agency
is in league with the bomber.

406
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:23,410
Is this even possible?

407
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:25,245
What about the bombing itself?

408
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:27,872
Did anyone assume it was possible?

409
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:33,336
Everything that happened since that day

410
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:37,590
all should not have happened.

411
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:47,851
No one...

412
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:51,271
should be blindly trusted anymore.

413
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:04,117
Han-mo, a word?

414
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:06,327
Yes, sir.

415
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:12,542
Aren't you coming?

416
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:25,889
You.

417
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:28,475
Do you not trust me either?

418
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:33,521
Why would you suddenly ask such a thing?

419
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:35,273
The Blue House is requesting you.

420
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,485
The Blue House?

421
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:44,866
He wants a direct report from
the agent who conducted the interview.

422
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:46,868
He being the Acting President.

423
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:49,162
I see.

424
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:51,831
Am I being reprimanded

425
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:54,292
or is this their way
of telling me I'm fired?

426
00:29:58,421 --> 00:29:59,464
Why don't you

427
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:04,093
take a sniff

428
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:06,387
of the air up there?

429
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:11,559
Sure.

430
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:12,769
Agent Jeong,

431
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:15,438
the President is waiting for you.

432
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:25,073
I'm glad you're debriefing
the President in person.

433
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:28,827
You can tell him about the suspicions
we have regarding Assemblyman Oh.

434
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:32,163
He's summoning me to hear about
what we have on Myung Hae-joon.

435
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:34,374
Will he believe me

436
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:36,125
if I tell him about Mr. Oh?

437
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:38,127
Han-mo,

438
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:40,547
we have evidence.

439
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:43,925
Evidence that can't be refuted.

440
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:03,820
Thank you for coming Agent Jeong.

441
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:07,282
Due to the nature of this case,
I wanted to hear it from you.

442
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,325
Do you have any leads?

443
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:11,369
Yes, I believe so.

444
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:12,954
-This way.
-Yes, sir.

445
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:15,123
I'm glad to hear that.

446
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:46,237
It's a relief.

447
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:51,576
I had no idea you'd be here too.

448
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:59,626
His help was crucial
regarding the capture of Myung Hae-joon.

449
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:01,544
Moreover,

450
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,713
he's an actual victim of the bombing.

451
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:12,680
So what happened to Myung Hae-joon?

452
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:15,099
Right.

453
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:18,686
Thallium was found in the food he ate.

454
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:22,774
Someone poisoned Myung Hae-joon

455
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:25,735
to shut him up.

456
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:28,988
Does this mean
that whoever poisoned Myung Hae-joon

457
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:31,741
is involved with
the National Assembly Building bomber?

458
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:35,119
We haven't been able to prove that yet.

459
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:38,289
However, we are keeping
every option open as we investigate.

460
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:44,504
Did he leave any messages before he died

461
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:46,589
about the bomber or his accomplice?

462
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:55,974
I'm sorry, sir.
He refused to talk until the end,

463
00:32:57,016 --> 00:32:59,143
and we weren't able to get any
solid evidence.

464
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:02,814
But you said you had a lead earlier.

465
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:20,665
All I can tell you right now

466
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:23,960
is that

467
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:26,629
we will hunt the bomber or bombers

468
00:33:27,755 --> 00:33:30,675
and serve justice to those involved.

469
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,095
That I can promise.

470
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:41,811
All right.

471
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:46,190
Please keep me posted then.
I'll be waiting.

472
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:13,009
Did the debriefing go well?

473
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:16,179
Yes, sir.

474
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:18,890
Here are the list of candidates
for the new nonparty cabinet.

475
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:22,852
Please send over the files needed
to verify their backgrounds.

476
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:24,395
MATERIAL USED TO VERIFY CANDIDATES

477
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:26,773
-Sure.
-Have a good day then.

478
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:33,905
What do you mean you couldn't debrief him?

479
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:37,784
Here. Look and you'll see why.

480
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:45,083
MINISTER OF NATIONAL DEFENSE:
OH YEONG-SEOK

481
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:46,709
Minister of National Defense?

482
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:55,051
Assemblyman Oh.

483
00:34:56,552 --> 00:34:59,347
Thank you for accepting the position
of Minister of National Defense.

484
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,603
I'm grateful for the opportunity
to dedicate myself to this country.

485
00:35:09,982 --> 00:35:13,736
I requested the NIS
for background checks on the candidates.

486
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:17,073
The Secretary of Political Affairs
is consulting the assemblymen.

487
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:23,162
Will they, and I mean the opposing party,
accept this proposal?

488
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:26,082
The presidential election is approaching.

489
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:28,084
They won't like it.

490
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:33,965
SEONJIN REPUBLICAN PARTY

491
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:35,633
Let's go to the Blue House.

492
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:37,718
I need to speak
with President Park directly.

493
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,561
What on earth is on Ms. Yun's mind.

494
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:48,354
She came running over to the Blue House--

495
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:50,189
It's not a positive sign.

496
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:52,942
The nonparty cabinet
is for the presidential election.

497
00:35:53,025 --> 00:35:55,903
It's to stabilize the nation.
It shouldn't be a political agenda.

498
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:59,407
Students should be good to their parents
and mainly study their textbooks.

499
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:00,700
Sorry?

500
00:36:00,783 --> 00:36:04,370
What seems natural, reasonable,
and desirable has never happened

501
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:06,998
during my two years
serving in the Blue House.

502
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:11,961
Please withdraw your proposal
for a nonparty cabinet.

503
00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:23,181
To stabilize the government,

504
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:26,309
I'm asking the opposing party
to participate in the administration.

505
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:29,645
You're sharing the power with us
as a means to shut us up.

506
00:36:30,771 --> 00:36:32,690
I doubt you have any to spare though

507
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:35,902
since forming a nonparty cabinet
is above your pay grade.

508
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:37,570
The power to appoint ministers

509
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:40,531
lies with the head of the administration.

510
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:44,410
And currently, I am the head
of this nation's administration, ma'am.

511
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,205
As you know,

512
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:50,291
the Constitution states
that all the power and duties

513
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:53,419
of the Korean president
is passed on to the acting President.

514
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:57,173
I'm sure you're aware
of what experts in constitutional law say.

515
00:36:57,256 --> 00:36:59,300
The acting President's authorities are

516
00:36:59,425 --> 00:37:01,552
only to be executed
to maintain status quo.

517
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,597
Do you know why?

518
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,642
It's because you weren't elected
to wield this power.

519
00:37:10,686 --> 00:37:13,272
People call it the democratic legitimacy.

520
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:16,943
A nonparty cabinet is needed
to ensure a successful

521
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,111
presidential election.

522
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,697
As the man responsible for this nation,

523
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:23,991
I plan on performing all my duties.

524
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:27,328
Not a single passage

525
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:29,455
in our Constitution states

526
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:32,625
that an acting President's role
must be kept to a minimum.

527
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:36,003
Then let me come up with a legal ground.

528
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:39,131
Withdraw your proposal
for a nonparty cabinet,

529
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:41,926
or I plan to have you impeached.

530
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:47,848
A government official's abuse of power
is definitely grounds for one.

531
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:54,021
Is an impeachment even possible?

532
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:55,940
To impeach a president,
two-thirds majority vote

533
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:58,109
of the National Assembly is needed
and that's over 200.

534
00:37:58,192 --> 00:38:00,820
The number of survivors don't make up 200.

535
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,822
It's not impossible though.

536
00:38:02,905 --> 00:38:05,491
President Park
is technically only a Minister.

537
00:38:05,574 --> 00:38:07,743
Regulations for a Cabinet member
can be applied

538
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:09,829
which lowers the number of votes

539
00:38:09,912 --> 00:38:11,372
to only half.

540
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:13,082
Only 150 votes will do.

541
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:16,794
There are 135 members
in Seonjin Republican Party

542
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:19,964
a dozen from minor parties or
without a party.

543
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:22,633
On our side...
Jeez, I'm getting a headache.

544
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:24,677
It's what Ms. Yun wants.

545
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:28,431
She wants the press to eat up
the news about his possible impeachment.

546
00:38:28,514 --> 00:38:30,433
The scandal
will freeze the administration,

547
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:32,601
stop the nonparty cabinet from happening,

548
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:34,645
and put a dent

549
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:36,647
in President Park's strong reputation.

550
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:38,190
Bingo.

551
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:40,985
So it all begins with
the press yapping about it.

552
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:45,031
Yes, it's me. Can you hold?

553
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:49,535
Reporter Jo, so...

554
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:55,458
There's a rumor about you
making a move to remove President Park.

555
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:56,375
Is that true?

556
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:59,962
Once Seonjin Republican Party
comes to an internal decision,

557
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:02,131
I will introduce a motion to impeach.

558
00:39:02,214 --> 00:39:03,424
Do you believe that

559
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:06,010
implementing a nonparty cabinet
is grounds for impeachment?

560
00:39:06,093 --> 00:39:07,928
An acting President
isn't an elected position.

561
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:11,307
It is an interim position
which is only given the authority

562
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:13,309
to maintain status quo of our government.

563
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:17,063
A cabinet shake-up is far from that.

564
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:20,024
Acting President Park
is using this time of chaos

565
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:21,984
to abuse his power in office.

566
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:25,237
How sure are you
of the motion being approved?

567
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:27,448
Korea's National Assembly may have fallen,

568
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:31,243
but we cannot let our democracy
be ruined as well.

569
00:39:32,161 --> 00:39:33,662
That'll be all.

570
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:35,956
-Ma'am, wait.
-One more thing!

571
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:38,084
Could you please answer more questions?

572
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:40,669
-Could you elaborate?
-What is your next plan?

573
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:41,670
Ma'am, just one more.

574
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:44,382
-Ma'am!
-Many have been asking.

575
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:45,674
Please give us your opinion.

576
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,468
Ma'am, just one more word!

577
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:49,261
SEONJIN REPUBLICAN PARTY
AD HOC COMMITTEE

578
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:51,013
MOTION TO DISMISS PRESIDENT PARK

579
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:56,143
"Korea's National Assembly
may have fallen,

580
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:59,522
but we cannot let our democracy
be ruined as well."

581
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:09,365
I support you, Ms. Yun.

582
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:12,952
An acting President
reshuffling the Cabinet?

583
00:40:13,035 --> 00:40:14,578
It must be stopped.

584
00:40:15,162 --> 00:40:16,705
Just look at the state we're in.

585
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:18,040
Members of the National Assembly

586
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:20,751
are stationed here
because they have nowhere to go.

587
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:23,838
A proper hearing seems too overwhelming.

588
00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:26,799
Appointing people in positions
without a proper verification?

589
00:40:26,882 --> 00:40:28,926
The Blue House has crossed the line.

590
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:30,136
Therefore,

591
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:33,055
it is our duty to keep it in check.

592
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:34,515
I had no idea

593
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:37,768
that you and I shared the same views.

594
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:39,145
Protecting our nation's democracy

595
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:41,522
is a job for all members
of the National Assembly.

596
00:40:47,194 --> 00:40:48,195
It is my goal

597
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:51,490
to lay a bridge between
the two opposing parties.

598
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:05,963
Assemblyman Park of
Seonjin Republican Party has asked

599
00:41:06,046 --> 00:41:09,633
for subway line number seven
to be extended to Sapyeong Station.

600
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,970
Assemblyman Na of Seonjin Republican Party

601
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:16,223
has officially requested that you approve
of the redevelopment of Mirinae District.

602
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:18,142
Assemblywoman Kim of
Seonjin Republican Party...

603
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:20,311
Ms. Jang, when did you switch parties?

604
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:27,526
I asked you a question.

605
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:29,945
Why are all the proposals

606
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:31,989
only from the opposing party?

607
00:41:32,072 --> 00:41:33,657
Does the city of Seoul have tax to spare?

608
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:37,495
You just said that
you wish to lay a bridge between...

609
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:42,333
-Ms. Jang.
-Yes?

610
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:51,592
Please tell me you're just stupid

611
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:54,386
and that

612
00:41:56,388 --> 00:41:57,556
you aren't rebelling.

613
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:02,269
Will President Park withdraw his proposal?

614
00:42:02,811 --> 00:42:05,105
They say that anyone
can be in position of power,

615
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:07,399
but some are just not born
with political DNA.

616
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:08,359
Sorry?

617
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:09,944
University professors.

618
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:12,488
Once you get used to teaching others,

619
00:42:12,571 --> 00:42:14,281
you might withstand punches

620
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:15,950
but not finger-pointing.

621
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:17,409
You have no tolerance for it.

622
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:21,956
We'll accuse him of abusing his power
and his self-righteous leadership.

623
00:42:22,122 --> 00:42:25,125
The press will paint him as the man
who crippled the National Assembly.

624
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:27,086
President Park can't endure it.

625
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,172
If he's no match to you, why even bother

626
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:32,383
with a pick-off throw?

627
00:42:32,466 --> 00:42:33,467
Isn't it too early?

628
00:42:35,594 --> 00:42:37,304
He's not the one I threw it at.

629
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:39,056
During that Baengnyeong Battle,

630
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:41,725
where were you?

631
00:42:43,435 --> 00:42:45,604
When me and my fellow soldiers

632
00:42:46,313 --> 00:42:48,774
were facing bullets due
to an unreasonable command,

633
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:52,570
when the ones who survived

634
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:55,489
were suffering in pain

635
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,576
of the wounds
and the people's indifference,

636
00:43:00,452 --> 00:43:02,329
where exactly were you?

637
00:43:03,455 --> 00:43:05,583
-Mr. Oh--
-You were a member

638
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:08,877
of the National Defense Committee.

639
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:12,548
However, when we asked for your help,

640
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:15,259
you were never present.

641
00:43:16,802 --> 00:43:17,803
Not even once.

642
00:43:20,055 --> 00:43:22,099
In this nation,

643
00:43:23,475 --> 00:43:25,853
you've never once been an underdog.

644
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:29,356
That's why,

645
00:43:30,357 --> 00:43:32,484
in the nation I hope to live in,

646
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:36,572
there is no place for you.

647
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:42,745
Oh Yeong-seok

648
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:45,205
is more dangerous
than I initially thought.

649
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:49,335
It's hard to guess
what that man is thinking.

650
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:53,631
A politician whose moves are
hard to calculate is dangerous.

651
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:57,885
So to have someone that dangerous
beside the highly praised President Park

652
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:00,512
is even more threatening.

653
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:04,933
SEONJIN REPUBLICAN PARTY COMMITTEE

654
00:44:06,852 --> 00:44:09,688
DISCUSSION REGARDING
ACTING PRESIDENT PARK'S IMPEACHMENT

655
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:20,658
Members of the majority party
have disclosed their stance.

656
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:25,788
The majority party

657
00:44:26,372 --> 00:44:29,667
just handed in
an objection statement regarding

658
00:44:30,709 --> 00:44:31,543
the nonparty cabinet.

659
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:35,381
On what grounds?

660
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:39,885
"Governing the authority

661
00:44:39,968 --> 00:44:42,137
of an acting President
who wasn't elected into position

662
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:45,766
is the underlying spirit of democracy."

663
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:48,060
That's just a justification.

664
00:44:48,143 --> 00:44:49,687
Here's why they're really against it.

665
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:52,439
Look who's on
the majority party's contingency committee

666
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:53,982
that was launched today.

667
00:44:58,404 --> 00:44:59,947
The head of the committee

668
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:02,282
is the former
Deputy Mayor of State Affairs of Seoul.

669
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:05,536
Its spokesperson is the former
Deputy Mayor of Administration of Seoul.

670
00:45:05,744 --> 00:45:09,081
Heading the Reinforcement Committee
is the former Bureau Director of Seoul.

671
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:12,835
Now that's a pretty lineup.

672
00:45:12,918 --> 00:45:15,129
They're all Mayor Kang's people.

673
00:45:18,924 --> 00:45:20,884
Hurrah for democracy.

674
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:23,762
A nonparty cabinet is another name

675
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:25,806
for coalition government
with the opposing party.

676
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:26,890
CONTINGENCY COMMITTEE

677
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:30,477
The majority party and the Blue House
should work on recreating the government,

678
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:32,855
but the nonparty cabinet
accommodates the opposing party.

679
00:45:32,938 --> 00:45:34,189
Why?

680
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:37,109
That's because the acting President

681
00:45:37,192 --> 00:45:40,320
isn't a member
of the Democratic Justice Party!

682
00:45:49,955 --> 00:45:51,081
Please withdraw your proposal

683
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:53,542
for a nonparty cabinet.

684
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:58,964
All party members who would be leading it
are against the idea.

685
00:45:59,548 --> 00:46:01,550
If the members of
the Seonjin Republican Party

686
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:03,844
decide to introduce
a motion for impeachment,

687
00:46:04,553 --> 00:46:06,930
the public who are already exhausted

688
00:46:07,556 --> 00:46:09,725
will hold you responsible for the chaos.

689
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:12,394
Are you suggesting

690
00:46:12,769 --> 00:46:16,148
that we let them see the Blue House
cave in to the National Assembly?

691
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:19,735
We can't let it reach an impeachment.

692
00:46:19,818 --> 00:46:21,737
Please withdraw your proposal.

693
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:23,864
You shouldn't, sir.

694
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:28,035
The majority and the opposing party
will never fear you again.

695
00:46:28,827 --> 00:46:31,538
The same goes for
the public officials in administration.

696
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:35,626
If it doesn't fall through,
with the Minister position still vacant,

697
00:46:36,251 --> 00:46:38,670
your leadership might
also lose its authority.

698
00:46:38,754 --> 00:46:41,423
It won't just end
with a chaotic government then.

699
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:43,634
It'll become a moribund
or a vegetative state.

700
00:46:43,717 --> 00:46:45,677
Meaning,
the administration will become paralyzed.

701
00:47:04,696 --> 00:47:07,032
I only wanted one thing from the start.

702
00:47:08,867 --> 00:47:10,077
I wanted...

703
00:47:10,577 --> 00:47:12,663
the presidential election
to be held as planned.

704
00:47:15,707 --> 00:47:17,334
That's why a non-party cabinet was needed.

705
00:47:20,879 --> 00:47:21,838
However,

706
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:25,050
now I only have two options.

707
00:47:26,426 --> 00:47:27,261
Impeachment

708
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:29,304
or...

709
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:32,432
paralysis in state affairs.

710
00:47:37,729 --> 00:47:38,605
Do I...

711
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:43,402
have to make this decision?

712
00:48:52,679 --> 00:48:53,722
What do you think...

713
00:48:55,974 --> 00:48:57,476
President Park will choose to do?

714
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:00,687
As Chief Presidential Secretary,

715
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:03,023
you must know him best.

716
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:05,901
Well...

717
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:10,614
It isn't the outcome I hope for,

718
00:49:14,242 --> 00:49:16,203
but he won't be able to
push ahead to the end.

719
00:49:21,541 --> 00:49:25,754
It's his first time having so many people
opposing him like this.

720
00:49:26,838 --> 00:49:29,424
He won't want to become someone's enemy.

721
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:35,430
He's still a good person.

722
00:49:54,366 --> 00:49:56,660
Our help in the kitchen asked

723
00:49:57,494 --> 00:49:59,162
whether you're going to shower first

724
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:00,664
or eat first.

725
00:50:03,959 --> 00:50:05,085
Which is it?

726
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:09,464
What would you like to do?

727
00:50:10,298 --> 00:50:11,425
Do you...

728
00:50:12,467 --> 00:50:15,095
really have to ask me that?
You can decide that much.

729
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:19,474
How would anyone other than you
make that decision?

730
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:31,903
Did something happen?

731
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:41,705
So?

732
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:47,419
What is it that you really want to do?

733
00:50:53,842 --> 00:50:54,926
Tell me.

734
00:50:55,802 --> 00:50:56,887
Then I'll...

735
00:50:58,847 --> 00:51:01,349
make the decision for you.

736
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:10,400
What I want to do?

737
00:51:15,697 --> 00:51:16,865
There's one thing I want.

738
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:25,540
I want...

739
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:28,335
to go back to our house.

740
00:51:32,714 --> 00:51:34,549
I want to go back

741
00:51:35,675 --> 00:51:36,927
to school.

742
00:51:53,902 --> 00:51:55,904
He won't go back to school.

743
00:51:56,488 --> 00:51:57,614
Not President Park.

744
00:51:58,907 --> 00:52:00,992
His approval rating for state affairs
is 50 percent,

745
00:52:01,076 --> 00:52:02,953
and he's the most popular
presidential candidate.

746
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:05,539
With that approval rating,
why would he return to school?

747
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,083
Just watch.

748
00:52:08,708 --> 00:52:10,794
He'll say the people wanted him,
that it was inevitable

749
00:52:10,877 --> 00:52:12,838
or that it's his destiny

750
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:15,799
and announce his candidacy
for the presidential election.

751
00:52:16,341 --> 00:52:18,218
How is it going with the nonparty cabinet?

752
00:52:21,263 --> 00:52:22,931
He'll withdraw it.

753
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:26,476
President Park is already exhausted.

754
00:52:27,185 --> 00:52:28,436
If I become president,

755
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:30,981
you should be listed
in the Guinness Book of Records.

756
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:35,944
You're the first Chief of Civil Affairs
approved by four presidents.

757
00:52:39,364 --> 00:52:41,616
That honor would be more than I deserve.

758
00:52:42,158 --> 00:52:44,452
I'd like to spend the rest of my life

759
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:48,248
reforming the prosecution.

760
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:50,750
Minister of Justice?

761
00:52:53,628 --> 00:52:56,756
Gwacheon is the best place
to raise children.

762
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:58,550
You got it.

763
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:07,601
You changed drivers again.

764
00:53:09,144 --> 00:53:11,187
Young men are like that nowadays.

765
00:53:11,396 --> 00:53:12,856
They're not tenacious.

766
00:53:31,917 --> 00:53:33,335
I told you

767
00:53:33,752 --> 00:53:34,961
that I'll make the decision.

768
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:49,184
Even if we go back home,

769
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:52,145
you have to go without regret
to feel comfortable.

770
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:55,774
It'll weigh on your heart forever.

771
00:53:56,775 --> 00:53:58,068
I can't let that happen.

772
00:54:07,202 --> 00:54:10,038
Please check if Chief An is at work.

773
00:54:10,121 --> 00:54:12,958
I found legal basis
to appoint a nonparty cabinet.

774
00:54:15,961 --> 00:54:16,795
Mr. President.

775
00:54:23,426 --> 00:54:24,844
First, I have something to tell you.

776
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:30,642
Is that true?

777
00:54:31,643 --> 00:54:33,979
You're saying President Park
was relieved of his post

778
00:54:34,062 --> 00:54:35,313
as minister?

779
00:54:35,397 --> 00:54:36,815
It was the morning of the bombing.

780
00:54:37,148 --> 00:54:39,234
The president
gave him the news personally.

781
00:54:40,235 --> 00:54:42,070
I don't know if it's good or bad,

782
00:54:42,153 --> 00:54:44,531
but it doesn't have any legal effect.

783
00:54:47,993 --> 00:54:50,829
This is from the black box
of Mayor Kang's car.

784
00:54:51,371 --> 00:54:55,750
Then is this how word
about your dismissal got out?

785
00:54:55,834 --> 00:54:58,169
How did you find out?

786
00:54:58,253 --> 00:55:02,132
I got a tip that the secretarial staff
was leaking information.

787
00:55:03,091 --> 00:55:06,177
That's how the word
about President Park's dismissal got out.

788
00:55:08,763 --> 00:55:12,225
It was given to the favored candidate
of the ruling party

789
00:55:12,684 --> 00:55:13,852
like war booty.

790
00:55:14,185 --> 00:55:15,979
So we did an internal inspection.

791
00:55:16,521 --> 00:55:18,481
While we were inspecting Chief An,

792
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:20,567
I got this information

793
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:22,902
from the driver Mayor Kang fired.

794
00:55:24,404 --> 00:55:26,031
What do you plan to do, sir?

795
00:55:27,699 --> 00:55:30,744
This is clearly breach
of classified information.

796
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:32,287
You should replace him, sir.

797
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:36,207
That would be a warning
to the rest of the secretarial staff.

798
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:41,755
I think

799
00:55:42,422 --> 00:55:43,715
we should keep this to ourselves.

800
00:55:44,799 --> 00:55:46,926
-Sir.
-Tell Chief An...

801
00:55:48,219 --> 00:55:49,137
to come see me.

802
00:55:59,314 --> 00:56:01,608
-Did you want to see me, sir?
-Yes.

803
00:56:02,317 --> 00:56:03,651
Do you know why the Constitution

804
00:56:03,818 --> 00:56:07,072
doesn't legally limit the authority
of the acting president?

805
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:11,659
This is a thesis that presents
the grounds for it.

806
00:56:17,332 --> 00:56:18,333
AUTHORITY OF A PRESIDENT

807
00:56:18,416 --> 00:56:19,626
AUTHORITY OF ADMINISTRATION

808
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:21,795
"When an acting president is needed,

809
00:56:22,128 --> 00:56:24,631
the nation is already
in an irregular situation

810
00:56:24,756 --> 00:56:27,467
and is in danger
of unforeseeable circumstances.

811
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:31,096
He or she needs to have...

812
00:56:33,014 --> 00:56:35,016
all the authority of the president

813
00:56:35,809 --> 00:56:37,602
in order to protect the people."

814
00:56:41,564 --> 00:56:43,149
This is the spirit of our Constitution.

815
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:45,401
As a citizen of this nation,

816
00:56:45,485 --> 00:56:48,071
I plan to respect
this spirit of the Constitution.

817
00:56:49,572 --> 00:56:50,532
You plan to go forward

818
00:56:51,533 --> 00:56:52,742
with the nonparty cabinet.

819
00:56:54,327 --> 00:56:55,453
There's more.

820
00:56:59,207 --> 00:57:01,876
"Therefore, using sublaws

821
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:05,630
or the law to restrict the authority
of the acting president

822
00:57:05,713 --> 00:57:07,423
in any way...

823
00:57:13,138 --> 00:57:15,223
can be considered a violation
of the Constitution."

824
00:57:16,724 --> 00:57:17,851
This means

825
00:57:18,893 --> 00:57:20,812
the impeachment motion
of the opposing party

826
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:23,398
and the opposition of the majority party

827
00:57:24,065 --> 00:57:28,403
can all be considered
a violation of the Constitution.

828
00:57:29,821 --> 00:57:32,782
Chief An, you were a lawyer, right?

829
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:38,163
Could you come up with a way
for the Blue House

830
00:57:38,663 --> 00:57:40,415
to legally stand against both parties?

831
00:57:44,878 --> 00:57:48,715
There are thousands of ways
to interpret the Constitution.

832
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:52,385
This thesis is just one of them.

833
00:57:53,845 --> 00:57:55,138
As a lawyer,

834
00:57:56,764 --> 00:57:58,558
I don't agree with this interpretation.

835
00:58:00,185 --> 00:58:01,186
I'm sorry.

836
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:05,315
I see.

837
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:07,692
Then...

838
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:10,778
I have no choice.

839
00:58:15,909 --> 00:58:17,702
Call the National Assembly, Secretary Cha.

840
00:58:18,286 --> 00:58:21,456
A hearing will be heard
at the National Assembly

841
00:58:21,539 --> 00:58:24,000
for our minister candidate
and the opposing party's.

842
00:58:24,667 --> 00:58:25,877
Sir.

843
00:58:26,794 --> 00:58:29,506
I plan to appoint a new cabinet.

844
00:58:37,931 --> 00:58:38,806
What?

845
00:58:39,641 --> 00:58:42,268
President Park is going forward
in appointing a nonparty cabinet?

846
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:45,063
Yes, he plans to hold a hearing
at the National Assembly.

847
00:58:48,107 --> 00:58:49,067
What?

848
00:58:51,110 --> 00:58:54,447
How is that possible when we don't
have enough people for a quorum?

849
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:57,825
He proposed for a public hearing
to inspect the candidates,

850
00:58:57,909 --> 00:58:59,786
not for the Standing Committee.

851
00:58:59,869 --> 00:59:00,995
CAN'T GET A QUORUM

852
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:03,623
NONPARTY CABINET MINISTER HEARING

853
00:59:13,049 --> 00:59:15,260
So when is the hearing?

854
00:59:15,843 --> 00:59:17,053
It's 2 p.m. on March 22nd

855
00:59:17,136 --> 00:59:19,138
at the Seoul Metropolitan Council.

856
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:20,890
Change our party's general meeting

857
00:59:20,974 --> 00:59:23,351
to the same date and time.

858
00:59:23,434 --> 00:59:26,980
What? If our assemblymen
aren't at the hearing--

859
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:29,649
Whether it's a public hearing or not,
it'll be put off temporarily.

860
00:59:30,358 --> 00:59:34,237
The citizens should see for themselves
that the president has abandoned

861
00:59:34,362 --> 00:59:36,447
the opposing party
and is crippling this nation.

862
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:39,492
Do you really insist
on going to the hearing?

863
00:59:39,576 --> 00:59:43,246
Seonjin Republican Party has
a general meeting at the same time.

864
00:59:43,371 --> 00:59:45,498
Mr. President,

865
00:59:45,748 --> 00:59:48,334
your impeachment might be decided
at that meeting.

866
00:59:49,002 --> 00:59:51,713
I'm going to focus on one thing for now,
Ms. Jeong.

867
00:59:56,217 --> 01:00:00,513
I plan to have the presidential election
be held smoothly without problems.

868
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:03,016
And to do so,
the nonparty cabinet is essential.

869
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:08,688
I intend to do everything I can.

870
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:18,448
SEONJIN REPUBLICAN PARTY

871
01:00:18,531 --> 01:00:20,575
DISCUSSION REGARDING
ACTING PRESIDENT PARK'S IMPEACHMENT

872
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:23,828
GENERAL MEETING
OF SEONJIN REPUBLICAN PARTY

873
01:00:23,911 --> 01:00:26,331
SEOUL METROPOLITAN COUNCIL

874
01:00:27,915 --> 01:00:30,752
CABINET MEMBER CANDIDATE

875
01:00:30,835 --> 01:00:32,920
NEW MINISTER CANDIDATE HEARING

876
01:01:43,741 --> 01:01:45,576
GENERAL MEETING
OF SEONJIN REPUBLICAN PARTY

877
01:01:51,374 --> 01:01:54,001
I'm sorry. Please wait a bit.

878
01:01:54,085 --> 01:01:55,670
I'm sorry.

879
01:01:58,881 --> 01:02:00,341
If this is everyone,

880
01:02:01,509 --> 01:02:03,928
I don't think we can make a quorum
for the general meeting.

881
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:46,971
The hearing... It's taking place!

882
01:02:50,892 --> 01:02:53,060
I thought it would fall through.

883
01:02:54,604 --> 01:02:57,523
Seonjin Republican Party's general meeting
must have fell through.

884
01:02:58,232 --> 01:02:59,484
How did this happen?

885
01:03:00,777 --> 01:03:04,322
Maybe the good assemblymen
couldn't turn their backs

886
01:03:04,572 --> 01:03:07,241
on the hopes of the citizens
for a nonparty cabinet.

887
01:03:13,998 --> 01:03:15,750
Then I have no choice.

888
01:03:25,343 --> 01:03:26,969
If I can't deal with it legally,

889
01:03:30,306 --> 01:03:31,974
I'll have to deal with it politically.

890
01:03:35,102 --> 01:03:36,187
Is that true?

891
01:03:36,979 --> 01:03:39,023
You're saying President Park
was relieved of his post

892
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:40,191
as minister?

893
01:03:40,608 --> 01:03:41,943
It was the morning of the bombing.

894
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:44,946
The president
gave him the news personally.

895
01:03:45,738 --> 01:03:47,448
I don't know if it's good or bad,

896
01:03:47,824 --> 01:03:50,117
but it doesn't have any legal effect.

897
01:04:02,255 --> 01:04:03,172
So?

898
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:06,133
What do you plan to do?

899
01:04:07,927 --> 01:04:09,804
You'll get hurt too if it goes public.

900
01:04:13,641 --> 01:04:14,725
So I am considering...

901
01:04:17,061 --> 01:04:20,731
becoming an informant
for the public interest.

902
01:04:21,732 --> 01:04:24,235
Let's end the ugly history

903
01:04:24,318 --> 01:04:27,405
of trading confidential information
for power in the future.

904
01:04:27,488 --> 01:04:31,450
I plan to come clean like this.

905
01:04:32,285 --> 01:04:33,327
Informant?

906
01:04:33,828 --> 01:04:35,162
Plan to come clean?

907
01:04:35,788 --> 01:04:36,914
I have no choice.

908
01:04:37,582 --> 01:04:39,584
If I get fired for leaking
confidential information,

909
01:04:40,418 --> 01:04:43,629
my 30 years of public service
will go down the drain.

910
01:04:45,590 --> 01:04:47,508
How will I face my children?

911
01:04:49,343 --> 01:04:50,219
Then...

912
01:04:51,679 --> 01:04:52,513
what about me?

913
01:04:53,931 --> 01:04:55,349
Legally,

914
01:04:55,433 --> 01:04:57,602
you will be accused and charged
for leaking

915
01:04:57,685 --> 01:04:59,437
confidential information
of the Blue House.

916
01:05:00,021 --> 01:05:01,355
Politically,

917
01:05:02,315 --> 01:05:05,776
you will be branded the mayor of Seoul
that slackened the discipline

918
01:05:07,361 --> 01:05:11,198
of the public office
to bring down your opponent.

919
01:05:16,078 --> 01:05:18,080
Would you like to deal with this legally

920
01:05:18,205 --> 01:05:21,125
or politically?

921
01:05:37,808 --> 01:05:39,310
KANG SANG-GU

922
01:05:45,816 --> 01:05:49,278
MAYOR KANG SANG-GU

923
01:05:52,073 --> 01:05:53,074
Secretary Jang,

924
01:05:54,450 --> 01:05:56,827
gather all the assemblymen.
The civil complaints...

925
01:05:57,411 --> 01:05:58,579
No, I mean...

926
01:06:00,164 --> 01:06:02,416
their campaign promises.
Tell them I'll carry them out.

927
01:06:05,169 --> 01:06:06,462
Not our party!

928
01:06:07,046 --> 01:06:10,383
The assemblymen of Seonjin
Republican Party you like so much!

929
01:06:44,959 --> 01:06:47,211
I heard that this was your doing

930
01:06:47,294 --> 01:06:50,256
and that you won over our members
through your pledge.

931
01:06:53,968 --> 01:06:55,344
"Won over"?

932
01:06:55,970 --> 01:06:58,889
Is taking sides necessary when we're just

933
01:06:58,973 --> 01:07:01,100
trying to make our people's lives better?

934
01:07:02,435 --> 01:07:04,145
I think I've told you.

935
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:05,563
Governance

936
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:08,733
is what I work with.

937
01:07:31,464 --> 01:07:34,300
Why aren't you dismissing me?

938
01:07:35,926 --> 01:07:37,845
I do not support you, sir.

939
01:07:38,721 --> 01:07:40,181
I'm an unfavorable...

940
01:07:42,767 --> 01:07:45,895
In this case, dismissing me

941
01:07:46,395 --> 01:07:48,272
is the most natural thing to do.

942
01:07:49,565 --> 01:07:52,693
If I were to dismiss everyone
who didn't support me,

943
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:56,280
I doubt there would be many left
at this Blue House.

944
01:07:59,742 --> 01:08:01,952
I decided to announce my dismissal

945
01:08:02,328 --> 01:08:05,915
because I knew you'd believe
that it was in the favor

946
01:08:06,207 --> 01:08:07,833
of public interest.

947
01:08:12,755 --> 01:08:13,923
That must be why

948
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:16,884
despite the change in power,

949
01:08:18,761 --> 01:08:20,638
the past presidents chose you.

950
01:08:22,223 --> 01:08:25,434
And we need help
from all the competent men around us.

951
01:08:27,603 --> 01:08:28,979
Was that a good enough answer?

952
01:08:30,898 --> 01:08:34,235
You probably don't know about me
and how I survived

953
01:08:34,944 --> 01:08:36,320
in the Blue House.

954
01:08:39,782 --> 01:08:40,783
Then

955
01:08:42,451 --> 01:08:43,619
you can show me

956
01:08:45,287 --> 01:08:46,872
what kind of person you are

957
01:08:47,706 --> 01:08:49,625
and why you are needed here.

958
01:08:58,717 --> 01:08:59,969
DELETE

959
01:09:00,052 --> 01:09:01,345
DELETE THIS FILE?

960
01:09:02,012 --> 01:09:02,847
EMPTY TRASH

961
01:09:03,597 --> 01:09:05,391
DELETE THIS FILE PERMANENTLY?

962
01:09:11,605 --> 01:09:13,732
It was very unlike Mr. President

963
01:09:13,816 --> 01:09:15,776
not to dismiss Chief An.

964
01:09:16,569 --> 01:09:19,446
He has never disobeyed the principles.

965
01:09:19,530 --> 01:09:23,033
But thanks to him, the assemblymen decided
to help out with the hearing.

966
01:09:23,742 --> 01:09:25,578
-But--
-The opposing party

967
01:09:26,245 --> 01:09:28,372
will no longer mention impeachment.

968
01:09:28,956 --> 01:09:30,416
They'll be afraid of public backlash.

969
01:09:32,251 --> 01:09:34,044
I was wrong, sir.

970
01:09:36,547 --> 01:09:37,882
Mr. President won

971
01:09:38,799 --> 01:09:40,384
without making any enemies.

972
01:09:40,467 --> 01:09:42,052
I guess so.

973
01:09:47,099 --> 01:09:48,893
I think I've found him.

974
01:09:50,811 --> 01:09:52,021
The winner.

975
01:09:54,273 --> 01:09:55,900
The one who knows how to win.

976
01:10:07,578 --> 01:10:09,413
This is the first item
on the decision making.

977
01:10:09,997 --> 01:10:14,084
We will now begin the hearing
regarding the candidates.

978
01:10:19,256 --> 01:10:20,633
As you all know...

979
01:10:20,925 --> 01:10:22,259
We're finally out of the woods.

980
01:10:23,636 --> 01:10:27,348
But such controversies regarding
the acting president will continue.

981
01:10:27,431 --> 01:10:30,434
This is a public hearing...

982
01:10:31,227 --> 01:10:33,520
There is one way to quell it.

983
01:10:36,899 --> 01:10:38,108
And what is it?

984
01:10:39,860 --> 01:10:41,779
You can be elected

985
01:10:41,862 --> 01:10:43,697
under the democratic legitimacy.

986
01:11:10,182 --> 01:11:12,226
You don't have to act
on behalf of the president.

987
01:11:13,644 --> 01:11:16,647
You can act on behalf of the people.

988
01:11:18,649 --> 01:11:19,733
What do you mean?

989
01:11:19,817 --> 01:11:21,902
Will you run for the presidency?

990
01:11:21,986 --> 01:11:24,571
Now, the candidates with take an oath.

991
01:11:25,906 --> 01:11:26,907
The candidates

992
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:30,995
will stand up, lift their right hand,
and take an oath.

993
01:11:31,078 --> 01:11:32,746
The next president
of the Republic of Korea.

994
01:11:33,747 --> 01:11:37,084
Afterwards, please hand in the documents.

995
01:11:39,461 --> 01:11:41,839
Now, please take an oath.

996
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:07,031
Mr. President will outrank
all other candidates by a wide margin.

997
01:12:07,823 --> 01:12:11,285
Do you think I'm suitable
for that position?

998
01:12:11,368 --> 01:12:14,705
You wanted me to call you once
I was certain about the bomber.

999
01:12:14,788 --> 01:12:18,125
Assemblyman Oh Yeong-seok must not
become the Minister of National Defense.

1000
01:12:18,751 --> 01:12:20,794
There's an issue with Agent Han
at the moment.

1001
01:12:25,299 --> 01:12:27,968
At least for today, it seems like
Lady Luck is on my side,

1002
01:12:28,052 --> 01:12:29,345
not yours.

1003
01:12:29,970 --> 01:12:32,806
