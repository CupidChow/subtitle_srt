1
00:00:53,636 --> 00:01:00,602
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
PLACES AND EVENTS ARE FICTIONAL

2
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,575
This is the Data Processing Office.
We've restored the call logs.

3
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:19,287
Could you send the file to me right now?

4
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:27,545
DATA PROCESSING OFFICE

5
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:29,297
Are you the Minister of National Defense?

6
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,591
This is Secretary Cha Yeong-jin.

7
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:44,395
She has a gun.

8
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:53,947
Shit.

9
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,327
-Guards!
-She has a gun!

10
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:06,835
Guards!

11
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:23,226
-Run!
-We need to get out of here!

12
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:30,024
Are you all right?

13
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:33,820
Where is Mr. President?
I heard two gunshots.

14
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:39,033
They'll be arriving in a moment.
Please clear the way.

15
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:40,994
-Get ready quickly.
-Yes, sir.

16
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:46,875
Entrance cleared.

17
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:50,378
Out of the way!

18
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:03,558
We'll move him to the bed.
One, two, three!

19
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:07,770
Please start an IV drip.

20
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,272
And request a CT scan.

21
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:13,735
I'll check your wound first, sir.

22
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:16,321
One, two, three.

23
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,213
A bullet penetrated his chest
from the underarm toward the thorax.

24
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:38,134
We'll need to perform a CT scan to see
whether his lungs and veins are damaged.

25
00:03:38,217 --> 00:03:41,054
But there were two. We heard two gunshots.

26
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:43,014
Do you see only one gunshot wound?

27
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:48,478
Yes, I only see one on the President.
It went through him.

28
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:51,940
-Get the portable x-ray ready.
-Yes, doctor.

29
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:58,279
Sir.

30
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:11,751
So the other bullet didn't hit him,

31
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:13,920
thanks to Assemblyman Oh...
I mean, Minister Oh.

32
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:15,463
Life is so unpredictable, indeed.

33
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:18,925
Minister Oh was almost
not at the ceremony today.

34
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:20,051
Isn't that right?

35
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,304
I'm relieved that no one else got hurt.

36
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:27,058
Hello? Yes, Reporter Yu.
This is Kim Nam-wook.

37
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:32,063
I can't say anything about
the President's condition at the moment.

38
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:34,023
Until we release our official statement...

39
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:36,567
Positive or not,

40
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:39,028
no news story should be published
based on mere speculation.

41
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,446
Right.

42
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:43,783
This isn't just about
the President's health, as you know.

43
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,369
This concerns national security.

44
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:50,748
A number of bullet fragments
are lodged in your chest.

45
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:53,167
You see this, right?

46
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:57,255
It's highly likely that the fragments
will rupture your artery.

47
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:01,092
His artery? Which one?

48
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,261
The aorta.

49
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:07,181
You didn't lose a lot of blood,

50
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:09,100
and the wound may not look that serious,

51
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:13,396
but you basically have
a ticking time bomb inside your chest.

52
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:17,900
Your life will be in danger.

53
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:22,196
He needs surgery right away.

54
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,702
Will it be a major surgery?

55
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:32,915
It is a tricky one,
so it'll take quite a while.

56
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:34,876
I'd say, about ten hours?

57
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,050
Ten hours in the operating room?

58
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:47,638
Including the time for the anesthesia,
he'll be in there for at least 12 hours.

59
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:51,642
In other words, the Head of Government

60
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:56,481
of the Republic of Korea
will not be able to make

61
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,068
any decisions or choices
for the next 12 hours.

62
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:06,783
It also means

63
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:10,036
that the Commander-in-Chief
of our armed forces...

64
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:22,090
will be unreachable for over 12 hours.

65
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:26,135
While there's inter-Korean tension.

66
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,473
Article 71 of the Constitution.

67
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:33,226
"If the President is unable

68
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:35,186
to perform his or her duties
for any reason,

69
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:38,314
the members of the State Council

70
00:06:38,397 --> 00:06:39,398
shall act for him or her."

71
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:43,444
-This is--
-Are you trying to say

72
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:45,071
we're in that situation now?

73
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:49,826
Where the President is unable
to perform his duties?

74
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:52,370
The office of the President cannot
be vacant, no matter what.

75
00:06:58,334 --> 00:06:59,627
I'm relieved...

76
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:05,675
that this is happening after we appointed
all the Cabinet members.

77
00:07:07,426 --> 00:07:09,512
Didn't we need to establish

78
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:13,224
the nonparty cabinet
to be prepared for a day like this?

79
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,689
Who holds the most seniority

80
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:23,067
among the newly appointed ministers?

81
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:36,080
It would be the Minister
of Strategy and Finance.

82
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:37,582
Let's find out where he is.

83
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:39,625
Move! Out of the way!

84
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,377
Move. He suffered a gunshot wound!

85
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,216
This way, please.

86
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:59,353
That's the Minister
of Strategy and Finance, Hong Seung-gi.

87
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,863
The other bullet didn't miss.

88
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:14,410
Then who is next in line?

89
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,913
Who's next?

90
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:40,686
Did you people cook up this ruse

91
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:42,813
to make me the Acting President?

92
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:46,317
We simply chose the quickest
and the most effective way.

93
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:49,946
-This time--
-You should've consulted me beforehand!

94
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,074
You couldn't have

95
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:55,243
objected anyway.

96
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:58,329
We share

97
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:00,873
the same goal after all.

98
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:24,689
Minister Oh Yeong-seok.

99
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:28,651
Minister Oh

100
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:32,029
of National Defense is the next in line.

101
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,934
DAY 39: THE ACTING PRESIDENT,
OH YEONG-SEOK

102
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:04,437
EPISODE 11

103
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,689
Eunsan Building, Room 1306.

104
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:11,068
A key to the building
where the sniper was.

105
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,323
Why do you have this?

106
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:18,200
Are you not going to answer?

107
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,915
You'll exercise
your right to remain silent?

108
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:30,046
Shall I answer it for you?

109
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:36,761
You knew about the assassination attempt
of President Park beforehand.

110
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:41,766
Neither the Blue House's security team
nor NIS knew about it,

111
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,185
but you knew ahead of time.

112
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:45,686
Why?

113
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:50,107
Because you're one of them.

114
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:53,569
You fired your gun

115
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,864
to distract
the Blue House security guards.

116
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:01,243
To buy some time
for the sniper to flee the scene.

117
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:04,830
Right?

118
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,588
What do you think?

119
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:17,301
There is a 10 to 15 percent chance
he might die on the table,

120
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,012
which isn't too bad.

121
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,807
It's just that the surgery itself
is complicated.

122
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:28,771
Are you the Minister of National Defense?

123
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,940
This is Secretary Cha Yeong-jin.

124
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:41,075
The President is in the room now, right?

125
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:43,786
What's the matter? Is there something
you need to report to--

126
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:56,590
I guess she's really worried about him.

127
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:58,801
She is so kindhearted, don't you agree?

128
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:03,889
How could you work

129
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:06,642
as a spokesperson with that face?

130
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,978
Why? I have a very photogenic face.

131
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:12,440
You have no poker face.

132
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:15,109
You're so easy to read.

133
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:26,287
No, I'm not.

134
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,460
VIP WARD

135
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:52,771
-It must have been terrifying.
-Yes.

136
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:54,940
-Are you all right?
-How's Ms. Choe holding up?

137
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:56,650
Let's talk inside.

138
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:00,779
Assemblywoman Yun...

139
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:14,001
Then I'll contact
Assemblywoman Yun right away

140
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:16,337
and tell her that you'd like
to speak with her in person.

141
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:32,102
I must say, you and your secretaries

142
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,313
are all unbelievable.

143
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:39,151
You're severely injured.

144
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:41,695
You're going in for surgery
any minute now.

145
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:45,908
There's a newly appointed minister
who can fill in, so why...

146
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:00,881
Right? So why...

147
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:04,802
is my scary wife nagging me

148
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:06,929
in the midst of all this?

149
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:15,688
Gosh, seriously...

150
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:19,358
Are you all right?

151
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:20,568
Yes.

152
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,952
You know, don't you?

153
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,372
For me and the kids,

154
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,041
no one could ever

155
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:37,918
replace you.

156
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:13,954
Contact Assemblywoman Yun,

157
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:15,623
get the glasses fixed,

158
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:17,207
and get Si-wan and Si-jin...

159
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:19,668
My apologies, sir.

160
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:22,171
-Wait.
-Yes, sir.

161
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:27,259
Oh, Assemblywoman Yun Chan-gyeong
would like to meet... I mean,

162
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:30,304
The President would like to meet
with Assemblywoman Yun Chan-gyeong.

163
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:31,472
No, it's not that.

164
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,432
There, on your cuff.

165
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:36,769
Oh, thank you.
My mind has been all over the place.

166
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:46,111
I mean I'm totally focused
this time, Secretary Han.

167
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:47,863
You don't have to worry.

168
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:49,740
That's a relief.

169
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:55,287
Secretary Han?

170
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:58,082
President Park...

171
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:02,294
will be okay.

172
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,713
He'll really...

173
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,757
be...

174
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:17,726
That's right.

175
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:21,063
We all know.

176
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:24,066
President Park

177
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,151
is okay.

178
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,030
He even has a protocol administrator

179
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,032
like you by his side.

180
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:06,233
I heard you're getting
an emergency surgery, sir.

181
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:11,363
Was it that urgent to meet me before that?

182
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:22,041
MINISTER OF NATIONAL DEFENSE
OH YEONG-SEOK

183
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:36,263
According to
Article 71 of the Constitution,

184
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:38,098
you will have all acting authority

185
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:41,101
over administration
and as Commander-in-Chief

186
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:45,731
until President Park returns to work.

187
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:53,155
Are you saying I should keep
Minister Oh in check?

188
00:17:57,701 --> 00:18:00,037
Did you find Agent Han?

189
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:06,001
If you haven't found evidence

190
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:10,130
that Minister Oh was related to the bomber
as Agent Han asserts,

191
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:13,884
you wouldn't be asking me this right now.

192
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:17,805
You will be absent for 12 hours
at the most.

193
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:20,182
I'm just asking you...

194
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:27,314
to keep him in check
as the leader of the opposing party.

195
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:31,193
Just like you did...

196
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:34,446
with me until now.

197
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:41,411
I'll do my best
since the task was given to me.

198
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:43,997
Okay.

199
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:59,263
The members of my party asked

200
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:04,268
what I thought about recruiting you
since you are an independent.

201
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:06,478
I was against it.

202
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,692
You never give affirmation,

203
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:14,027
guarantee anything,
or are sure about anything.

204
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,488
You're boring and frustrating.

205
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:19,950
You don't fit in times like these
when people want clarity.

206
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:23,704
You may have a high approval rating
at the moment,

207
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:26,123
but you aren't the type of person

208
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:29,293
that can eat a bowl of gukbap
at the market for the election.

209
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:32,921
In other words,

210
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,465
you have no marketability

211
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:39,011
and won't sell well in politics.

212
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,388
Am I...

213
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,976
that bad?

214
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:47,853
But you are something I'd like to buy...

215
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:49,980
because of the durability.

216
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:57,696
Is the presidential election 40 days away?

217
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,783
When I fight in the ring,

218
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:07,164
I'd only be able to trust the referee
if it were you, sir.

219
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:16,215
I hope the surgery goes well.

220
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:13,939
We're going into the operating room now,
sir.

221
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,300
Your official schedule will begin

222
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:44,469
with a Cabinet meeting
including the chief secretary

223
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:46,430
and leader of the opposing party.

224
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:49,558
Here you go.

225
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:06,825
Move him on three. One, two, three.

226
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:51,870
We'll start the anesthesia.

227
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:06,927
According to Article 71
of the Constitution,

228
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:10,555
you have full authority
as the Acting President of Korea.

229
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:24,820
Please be seated.

230
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:36,998
Minister Oh will be the Acting President

231
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:39,042
until President Park leaves the hospital

232
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:40,627
and returns to work.

233
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:43,547
-Mr. Kim.
-Mr. Kim.

234
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:44,923
Ms. Woo.

235
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:46,591
Having an Acting President

236
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:48,510
for an Acting President
is unprecedented, right?

237
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:50,470
-Is this appropriate?
-Mr. Kim.

238
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:52,514
-Mr. Kim.
-How far does his authority go?

239
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:55,934
Yes, it is unprecedented
in our constitutional history

240
00:23:57,644 --> 00:23:59,688
to have an Acting President
due to a bombing,

241
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:01,356
and to have that Acting President

242
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:05,110
become unable to perform his duties
due to an assassination attempt.

243
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:06,903
All of this is unprecedented.

244
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:11,408
However, the Korean government
and the Blue House

245
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:14,452
will constantly make an effort

246
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:16,580
to protect our people’s lives and safety

247
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:18,665
from any form of terrorism
or assassination attempts.

248
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:21,918
He was shot near the heart. How difficult
do you think the surgery will be?

249
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:24,212
Will the medical team
be giving a briefing?

250
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:25,797
When will he be back?

251
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:30,177
So? What is his chance of survival?

252
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:42,564
There is only one thing
I'd like to tell you right now.

253
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:54,117
Scalpel.

254
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,040
Today,

255
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:03,210
I hope that unprecedented luck
in our constitutional history

256
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:06,713
will be with President Park.

257
00:25:09,507 --> 00:25:12,510
And I ask you to join me
in this hopeful prayer.

258
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:27,859
Is she still remaining silent?

259
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:31,821
Could I try talking to her?

260
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:35,200
All interrogation and investigation
of NIS agents

261
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:38,203
are to be done by NIS personnel.

262
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:40,080
That's our rule.

263
00:25:40,163 --> 00:25:42,249
If she is working with the shooter,

264
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:44,793
our security team
has jurisdiction as well.

265
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:49,422
Fine.

266
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:53,051
But you must share anything she says.

267
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:12,737
I'm Kang Dae-han

268
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:15,115
of the Blue House Security Team.

269
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:29,838
President Park Mu-jin sent me.

270
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:32,799
On the day of the hearing,

271
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:36,303
I believe you made an accusation
against Minister Oh.

272
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:41,641
Do you have evidence he is related
to the bombing, Agent Han?

273
00:26:47,188 --> 00:26:49,316
President Park wishes to be briefed.

274
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:56,698
I'll brief him in person.

275
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:07,625
He told me to brief him directly

276
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:10,503
regarding anything related to the bombing.

277
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:17,677
Take me to the Blue House right now
to see him.

278
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:23,183
That won't be possible.

279
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:29,147
President Park

280
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:32,609
is undergoing emergency surgery
due to a gunshot wound.

281
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:37,864
Also, Minister Oh is at the Blue House,
filling in as Acting President

282
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:41,493
in his place
as per Article 71 of the Constitution.

283
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,704
Minister...

284
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:47,916
Oh Yeong-seok...

285
00:27:50,293 --> 00:27:51,544
is Acting President?

286
00:27:59,135 --> 00:28:01,763
The stock market is fluctuating.

287
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:04,140
The market crashed
like it never did before

288
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:07,352
before closing and that includes
both KOSPI AND KOSDAQ.

289
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:09,521
Look here.

290
00:28:09,604 --> 00:28:12,774
That is probably
because of the shock that President Park

291
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:14,401
was shot and is getting surgery.

292
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:17,070
JOYANCE FINANCE

293
00:28:17,153 --> 00:28:20,448
This will kill all of our corporations
and private investors.

294
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:24,411
I suggest the KOSPI and KOSDAQ markets
be shut down tomorrow.

295
00:28:25,578 --> 00:28:28,498
We should give them time
to catch their breath.

296
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:32,627
Doesn't this seem like a rerun

297
00:28:33,002 --> 00:28:34,629
of President Park's first day here?

298
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:40,885
I'll tell you what I've decided.

299
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:44,055
I'm against that.

300
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:45,765
Excuse me?

301
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:52,021
If the stock market opens,

302
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:53,857
it's only a matter of time

303
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,151
before KOSPI drops below 2000
and KOSDAQ below 700.

304
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:58,111
We'll have to trust the market.

305
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:01,573
If terrified investors
all start selling stocks,

306
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:04,200
-not even a circuit breaker will work.
-If more people sell,

307
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:06,536
it'll be a big opportunity for buyers.

308
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:09,372
The market will soon find a way
to recover on its own.

309
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:12,041
Honk honk.

310
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:13,168
MAYOR OF SEOUL

311
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:22,886
That's because you're sitting
in the driver's seat.

312
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,764
I'm sure you want to honk your horn

313
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:28,516
and drive recklessly on the shoulder.

314
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,685
But Minister Oh,

315
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:34,105
it's a red light.

316
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:35,440
You need to stop.

317
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:39,819
The market, especially the stock market,

318
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:42,322
can't endure the anxiety.

319
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:43,782
That's interesting.

320
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:44,949
You're right.

321
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:46,993
I'm trying to get rid of this anxiety.

322
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,245
The economy is a mental warfare.

323
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:52,415
Let's say we close the market tomorrow.

324
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:56,878
It'll be a sign

325
00:29:56,961 --> 00:30:00,215
that the leaders of the Korean economy
are shocked and panicked.

326
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:01,633
Is that what you want?

327
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:05,094
CHIEF OF CIVIL AFFAIRS

328
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:06,721
The stock market will open at 9 a.m.

329
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:09,224
and close at 3:30 p.m. as always.

330
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:12,602
It will show the people of Korea
and overseas investors

331
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:15,980
that Korea's economy is standing strong.

332
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:25,281
It isn't a rerun.

333
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:27,033
The main character has changed.

334
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:29,994
Are you sure this is his first time
as Acting President?

335
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:35,333
Have you figured out
the whereabouts of the shooter?

336
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:38,837
Mr. Ko?

337
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:43,216
A car was reported stolen near the site.

338
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:45,426
The police have secured footage
from security cameras

339
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,387
and are comparing it
to witness statements.

340
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:50,431
The suspect must have been carrying a gun.

341
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:53,768
Have them work with Troop 707.

342
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:57,522
We'll set up the command center
at the Blue House.

343
00:30:58,731 --> 00:30:59,899
Excuse me?

344
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:03,611
You don't want to be briefed,

345
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:05,572
but want the command center here?

346
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:08,074
Mr. Ko.

347
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:11,452
-Yes?
-There was a bombing...

348
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:13,663
and an assassination attempt.

349
00:31:15,498 --> 00:31:16,958
Seeing the fear and anxiety

350
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:20,169
not only we, but also the people,
are experiencing,

351
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:22,255
this is a national disaster.

352
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:26,259
The Blue House will be the control tower
and I will take command.

353
00:31:33,349 --> 00:31:34,517
Next?

354
00:31:53,202 --> 00:31:54,621
What is he thinking?

355
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:58,124
He only has power for 12 hours.

356
00:31:58,207 --> 00:32:01,794
He should just take a stroll
around the Blue House and go home.

357
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:04,797
Why is he making
such a dangerous decision?

358
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:09,427
Come on now.
You should know better than anyone.

359
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:13,723
He wants to establish his administration.

360
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:16,976
He's showing his color clearly.

361
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:18,728
What color?

362
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:22,523
Assemblywoman Yun is conservative
regarding security

363
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:24,943
and progressive regarding the economy.

364
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:29,530
He's telling us
that he's a market fundamentalist

365
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:32,283
and he's far-right
in terms of security and economy.

366
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:35,703
Minister Oh was making sure
we all knew that.

367
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,455
Hey, Chief An.

368
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:40,458
There is business ethics
in the world of politics too.

369
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:43,461
How could he try to establish
his administration during a crisis?

370
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:46,381
And on top of that, he's campaigning?

371
00:32:47,548 --> 00:32:49,926
Where does he get off doing that?

372
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:01,562
Do you really think so?

373
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:05,692
Do you really think
the stock market can recover itself?

374
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:08,945
-I just--
-A ten-percent drop in the market

375
00:33:09,028 --> 00:33:12,198
means trillions of wons
evaporate from general accounts,

376
00:33:12,281 --> 00:33:14,575
private pension funds,
and student loan funds in one second.

377
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:17,453
Of course it will take time.

378
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:19,122
But it will recover soon.

379
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:22,667
Of course, we can earn
the lost money back someday.

380
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:24,544
But what about those
who will have to leave

381
00:33:24,627 --> 00:33:27,839
their families and school
and lose their retirement savings?

382
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:30,842
Who and how will recover
their ruined lives?

383
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:35,179
You said, if people sell more stocks,

384
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:37,974
it'll be a big opportunity
for those who want to buy, correct?

385
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:41,227
To whom do you want
to give the opportunity

386
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:43,271
you earn by selling the commoners' lives?

387
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:45,815
I have faith in the resilience
of Korean financial markets.

388
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:49,902
The government-initiated economy
isn't competitive enough.

389
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:52,530
You don't

390
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:56,868
see this nation as a profit model
in that position,

391
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:58,786
do you?

392
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:05,376
I hope what you want to keep
is your political creed,

393
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:07,837
not business profit.

394
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,547
I appreciate your advice.

395
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:32,403
When the market opens tomorrow,

396
00:34:32,945 --> 00:34:34,906
you will be able to buy

397
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:37,283
the stocks of your affiliates
at a very low price.

398
00:34:40,703 --> 00:34:43,706
The VIP asked me to make sure
your son can take over the group

399
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:48,836
without any problem.
He's greatly concerned.

400
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:55,885
They say a big crisis creates a big shot,

401
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:59,347
but I feel bad about this.

402
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:04,143
The person lying on the operating table...

403
00:35:05,144 --> 00:35:07,313
keeps getting on my nerves.

404
00:35:10,983 --> 00:35:12,360
Mr. Kim.

405
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:14,028
Don't worry, sir.

406
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:18,116
I'll make sure what happened today
won't cause any trouble in the future.

407
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:20,660
Good.

408
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:32,505
This is the person who shot the President.

409
00:35:33,422 --> 00:35:34,841
Do you recognize the face?

410
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:01,826
Agent Han.

411
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:13,629
I MET AGENT KIM JUN-O

412
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:46,495
If a trained intelligence agent
exercises the right to remain silent,

413
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:50,625
I've got no other option.

414
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:01,552
Security, come to the interrogation room.

415
00:37:03,262 --> 00:37:04,764
Find Agent Seo Ji-won.

416
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:10,686
Ask him about Tae-ik.

417
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:17,151
What are you...

418
00:37:20,696 --> 00:37:23,032
This is why I said
our agents will do the interrogation.

419
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:27,787
Are you okay?

420
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:54,605
Agent Seo Ji-won?

421
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:04,448
Isn't that your dinner?

422
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:10,288
Agent Han Na-gyeong
didn't mention you're cowardly.

423
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:12,331
Tae-ik.

424
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:16,544
Agent Han said you'd tell me about Tae-ik.

425
00:38:21,215 --> 00:38:24,468
I'm Kang Dae-han,
the head of the Blue House Security Team.

426
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:42,778
Yes, this is him.

427
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:44,405
Tae-ik.

428
00:38:45,197 --> 00:38:46,282
Is that his name?

429
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:49,076
It's the dying message

430
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:52,204
Myung Hae-joon left when he was murdered.

431
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:54,206
"Tae-ik."

432
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:59,253
He was first seen
at the scene of Myung Hae-joon's murder.

433
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:01,547
On the day of the hearing,

434
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:05,134
he faked a car accident
to threaten Agent Han,

435
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:09,138
and took all the evidence
on Assemblyman Oh from the scene.

436
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:16,145
And now, he attempted
to assassinate the President.

437
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:19,398
So you're saying the bombers
are behind the assassination,

438
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:22,318
and the man who is closely related
to them, Minister Oh,

439
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:24,695
is now in the Blue House, is that it?

440
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:52,848
After being chased by our troops,

441
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:55,351
the sniper fled into a chemical plant
near Gyeonggi-do.

442
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:59,188
All the exits of the plant are now blocked

443
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:02,733
and the suspect is completely
besieged by our police

444
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:04,360
and Troop 707.

445
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:07,196
Were there any injuries?

446
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:11,200
During the chase, a member of Troop 707

447
00:40:11,283 --> 00:40:13,786
was hit by the sniper's bullet
and was injured.

448
00:40:15,454 --> 00:40:17,039
Based on the chase, we assume

449
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:19,458
that the sniper is not only
physically strong,

450
00:40:20,042 --> 00:40:21,961
but technically also highly trained

451
00:40:22,044 --> 00:40:24,380
as a special forces soldier.

452
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:37,393
We'll order his arrest.

453
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:38,769
Wait.

454
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:40,813
Kill...

455
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:44,233
the sniper.

456
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:46,902
Pardon?

457
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:52,908
In this case, arresting him
would be the normal procedure--

458
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,618
He injured one of our men.

459
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:56,537
Do you think this a normal situation?

460
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:02,042
This is a chemical plant
filled with inflammable material.

461
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,337
Going out of our way to apprehend

462
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:07,339
a highly trained sniper

463
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:09,425
might result in more casualties.

464
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:11,010
What will you do then?

465
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:17,308
That's unacceptable to me.

466
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:19,101
It'll be a shoot-to-kill.

467
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:22,897
Mr. President...

468
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:28,527
I mean, President Park,

469
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:31,155
will have ordered the sniper
be apprehended alive.

470
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:38,829
In order to find out
who's behind the attack,

471
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:41,832
he would've thought
interrogating the sniper

472
00:41:42,082 --> 00:41:44,168
was the most reasonable course of action.

473
00:41:45,377 --> 00:41:46,587
Is that so?

474
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:50,174
It's the order he gave when
capturing Myung Hae-joon in Cambodia.

475
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:53,677
Right, but where did that get us?

476
00:41:58,057 --> 00:42:00,226
What about the attackers

477
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:02,061
did we find out from Myung Hae-joon?

478
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:04,480
Tell me.

479
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:08,609
Since the bombing,

480
00:42:09,276 --> 00:42:11,278
what exactly has President Park achieved?

481
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:16,992
Tell me, Ms. Jeong.

482
00:42:20,412 --> 00:42:21,872
My decision is final.

483
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:23,123
Director Ji, proceed.

484
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:32,132
Once we have eyes on the sniper,

485
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:34,593
we will shoot to kill.

486
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:39,515
Instead of capturing him alive,

487
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:41,642
you will shoot to kill.

488
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:06,625
Please reconsider.

489
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:11,797
Everyone in this room
is against the kill order.

490
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:14,008
I know why they are,

491
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:17,303
but think of it this way.

492
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:21,265
This is a sinking ship.

493
00:43:21,348 --> 00:43:23,559
We're all on that sinking ship,

494
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:25,853
sailing across wild waters at night.

495
00:43:27,563 --> 00:43:29,565
We all have ideas
on where to steer the ship,

496
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:31,775
but there's only one designated captain.

497
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:34,695
Even in this crisis,

498
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:38,490
would it be wise
to have the entire crew operate the helm?

499
00:43:39,074 --> 00:43:40,492
Because it's a democracy?

500
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:45,956
I would chuck that word
off the ship first.

501
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:47,875
We must follow the captain's orders,

502
00:43:50,085 --> 00:43:51,086
and at this moment,

503
00:43:52,212 --> 00:43:53,756
that captain is me.

504
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:02,348
We will shoot to kill

505
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:09,480
Once spotted,

506
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:12,024
shoot to kill.

507
00:44:44,973 --> 00:44:45,974
The sniper

508
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:48,185
has been killed.

509
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:12,668
Doctor, his BP is dropping.
It went from 95 to 80.

510
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:15,170
There must be another rupture.

511
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:16,338
Irrigation.

512
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:19,383
Suction.

513
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:27,683
Suction.

514
00:45:28,684 --> 00:45:29,935
I need a lot of gauze.

515
00:45:30,352 --> 00:45:31,645
More!

516
00:45:38,652 --> 00:45:41,238
The bleeding isn't stopping, doctor.

517
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:43,699
If we don't stop it,

518
00:45:45,033 --> 00:45:47,953
he will die of blood loss.

519
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:52,249
His BP is now at 72.

520
00:45:56,962 --> 00:46:00,299
PARK, 45, MALE, IN SURGERY

521
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:03,093
-Sir?
-Here, have one.

522
00:46:05,053 --> 00:46:06,346
Here you go.

523
00:46:06,513 --> 00:46:07,598
Thank you.

524
00:46:07,806 --> 00:46:08,891
Thank you.

525
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:14,897
You've been going through too many things
at the Blue House

526
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:17,524
that you should never have to experience.

527
00:46:23,155 --> 00:46:24,615
President Park came to me

528
00:46:26,074 --> 00:46:27,826
the first day he was sworn into office.

529
00:46:30,704 --> 00:46:32,581
He said he'd resign

530
00:46:33,665 --> 00:46:35,417
with that stubborn look of his.

531
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:38,795
That sounds just like
what Mu-jin would do.

532
00:46:42,508 --> 00:46:44,218
For the first time since then,

533
00:46:46,887 --> 00:46:48,472
I'm regretting my decision

534
00:46:49,389 --> 00:46:50,933
to keep him in office.

535
00:46:58,941 --> 00:47:00,192
Sir,

536
00:47:00,567 --> 00:47:01,985
why is it taking so long?

537
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:04,780
Shouldn't the surgery be over by now?

538
00:47:06,698 --> 00:47:07,908
5:15 A.M.

539
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:10,035
IN SURGERY

540
00:47:13,705 --> 00:47:14,623
IN RECOVERY

541
00:47:29,054 --> 00:47:31,223
The part of the aorta I was worried about

542
00:47:31,473 --> 00:47:33,392
was successfully repaired.

543
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:39,648
How's he doing?

544
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:41,900
Is he awake?

545
00:47:41,984 --> 00:47:46,738
He suffered massive blood loss during
surgery and his blood pressure plummeted.

546
00:47:47,447 --> 00:47:48,991
So currently,

547
00:47:49,992 --> 00:47:52,327
we're concerned
about possible brain damage.

548
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:56,498
Brain damage?

549
00:47:56,582 --> 00:47:58,834
Are you saying he might not wake up?

550
00:47:58,917 --> 00:48:00,544
There's nothing I can say

551
00:48:00,627 --> 00:48:03,046
except for that
we'll just have to wait and see.

552
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:08,468
My gosh. Sir?

553
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:54,931
YEOMINGWAN

554
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:06,234
Sir, is President Park awake?

555
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:08,695
When will he be discharged?
Shall we brief the press together?

556
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:09,780
That would be shocking.

557
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:13,867
Sir?

558
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:15,577
Where is everyone right now?

559
00:49:26,922 --> 00:49:28,256
Let's do our best

560
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:30,592
to make sure that his absence

561
00:49:32,177 --> 00:49:34,346
doesn't put our government in suspension.

562
00:49:34,846 --> 00:49:36,056
That is something

563
00:49:37,432 --> 00:49:39,059
you don't have to worry about.

564
00:49:40,936 --> 00:49:44,147
Minister Oh has adapted to the Blue House
faster than anyone I've seen before.

565
00:49:45,148 --> 00:49:46,274
That's surprising.

566
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:49,361
He had me worried
since he has no experience

567
00:49:50,612 --> 00:49:51,780
in an administrative position.

568
00:49:54,116 --> 00:49:55,492
Mr. Kim,

569
00:49:55,909 --> 00:49:57,369
during the press briefing,

570
00:49:57,953 --> 00:50:00,539
please emphasize the fact that Minister Oh

571
00:50:00,622 --> 00:50:02,040
is off to a smooth start.

572
00:50:02,207 --> 00:50:03,041
Sure.

573
00:50:03,125 --> 00:50:04,876
Secretary Min,

574
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:08,296
please accompany Minister Oh
to his meetings from now on.

575
00:50:08,964 --> 00:50:10,090
-Sure thing.
-Good.

576
00:50:11,758 --> 00:50:12,884
Meanwhile,

577
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:17,013
we should sit down with Minister Oh
to discuss the presidential election.

578
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:21,101
I'll go by the hospital first
to check on President Park.

579
00:50:22,894 --> 00:50:25,355
Minister Oh is beginning
his first official day in the office,

580
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:28,233
and you're leaving your post
on a personal matter?

581
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:36,575
I'll assume you've changed your plans,
Ms. Jeong.

582
00:50:48,795 --> 00:50:50,255
I'll check on President Park.

583
00:51:07,022 --> 00:51:08,106
Earlier...

584
00:51:08,273 --> 00:51:09,524
Tell me.

585
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:12,652
How are you not at all fazed?

586
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:14,488
How could you

587
00:51:14,654 --> 00:51:17,574
go on with your life
as if nothing happened?

588
00:51:17,657 --> 00:51:19,242
Do you not even care?

589
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:27,000
Are you done yelling?

590
00:51:31,421 --> 00:51:33,673
If so, let's try that once again
so I can understand.

591
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:36,927
Whether it's President Park
or Minister Oh,

592
00:51:37,219 --> 00:51:39,054
it doesn't matter to you, does it?

593
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:43,391
You don't care unless
that person has good approval ratings

594
00:51:43,475 --> 00:51:45,769
and he is eligible
to be a presidential candidate.

595
00:51:45,852 --> 00:51:47,229
All you want anyway

596
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:49,898
is to successfully
recreate the government.

597
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:54,194
Is that what you think?

598
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:57,781
People say that President Park
benefited the most from this bombing,

599
00:51:57,864 --> 00:51:59,533
and some say it's Minister Oh,

600
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:04,788
but they're wrong.

601
00:52:06,206 --> 00:52:07,707
It's you.

602
00:52:11,044 --> 00:52:12,462
Had it not been for the attack,

603
00:52:12,546 --> 00:52:14,756
you wouldn't have even dreamed of a chance

604
00:52:16,049 --> 00:52:17,509
to recreate the government

605
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:20,554
as none other than a kingmaker.

606
00:52:23,348 --> 00:52:24,307
Is that...

607
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:27,936
Is that why...

608
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:46,955
Do you not know

609
00:52:47,956 --> 00:52:49,207
why I seem unfazed?

610
00:52:51,084 --> 00:52:53,795
Do you really don't understand
why I'm not letting this get to me?

611
00:52:55,755 --> 00:52:57,382
It's because I don't want

612
00:52:57,924 --> 00:53:00,510
his period of absence
to be remembered as his failure.

613
00:53:01,928 --> 00:53:05,015
That's why I'm doing whatever I can

614
00:53:05,098 --> 00:53:07,309
because I'm President Park's
Chief Presidential Secretary.

615
00:53:09,102 --> 00:53:12,188
I thought at least you
of all people would understand me.

616
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:14,983
Was I wrong to assume that?

617
00:53:15,066 --> 00:53:16,818
I thought I knew you,

618
00:53:18,236 --> 00:53:19,237
but

619
00:53:20,071 --> 00:53:21,489
now I don't.

620
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:23,867
I don't know

621
00:53:24,826 --> 00:53:26,161
who you are anymore.

622
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:40,258
Please tell the VIP

623
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:43,470
that the assassination attempt
on President Park

624
00:53:43,553 --> 00:53:45,180
will remain a mystery,

625
00:53:45,972 --> 00:53:48,183
and that the administration
will be normalized soon.

626
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:52,312
The people

627
00:53:53,271 --> 00:53:54,648
will now think of me

628
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:57,859
as the next presidential candidate,
not Park Mu-jin.

629
00:53:58,944 --> 00:54:00,362
If President Park

630
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:04,574
didn't presumptuously try to find
an inside man within the government,

631
00:54:05,158 --> 00:54:08,119
the VIP wouldn't have taken such measures.

632
00:54:11,164 --> 00:54:12,540
Remember that.

633
00:54:13,625 --> 00:54:15,251
The VIP

634
00:54:16,044 --> 00:54:18,213
isn't fond of those who cross the line.

635
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:27,764
"Don't cross the line," is that it?

636
00:54:41,695 --> 00:54:43,405
THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA
BLUE HOUSE

637
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:44,948
I'll start with questions.

638
00:54:45,031 --> 00:54:46,449
-Here.
-Over here.

639
00:54:48,827 --> 00:54:52,622
The KOSPI stock index fell to below 2,000
and KOSDAQ plunged to below the 700 mark.

640
00:54:52,706 --> 00:54:54,040
Wasn't this a foreseeable crisis?

641
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:56,793
Next question. Actually,
I'll take all the questions first.

642
00:54:56,876 --> 00:54:59,004
-Here!
-I have one.

643
00:54:59,087 --> 00:55:00,630
Many experts raised concerns.

644
00:55:00,714 --> 00:55:03,008
Why was it decided to open the markets?

645
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:07,012
Pension investors are expected
to suffer the most damage.

646
00:55:07,095 --> 00:55:08,555
Is there a countermeasure?

647
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:10,640
Mr. Kim, please answer us.

648
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:13,101
-Does the administration...
-Is there...

649
00:55:13,184 --> 00:55:15,353
-Please answer this then.
-Over here!

650
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:27,824
Was this decided
by the Office of Economic Affairs

651
00:55:27,907 --> 00:55:30,118
or was it the decision
of Acting President Oh Yeong-seok?

652
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:38,543
The people want an answer, Mr. Kim

653
00:55:39,335 --> 00:55:41,087
Minister Oh Yeong-seok

654
00:55:41,796 --> 00:55:44,591
must want to turn in
his driver's license by now.

655
00:55:46,301 --> 00:55:49,345
He learned about
the economy only in books.

656
00:55:49,429 --> 00:55:53,058
He never really experienced anything
related to economy.

657
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:57,062
He's a rookie, by all means.

658
00:56:01,107 --> 00:56:03,318
Until President Park returns to office,

659
00:56:03,401 --> 00:56:05,403
he'll probably stay in the Blue House...

660
00:56:08,865 --> 00:56:11,367
only breathing in the fresh air it offers.

661
00:56:12,577 --> 00:56:13,828
What if it's the opposite?

662
00:56:15,914 --> 00:56:17,332
What if it isn't his inexperience,

663
00:56:17,999 --> 00:56:21,461
but a highly mapped out plan of his,
including this result?

664
00:56:22,587 --> 00:56:24,089
What happens then?

665
00:56:30,136 --> 00:56:32,555
It has been 19 hours already

666
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:35,850
since the sniper who targeted
President Park fled the scene.

667
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:38,561
Is there any progress on that front?

668
00:56:46,111 --> 00:56:50,115
-Do you have a suspect?
-Tell us about the investigation!

669
00:56:50,198 --> 00:56:51,991
-Do you have any leads?
-Is there any progress?

670
00:56:52,575 --> 00:56:54,369
Will there be any disciplinary action?

671
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:00,834
The sniper...

672
00:57:21,855 --> 00:57:24,482
May I answer that one myself?

673
00:57:48,506 --> 00:57:51,217
The sniper who tried
to assassinate President Park...

674
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:54,304
was killed.

675
00:57:58,892 --> 00:58:02,812
While the police and Troop 707
were chasing him,

676
00:58:03,396 --> 00:58:05,565
we suffered a casualty.

677
00:58:06,691 --> 00:58:08,526
Based on our judgment

678
00:58:10,069 --> 00:58:11,196
that we will not condone

679
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:15,074
any more innocent people being sacrificed,

680
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:16,701
it was a necessary decision.

681
00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:24,250
I would like to warn the attackers.

682
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:27,587
We will

683
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,173
never

684
00:58:31,174 --> 00:58:32,509
condone

685
00:58:33,718 --> 00:58:36,513
any threat to the safety

686
00:58:38,264 --> 00:58:40,475
or lives of our people.

687
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:43,728
We will...

688
00:58:45,104 --> 00:58:46,397
make sure...

689
00:58:48,441 --> 00:58:49,692
to punish you.

690
00:58:52,987 --> 00:58:56,783
PRESIDENT OH HAS DECLARED
A WAR AGAINST TERRORISTS

691
00:58:58,034 --> 00:59:00,828
Everyone is talking about Minister Oh.

692
00:59:00,912 --> 00:59:03,540
Search terms, news articles, photos.
Everything.

693
00:59:03,623 --> 00:59:05,708
This one photo summarized it well.

694
00:59:06,751 --> 00:59:08,795
The miraculous survivor, Oh Yeong-seok,

695
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:12,549
became the people's hero
worthy of the title.

696
00:59:12,632 --> 00:59:14,259
It's worse on social media.

697
00:59:14,342 --> 00:59:15,677
People are just terrible.

698
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:17,887
They're even comparing him
to President Park.

699
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:19,556
"They're polar opposites.

700
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:22,934
They're both Acting Presidents
but with different charisma."

701
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:31,484
This is a survey
regarding the top candidates.

702
00:59:33,528 --> 00:59:35,238
OH YEONG-SEOK, PARK MU-JIN,
YUN CHAN-GYEONG

703
00:59:36,489 --> 00:59:39,534
With a 41-percent,
Minister Oh easily surpassed

704
00:59:39,617 --> 00:59:41,744
Acting President Park and Yun Chan-gyeong

705
00:59:41,828 --> 00:59:43,037
and took the lead.

706
00:59:43,871 --> 00:59:47,709
No one has ever come close to receiving
a majority in the polls before.

707
00:59:48,376 --> 00:59:50,587
It's not like we didn't foresee this.

708
00:59:52,005 --> 00:59:53,214
Ever since the attack,

709
00:59:53,298 --> 00:59:55,967
our people were furious and afraid.

710
00:59:56,634 --> 00:59:57,927
After hearing

711
00:59:58,177 --> 01:00:00,471
about the sniper's execution
at the press conference,

712
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:02,724
I'm sure they felt relieved and reassured.

713
01:00:04,058 --> 01:00:07,061
At that moment, people's favor toward him

714
01:00:07,395 --> 01:00:08,646
skyrocketed

715
01:00:09,314 --> 01:00:10,440
immensely.

716
01:00:11,816 --> 01:00:13,484
At this rate,

717
01:00:13,693 --> 01:00:15,612
he'll become
the strongest presidential candidate.

718
01:00:16,946 --> 01:00:18,114
Good work.

719
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:24,287
JOYANCE FINANCE

720
01:00:24,370 --> 01:00:25,913
He's amazing.

721
01:00:26,372 --> 01:00:28,291
The indexes for KOSDAQ and KOSPI

722
01:00:28,583 --> 01:00:30,752
had been lower than ever,

723
01:00:31,419 --> 01:00:32,962
but they have stopped plummeting.

724
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:37,300
They have rebounded.

725
01:00:37,383 --> 01:00:39,260
That means the market has begun

726
01:00:40,303 --> 01:00:42,764
putting their trust in Minister Oh.

727
01:00:49,187 --> 01:00:51,105
PRESIDENT OH HAS DECLARED
A WAR AGAINST TERRORISTS

728
01:00:51,689 --> 01:00:54,942
You never know what will happen.

729
01:00:55,026 --> 01:00:57,612
You never know who'll be elected
until you count all the votes.

730
01:00:58,237 --> 01:01:01,282
Everyone claimed that Yun Chan-gyeong
would be the next president.

731
01:01:01,866 --> 01:01:03,910
The National Assembly Building collapsed

732
01:01:03,993 --> 01:01:06,120
and a big star was born.

733
01:01:06,913 --> 01:01:08,539
Our country is so dynamic.

734
01:01:08,623 --> 01:01:11,501
If we have to count the votes,
we don't know yet.

735
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:14,128
There are 40 days left.

736
01:01:14,212 --> 01:01:16,297
We'll only know
once President Park wakes up.

737
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:18,007
It'll be difficult.

738
01:01:18,925 --> 01:01:20,968
There are 3 things one needs
to become President.

739
01:01:21,803 --> 01:01:25,264
A story, charisma,

740
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:26,349
and luck.

741
01:01:27,058 --> 01:01:28,851
Who do you think

742
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:30,812
possesses all three?

743
01:01:35,149 --> 01:01:38,695
ACTING PRESIDENT OH, DIFFERENT CHARISMA
THAN ACTING PRESIDENT PARK

744
01:03:20,671 --> 01:03:23,299
In one day, he filled the void
during President Park's absence

745
01:03:23,382 --> 01:03:25,426
and became the top presidential candidate.

746
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:28,054
Isn't he what you were looking for?
The one who knows how to win.

747
01:03:28,137 --> 01:03:30,181
Minister Oh has a better chance
of winning.

748
01:03:30,264 --> 01:03:31,808
I'm worried

749
01:03:31,891 --> 01:03:33,684
what he'll do
until President Park wakes up.

750
01:03:33,768 --> 01:03:35,102
Who do you think

751
01:03:35,478 --> 01:03:36,813
is the whistle-blower?

752
01:03:36,896 --> 01:03:38,689
Are you suspecting me?

753
01:03:38,773 --> 01:03:42,693
Does he need to return to the Blue House?

754
01:03:42,777 --> 01:03:45,363
The one whom the nation has chosen

755
01:03:45,446 --> 01:03:47,156
to be in charge of state affairs

756
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:48,533
is me.

757
