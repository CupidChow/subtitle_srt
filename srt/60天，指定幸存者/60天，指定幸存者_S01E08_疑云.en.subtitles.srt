1
00:00:53,720 --> 00:01:00,727
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
PLACES AND EVENTS ARE FICTIONAL

2
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:08,193
Now, please take an oath.

3
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:20,246
"Oath.

4
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:23,208
As a candidate
for a voter-nominated office,

5
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,711
I solemnly declare and affirm
that what I state shall be the truth,

6
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:30,757
the whole truth and nothing but the truth.

7
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:34,260
March 22, 2019.

8
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:38,389
Candidate Oh Yeong-seok."

9
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,479
The confirmation hearing
for the minister nominee

10
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:46,147
is going well.

11
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:48,775
The nonparty cabinet is the result of

12
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:52,612
a joint effort between the ruling
and the opposition parties.

13
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:55,698
Most importantly, it shows
the government's strong determination

14
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:58,451
to ensure a fair, seamless
presidential election,

15
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:00,161
which will take place in 40 days.

16
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,164
CONFIRMATION HEARING WELL UNDERWAY

17
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:07,460
When the cabinet reshuffle is completed,

18
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:09,087
people will realize that President Park

19
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:13,383
was like a relief pitcher who took
the mound in the midst of a crisis.

20
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:16,136
Mr. President

21
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:21,266
will outrank all other candidates
by a wide margin.

22
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:24,644
A pitcher who takes the mound
before he's warmed up

23
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:26,437
is highly likely to get injured.

24
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:29,023
It'll only cut his career short.

25
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:31,234
To run for President,

26
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:32,777
he'll have to resign from office

27
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:36,281
at least 30 days prior to the election.

28
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:39,033
He can't run

29
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:41,077
as a candidate this time.

30
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:44,956
As for the Acting President role,
the newly appointed ministers can fill in.

31
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,419
Is President Park in agreement with you?

32
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:52,714
Has he agreed

33
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,757
to run

34
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:57,051
for President?

35
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,699
Would you consider
running for President, sir?

36
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:23,328
Not as the Acting President,

37
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:26,122
but as the president
of the Republic of Korea.

38
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:30,293
Do you think

39
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,172
I'm suitable for that position?

40
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,427
I think you can win.

41
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:44,182
As far as I know, you're the candidate

42
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:46,226
who is most likely to win the election.

43
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:05,411
Mr. President.

44
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:13,127
About the bomber, Myung Hae-joon...
Where is he now?

45
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:19,717
I cannot disclose that information
for national security's sake.

46
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:22,679
Are you sure that he's alive?

47
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:24,222
What?

48
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,102
That's...

49
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,353
Is the rumor true?

50
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:34,732
Some are saying that the bomber,
Myung Hae-joon, is dead.

51
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:37,110
-What?
-He's dead?

52
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:38,319
-Myung Hae-joon?
-Seriously?

53
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:39,654
Did something really happen?

54
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:42,782
There's a witness who saw his corpse

55
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:46,411
being transferred
from the DSSC to the NFS.

56
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:48,204
-What?
-To the National Forensic Service?

57
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,748
We received a tip
that one of the four corpses,

58
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,668
which hasn't been collected
by the bereaved,

59
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,212
is Myung Hae-joon.

60
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:57,505
Is it true?

61
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:00,174
Did he die during the interrogation?

62
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:01,926
Was he tortured or abused in any way?

63
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,137
-Please tell us.
-What happened to Myung Hae-joon?

64
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:05,972
-Tell us.
-Is he dead?

65
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:07,682
-Tell us the truth.
-Please make a comment.

66
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:10,435
-What happened during the interrogation?
-Tell us the truth.

67
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,104
Myung Hae-joon...

68
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:15,481
During his interrogation,

69
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:18,985
he was neither tortured
nor abused in any way.

70
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:20,278
Are you saying he's alive?

71
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:21,487
-Tell us.
-Is he alive?

72
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:23,323
-Then where is he now?
-Is he alive?

73
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:32,749
Raising groundless speculations
regarding him

74
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:35,209
may pose a serious threat
to national security.

75
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:36,377
I can't say anything else.

76
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:38,629
-Then is he alive?
-He wasn't tortured at all?

77
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:40,757
-Tell us the truth.
-Answer the question.

78
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:51,184
THE BLUE HOUSE

79
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:52,810
NCND.

80
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:54,937
"Neither confirm nor deny."

81
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,898
Their strategy is the Glomar response.

82
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,654
I have to say, the tip is quite detailed.

83
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:07,158
Well, the fact that they can't
firmly deny the speculation

84
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:10,369
means that it's true. Right?

85
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:15,917
Myung Hae-joon was murdered?

86
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:18,711
By who?

87
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,755
Well, we'll have to find out.

88
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:25,384
Hey, Sin-yeong.

89
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:29,222
You're no longer
in the Blue House press corps.

90
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:33,893
I can't wait until they call me
and tell me that dinner is ready.

91
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:35,228
I'm hungry,

92
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:37,605
and I can already smell the food.

93
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,440
The reporters have caught on to it,

94
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:42,110
so there will be all sorts of speculations
regarding Myung Hae-joon.

95
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:43,528
Yes, probably.

96
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:46,447
I always thought

97
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:50,034
freedom of the press
would be guaranteed in the South,

98
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:51,744
unlike the North, where I was born.

99
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:55,039
However, all I can do now

100
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:58,126
is saying that we can't confirm it
at the moment

101
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:00,503
with a stern face
in front of the press corps,

102
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:02,505
who insist that the people
have the right to know.

103
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:05,550
I'm an incompetent communications officer.

104
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:07,718
A press secretary who's a coward.

105
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,304
If we tell them

106
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:12,473
the truth,

107
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,726
will it help us catch the one
behind Myung Hae-joon's murder?

108
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:20,440
Broadcasting the details
of our investigation in real time

109
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:23,943
will only tell the bombers
how they can flee. Am I wrong?

110
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:28,448
At the moment, national security

111
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:30,908
matters more
than the people's right to know.

112
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:33,035
It's for the public good.

113
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,749
You're able to judge situations quickly,

114
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,710
and you can handle crises well.

115
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,046
Who can do a better job

116
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,298
than you?

117
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:49,510
Well...

118
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:52,722
I do have to say that you whine more

119
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:54,974
than I thought you would.

120
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:11,699
What do you think of a man
who likes to whine a little?

121
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:14,619
Go on in.

122
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,340
The reporters aren't the only problem.

123
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:30,676
The opposition party will make
a big fuss over it if it's made public.

124
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,970
You saw what Ms. Yun did.

125
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:34,972
She won't even hesitate
to get you impeached.

126
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:37,099
She'll launch
a full-on political attack against you.

127
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,769
But this is about national security,

128
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:42,939
which both she and the opposition party
consider the number one priority.

129
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:45,525
It is also their favorite card

130
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:48,069
because it can help them
bring their supporters together.

131
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:50,321
Whether you want
to take part in it or not,

132
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:51,989
they're getting ready for the election.

133
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,199
It's like a black hole.

134
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:56,327
They'll turn every situation
into a political strife.

135
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,956
In Ms. Yun's eyes,
the Blue House will look like

136
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:02,208
a presidential candidate's
campaign office.

137
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:04,252
Her competitor, whom she must beat

138
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:06,212
at all costs.

139
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:10,341
Then our priority should be
finding out who killed Myung Hae-joon.

140
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:12,385
To ensure national security

141
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:14,845
as well as to win the political battle.

142
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:17,139
I'll contact the NIS right away

143
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,559
to see if they've obtained any clues
regarding the killer.

144
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:27,358
Na-gyeong!

145
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:33,072
I found him.

146
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:41,038
Room 119.

147
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:44,166
I found him in the security footage
from the camera in front

148
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,668
of the air-raid shelter.

149
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,090
Do you see him?

150
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:53,009
Zoom in on the face.

151
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:01,642
Look at my eyes.

152
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:07,148
I found him in the security footage
recovered

153
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,899
by the Digital Forensics Center.

154
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:12,445
And thanks to that,
my eyes are all bloodshot now.

155
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:13,988
Don't you see it?

156
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,286
Dedication isn't a virtue.

157
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:21,829
It's our duty.

158
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:27,960
Goodness.

159
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,421
Do you take classes or what?

160
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:33,299
Who taught you to talk
like a stuffy old man?

161
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:45,978
Right here.

162
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:47,480
At 3:14 p.m.

163
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:50,149
It was right before the explosion.

164
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:51,984
This is him, right?

165
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:53,736
Assemblyman Oh Yeong-seok.

166
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:07,875
Mr. Chairman

167
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,336
and all members of the Committee.

168
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:12,797
I am here today

169
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:15,341
to prove to you all

170
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:18,469
that my capabilities and moral standards
are well suited for the role of

171
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:19,887
the Minister of National Defense.

172
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:20,971
We found it.

173
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:25,267
It's firm evidence that shows
the bombers had designated Assemblyman Oh

174
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:27,186
as a survivor before the attack.

175
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:35,152
Assemblyman Oh was caught on
the camera in front of Room 119

176
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:37,780
at 3:14 p.m.,
which was right before the explosion.

177
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:45,121
We must report this to the Blue House
immediately,

178
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:47,123
before the confirmation hearing ends.

179
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:51,752
The DSSC, which is partially responsible
for Myung Hae-joon's death,

180
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:53,671
operates under National Defense.

181
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,382
If Oh Yeong-seok is appointed
Minister of National Defense,

182
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:58,801
he'll try to bury this case.

183
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:52,771
We were waiting for you, Agent Jeong.

184
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:56,734
How is the investigation going?
Any progress?

185
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:58,777
We found

186
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,113
the killer, sir.

187
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:06,994
You found the killer?

188
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:10,289
Who is it? Where is the killer now?

189
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:17,338
Agent Jeong?

190
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,013
Who is the person
that killed Myung Hae-joon?

191
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,266
It's me, sir.

192
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:36,524
I killed Myung Hae-joon.

193
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:44,740
What did you...

194
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:46,784
just say?

195
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:50,204
I killed Myung Hae-joon,

196
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:51,539
Mr. President.

197
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:11,600
DAY 42: DOUBT
EPISODE 8

198
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:15,771
State your team, name, and position.

199
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:19,858
I'm the chief of
NIS' Counterterrorism Task Force,

200
00:14:20,859 --> 00:14:22,069
Jeong Han-mo.

201
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,369
You said

202
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:34,290
Agent Jeong is well respected
within the NIS, right?

203
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,585
Yes, I'm sure he is.

204
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:41,589
From the Counterintelligence Task Force
to the Counterterrorism Center,

205
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:46,093
he's been on the so-called elite path
at the NIS.

206
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:57,062
Then why do you think he did
such a reckless thing?

207
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:04,361
If he thought about the career he's built

208
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:06,030
or his family even just once...

209
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:08,365
It couldn't have been an easy decision,

210
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,911
considering his age and the fact
that he has a family to support.

211
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:18,000
Why do you think Agent Jeong
killed Myung Hae-joon?

212
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:22,421
He deserved to die.

213
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:26,133
Our President and many innocent civilians

214
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:28,802
lost their lives because of the attack,

215
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:31,263
and yet he neither repented

216
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,766
nor begged for forgiveness.

217
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:35,643
I...

218
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:41,857
I...

219
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:45,027
I did

220
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,405
the best thing that I could do.

221
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:52,618
Something's wrong.

222
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:54,870
You know
he'd never do something like that.

223
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:58,165
I'm his witness and his alibi, sir.

224
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:01,377
I was with Han-mo
the whole time we were investigating

225
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,586
Myung Hae-joon at the DSSC.

226
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:05,839
If it's actually true,
there's no way I wouldn't know about it.

227
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:08,217
I'm just as frustrated as you are.

228
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:11,470
They're saying he has confessed to it!

229
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,264
It's not like he was tortured or coerced.

230
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:16,892
He walked in there
and confessed to the murder.

231
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:19,478
What else needs to be said?

232
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,418
What are you doing now?

233
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:44,962
Agent Han?

234
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:49,550
From this moment forward,
all the data regarding Myung Hae-joon case

235
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:51,677
will be transferred
to State Bureau of Investigation.

236
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:55,889
You can't just do that
without any discussion--

237
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:59,059
You've been suspended, Agent Han.

238
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:03,313
Would you please come with us
to the office?

239
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:05,441
According to the regulation,

240
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:08,944
there will be an interrogation to find out
if you're Agent Jeong's accomplice.

241
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:11,989
Accomplice?

242
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:15,034
Please cooperate.
Otherwise, we'll force you to.

243
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:19,371
Hey, don't forget
to take things like USB sticks.

244
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:21,665
Get her!

245
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,292
Get her!

246
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:25,502
Agent Han!

247
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:27,671
Stop!

248
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:30,632
Stop there!

249
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,509
Hey! Han Na-Gyeong!

250
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:38,682
Damn it.

251
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:39,808
Hey, Han Na-Gyeong!

252
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,810
Stop there right now!

253
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:45,230
Hey, stop!

254
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:47,066
Damn it!

255
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:49,401
Stop, Han Na-Gyeong!

256
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:51,737
Hey!

257
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,031
Stop her!

258
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:00,913
You stop there!

259
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,083
Hey!

260
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,502
Hey! Stop!

261
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:09,797
Stop the car!

262
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:12,716
Damn it!

263
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:24,144
You won't have to worry about
being tracked for a while.

264
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:28,524
This is a stolen car that has been
in the office parking lot for ages.

265
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:36,448
These are a copy of the things
Han-mo tried to report to the Blue House.

266
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:45,707
Stop the car. I'll go by myself from here.

267
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:51,880
If you're away for too long,
you might get suspected too.

268
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:08,021
Promise me

269
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,565
even if things go wrong,

270
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:11,650
you won't mention my name
during the interrogation.

271
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:16,071
What?

272
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:19,825
I can't trust you.

273
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:24,163
Oh, well. Na-Gyeong.

274
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:26,540
You might as well just make this work.

275
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:28,584
You must make this work.

276
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:31,879
Don't get caught and don't get hurt.

277
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:37,551
Be careful. Please.

278
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,019
Ji-won.

279
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,064
Thanks.

280
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:07,706
Mr. Oh.

281
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:11,418
You defeated the North Korean army
seven years ago

282
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:15,214
at the Battle of Baengnyeong, right?

283
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:18,800
That was the first battle we won
ever since the Korean War.

284
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:20,302
Am I right?

285
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:24,890
We did defeat the North Korean army,

286
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:29,228
but we didn't win
the Battle of Baengnyeong.

287
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:36,485
Fourteen members of my troupe

288
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,906
lost their precious lives.

289
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,452
As the commander of the battle,

290
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,457
I think about my responsibility...

291
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:55,295
for the defeat every single day.

292
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:04,596
Agent Han?

293
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,018
You wanted me to call you once
I was certain about the bomber.

294
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:12,437
Assemblyman Oh

295
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:15,023
must not become
the Minister of National Defense.

296
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:20,445
Are you saying he's unqualified somehow?

297
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:25,575
Is this related to the blueprint
of the National Assembly building?

298
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:27,911
We'll talk about the details in person.

299
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,415
I'm on my way to the hearing.

300
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:40,048
Mr. Oh.

301
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,843
-Here's the next question.
-Sir.

302
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:48,348
May I suggest we take a short break?

303
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:53,520
Before we confirm the hearing report
about Mr. Oh,

304
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:56,648
there's something I'd like to discuss
with our party members.

305
00:21:58,942 --> 00:21:59,901
Please, sir.

306
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:05,490
As Ms. Yun suggested,
we'll take a short break.

307
00:23:02,255 --> 00:23:03,507
It's getting too late.

308
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:05,592
It's almost time.

309
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:15,811
Do you think it's reliable information?

310
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:22,442
I proposed her a deal with the blueprint.

311
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:25,028
Usually, people would say yes
even if they didn't mean it.

312
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:26,404
There's nothing to lose.

313
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:28,240
She got an offer from the opposing party

314
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:29,950
when the administration
is about to change.

315
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:34,871
But Agent Han turn the offer down.

316
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:37,541
I trust her.

317
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:44,506
AGENT HAN NA-GYEONG

318
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:48,635
Please stay away.
There was an accident here.

319
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:53,932
-There's been an accident.
-Please step away.

320
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:55,142
Excuse me.

321
00:23:56,726 --> 00:23:58,645
Ma'am. Ma'am.

322
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:01,481
Have you heard from the informant yet?

323
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:04,442
It's been an hour already.

324
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:07,863
We need to finish it up by today, ma'am.

325
00:24:08,446 --> 00:24:12,492
She said he's unqualified for the position
of Minister of National Defense.

326
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:15,328
Security is important now more than ever.

327
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:16,621
This is about...

328
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:19,833
appointing Minister of National Defense.

329
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:23,253
Please just trust me
and give it some more time.

330
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:24,921
I trust you.

331
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:27,883
But will the other members
trust you as well?

332
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:32,804
You failed to scout Assemblyman Oh,

333
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:36,266
and everyone in there knows that.

334
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:40,729
You were against establishing
a nonparty cabinet too.

335
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:46,610
If it gets any more delayed,

336
00:24:46,693 --> 00:24:48,528
they will say things

337
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:51,865
like you're trying to ruin the hearing
and besmirch him out of personal reasons.

338
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:02,500
Ma'am, can you hear me?

339
00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:07,964
Ma'am.

340
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:21,770
Ma'am, please stay...

341
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,563
where you are.

342
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:19,619
You did great.

343
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:20,870
Thank you.

344
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:22,289
Congratulations.

345
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:23,707
Thank you.

346
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:24,833
I'll see you around.

347
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:26,251
Congratulations, Assemblyman Oh.

348
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,256
Your hard work didn't go unnoticed too.

349
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:37,053
You managed to survive not only
on the battlefield but even a bombing.

350
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:42,142
That kind of luck
never strikes a person even once,

351
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:43,435
but it happened

352
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:45,603
to you twice.

353
00:26:47,522 --> 00:26:48,606
Luck?

354
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:51,776
Do you believe
you'll always be this lucky?

355
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,698
At least for today, it seems like

356
00:26:57,615 --> 00:26:59,534
Lady Luck is on my side,

357
00:27:00,618 --> 00:27:01,828
not yours.

358
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:03,830
I'll see you then.

359
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:12,797
Assemblyman Oh's confirmation hearing

360
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:15,091
just ended, sir.

361
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:20,096
His appointment was accepted
without any specific hitches.

CERTIFICATE OF APPOINTMENT

363
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:31,483
Is it too far into the night
to meet Assemblyman Oh?

364
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:33,443
What is it about?

365
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:37,989
He was here on that day.

367
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:43,495
The day Agent Jeong came here
to debrief me on the interrogation.

368
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:46,206
Something about him felt off.

369
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:47,874
Agent Jeong?

370
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:49,542
Yes.

371
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:53,254
He said he had a lead
on the Myung Hae-joon Case,

372
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:54,631
but quickly changed his word.

373
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:57,384
It's as if he had become
a different person.

374
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:03,765
I want to know

375
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:06,601
if Mr. Oh thinks the same way.

376
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:08,937
What's there to be curious about?

377
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:10,522
The answer is clear as day.

378
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:13,733
A witness who holds
the key to the investigation

379
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:16,528
suddenly changes his or her statement?

380
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:21,366
That only happens when
someone who shouldn't hear it is present.

381
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:24,202
Who was in the room with you?

382
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:27,580
Do you have any leads?

383
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:29,833
Yes, I believe so.

384
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:31,084
This way.

385
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:33,128
I'm glad to hear that.

386
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,680
It's a relief.

387
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:49,394
I had no idea you'd be here too.

00:29:18,214 --> 00:29:19,340
Yes, over here.

391
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,890
Make sure it's in line.

392
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:28,266
Nice.

393
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:32,854
-Ms. Kim.
-Yes?

394
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:35,273
No one will give you a merit badge

395
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:38,818
for saving duct tape in the Blue House.

396
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:41,529
Don't you know that
this is President Park's first time

397
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:42,989
at an event like this?

398
00:29:43,072 --> 00:29:44,783
Look where you marked, for example.

399
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:49,120
All right. One, two, three.

400
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:50,371
The spot...

401
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:53,082
I see you marked the right spot.

402
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:03,468
Secretary Cha, did you call for me?

403
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:05,386
Gosh, look at the dust on your suit.

404
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:06,596
And who are you again?

405
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:08,223
-Sorry?
-Let me ask you all this.

406
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:11,351
Raise your hand
if you heard me calling for him.

407
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:13,478
No?

408
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:16,189
Ms. Kim, you're doing a great job.

CERTIFICATE OF APPOINTMENT
OH YEONG-SEOK

412
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:34,541
Minister candidate Oh Yeong-seok's
approval rating has skyrocketed.

413
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:37,585
With a rating of 19.8 percent,

414
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:40,672
he's even ahead of Yun Chan-gyeong
in the presidential race.

415
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:44,300
He's in second place
right behind President Park.

416
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:46,177
He must've

417
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:50,557
won over the public
at his hearing yesterday.

418
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:54,769
His rating has been measured
ever since he gave his eulogy,

419
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:56,688
and it's been on the rise.

420
00:30:57,897 --> 00:30:59,274
It's quite funny if you ask me.

421
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:05,488
The two with the highest approval ratings

422
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:08,449
are both survivors of this recent attack.

423
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,493
It reflects how much

424
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:12,996
the people were terrorized by it.

425
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:16,207
That fear had them
make heroes out of the survivors.

426
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:20,086
It was one heck of a move
to have Mr. Oh join the nonparty cabinet.

427
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:23,756
I'm sure it'll immensely help
President Park run the government.

428
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,009
Good job.

429
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:37,604
I had a tip

430
00:31:38,354 --> 00:31:41,149
that implied how Assemblyman Oh
is unfit to be a minister.

431
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:46,112
The tip came from Agent Han Na-gyeong
of the NIS Terrorism Task Force.

432
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:48,948
Please have a seat.

433
00:31:56,497 --> 00:31:58,833
What disqualifies him of being appointed?

434
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:01,252
What was the tip?

435
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:03,504
I don't know yet.

436
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:08,635
She called me on the road
and asked me to stall the hearing.

437
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:12,180
I haven't heard back from her
even up until this moment though.

438
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:15,808
Around the same time,

439
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:18,978
a big car accident occurred
near where the hearing was being held.

440
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:20,480
Odd, right?

441
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:23,775
However, no one with injuries
from a car crash

442
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:26,569
was admitted to
any of the hospitals near the site.

443
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:30,365
Do you think that
Agent Han was a victim of the accident?

444
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:32,116
I don't think it was an accident.

445
00:32:34,243 --> 00:32:35,453
Agent Han told me

446
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:39,874
that she had definitive proof regarding
the National Assembly Building bombing.

447
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:44,128
She was even adamant about
Assemblyman Oh being unfit for Minister.

448
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:48,633
But then she disappeared
without a single trace.

449
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:53,346
Do you suspect Assemblyman Oh?

450
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:58,226
And you're suspecting me.

451
00:32:58,810 --> 00:32:59,769
Mr. Oh

452
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:02,855
has devoted his life to this country.

453
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:06,734
And you think I'm crossing into
a dangerous territory by accusing him.

454
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:09,153
I'm here without any proof after all.

455
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:12,657
You must think it's to put a dent
in your nonparty cabinet.

456
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:21,165
I didn't actually think
you'd agree with me easily.

457
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:22,583
Why not?

458
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:25,962
You're probably scared
because I could be right.

459
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:30,925
It would be even scarier to admit

460
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:34,470
that you were wrong
in appointing him as Minister.

461
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:36,014
Aren't I right?

462
00:33:48,651 --> 00:33:50,486
Please take care of this. Thanks.

463
00:33:58,870 --> 00:33:59,996
You're actually

464
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:02,665
more competent that I gave you credit for.

465
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,711
President Park
has become a true politician.

466
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:23,436
Secretary Cha, call the NIS.

467
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:25,021
I need to verify something.

468
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:00,223
I heard that Agent Han
found definitive proof regarding

469
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:02,475
the National Assembly Building bombing.
Is this true?

470
00:35:02,558 --> 00:35:03,476
Sorry?

471
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:06,104
What do you mean by definitive proof?

472
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:10,566
Oh, I must apologize, sir.

473
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:14,570
Chief Jeong and Agent Han
were asked to debrief you in person,

474
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:17,657
-so I am not aware of all the findings--
-Agent Han.

475
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:19,992
Where is she right now?

476
00:35:21,744 --> 00:35:25,206
There's an issue with Agent Han
at the moment.

477
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:31,045
The State Bureau of Investigation
informed her

478
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:34,173
that they'd be looking into her
being Agent Jeong's accomplice.

479
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:36,926
She must've gotten scared
because she's gone AWOL.

480
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:41,097
The agency

481
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:44,100
is doing its best
to locate her as we speak.

482
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:56,487
Please report back to me
as soon as you find her.

483
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:59,323
I need to ask her something in person.

484
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:05,872
Yes, Mr. President.

485
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:58,007
Hey, you're up.

486
00:37:07,683 --> 00:37:09,060
Drink this.

487
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:13,856
What happened?

488
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:17,610
How did I get here?

489
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:20,613
You took the words right out of my mouth.

490
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:23,199
I received a call.

491
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:25,826
They said you were in an accident
and asked me for my address.

492
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:28,246
A call?

493
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:31,249
From whom?

494
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:36,504
Let's check the caller ID.

495
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:48,975
What's the number?

496
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:53,479
It was from a payphone

497
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,898
somewhere near
the Seoul Metropolitan Council.

498
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:57,900
A payphone?

499
00:37:58,276 --> 00:37:59,402
Who could've been?

500
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:02,113
The bell rang, so I opened the door.

501
00:38:02,196 --> 00:38:04,699
You were the only one outside.
Don't you remember?

502
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:25,928
Do you remember who it was?

503
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:28,931
No.

504
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:44,488
MS. YUN CHAN-GYEONG

505
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:50,536
Why aren't you answering?

506
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:53,497
The only person who knew
I was headed to the hearing

507
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:55,458
was Ms. Yun.

508
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:01,172
So the car accident wasn't random.

509
00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:07,219
CALL HISTORY

511
00:39:13,642 --> 00:39:15,478
Ji-won, we can only

512
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:17,938
trust each other right now.

513
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:28,741
What about the hearing?

514
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:32,161
Was Assemblyman Oh's appointment approved?

515
00:39:36,582 --> 00:39:38,000
Congratulations.

516
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:41,796
I heard that

517
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:44,340
your appointment was approved
with a unanimous vote.

518
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:46,342
Thank you.

519
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:51,972
I'm guessing you didn't
hear the news though.

520
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:56,644
The head of the congressional hearing
informed me

521
00:39:57,728 --> 00:40:00,731
that Agent Han of the NIS
tipped Ms. Yun off

522
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:04,068
about there being
a reason for disqualification.

523
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:10,074
Although, it turned out to be nothing.

524
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:16,414
Why do you think Agent Han said so though?

525
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:21,043
She's not exactly in a position
to make false accusations like that.

526
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:25,965
Agent Han

527
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:27,842
lost a loved one

528
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:29,009
in the attack.

529
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:35,015
I was told she lost her fiancé during

530
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:37,893
the National Assembly Building bombing.

531
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:41,313
He died

532
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:44,024
while I lived.

533
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:48,279
She's been suspicious of my survival

534
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:49,780
from the get-go.

535
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,120
No matter how many times it's explained,

536
00:40:57,496 --> 00:40:59,290
even though it's the truth,

537
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:02,001
it'll be hard for her to accept.

538
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:05,838
I've been there myself.

539
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:10,926
After the Battle of Baengnyeong?

540
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:15,347
Living in South Korea

541
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:17,975
only ends in two ways.

542
00:41:19,351 --> 00:41:21,145
You either become a victim one day

543
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:24,857
or the bereaved.

544
00:41:27,776 --> 00:41:29,612
That day at sea,

545
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:34,408
I asked myself over and over again

546
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:37,203
why those innocent young souls had to die.

547
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:40,539
I just couldn't accept the truth.

548
00:41:42,958 --> 00:41:44,460
I couldn't believe it.

549
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:49,381
However,

550
00:41:50,424 --> 00:41:52,551
nobody gave me an answer.

551
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:57,681
The conservatives
who uses national security to score votes

552
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:01,101
took advantage of us,

553
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:04,563
and the progressives
who cry peace for their votes

554
00:42:06,273 --> 00:42:07,983
turned a blind eye.

555
00:42:11,153 --> 00:42:12,029
Is that why

556
00:42:13,113 --> 00:42:14,990
you got into politics?

557
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:19,745
I chose a path
where I could find the answers myself.

558
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:24,333
And Agent Han

559
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:27,211
is one of the people

560
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:29,588
that I wish

561
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:31,924
to speak for.

562
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:55,531
What time is the investiture
for the new ministers?

563
00:42:55,614 --> 00:42:57,241
It's at 2 p.m., ma'am.

564
00:42:57,908 --> 00:43:01,745
Will President Park appoint
Assemblyman Oh as a minister?

565
00:43:02,329 --> 00:43:03,247
I don't know,

566
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:05,332
but it feels like I'm being evaluated.

567
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:06,542
Excuse me?

568
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:09,044
If he trusts me as a politician,

569
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:10,754
he'll reconsider.

570
00:43:11,463 --> 00:43:13,632
If he appoints Assemblyman Oh,

571
00:43:14,508 --> 00:43:16,677
won't that mean he doesn't trust me?

572
00:43:18,345 --> 00:43:19,555
I wonder

573
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:22,558
what kind of choice
President Park will make.

574
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:44,413
I've chosen to answer myself.

575
00:43:56,008 --> 00:43:58,761
It's time to leave, sir.

576
00:43:58,844 --> 00:44:00,638
The investiture will start soon.

577
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:06,185
Okay.

578
00:45:45,784 --> 00:45:47,786
You'd like to postpone the investiture?

579
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:49,496
If you do that now,

580
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:52,624
wouldn't the media
come up with wild speculations?

581
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:54,960
Rumors about your health,
conflict within the Blue House,

582
00:45:55,043 --> 00:45:56,712
the Blue House playing a power game...

583
00:45:56,795 --> 00:45:59,298
There will be various rumors.
Please help me out here.

584
00:45:59,381 --> 00:46:00,507
Mr. Kim.

585
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:03,677
I need time...

586
00:46:04,636 --> 00:46:05,637
to verify the candidates.

587
00:46:06,638 --> 00:46:07,514
I'll leave...

588
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:10,309
the media up to you.

589
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:17,524
Do you plan to withdraw

590
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:19,610
Assemblyman Oh's nomination?

591
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:24,698
You can't do that, sir.

592
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:26,742
Assemblyman Oh

593
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:29,578
is a symbolic member
of the nonparty cabinet.

594
00:46:30,162 --> 00:46:31,538
Withdrawing for any reason,

595
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:34,875
would only mean the Blue House
failed in personnel verification.

596
00:46:37,085 --> 00:46:40,422
The opposing party will use this

597
00:46:41,006 --> 00:46:43,634
as an excuse to annul the nonparty cabinet

598
00:46:44,426 --> 00:46:46,678
and say it was bad government.

599
00:46:47,387 --> 00:46:50,474
You're the biggest threat
to Assemblywoman Yun

600
00:46:50,557 --> 00:46:52,100
as a presidential candidate.

601
00:46:54,728 --> 00:46:56,605
Other than Assemblywoman Yun's claim,

602
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:58,357
we currently have no evidence

603
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:01,401
on the suspicions of Assemblyman Oh, sir.

604
00:47:02,277 --> 00:47:03,362
Assemblywoman Yun

605
00:47:03,445 --> 00:47:06,365
was trying to get you impeached
just a few days ago.

606
00:47:06,865 --> 00:47:08,575
She's a master in politics.

607
00:47:08,742 --> 00:47:10,702
She may have other intentions, sir.

608
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:11,787
What should I do?

609
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:13,705
Should I call the ceremony hall?

610
00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:15,499
It isn't too late yet.

611
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:25,634
Let me ask you one thing.

612
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:27,970
Isn't the hearing

613
00:47:28,554 --> 00:47:30,222
a verification process

614
00:47:30,597 --> 00:47:32,099
of candidates by the National Assembly?

615
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:37,521
The opposing party

616
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:39,147
asked for a verification,

617
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:41,608
and I just faithfully complied to it.

618
00:47:43,318 --> 00:47:44,903
Have I created a controversy

619
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:47,990
that you have to object to?

620
00:48:08,635 --> 00:48:09,886
Then

621
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:11,805
when you met with Assemblyman Oh,

622
00:48:11,888 --> 00:48:14,683
did you find him suspicious in any way?

623
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:16,059
It's the opposite.

624
00:48:16,143 --> 00:48:18,437
Then why are you taking such a big chance?

625
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:21,648
Don't you see
what Assemblywoman Yun wants?

626
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:23,650
Assemblyman Oh is someone everyone--

627
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:25,527
I don't know what Assemblywoman Yun wants

628
00:48:25,986 --> 00:48:27,988
or what kind of person Assemblyman Oh is.

629
00:48:28,947 --> 00:48:32,242
I want to trust them, but can't.
As for now, I don't even know

630
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:33,994
whether they are friend or foe.

631
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:38,040
So I've decided to choose neither of them.

632
00:48:38,123 --> 00:48:40,250
-Mr. President.
-What I believe in...

633
00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:44,087
are the principles and system
of our administration.

634
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:48,008
It's controlled our nation so far.

635
00:48:51,553 --> 00:48:54,514
Until Assemblyman Oh is verified,

636
00:48:57,059 --> 00:48:59,227
I don't plan to appoint him
Minister of National Defense.

637
00:49:01,063 --> 00:49:02,439
The nonparty cabinet

638
00:49:03,899 --> 00:49:07,611
was a test to verify
your administrative ability.

639
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:10,697
If you postpone the investiture

640
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:13,283
and withdraw his nomination,

641
00:49:14,576 --> 00:49:17,913
that will clearly become

642
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:21,416
your error and misadministration.

643
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:24,127
Your approval rating
will definitely plunge.

644
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:25,712
Are you okay with that?

645
00:49:26,546 --> 00:49:28,215
You want me to be
a presidential candidate?

646
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:29,508
Yes.

647
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:36,556
I can't be the candidate that has
a good chance of winning

648
00:49:37,849 --> 00:49:39,601
like you want me to be.

649
00:49:43,772 --> 00:49:44,690
That's my answer.

650
00:49:51,905 --> 00:49:52,989
Yes, sir.

651
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:04,167
I'll have the investiture...

652
00:50:06,128 --> 00:50:09,256
postponed as you wish, sir.

653
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:37,659
What did he say?

654
00:50:39,161 --> 00:50:41,496
He just isn't used to this.

655
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:44,249
Taking chances on political matters

656
00:50:44,666 --> 00:50:45,792
or how the Blue House works.

657
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:51,006
He isn't used to it?

658
00:50:52,674 --> 00:50:55,343
The President isn't desperate enough.

659
00:50:56,678 --> 00:50:57,596
I

660
00:50:58,263 --> 00:50:59,598
think every day

661
00:50:59,681 --> 00:51:02,267
that during the previous government,
we should've used the power

662
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:04,060
we had to fight and win

663
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:06,480
against the opposing party
or anyone that were against us

664
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:07,731
by any means.

665
00:51:09,065 --> 00:51:10,776
If we didn't give them an excuse

666
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:13,069
or even the smallest reason to attack us,

667
00:51:13,153 --> 00:51:17,115
if we pushed back harder,
if I just insisted to the President...

668
00:51:20,452 --> 00:51:21,661
more strongly...

669
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:27,626
Then...

670
00:51:29,252 --> 00:51:30,504
he wouldn't...

671
00:51:31,671 --> 00:51:32,798
have been ridiculed...

672
00:51:34,382 --> 00:51:36,802
throughout his entire term,

673
00:51:38,637 --> 00:51:39,638
nor...

674
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:44,935
would he have gone down in history
so pathetically.

675
00:51:53,693 --> 00:51:55,278
President Yang Jin-man...

676
00:51:58,824 --> 00:52:02,160
was the kindest person I've ever met.

677
00:52:19,177 --> 00:52:21,096
That's why we failed.

678
00:52:39,364 --> 00:52:40,866
I really don't understand.

679
00:52:41,283 --> 00:52:43,994
Why did Han-mo confess
that he killed Myung Hae-joon?

680
00:52:46,288 --> 00:52:48,707
I need to ask around

681
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:50,625
to find out what happened to Han-mo.

682
00:52:52,127 --> 00:52:55,005
You can't be careless like that.
Don't you get it?

683
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:57,591
We've all fallen into a trap.

684
00:52:58,925 --> 00:53:00,176
Han-mo went to the Blue House

685
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:02,345
to report Assemblyman Oh
to higher authorities

686
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:04,139
and got locked up as a murderer.

687
00:53:04,723 --> 00:53:07,684
You almost died
on your way to the hearing.

688
00:53:08,393 --> 00:53:09,895
I followed your orders,

689
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:12,063
and now I've been suspended

690
00:53:12,731 --> 00:53:14,524
indefinitely without pay.

691
00:53:17,736 --> 00:53:19,905
I haven't even paid off my car yet.

692
00:53:23,408 --> 00:53:25,035
Are you trying to make me feel bad?

693
00:53:25,118 --> 00:53:26,369
No, I'm not.

694
00:53:27,412 --> 00:53:29,956
I'm saying an agent's commitment
isn't a virtue,

695
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:31,708
but an obligation.

696
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:34,920
It's what you said.

697
00:53:37,088 --> 00:53:40,508
Something this cliche should be
engraved in stone for the NIS.

698
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:43,303
Who in the world said that to you?

699
00:53:45,722 --> 00:53:47,057
The agent who trained me.

700
00:53:48,141 --> 00:53:49,768
Kim Jun-o of Espionage Team Two.

701
00:54:06,576 --> 00:54:08,328
This is Myung Hae-joon's killer.

702
00:54:11,539 --> 00:54:14,542
Is he the one that attacked you yesterday?

703
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:21,633
It's him.

704
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:24,427
Tae-ik.

705
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:56,960
Do you work out?

706
00:54:58,378 --> 00:54:59,671
You've lost weight.

707
00:55:00,255 --> 00:55:01,923
Golf isn't much exercise.

708
00:55:03,967 --> 00:55:05,969
I can't seem to lower my score.

709
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:10,515
It's always above 80.

710
00:55:17,188 --> 00:55:20,191
Maybe I lost weight
because I have much to worry about.

711
00:55:22,402 --> 00:55:24,279
Two of my men...

712
00:55:26,406 --> 00:55:29,242
I'm really sad, Mr. Kim.

713
00:55:29,826 --> 00:55:31,369
Make sure I don't have to worry.

714
00:55:33,788 --> 00:55:37,709
I told my men in the State Bureau
of Investigation to find Na-gyeong.

715
00:55:40,086 --> 00:55:42,630
The Blue House wasn't doing anything.

716
00:55:43,131 --> 00:55:46,176
Would you like cuffs this time?

717
00:55:46,259 --> 00:55:48,219
You have to find her first.

718
00:55:49,387 --> 00:55:51,306
Don't have others do it,
but find her yourself.

719
00:55:55,977 --> 00:55:58,980
Outsourcing causes problems.
Isn't that right, Mr. Kim?

720
00:55:59,064 --> 00:56:02,442
You need to learn how to wait
after giving orders

721
00:56:02,525 --> 00:56:03,735
for your men to grow.

722
00:56:05,779 --> 00:56:08,406
Is that how the VIP taught you?

723
00:56:10,241 --> 00:56:12,243
He trusts you too much.

724
00:56:16,247 --> 00:56:19,250
Those that are in charge
of state affairs don't even meet.

725
00:56:19,334 --> 00:56:21,086
We don't know each other's names or faces.

726
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:24,714
How will we get anything done
without being connected?

727
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:26,800
Isn't it better not to know...

728
00:56:27,842 --> 00:56:28,885
for everyone?

729
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,046
Did I keep you waiting?

730
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:11,511
They must get chatty with age.

731
00:57:11,886 --> 00:57:13,221
Director Ji...

732
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:17,725
seemed to be hoping you'd meet with him.

733
00:57:19,477 --> 00:57:21,729
He works in the shadows
but wants to stand in the light?

734
00:57:22,063 --> 00:57:23,398
Silent commitment.

735
00:57:24,357 --> 00:57:27,235
I wonder why people engrave
that on stone...

736
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:29,612
when they can't live up to it.

737
00:57:30,864 --> 00:57:34,534
President Park seems to be looking
for Agent Han.

738
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:38,496
Director Ji will take care of her,
so the investiture

739
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:40,832
for the Minister of National Defense
goes smoothly.

740
00:57:42,333 --> 00:57:44,085
Is the investiture that important?

741
00:57:45,879 --> 00:57:47,964
I think we got everything we needed

742
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:49,966
during the hearing.

743
00:57:52,677 --> 00:57:53,803
I saw

744
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:58,433
that your approval rating soared
after the hearing,

745
00:58:00,059 --> 00:58:02,729
and you are up there with President Park.

746
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:07,275
Now, everyone will move
with the presidential election in mind,

747
00:58:07,358 --> 00:58:10,153
including Assemblywoman Yun
and the Blue House.

748
00:58:10,778 --> 00:58:11,863
Those people...

749
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:15,658
How great a world
are they trying to create?

750
00:58:17,785 --> 00:58:20,079
If we could change the world
with an election,

751
00:58:22,081 --> 00:58:23,416
humans...

752
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,586
would have done everything
to get rid of elections.

753
00:58:28,671 --> 00:58:30,048
And a long time ago at that.

754
00:58:35,803 --> 00:58:36,888
Don't you agree?

755
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:41,017
That's why elections are like
Santa Claus to adults.

756
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:44,229
It's a lie we want to believe in.

757
00:58:47,649 --> 00:58:51,819
Don't you think you can give people
their gift?

758
00:58:53,821 --> 00:58:56,366
President Park won't be registered...

759
00:58:57,659 --> 00:58:58,743
as a presidential candidate.

760
00:59:10,129 --> 00:59:13,299
What should we tell the press
about the postponement?

761
00:59:18,846 --> 00:59:21,099
Let's say it's a problem
in administrative procedure.

762
00:59:21,933 --> 00:59:24,102
It's a first with an acting president.

763
00:59:24,936 --> 00:59:25,979
Whom do you have in mind?

764
00:59:28,189 --> 00:59:30,441
The presidential candidate registration
is in 10 days.

765
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:33,194
President Park turned you down.

766
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:39,075
But...

767
00:59:39,659 --> 00:59:42,579
I'm sure someone new

768
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:45,415
will show up
as the presidential candidate.

769
00:59:50,169 --> 00:59:51,462
Good luck!

770
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:01,389
Nothing in this house is off the record
nor do embargoes work.

771
01:00:03,057 --> 01:00:04,767
-Is this true?
-Please answer us!

772
01:00:12,859 --> 01:00:14,152
What is it?

773
01:00:20,533 --> 01:00:21,868
Who could it have been?

774
01:00:23,286 --> 01:00:24,662
Why bother now?

775
01:00:25,163 --> 01:00:27,415
It's a scandal
regarding Yang Jin-man's ministers.

776
01:00:27,832 --> 01:00:31,002
Why would they release a scandal
about those who are already dead?

777
01:00:32,128 --> 01:00:33,921
Why do you think they tipped off
the press?

778
01:00:34,672 --> 01:00:35,798
How is the press responding?

779
01:00:35,882 --> 01:00:39,093
So you're saying that the same tip
was given to Joongang Daily,

780
01:00:39,177 --> 01:00:41,137
the public TV, and the news channel,
right?

781
01:00:44,891 --> 01:00:48,061
That's an internal document
with the Blue House's mark on it.

782
01:00:49,354 --> 01:00:51,689
Was there a whistle-blower? Who was it?

783
01:00:53,691 --> 01:00:54,776
Do you have no clue either?

784
01:00:54,859 --> 01:00:58,029
Even Jang-hyun, the chief
of the Blue House, had no idea either.

785
01:00:58,404 --> 01:00:59,614
Based on the tip,

786
01:01:00,365 --> 01:01:02,033
I'm certain it was a whistle-blower.

787
01:01:05,912 --> 01:01:07,580
The tip is...

788
01:01:07,664 --> 01:01:09,165
JANG GUN-HO'S
INVOLVEMENT IN CORRUPTION

789
01:01:10,416 --> 01:01:11,959
I can't believe them.

790
01:01:14,587 --> 01:01:17,006
"Jang Gun-ho, Former Minister
of National Defense's Involvement

791
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:18,341
in Corruption.

792
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:22,095
Choi Jong-bok, Former Minister
of Construction and Transportation's

793
01:01:22,178 --> 01:01:23,262
Investment in Real Estate.

794
01:01:24,347 --> 01:01:26,265
Park Ji-yoon, former Minister
of Gender Equality

795
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:27,850
and Family's husband's sex scandal."

796
01:01:27,934 --> 01:01:29,560
Also, "Former--"

797
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:34,899
Was the Chief Office already aware
of this?

798
01:01:36,818 --> 01:01:37,944
It is our duty to monitor

799
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:40,363
our public officials.

800
01:01:42,990 --> 01:01:44,909
We now know that the tip wasn't fake.

801
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:48,621
So now, we need to know who released
these documents to the press.

802
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:52,542
This was top secret information that
only the Chief Office knew about.

803
01:01:56,754 --> 01:01:57,714
So? Are you accusing me?

804
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:01,551
Just be blatant and tell me
that you're suspecting me.

805
01:02:01,634 --> 01:02:02,885
Don't beat around the bush.

806
01:02:03,678 --> 01:02:05,263
It feels like crap.

807
01:02:05,346 --> 01:02:08,224
This is a logical inference.
You've done this before.

808
01:02:09,517 --> 01:02:10,601
If that's the case,

809
01:02:11,310 --> 01:02:12,854
you're not that innocent either.

810
01:02:13,479 --> 01:02:15,356
Remember Myung Hae-joon's video?

811
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:17,817
In order to gain political wins,

812
01:02:18,443 --> 01:02:20,486
there's nothing you can't do.

813
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:22,613
I'm sorry to interrupt
your passionate debate,

814
01:02:22,697 --> 01:02:24,031
but this is odd.

815
01:02:25,366 --> 01:02:27,827
This tip has all the big and small issues

816
01:02:27,910 --> 01:02:31,289
regarding Yang Jin-man's men.

817
01:02:32,665 --> 01:02:35,168
But why isn't there anything
about Mr. President?

818
01:02:37,253 --> 01:02:38,129
Not even one bit.

819
01:02:39,672 --> 01:02:43,301
The anonymous whistle-blower has claimed

820
01:02:43,384 --> 01:02:48,222
that they also have scandals related
to Acting President Park Mu-jin.

821
01:02:48,890 --> 01:02:50,850
They weren't after Yang Jin-man's cabinet.

822
01:02:51,225 --> 01:02:52,477
President Park was their target.

823
01:02:53,186 --> 01:02:56,022
Why did they reveal scandals
regarding the cabinet?

824
01:02:56,105 --> 01:02:57,940
They've all passed away.

825
01:02:58,107 --> 01:03:00,067
Because the scandals were proven
to be true.

826
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:03,404
They're warning all of us

827
01:03:03,905 --> 01:03:05,323
that President Park's scandal

828
01:03:06,157 --> 01:03:07,116
is also true.

829
01:03:12,538 --> 01:03:15,708
They also have scandals related
to Acting President Park Mu-jin.

830
01:03:16,459 --> 01:03:17,960
If this information proves to be true,

831
01:03:18,044 --> 01:03:20,087
it is likely to cause a great commotion.

832
01:03:24,509 --> 01:03:25,343
Sir.

833
01:03:27,553 --> 01:03:28,596
Is there anything

834
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:32,475
you can think of?

835
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:36,479
Whether it's related to your work

836
01:03:36,562 --> 01:03:38,272
or your private life.

837
01:03:42,527 --> 01:03:44,695
What kind of information do you think
the informant has?

838
01:03:44,779 --> 01:03:46,823
He was evaluated during the hearing,

839
01:03:46,906 --> 01:03:49,408
and he had the best reputation in Sejong.

840
01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:53,746
Since he's always been at school,
it can't be anything too serious, right?

841
01:03:54,622 --> 01:03:57,667
If it's related to school, it could be
his thesis, position, or research funds.

842
01:03:57,750 --> 01:03:59,961
If it's his ministry,
collusion with the local government?

843
01:04:00,545 --> 01:04:01,963
-Come on.
-Come on.

844
01:04:02,046 --> 01:04:05,091
What? It's better to predict
such things before they hit you.

845
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:07,134
But it's best to prevent them.

846
01:04:09,011 --> 01:04:10,930
"Collusion with the local government"?

847
01:04:11,347 --> 01:04:13,057
Why are you writing that down?

848
01:04:13,558 --> 01:04:15,560
If you tell us first, it'll be better.

849
01:04:15,643 --> 01:04:17,186
If we make a move first,

850
01:04:18,479 --> 01:04:20,857
we can prevent this from blowing up.

851
01:04:24,318 --> 01:04:28,573
In addition, the whistle-blower stated
that they will release the scandals

852
01:04:29,156 --> 01:04:31,325
related to President Park Mu-jin tomorrow.

853
01:04:37,748 --> 01:04:38,749
Sir.

854
01:04:43,963 --> 01:04:45,423
Will you please tell us?

855
01:05:17,288 --> 01:05:21,626
The public is in commotion
about how President Park's scandals

856
01:05:21,709 --> 01:05:23,502
will affect this country.

857
01:05:23,586 --> 01:05:26,422
Someone who has claimed to know
about his scandals appeared.

858
01:05:26,505 --> 01:05:27,965
This is ridiculous.

859
01:05:28,049 --> 01:05:30,134
Is this true?

860
01:05:30,217 --> 01:05:33,554
Agent Han is not someone who would
commit such a crime.

861
01:05:33,638 --> 01:05:35,222
Am I to push them into the gates of hell

862
01:05:35,306 --> 01:05:37,266
so that I can be commended?

863
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:39,560
I wonder how Mu-jin will react

864
01:05:39,644 --> 01:05:43,606
once he finds out that he was a part
of the bombing.

865
01:05:44,106 --> 01:05:46,108
