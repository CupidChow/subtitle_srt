A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:00:53,678 --> 00:01:00,685
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
PLACES AND EVENTS ARE FICTIONAL

00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:10,236
DONGIL NEWS, KOOKIL NEWS,
DONGBUK DAILY, MINSUNG NEWS,

MINSUNG NEWS,
DONGBUK DAILY

6
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:22,916
Finding out the truth behind the attack

7
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:24,250
and stabilizing state affairs.

8
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:27,128
Park Mu-jin, the Acting President,

9
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:29,589
has two significant tasks to do.

10
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:33,927
However, Acting President Park Mu-jin
has never been in an elected position.

11
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:36,805
Given this unprecedented national crisis,

12
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:39,099
many people are concerned about
whether or not he can show

13
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:41,059
leadership in front
of administrative officers

14
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:43,019
-and the National Assembly.
-He has a week.

15
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:46,981
If he can run state affairs without
any problems for the next week,

16
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:50,193
the headlines of every paper will change.

17
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:51,569
"Acting President Park Mu-jin..."

18
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:52,654
THE PRESIDENT PASSES AWAY

19
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:54,697
"...Becomes a Strong Candidate."

20
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,535
After that, the public will choose him

21
00:01:58,618 --> 00:01:59,953
as the next candidate.

22
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,209
It seems like you chose him

23
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:08,294
to be your next political partner.

24
00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:10,004
No, sir.

25
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:14,342
He's a good man.

26
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:19,806
But for me, I'm satisfied with serving
the late President Yang Jin-man.

27
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:23,726
You also witnessed

28
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:27,355
how the world criticized his good deeds.

29
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:32,360
I'm going to choose the person who wins.

30
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:36,489
That's a relief.

31
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:38,908
President Park

32
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:41,911
never even ran for class president

33
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,205
when he was in school.

34
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,124
In those days.

35
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,001
Although he was a model student.

36
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:51,838
Do you know what that implies?

37
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:56,426
He doesn't have

38
00:02:57,385 --> 00:02:59,929
any desire for power.
He isn't suitable for politics.

39
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:02,307
He just didn't have the opportunity.

40
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:04,726
The opportunity to obtain power.

41
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:08,855
Do you think he'll stay the same
even after witnessing

42
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:10,982
the nation move on his orders?

43
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:14,360
Have you ever seen someone let go
of their power willingly?

44
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:18,990
Daddy!

45
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:28,499
You did great.

46
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:31,711
Daddy, I rode a spaceship.

47
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:32,837
A spaceship?

48
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,298
She's talking about the MRI machine.

49
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,054
How were her results?
She's fine, right?

50
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:44,182
She counted to ten.
She recognized us too.

51
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:45,558
Isn't that enough?

52
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:48,269
We have a doctor
at the Blue House as well.

53
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:49,812
You don't need to worry, sir.

54
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,106
Thank you.

55
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:54,692
Let me see.

56
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:58,529
Gosh. It must've hurt so much.

57
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:03,409
Si-wan! I rode a spaceship.

58
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:09,207
Si-wan. I said, I rode a spaceship.

59
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,542
I'm serious.

60
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,506
Si-wan, Si-jin's back.
You were worried about her.

61
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,675
Aren't you hungry?

62
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:20,301
Should I tell them to prepare your meal?

63
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:26,641
I'm sorry. He's a teenager.

64
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:29,936
You know how they are, right?

65
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:33,189
Yes. I heard they're more frightening
than any dictator.

66
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,651
You don't have to be sorry.

67
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:39,487
They even say North Korea
won't dare invade

68
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:41,281
because they're so frightening.

69
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:46,661
I'm terribly sorry, sir.

70
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,914
That joke was inappropriate
at a time like this.

71
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,710
I'd like to apologize
for my son's rudeness.

72
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:02,385
Is that true?

73
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:05,972
Why else do you think he suddenly
got into a fistfight?

74
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:10,101
The kids couldn't have physical education
because of the fine dust.

75
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:12,895
One of the kids said it was
because the Minister of Environment

76
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:14,897
wasn't doing his job properly.

77
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:16,733
Well,

78
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:18,860
that kid is a teenager too.

79
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:23,114
It's hard for him, too.

80
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:25,575
Think about it.

81
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:28,745
He never imagined
he'd be living in the Blue House,

82
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:30,496
which he only saw on the news.

83
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,248
PRESIDENT OF KOREA, YANG JIN-MAN

84
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,875
He probably doesn't know

85
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,793
how he'll face his friends again.

86
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,008
-What now?
-I still need to teach him manners.

87
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:44,177
Puberty doesn't make him special.

88
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,769
Si-wan, we need to talk.

89
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:58,608
Si-Wan.

90
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,409
Did you put something on that?

91
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,329
A man's face is his life.

92
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,381
I'm sorry. This is all because of me.

93
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:23,966
We will have to live here

94
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:26,719
for the time being.

95
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:30,431
Someone once told me

96
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:34,143
that you don't get paid every month
because you're good.

97
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:38,898
You get paid so you can smile
while being criticized.

98
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,151
I get paid

99
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:45,321
with the people's tax money.

100
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:49,283
You don't need to worry about me.

101
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,911
It's harder for you.

102
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,165
That bothers me.

103
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:05,133
So Si-wan, I hope you will...

104
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,096
stay strong.

105
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,182
-Dad.
-Yes?

106
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:17,478
What's the Wi-Fi password?

107
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:26,529
-I've tested all the dishes.
-Thank you.

108
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:30,867
From now on, you may only eat
after the inspector tests them,

109
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,619
whether it is at the Blue House
or elsewhere.

110
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,580
Especially during times like this

111
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:37,582
when there's a threat of attack,

112
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:40,001
the inspection will be done
more meticulously.

113
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:43,463
On that note, ma'am,

114
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:46,799
could you consult with us
regarding your schedule?

115
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:48,759
We need to ensure your safety.

116
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:50,386
And since this is a sensitive time,

117
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,889
we need to consider
the political side as well.

118
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:54,432
I'm afraid

119
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:56,559
I can't do that.

120
00:07:57,226 --> 00:07:59,604
I'm a lawyer.

121
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:02,523
I have a duty to maintain
attorney-client confidentiality.

122
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:05,776
For the next 60 days,

123
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,862
you are the First Lady.

124
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:12,867
Hello.

125
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:19,707
Is something wrong?

126
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,792
Is this how you feel as well?

127
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:26,422
For the past 15 years of our marriage,
I've been free.

128
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:29,258
But she wants to tie me down now.

129
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,056
Two months will fly by.

130
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:39,143
After 60 days, we can go home.

131
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:41,270
Nothing will change.

132
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,205
Hello, sir!

133
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:01,916
Hello.

134
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:19,141
As you've requested,

135
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:22,687
Ms. Jeong Su-jeong will be working
at the Presidential Secretariat.

136
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:24,814
She will be formally assigned

137
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:27,024
once her background check clears.

138
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:29,777
We should go.

139
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:34,031
Your official schedule awaits,
starting with the Chief of Staff meeting.

140
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:59,599
DAY 59: MAINTAINING STATUS QUO
EPISODE 3

141
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:04,395
I'm Jo Yong-gu from Saenal News.

142
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:07,815
The attack on the National Assembly
Building. Was it North Korea?

143
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:09,692
For now...

144
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:13,321
I'm Min Ju-hong from KBC.
How likely is it that it was North Korea?

145
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:14,780
PRESS SECRETARY
HONG SU-WON

146
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:18,034
-The NIS--
-I'm Im Jae-suk from OPS.

147
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,535
If it was not North Korea,

148
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:22,997
was ISIS the terrorist organization
most likely responsible for it?

149
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:25,374
Give me the mic.

150
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:29,378
I'm Woo Sin-yeong from TBN.

151
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,464
I heard
Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Force...

152
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:33,549
dispatched the Aegis
to the East Sea yesterday.

153
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:41,349
Ms. Woo, that was embargoed--

154
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:43,309
Here's my question.

155
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:45,978
I heard the reason
why they dispatched the Aegis was...

156
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:50,608
because a North Korean submarine
entered our territorial waters.

157
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:00,993
So it's true.

158
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:03,663
So was it North Korea?

159
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:06,332
-Is North Korea invading the South?
-Is a war imminent?

160
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:09,543
-Why is the Blue House saying anything?
-Well...

161
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:13,005
Why aren't you telling
the people the truth?

162
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:19,053
We will take a short break.

163
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:21,764
-Please answer us.
-What the hell?

164
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:27,603
Where is he going?

165
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,273
-What's all this?
-Tell me about it. What was that--

166
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:34,985
I mean, didn't you write
the script for the briefing?

167
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:36,445
Aren't you going to fix this?

168
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:39,365
Me?

169
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,283
I wrote it, but...

170
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:45,162
And I'm not ready
for a situation like this.

171
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:48,999
None of us was ready
for a situation like this.

172
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,877
No one in this Blue House was.

173
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:52,962
Well...

174
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,179
Sin-yeong, where are you going?

175
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:06,350
We already have the headlines.

176
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:08,978
"Acting President Park Mu-jin
Gets off to a Shaky Start."

177
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:12,356
"The Incompetent Blue House Fails
as a Control Tower."

178
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:16,277
I'll start by answering
Ms. Woo's question.

179
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:31,500
Japan's Aegis has already
retreated from the East Sea.

180
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:36,797
There was no provocation from North Korea,
and a war did not break out.

181
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:39,258
Those are the facts I can confirm for now.

182
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:42,261
Are you saying North Korea
wasn't behind the attack?

183
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:44,180
If not, who was it?

184
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:46,223
The NIS, DSSC,

185
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:49,393
and our military forces

186
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:53,230
are conducting thorough investigations
and are open to all possibilities.

187
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:55,691
-Once there is a conclusion--
-Once there is,

188
00:12:56,817 --> 00:13:00,821
will it be made known
to the people and the press immediately?

189
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:08,329
Ms. Woo's performance assessment
depends on her questions.

190
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:11,123
And my performance assessment
depends on my silence.

191
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,209
I hope this answers your question.

192
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:18,005
Since the incident yesterday,
all kinds of fake news and rumors

193
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:20,424
are spreading through social media.

194
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:24,094
If the government doesn't share
the information transparently,

195
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:27,473
the embers of the fake news
will never be put out.

196
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:29,975
As long as the press does not publish
mere speculation,

197
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:32,436
it won't spread like wildfire.

198
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:36,482
The security of this nation
and its people are on the line.

199
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:40,402
Your cooperation will be
very much appreciated.

200
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:43,489
BLUE HOUSE

201
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:51,413
Thank you. I'm...

202
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:56,585
I'm the acting press secretary,
Kim Nam-wook.

203
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:06,846
In total, 37 posts of agency heads
fell vacant due to the bombing.

204
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:10,266
We will take immediate measures
so the Vice-Ministers

205
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:11,684
can replace the Ministers.

206
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:15,396
There may be a second attack
on key industries, railways,

207
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:16,522
ships, and aircraft.

208
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:21,235
Inspections at the Immigration Office
have been temporarily suspended.

209
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:24,738
You can't ground everyone
across the board like that.

210
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:29,410
Making overseas investors anxious
is the most amateur thing we could do.

211
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,246
I'm Gu Yong-wan,
chief of economic affairs.

212
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:35,875
Our most urgent priority
is to suspend bank transactions.

213
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,918
The mass of people
trying to withdraw their funds

214
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:39,753
has crippled the banks since morning.

215
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:41,171
We can't do that, sir.

216
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:43,924
If we suspend bank transactions,
countless numbers of small businesses

217
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:46,218
will fall like dominoes in 48 hours.

218
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:49,221
If we don't, the banks will go under.

219
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:53,309
Then our economy will become brain-dead
before we even try CPR.

220
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:55,769
But we must deal with
the personnel matters first.

221
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:58,314
Security is our priority,
first and foremost.

222
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,482
-This country's economy might fall apart.
-Listen--

223
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,075
Everyone, please leave.

224
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,998
Let's call it a day.

225
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:21,670
It's all my fault.

226
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:25,633
I thought the Blue House secretarial staff
could help President Park.

227
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,845
I overestimated

228
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:32,890
you people.

229
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:39,730
These matters will be approved

230
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:41,815
based on priority and order of importance.

231
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:45,819
Let's go.

232
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:16,308
"On the first day,
at the Chief of Staff meeting,

233
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:20,145
Secretary Han yelled
at everyone in anger."

234
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:23,565
This will be regarded as inaudible,

235
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:24,858
so it won't stay on the record.

236
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:33,993
It's a total mess.

237
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,621
Did he hit menopause?

238
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:41,583
There was nothing to be
so furious about. How odd.

239
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:43,335
It's a message.

240
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:48,298
"Though the Acting President is clueless,
don't think you can boss him around."

241
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,426
"I'm behind him."

242
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:53,804
"I'm the real owner of the Blue House."

243
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:55,222
CHIEF OF CIVIL AFFAIRS
AN SE-YOUNG

244
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:57,099
Come on. Secretary Han wouldn't do that.

245
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:58,642
Why not?

246
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:03,772
The only person who has the ability
to power through this state of emergency

247
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:06,108
is Secretary Han.

248
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:10,195
Ms. Min.

249
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:13,991
Illegal wiretapping will bring
your entire family down.

250
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:19,038
We basically had only one agenda

251
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:21,457
at the meeting today.

252
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:24,918
Anxiety.

253
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:31,175
"We can't trust Park Mu-jin's leadership."

254
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:36,221
You will visit
the scene of the tragedy this afternoon.

255
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:40,267
The National Assembly Building?

256
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:43,395
Because the citizens can't
trust you either, Mr. President.

257
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,399
Mr. President.

258
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:49,276
You need to show them

259
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:52,988
that the Blue House hasn't fallen apart.

260
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:57,993
That the Republic of Korea
is still doing well.

261
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:03,499
You need to do that for your own sake too.

262
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,753
What does that mean?

263
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:09,838
You were not elected President.

264
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:14,426
Without trust and support from
the Blue House staff and the citizens,

265
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:17,137
you won't be able to do anything

266
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:20,933
from that seat for the next 60 days.

267
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:25,771
Trust and support.

268
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:29,608
Those are power and authority.

269
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:34,363
Did you just say "power"?

270
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:41,662
That has nothing to do with me.

271
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:45,499
I'm going to carry out my duty
as a citizen of this country

272
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,877
and return to my school after 60 days
as planned.

273
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:54,049
Seriously,

274
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:58,887
how did they evade the inspection
of the National Assembly Building?

275
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:02,933
They must have disguised it
as something no one was suspicious of.

276
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:06,770
The explosive demolition method

277
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:09,398
requires fuses planted
all over the building to make it work.

278
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:10,315
So?

279
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:13,944
Once we find the fuses, we will know

280
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:15,320
how they planned the attack.

281
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:19,825
What happened to your face?

282
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:23,162
What? This? Gosh, this is embarrassing.

283
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:27,958
Korea really is the most-connected nation.
There are LAN cables everywhere.

284
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:31,670
See? Look at this.
How could I not trip and fall?

285
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:43,932
No one would have suspected
a cable installation.

286
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:47,561
That's how they could avoid
the inspection.

287
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:49,521
Are you sure?

288
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:52,524
We found something!

289
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:03,035
Yes, this is a detonating fuse.

290
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,329
What? Are you sure this is it?

291
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:06,622
Yes, I'm sure.

292
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,917
Essentially,
the cord was filled with explosives.

293
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:27,476
-The cable installation company?
-Yes.

294
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:30,103
I'm looking for the company
that installed cables in the building.

295
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:31,772
Why do you need that?

296
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:35,359
The bombers

297
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:38,779
detonated the bombs
using the building's Internet cable lines.

298
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:55,337
Was there a specific reason
for hiring this company?

299
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:59,049
Perhaps someone recommended them?

300
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:01,593
There was an open bidding process.

301
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:04,346
There can only be one reason.

302
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,307

WHO BOMBED THE ASSEMBLY BUILDING?

339
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:46,891
There have been acts of violence
in Mohyeon and Bogil.

340
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:54,858
What's worse, they brutally lynched

341
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:56,401
North Korean defectors.

342
00:28:57,193 --> 00:28:59,195
Why, out of the blue? For what reason?

343
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:02,824
I think it's because of the fake news
that's been spreading on social media.

344
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:04,951
"Fake news"?

345
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:06,995
"Some North Korean defectors
arranged the explosion

346
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:09,414
at the National Assembly Building
as per North Korea's order.

347
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:11,958

00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:25,472
A VIP in North Korea paid Baekdu Gang
to smuggle explosives into the country.

351
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:28,767
Here's how North Korea
plans to invade the South.

352
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:31,269
They will collude with the defectors
in Bogil and Mohyeon

353
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:33,980
as well as with the pro-North forces
left in the government."

354
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:35,064
This administration is...

355
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:37,400
"They will attempt to amend
the Constitution

356
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:39,944
to turn Korea into a socialist country."

357
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,490
So? Shall I keep reading?

358
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:46,951
Am I the only one

359
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:49,287
who doesn't understand?

360
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:53,041
There isn't enough evidence,
and it sounds inaccurate.

361
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:55,794
Besides,
the process of reasoning lacks logic.

362
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:57,962
Why do people believe this?

363
00:29:58,046 --> 00:29:59,214
Because they're human.

364
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:01,883
When people are frightened,

365
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:04,385
their initial thought
isn't to find the source.

366
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:06,596
Instead, they look for a visible enemy.

367
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:08,848
They need a scapegoat,

368
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:11,059
whom they can hate and resent
all they want.

369
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,187
It's because that is a lot easier.

370
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,654
Oh, dear.

371
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:24,489
Nam-wook.

372
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:26,157
Yes, sir.

373
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:28,910
You should stay away
from the briefing room for the time being.

374
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:31,496
-Pardon me?
-Wouldn't you be uncomfortable?

375
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:34,249
Because you're from... Gosh.

376
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:38,336
There are so many negative articles
regarding North Korean defectors.

377
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,922
All the reporters will grill you.

378
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:42,298
They'll be like, "Is it true?"

379
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:44,008
"What's your take on it?"

380
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:48,263
Just stay glued to your desk

381
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:51,349
and write well-crafted speeches.

382
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:52,517
No pressure though.

383
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:56,145
My gosh,
thank you for being so considerate.

384
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:57,313
Yes, I know.

385
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:01,776
But I have to say, I'm curious too.

386
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:05,071
Could the bomber really be
one of the North Korean defectors?

387
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:07,866
Well, I mean...

388
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:10,702
As they say,
there's no smoke without fire.

389
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:13,496
-I'm sure there's something--
-What can there be?

390
00:31:15,748 --> 00:31:17,125
The North Korean defectors

391
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:19,919
risked their lives to come here
because they hate North Korea.

392
00:31:20,503 --> 00:31:23,631
They committed this attack as per
the North Korean government's order?

393
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:24,841
Does that make sense to you?

394
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:26,676
Aren't I right?

395
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:35,143
Should I answer as a defector
or as an administrator at the Blue House?

396
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,940
Well, what I meant was...

397
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:44,193
Well...

398
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:50,033
I apologize.
I should've been more thoughtful.

399
00:31:50,116 --> 00:31:50,950
I'm sorry.

400
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:05,924
They say fists...

401
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,303
always move downward.

402
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,390
Those people attacked
the North Korean defectors

403
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:17,185
because they're powerless,
not because they're dangerous.

404
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:32,075
Yes. What about it?

405
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:35,620
Pardon?

406
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,208
Sir.

407
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:42,543
The assaults in Mohyeon and Bogil...

408
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:45,088
Have the police and prosecutors said
how they plan to handle it?

409
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:46,172
Well...

410
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,968
Things seem to be unfolding
in a strange direction.

411
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:57,100
INSPECTION OF SPECIAL CRIMES

412
00:32:57,183 --> 00:33:00,812
COMMIES ARE THE CULPRITS

413
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:03,272
Dear ten million citizens of Seoul.

414
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,109
We are designating

415
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:08,861
the high-crime areas Mohyeon and Bogil,

416
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:13,241
where the violent incidents occurred,
Special Crime Investigation Zones.

417
00:33:13,908 --> 00:33:16,077
I hereby declare a war against crime.

418
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,623
-My gosh!
-What's that?

419
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:26,504
Mayor Kang, who discriminates against
North Korean defectors, must step down!

420
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:29,757
-Goodness. That's terrible.
-Step down!

421
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:32,343
That's what Mayor Kang wanted.

422
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:36,681
Otherwise, he wouldn't have held
the press conference there,

423
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:39,392
fully knowing that the residents
in the area would protest.

424
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:44,564
A victim of violence
that is threatening the community.

425
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:47,692
A fighter who fights against any crisis
that comes his way.

426
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:50,445
-I bet he needed to craft that image.
-Mayor Kang Sang-gu

427
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:51,487
must step down!

428
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:53,698
-He must step down!
-Kang Sang-gu must step down!

429
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:56,325
-He must step down!
-Step down!

430
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:58,369
Kang Sang-gu must step down!

431
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:00,038
-Step down at once!
-See that?

432
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:04,792
Anyone who challenges governmental
authority will not be forgiven,

433
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:07,503
regardless of who it is.
No matter what kind of crisis befalls us,

434
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:08,713
I, Kang Sang-gu,

435
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:12,675
will never give in or give up.

436
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:16,471
However, national security,
stability, order,

437
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:18,765
and a keeping distance from North Korea.

438
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:22,018
Aren't they our party's specialties?

439
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:26,898
Mayor Kang Sang-gu
is the leading presidential candidate

440
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:28,399
for the majority party.

441
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:32,445
His supporters' votes are like
bunnies in his pocket.

442
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:35,740
Now, he wants to hunt jackrabbits.

443
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:40,495
That's why he wants to target
our supporters?

444
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:42,121
And to make that happen,

445
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:46,959
I will do my very best
to ensure safety in Seoul.

446
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:50,004
Come to think of it,
Mayor Kang isn't after

447
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:51,672
some jackrabbits.

448
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:55,093
He wants to steal our bunnies.

449
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:00,973
Unfortunately, our nation

450
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:03,851
doesn't have a President at the moment.

451
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:08,189
However, Seoul has Kang Sang-gu.

452
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:09,941
As long as I'm in office,

453
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:12,652
no attacks or acts of violence

454
00:35:12,735 --> 00:35:16,405
will be tolerated whatsoever.

455
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:17,698
COMMIES ARE THE CULPRITS

456
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:18,783
GO HOME, DEFECTORS!

457
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:22,995
-Kang Sang-gu!
-Kang Sang-gu!

458
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:30,044
We're from the Special Judicial Police.

459
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:32,296
HOUSEKEEPERS WANTED

460
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:34,841
These are counterfeit watches.

461
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:36,551
You know this is illegal, right?

462
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:39,971
Have these been cleared by Customs?

463
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:41,973
SPECIAL INSPECTION IN PROGRESS

464
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:45,101
-Heo Jin-ju.
-Yes.

465
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:47,436
-You'll have to come with us.
-Pardon me.

466
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:49,647
-Escort her.
-Why...

467
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:50,731
But...

468
00:35:52,024 --> 00:35:53,776
Wait. Just a moment, sir.

469
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,361
-Please--
-Don't do this.

470
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:08,875
Where did they take Jin-ju?

471
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:14,380
FOR A CRIME-FREE SEOUL

472
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:16,757
CRIME CRACKDOWN IN BOGIL AND MOHYEON

473
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,050
The SJP?

474
00:36:18,634 --> 00:36:20,636
The Special Judicial Police

475
00:36:20,803 --> 00:36:22,680
belong to the City of Seoul.

476
00:36:22,763 --> 00:36:24,557
Mayor Kang has full authority

477
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:28,269
over all their investigations,
not the police or the Prosecutors' Office.

478
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:31,939
MAYOR KANG SANG-GU DECLARES WAR
AGAINST CRIME

479
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:36,152
Mayor Kang wants to show the people
that he is confident about maintaining

480
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:37,820
the city's safety and security.

481
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:40,823
He has no authority to mobilize
the police or prosecutors,

482
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:43,534
but the Special Judicial Police
are under the city's jurisdiction.

483
00:36:43,784 --> 00:36:46,454
Then technically,
what Mayor Kang is doing isn't illegal.

484
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:48,289
It's not illegal,

485
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:50,166
but it's morally wrong.

486
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:52,960
He's exploiting people's fears

487
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:55,213
to improve his approval rating.

488
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:58,549
And because of that,
the North Korean defectors,

489
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:00,468
who are actually victims
of the act of violence,

490
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:03,596
are now viewed as a criminal group.

491
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:12,897
I apologize.

492
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,148
I'm sure you're aware,

493
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:16,525
but this is
a politically sensitive situation.

494
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:20,321
If people find out
that you're affiliated with this,

495
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:22,865
it may cause trouble for President Park.

496
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:24,825
Then

497
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:26,118
you choose.

498
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:28,329
If you let me go in quietly,

499
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:31,457
people will think I'm just a lawyer.

500
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:34,710
But if you keep arguing with me here,

501
00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:37,046
people will probably find out.

502
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:49,058
Then promise me

503
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:52,103
that you will do as I say
at official events.

504
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:57,108
Yes, I promise.

505
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:11,372
Jin-ju.

506
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:13,874
Jin-ju.

507
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:15,960
It's me, Choe Gang-yeon.

508
00:38:21,173 --> 00:38:24,635
Please... Help me.

509
00:38:31,517 --> 00:38:32,768
Jin-ju.

510
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:41,819
Yes, that's probably where it came from.
Crazy, right?

511
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,406
Call an ambulance, please.

512
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:47,950
Ms. Heo Jin-ju is ill.

513
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:49,285
She needs to see a doctor.

514
00:38:49,368 --> 00:38:52,788
Sure. Then all these people here are ill,
suffering from bingdu withdrawal.

515
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:55,708
Do you know what "bingdu" is?
The North Korean word for opium?

516
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:59,086
A low-grade fever with chills
accompanied by vomiting.

517
00:39:01,213 --> 00:39:04,383
That piece of work
is suffering from withdrawal.

518
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:07,720
No, Jin-ju isn't a user.

519
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:10,431
I can guarantee it as her lawyer.

520
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,226
Can you still guarantee it?

521
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:18,606
We confiscated all this bingdu in Bogil,
where your client has her shop.

522
00:39:19,106 --> 00:39:21,484
It can't serve as evidence to prove
that she's a user.

523
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:25,529
So what, then?
You'll continue to believe your client?

524
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,406
Sure, go ahead.

525
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:32,203
Honestly, how could you believe a commie,
of all people?

526
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,163
Look!

527
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:42,505
Oh, that's... Isn't that you?

528
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:45,758
ACTING PRESIDENT'S WIFE

529
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:52,681
HUMAN RIGHTS LAWYER CHOE GANG-YEON

530
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:07,279
Does my wife have to accompany me?

531
00:40:07,863 --> 00:40:11,075
There are times when a picture
is worth a thousand words.

532
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:14,495
Sense of responsibility, stability,
and credibility.

533
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:17,123
Just one photo with Ms. Choe will convey

534
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:19,625
everything the people want from you.

535
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:21,919
Mr. President.

536
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:24,547
Oh, yes.

537
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:29,176
The Security Team strongly emphasized

538
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,095
that you must wear this.

539
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:32,096
Okay.

540
00:40:33,472 --> 00:40:36,892
I heard North Korean defectors
have been protesting all over the city

541
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:39,437
since Mayor Kang sent
the Special Judicial Police

542
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,105
to Mohyeon and Bogil.

543
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:43,899
There are a lot of people on site,

544
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,527
so the entire Security Team
has its guard up.

545
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:49,572
Well...

546
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:52,491
May I just go alone?

547
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:57,746
Why? Is there a specific reason?

548
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:00,791
My wife is an ordinary civilian
with her own career.

549
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:02,418
I don't want to force her

550
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:05,796
to stand before the public
just because she's my wife.

551
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:07,548
And most importantly,

552
00:41:08,924 --> 00:41:10,551
she won't want to go.

553
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:21,896
I didn't think you'd come.

554
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:24,315
Especially dressed like that.

555
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:34,700
You see,

556
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:38,162
I'm not here
as the acting president's wife.

557
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:40,664
I'm here as a lawyer.

558
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:46,754
Revoke the Special Crime
Investigation Zone designations

559
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:48,380
of Mohyeon and Bogil.

560
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:52,801
Mayor Kang is oppressing
and discriminating against

561
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:54,595
many innocent North Korean defectors

562
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:56,472
for his political ambitions.

563
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:00,559
And my client is one of those defectors.

564
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:06,982
I can't have a proper meeting
with my client now

565
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:08,984
because of where I am.

566
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:12,196
But you...

567
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:14,573
You can do it

568
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:16,367
because of where you are.

569
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:30,172
-It's the President.
-Please step aside.

570
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:31,423
He's here.

571
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:01,453
This way, sir.

572
00:43:10,796 --> 00:43:12,423
Agent Na, please.

573
00:43:14,466 --> 00:43:18,512
Can we please behave
more wisely and sensibly?

574
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:20,264
The cable technician

575
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:23,559
was our best lead on the bombing.

576
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:25,978
He died while fleeing in order to hide

577
00:43:26,061 --> 00:43:27,438
whatever evidence he had.

578
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:29,982
How can we not report this
to the Blue House?

579
00:43:30,065 --> 00:43:33,360
What exactly is there to report?

580
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:35,446
We have no leads. We don't know his name.

581
00:43:35,529 --> 00:43:37,698
He was a John Doe
who wasn't even in the system.

582
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:38,991
What would we report?

583
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:41,660
Should we report
that he had eyes and ears?

584
00:43:45,372 --> 00:43:46,332
Na-gyeong.

585
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:51,211
The president died and
the National Assembly Building blew up.

586
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:53,380
Whom we point to as the bombers

587
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:56,467
can start an international war
or a civil war.

588
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:59,053
-Han-mo!
-Find definitive evidence.

589
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:01,221
Then I'll definitely report it.

590
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:11,482
KIM JUN-O

591
00:44:14,234 --> 00:44:17,279
Do we perhaps have
another lead on the bombing?

592
00:44:18,864 --> 00:44:19,698
What?

593
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:23,202
Could someone have
known about it in advance,

594
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:25,245
or was there a tip?

595
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:28,457
That doesn't make any sense.

596
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:31,418
If we had known, we would've prevented it.

597
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:33,921
President Park is here.

598
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:40,594
Don't go off the rails
and stir up trouble.

599
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:43,555
I want to keep working with you
here in the field.

600
00:44:49,978 --> 00:44:51,522
Thank you for your service.

601
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:53,315
Thank you for your service.

602
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:55,442
I am Jeong Han-mo
of the NIS Terrorism Task Force.

603
00:44:57,986 --> 00:44:59,947
Do you have any leads on the bomber?

604
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:02,324
I'm afraid we don't yet.

605
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:11,959
I'm Han Na-gyeong,
an NIS Terrorism Task Force analyst.

606
00:45:13,585 --> 00:45:14,837
Thank you for your service.

607
00:45:19,007 --> 00:45:20,426
Let me introduce you to our agents.

608
00:45:20,509 --> 00:45:21,593
Sure.

609
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:23,887
This is analyst Kim Yong-wu.

610
00:45:24,012 --> 00:45:25,097
Thank you for your service.

611
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:27,182
We're heading out.

612
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:29,727
This way.

613
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,065
EMERGENCY RELIEF SERVICE

614
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:48,746
This way, sir.

615
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:52,916
Sir?

616
00:45:57,796 --> 00:45:58,630
Sir?

617
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:01,508
What...

618
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:06,638
Ms. Jeong, you didn't see me.

619
00:46:07,222 --> 00:46:08,682
But sir, you can't...

620
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:17,107
I feel

621
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:19,109
too shameless.

622
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:26,200
We're on the move.

623
00:46:55,187 --> 00:46:56,355
President Park,

624
00:46:56,939 --> 00:46:58,148
you must show them.

625
00:47:00,567 --> 00:47:02,778
Show them that
the Blue House is standing strong.

626
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:05,364
Show them

627
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:08,075
that Korea is still on its feet.

628
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:15,833
I am Acting President

629
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:18,085
Park Mu-jin.

630
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:21,964
First of all,
I send my deepest condolences

631
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:25,175
to those of you

632
00:47:26,134 --> 00:47:27,803
who have lost their beloved family.

633
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:44,111
The National Assembly Building,
which was the symbol of Korea's democracy

634
00:47:45,112 --> 00:47:46,113
until just yesterday,

635
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:49,157
has become the site
of a great tragedy today.

636
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:59,877
WHEN HOPE IS NO LONGER VISIBLE, HOPE

637
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:16,935
However, this is also the place

638
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:20,606
where the rescue squad
continues to search for survivors,

639
00:48:21,523 --> 00:48:23,650
and where policemen, firefighters,

640
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:26,361
and volunteers devote

641
00:48:27,446 --> 00:48:28,572
their time and effort.

642
00:48:30,782 --> 00:48:33,368
It's the reason we can find hope

643
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:36,455
even in the aftermath

644
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:37,873
of a tragic attack.

645
00:48:38,457 --> 00:48:39,541
Over here!

646
00:48:40,667 --> 00:48:43,712
Is it true that a North Korean defector

647
00:48:44,296 --> 00:48:45,881
committed this attack?

648
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:49,676
Do you agree with Mayor Kang's policy
of discrimination

649
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:51,219
against defectors?

650
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:57,100
What do you mean by that?

651
00:49:01,021 --> 00:49:01,980
FIND OUT THE TRUTH

652
00:49:02,564 --> 00:49:04,274
Please tell us what's going on!

653
00:49:05,859 --> 00:49:07,277
No, wait...

654
00:49:09,655 --> 00:49:10,656
Get down!

655
00:49:13,075 --> 00:49:15,118
What... What is going on?

656
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:16,411
Get him on the ground!

657
00:49:22,584 --> 00:49:23,919
-We're moving out.
-Hurry!

658
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:26,296
Hurry. Get him out of here.

659
00:49:33,053 --> 00:49:34,972
-Oh, no!
-My gosh!

660
00:49:35,555 --> 00:49:36,848
Oh, dear!

661
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:38,934
What the hell is going on?

662
00:49:39,017 --> 00:49:40,852
What happened?

663
00:49:40,936 --> 00:49:43,605
-It's not a weapon.
-He wasn't attacking anyone.

664
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:45,023
My goodness.

665
00:49:45,107 --> 00:49:46,108
WE ARE YOUR PEOPLE TOO!

666
00:49:46,274 --> 00:49:47,109
My dear God.

667
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:49,736
"The Ill-Prepared Blue House
Makes People Relive the Nightmare."

668
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:51,738
"The Unstable Acting President
Increases Anxiety."

669
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:54,282
"Acting President Park

670
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:57,327
Flees the Scene, A Total Catastrophe."

671
00:49:58,620 --> 00:49:59,621
Had he at least

672
00:50:00,789 --> 00:50:03,667
kept his vest on, his security detail
wouldn't have had to manhandle him

673
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:05,252
and throw him into the car,

674
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:07,838
and this humiliating photo wouldn't exist.

675
00:50:08,463 --> 00:50:10,340
He felt shameless
wearing a bulletproof vest

676
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:13,385
in front of countless people
who lost their loved ones.

677
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:15,595
He was there to send them his condolences.

678
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:17,014
He was there

679
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:20,267
for important political reasons.

680
00:50:20,976 --> 00:50:23,729
It was to show that Korea still has order,

681
00:50:23,812 --> 00:50:25,439
but we failed.

682
00:50:27,149 --> 00:50:28,608
Sincerity and heartfelt empathy?

683
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:32,362
Those humane feelings should've stayed
in the calm and serene city of Sejong,

684
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:33,530
not here in the Blue House!

685
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:43,123
The man who caused a scene
at the bombing site is

686
00:50:43,623 --> 00:50:44,750
a North Korean defector.

687
00:50:45,834 --> 00:50:48,670
What he was trying to pull out
was a banner, not a weapon.

688
00:50:50,839 --> 00:50:52,966
He must've wanted to tell you
that his sick wife

689
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:54,634
had been arrested by the SJP.

690
00:50:56,803 --> 00:50:58,180
I apologize for the team

691
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:00,098
overreacting.

692
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:04,436
If I had

693
00:51:05,604 --> 00:51:07,105
kept my vest on,

694
00:51:08,607 --> 00:51:10,817
they wouldn't have panicked.

695
00:51:13,945 --> 00:51:15,113
This isn't on you, sir.

696
00:51:16,948 --> 00:51:17,824
My team...

697
00:51:19,117 --> 00:51:21,286
failed to protect the late President.

698
00:51:23,205 --> 00:51:26,708
We just didn't want
to make the same mistake twice.

699
00:51:34,382 --> 00:51:35,967
About that defector, sir.

700
00:51:36,843 --> 00:51:39,721
I heard that his wife
is a client of the First Lady's.

701
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:41,723
Sir.

702
00:51:46,186 --> 00:51:50,148
My client suffers from an illness
called Cushing syndrome.

703
00:51:50,732 --> 00:51:54,569
However, the officers holding her
in custody think she's an addict

704
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:57,239
just because
she's a North Korean defector.

705
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:04,538
The Special Crime Investigation Zones.

706
00:52:04,996 --> 00:52:06,331
How can I revoke the designations?

707
00:52:09,668 --> 00:52:11,044
This is unexpected.

708
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:15,423
I didn't think you'd actively get involved

709
00:52:15,507 --> 00:52:16,800
in state affairs.

710
00:52:18,927 --> 00:52:21,471
I feel pathetic.

711
00:52:21,555 --> 00:52:25,183
There's no need to worry
about the photos taken at the site.

712
00:52:26,059 --> 00:52:27,894
They've agreed to take down the photos.

713
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:29,020
What I'm ashamed of

714
00:52:30,355 --> 00:52:33,024
is that I had no idea just how terrified

715
00:52:34,651 --> 00:52:36,528
the people actually were.

716
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:40,574
Not until

717
00:52:41,116 --> 00:52:43,243
I left the site today
as if running for my life.

718
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:46,538
I must be

719
00:52:48,623 --> 00:52:50,542
at a safer place than I realized.

720
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:58,341
The Special Crime Investigation Zone
and the Special Judicial Police?

721
00:52:58,925 --> 00:53:01,511
Unless Mayor Kang changes his mind,

722
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:06,766
there's nothing we can do.

723
00:53:07,767 --> 00:53:09,769
What if I persuaded him in person?

724
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:11,980
He won't sit down with you

725
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:14,149
if he knows what it's about.

726
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:20,488
Hold an inter-party meeting

727
00:53:20,906 --> 00:53:23,200
and invite him as a party representative.

728
00:53:23,491 --> 00:53:26,661
He wishes to have a more national image,

729
00:53:27,412 --> 00:53:28,747
so I'm sure he'll come.

730
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:32,834
The Blue House must have
its own supply of fresh air.

731
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:37,088
The fine dust level today is very high.

732
00:53:52,687 --> 00:53:53,980
Welcome.

733
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:55,273
-Please have a seat.
-Sure.

734
00:54:03,615 --> 00:54:06,368
The majority party representative
fell victim to the tragedy,

735
00:54:06,451 --> 00:54:07,869
so I'll gladly step in anytime.

736
00:54:08,453 --> 00:54:10,288
I should offer you my help, Mr. President.

737
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:16,628
Running a government isn't like
getting a driver's license.

738
00:54:17,712 --> 00:54:21,007
Sitting behind the wheel doesn't magically
give you the necessary skills,

739
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:23,051
and we all know that.

740
00:54:26,054 --> 00:54:26,888
Mayor Kang.

741
00:54:28,348 --> 00:54:30,850
Would you revoke the Special Crime
Investigation Zone designations

742
00:54:31,184 --> 00:54:32,352
of Mohyeon and Bogil?

743
00:54:33,019 --> 00:54:36,648
I'd also like the SJP to stop
its unfairly targeted investigations.

744
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:39,484
Unfairly targeted?

745
00:54:40,735 --> 00:54:41,569
In Seoul?

746
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:45,865
We're enforcing a rightful
and legal section of the law

747
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:49,035
to protect the people of Seoul
and their assets.

748
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:51,538
You're maligning that
as unfairly targeted?

749
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:53,665
An accomplice

750
00:54:54,666 --> 00:54:57,460
of the National Assembly Building Bombing
might be among them.

751
00:54:57,544 --> 00:54:59,004
Nothing has been confirmed.

752
00:54:59,087 --> 00:55:01,464
It's what
the ten million people of Seoul believe,

753
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:02,424
and that

754
00:55:03,925 --> 00:55:05,051
is more important to me.

755
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:07,178
Mayor Kang...

756
00:55:08,596 --> 00:55:10,265
I'm not staying for this.

757
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:12,267
If you wish to talk about Seoul,

758
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:15,687
come to City Hall, President Park.

759
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:23,403
Aren't the defectors
also the people of Seoul

760
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:25,405
whom you should protect?

761
00:55:27,365 --> 00:55:28,408
Why?

762
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:30,994
Do they seem like innocent Koreans

763
00:55:31,077 --> 00:55:34,706
who came to the South
seeking warmth and freedom?

764
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:37,500
The truth is they are nothing but runaways

765
00:55:37,584 --> 00:55:39,461
who couldn't adapt
to their system of state.

766
00:55:39,544 --> 00:55:40,628
They risked

767
00:55:41,379 --> 00:55:42,714
their lives

768
00:55:43,465 --> 00:55:45,175
to become citizens of Seoul.

769
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:49,637
If we're talking about qualifications,
who do you think is more qualified?

770
00:55:50,555 --> 00:55:51,890
You and I

771
00:55:52,223 --> 00:55:54,893
didn't do anything
but be born in this country.

772
00:55:57,479 --> 00:56:00,315
I'm sure that
now that you're behind the wheel,

773
00:56:00,398 --> 00:56:02,150
you want to honk and step on the gas.

774
00:56:03,234 --> 00:56:04,235
But President Park,

775
00:56:05,904 --> 00:56:07,906
an unskilled driver

776
00:56:07,989 --> 00:56:11,910
should just hand over the wheel
to someone with more experience.

777
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:15,872
You'll have nowhere to hide
if you crash and burn.

778
00:56:23,713 --> 00:56:26,716
Since it would be wrong to just sip tea
at an inter-party meeting,

779
00:56:27,759 --> 00:56:28,885
do you want a tip?

780
00:56:30,762 --> 00:56:33,556
There are two ways to handle Mayor Kang.

781
00:56:34,057 --> 00:56:36,810
Persuade or make him yield.

782
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:40,063
You failed to persuade him,

783
00:56:40,605 --> 00:56:43,566
so that leaves you
with just one remaining option.

784
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:49,197
You must be quite fond of President Park

785
00:56:49,948 --> 00:56:52,700
to give him a tip on handling Mayor Kang.

786
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:58,706
It's up to me to protect my bunnies.

787
00:57:04,963 --> 00:57:06,464
An executive order?

788
00:57:06,631 --> 00:57:08,800
Delegate Yun Chan-gyeong suggested it?

789
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:12,011
Yes, is it impossible?

790
00:57:12,554 --> 00:57:13,555
It's possible.

791
00:57:14,722 --> 00:57:16,724
According to the 75th Amendment
of the Constitution,

792
00:57:16,808 --> 00:57:18,393
if you order a state of emergency,

793
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:21,813
you can dismiss
the Special Judicial Police of Seoul

794
00:57:21,896 --> 00:57:25,692
and revoke the Special Crime
Investigation Zones of Mohyeon and Bogil.

795
00:57:26,734 --> 00:57:28,111
-I'm relieved.
-Only...

796
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:31,990
by an elected President though.

797
00:57:33,491 --> 00:57:35,201
The 71st Amendment states

798
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:38,663
that an acting president is entrusted
with the authorities of a president,

799
00:57:38,746 --> 00:57:40,081
but only up to established orders.

800
00:57:40,165 --> 00:57:43,751
You may only give orders
to maintain the status quo.

801
00:57:44,169 --> 00:57:46,588
An executive order is a new command,

802
00:57:47,046 --> 00:57:48,715
one that disturbs the status quo.

803
00:57:50,091 --> 00:57:52,886
Are you saying
I don't have the authority then?

804
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:56,222
The Constitution doesn't specify

805
00:57:56,639 --> 00:57:59,058
that an acting president can't issue
an executive order. But...

806
00:57:59,184 --> 00:58:02,103
Please form an advisory panel
to provide counsel.

807
00:58:02,187 --> 00:58:03,605
Yes, sir.

808
00:58:04,105 --> 00:58:08,234
It seems like you want to knock
Mayor Kang out cold, Mr. President.

809
00:58:09,152 --> 00:58:10,028
Is that a problem?

810
00:58:10,987 --> 00:58:12,238
He is currently

811
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:15,575
the strongest presidential candidate
of the majority party.

812
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:18,536
He shouldn't be completely
put down like this.

813
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:20,205
It'll ruin his reputation.

814
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:23,583
I thought you were opposed
to his policies.

815
00:58:23,666 --> 00:58:24,959
You...

816
00:58:29,714 --> 00:58:30,757
are an independent.

817
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:37,472
Please reconsider
a political solution, sir.

818
00:58:45,271 --> 00:58:46,731
I'll go after her.

819
00:58:51,444 --> 00:58:53,530
If you insist on an executive order,

820
00:58:53,613 --> 00:58:55,657
the opposing party will say
you're abusing your power.

821
00:58:56,491 --> 00:58:58,034
They'll suggest impeachment

822
00:58:58,618 --> 00:59:01,162
and turn the presidential election around
in their favor.

823
00:59:01,871 --> 00:59:04,415
That's why Ms. Yun offered you that tip.

824
00:59:04,499 --> 00:59:09,003
She wanted to ruin Mayor Kang's reputation
and have you impeached.

825
00:59:15,802 --> 00:59:19,389
Are you only against the executive order

826
00:59:19,472 --> 00:59:21,849
because Mayor Kang
is from the majority party?

827
00:59:22,141 --> 00:59:24,269
You're taking sides.
Are you allowed to do that?

828
00:59:24,352 --> 00:59:25,770
This is the Blue House!

829
00:59:25,853 --> 00:59:28,356
What's wrong with taking sides, Ms. Jeong?

830
00:59:29,691 --> 00:59:32,151
-Because--
-To a lifer in the government like you,

831
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:34,654
a change in regime
seems like a battle for power.

832
00:59:34,737 --> 00:59:37,407
However, to a government employee
who was specially recruited like me,

833
00:59:37,490 --> 00:59:39,659
it's the succession of certain policies.

834
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:48,626
Decentralization of power
has been President Yang's desire.

835
00:59:51,296 --> 00:59:53,339
I agree that Mayor Kang isn't likable.

836
00:59:53,673 --> 00:59:56,926
However, when it comes to
decentralization of power,

837
00:59:57,010 --> 00:59:59,846
he is the only politician
who shares President Yang's vision.

838
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:04,726
PROMOTING
DECENTRALIZATION OF POWER

839
01:00:04,809 --> 01:00:06,477
Since the bombing,

840
01:00:07,145 --> 01:00:11,190
I haven't been able to cry out loud
and mourn

841
01:00:11,274 --> 01:00:13,234
for my boss of 20 years.

842
01:00:13,985 --> 01:00:15,194
Because I'm apologetic,

843
01:00:16,487 --> 01:00:17,572
angry,

844
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:20,491
and infuriated by the injustice.

845
01:00:23,536 --> 01:00:25,622
His ideas,
which were written on these pages...

846
01:00:26,956 --> 01:00:28,583
I must

847
01:00:29,959 --> 01:00:31,753
see them become a reality.

848
01:00:36,924 --> 01:00:39,719
That is my way of mourning him.

849
01:01:03,701 --> 01:01:06,245
Without the help
of the presidential staff,

850
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:09,499
nothing will be easy,
from Cabinet meetings

851
01:01:09,582 --> 01:01:11,209
to challenging the opposing party.

852
01:01:12,794 --> 01:01:16,089
Do you still want to try
the executive order?

853
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:19,258
There's no other way.

854
01:01:22,095 --> 01:01:23,471
Then

855
01:01:24,639 --> 01:01:26,182
please remember this.

856
01:01:27,558 --> 01:01:29,227
Once you issue the executive order

857
01:01:29,310 --> 01:01:31,396
and subdue Mayor Kang,

858
01:01:32,146 --> 01:01:34,107
you will have begun

859
01:01:34,649 --> 01:01:39,237
the Park Mu-jin administration.

860
01:01:40,363 --> 01:01:43,032
With all the prominent figures
of the majority party gone,

861
01:01:43,116 --> 01:01:46,285
people will naturally begin to look to you

862
01:01:46,369 --> 01:01:48,371
as a strong presidential candidate.

863
01:01:48,871 --> 01:01:53,418
I only wish to do what I must
in this position now.

864
01:01:53,501 --> 01:01:55,169
What you want doesn't matter.

865
01:01:56,796 --> 01:02:00,508
People will have expectations
on their own volition

866
01:02:01,217 --> 01:02:03,302
and then quickly turn their backs to you.

867
01:02:03,386 --> 01:02:07,932
The media, using verification
as a justification, will question you.

868
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:12,103
Your political enemies will dig
into you, your family, and friends

869
01:02:12,186 --> 01:02:14,647
to find a weak spot they can exploit.

870
01:02:16,733 --> 01:02:18,025
There's a chance

871
01:02:18,735 --> 01:02:21,070
you'll never return
to the life you once had.

872
01:02:22,530 --> 01:02:23,990
The same goes for your family.

873
01:02:25,825 --> 01:02:27,201
Would you be OK with that?

874
01:02:28,911 --> 01:02:29,996
Why

875
01:02:31,497 --> 01:02:32,749
are you telling me this?

876
01:02:35,918 --> 01:02:38,713
Becoming acting president
wasn't your choice,

877
01:02:39,922 --> 01:02:41,632
but this matter is.

878
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:13,456
Mr. President,

879
01:03:13,539 --> 01:03:16,542
I'm calling about the advisory board
regarding the executive order.

880
01:03:18,377 --> 01:03:20,254
-Sir?
-Ms. Jeong,

881
01:03:22,006 --> 01:03:24,091
could I get back to you on that?

882
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:48,407
You're up late today.

883
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:53,079
Is something wrong?

884
01:03:59,752 --> 01:04:01,712
My client Jin-ju...

885
01:04:05,925 --> 01:04:07,134
She died

886
01:04:08,469 --> 01:04:09,512
just now.

887
01:04:12,682 --> 01:04:15,393
All she needed was a hormone shot
to get better,

888
01:04:17,103 --> 01:04:19,146
but I wasn't able to get that for her.

889
01:04:22,108 --> 01:04:23,734
While crossing the Tumen River

890
01:04:24,902 --> 01:04:28,197
and going through Kunming
and Laos to get here,

891
01:04:30,533 --> 01:04:33,452
she survived
several near-death situations.

892
01:04:34,954 --> 01:04:37,582
That's how she got to South Korea,

893
01:04:38,583 --> 01:04:41,168
but this nation couldn't
give her a simple shot

894
01:04:42,128 --> 01:04:43,963
and caused her death.

895
01:04:46,716 --> 01:04:47,717
I wasn't

896
01:04:48,217 --> 01:04:50,177
able to do anything.

897
01:04:52,346 --> 01:04:54,265
I'm her lawyer,

898
01:04:55,182 --> 01:04:58,436
but I was worried
that people might judge me,

899
01:04:59,437 --> 01:05:00,563
and I was afraid

900
01:05:01,981 --> 01:05:04,483
it would harm you somehow.

901
01:05:10,031 --> 01:05:11,908
-Gang-yeon.
-Why...

902
01:05:14,035 --> 01:05:15,369
couldn't you do anything?

903
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:18,080
What were you afraid of?

904
01:05:20,708 --> 01:05:24,086
We did absolutely nothing...

905
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:28,090
even though we were in a position
to do so.

906
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:53,449
What should we do, Secretary Han?

907
01:05:54,075 --> 01:05:56,494
We need an emergency meeting
with the police and prosecutors.

908
01:05:56,577 --> 01:05:58,079
What is it?

909
01:05:59,455 --> 01:06:02,792
North Korean defectors
are enraged by Heo Jin-ju's death

910
01:06:02,875 --> 01:06:05,920
and gathering on social media
and in various communities.

911
01:06:06,754 --> 01:06:10,174
They seem to be planning a huge memorial
at Gwanghwamun this Saturday.

912
01:06:12,301 --> 01:06:13,219
The problem is

913
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:16,722
that another organization is scheduled
to gather there that day.

914
01:06:16,973 --> 01:06:18,099
It can't be...

915
01:06:18,224 --> 01:06:20,518
The extremists that
assaulted the defectors in Bogil

916
01:06:20,601 --> 01:06:22,520
are registered to gather there.

917
01:06:23,354 --> 01:06:26,440
We can't let that happen.
If they get into a conflict--

918
01:06:26,524 --> 01:06:28,234
Then our worst fear will come true.

919
01:06:28,317 --> 01:06:29,694
Where is President Park?

920
01:06:45,793 --> 01:06:46,794
Excuse me.

921
01:06:47,086 --> 01:06:49,088
Have you seen President Park?

922
01:06:49,171 --> 01:06:50,965
He isn't answering his phone.

923
01:06:52,383 --> 01:06:53,467
No, I haven't.

924
01:07:08,107 --> 01:07:08,983
Mr. President.

925
01:07:10,401 --> 01:07:12,319
I'm glad you're here, Ms. Jeong.

926
01:07:12,403 --> 01:07:14,488
I've looked all over for you.

927
01:07:14,572 --> 01:07:16,115
Here.

928
01:07:16,198 --> 01:07:18,409
Ambassador's basic human rights,

929
01:07:18,492 --> 01:07:19,827
active provision claim...

930
01:07:20,578 --> 01:07:22,204
What does this mean?

931
01:07:22,913 --> 01:07:23,748
Excuse me?

932
01:07:25,499 --> 01:07:28,419
I was a science major,
so social studies isn't my forte.

933
01:07:33,591 --> 01:07:36,052
Did you study the Constitution
because of...

934
01:07:36,552 --> 01:07:37,386
the executive order?

935
01:07:38,387 --> 01:07:41,849
I was a science major,
and I don't know many Chinese characters.

936
01:07:49,315 --> 01:07:51,067
THE CONSTITUTION
OF THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA

937
01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:53,736
I thought the answer
would be in the Constitution,

938
01:07:54,487 --> 01:07:55,905
but it wasn't.

939
01:07:55,988 --> 01:07:57,740
I read it over and over,
but didn't get it.

940
01:07:57,823 --> 01:08:00,618
So I've decided to go with your opinion.

941
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:05,790
The acting president can only
maintain preexisting rules.

942
01:08:06,665 --> 01:08:09,335
That's what I intend to do.

943
01:08:11,629 --> 01:08:15,549
I see you've made a decision.

944
01:08:17,593 --> 01:08:18,677
I will issue...

945
01:08:20,346 --> 01:08:21,472
an executive order.

946
01:08:24,975 --> 01:08:28,604
The orders I have to go by
as acting president

947
01:08:28,687 --> 01:08:31,232
are those that were effective
on March 4 when my term started.

948
01:08:31,732 --> 01:08:33,109
The discrimination policy

949
01:08:33,192 --> 01:08:35,861
against North Korean defectors
began the day after.

950
01:08:38,072 --> 01:08:38,948
In other words,

951
01:08:39,573 --> 01:08:43,160
within the order I am bound by
as acting president,

952
01:08:44,578 --> 01:08:46,747
the discrimination policy didn't exist.

953
01:08:55,256 --> 01:08:56,715
I issue an executive order

954
01:08:58,008 --> 01:09:01,178
to carry out my duty
to maintain preexisting orders.

955
01:09:04,598 --> 01:09:07,351
-This is risky.
-Please reconsider.

956
01:09:07,434 --> 01:09:08,477
I'm...

957
01:09:09,854 --> 01:09:11,397
I'm against this, sir.

958
01:09:19,196 --> 01:09:21,031
I didn't think you'd disagree,
Secretary Han.

959
01:09:21,699 --> 01:09:24,368
I'm the chief presidential secretary
of the Blue House.

960
01:09:24,451 --> 01:09:28,247
You will return to your school in 60 days.

961
01:09:30,624 --> 01:09:34,545
Those of us here have to carry out
the late president's legitimacy.

962
01:09:35,337 --> 01:09:37,548
I'll make the appropriate choice to do so.

963
01:09:39,884 --> 01:09:42,928
As long as I'm against this,
no one at the Blue House

964
01:09:43,012 --> 01:09:44,638
will side with you.

965
01:09:46,307 --> 01:09:47,433
They're my people.

966
01:09:53,814 --> 01:09:55,858
If you wish to issue an executive order,

967
01:09:56,650 --> 01:09:57,943
you will have to fire me.

968
01:09:59,737 --> 01:10:01,739
Wait, Secretary Han.

969
01:10:02,698 --> 01:10:04,491
Make your choice, sir.

970
01:10:19,798 --> 01:10:20,758
Secretary Cha,

971
01:10:22,843 --> 01:10:24,094
call a Cabinet meeting.

972
01:10:29,183 --> 01:10:30,059
The agenda...

973
01:10:33,687 --> 01:10:35,272
is the issue of an executive order.

974
01:10:43,113 --> 01:10:44,031
As of now,

975
01:10:46,992 --> 01:10:48,702
Secretary Han is dismissed from his job.

976
01:10:52,373 --> 01:10:53,332
Mr. President.

977
01:10:56,210 --> 01:10:57,419
That's it...

978
01:10:59,046 --> 01:11:00,214
for today's meeting.

979
01:11:01,757 --> 01:11:03,425
THE CONSTITUTION
OF THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA

980
01:11:48,178 --> 01:11:50,347
Don't forget this moment, sir.

981
01:11:57,313 --> 01:11:59,940
This is how you use authority.

982
01:12:06,780 --> 01:12:10,576
Do you still think you don't desire
power and authority?

983
01:12:17,458 --> 01:12:19,543
Did you just say "power"?

984
01:12:24,465 --> 01:12:26,508
That has nothing to do with me.

985
01:12:43,942 --> 01:12:46,403
You should've said something to me first.

986
01:12:47,863 --> 01:12:50,282
Did you want to make a point
to the secretarial staff

987
01:12:50,491 --> 01:12:52,493
that President Park
has the greatest authority

988
01:12:52,576 --> 01:12:54,578
and to be loyal
if they want to stick around?

989
01:12:56,413 --> 01:12:58,582
You were right.

990
01:12:59,917 --> 01:13:01,835
It's not that he never wanted power,

991
01:13:02,336 --> 01:13:04,671
but he just didn't have the chance.

992
01:13:10,344 --> 01:13:11,345
Then...

993
01:13:12,679 --> 01:13:14,807
is President Park your choice

994
01:13:15,599 --> 01:13:18,811
like you chose the late President Yang
30 years ago?

995
01:13:23,816 --> 01:13:26,318
You will have to carry a heavy burden now.

996
01:13:27,111 --> 01:13:30,447
You have to take care of the Blue House
without me.

997
01:13:52,344 --> 01:13:55,472
Is it true President Park
is issuing an executive order?

998
01:13:55,556 --> 01:13:59,059
-Isn't that abuse of authority?
-Isn't that grounds for impeachment?

999
01:14:07,943 --> 01:14:10,779
Stick to one thing.
Either become competent

1000
01:14:10,863 --> 01:14:12,322
or step down.

1001
01:14:15,075 --> 01:14:16,618
Please answer.

1002
01:14:18,036 --> 01:14:19,413
Please answer!

1003
01:14:21,957 --> 01:14:23,208
Please answer.

1004
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:24,877
-Please answer.
-Wait a minute!

1005
01:14:26,044 --> 01:14:28,672
-Excuse me.
-Wait!

1006
01:14:28,755 --> 01:14:30,340
-What's this?
-Please answer!

1007
01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:31,717
What is going on?

1008
01:14:35,095 --> 01:14:36,263
Is it over already?

1009
01:14:45,522 --> 01:14:46,648
Wait!

1010
01:14:49,318 --> 01:14:52,112
What just happened? Where did he go?

1011
01:14:52,196 --> 01:14:54,823
Aren't you going to do
the afternoon brief?

1012
01:14:56,033 --> 01:14:59,036
Why? Do I have to tell you
if I'm asking a North Korean defector

1013
01:14:59,119 --> 01:15:01,622
or a Blue House adviser?

1014
01:15:03,582 --> 01:15:07,085
This is a work directive for Kim Nam-wook,
a defector and Blue House director.

1015
01:15:09,796 --> 01:15:12,090
Are you telling me to stand
in front of the cameras

1016
01:15:12,174 --> 01:15:14,635
and become the hope and dreams
of devastated defectors?

1017
01:15:15,219 --> 01:15:17,888
Go ahead if that's what you want to do,

1018
01:15:18,555 --> 01:15:20,057
but "hope and dreams"...

1019
01:15:21,725 --> 01:15:25,646
Watch what you say about
Sejong the Great or Admiral Yi Sun-sin.

1020
01:15:28,398 --> 01:15:30,108
We don't have a press secretary,

1021
01:15:30,526 --> 01:15:31,902
and you're the best option

1022
01:15:32,945 --> 01:15:33,904
among us.

1023
01:15:35,155 --> 01:15:35,989
Right?

1024
01:15:36,490 --> 01:15:38,367
Do you need more reasons?

1025
01:15:44,498 --> 01:15:46,041
He loves compliments.

1026
01:15:46,708 --> 01:15:48,502
BLUE HOUSE

1027
01:15:56,885 --> 01:15:59,513
We will now begin the afternoon brief
of March 6.

1028
01:16:02,182 --> 01:16:03,767
Acting President Park Mu-jin...

1029
01:16:07,145 --> 01:16:09,398
First, I'd like to relay my condolences

1030
01:16:09,481 --> 01:16:11,275
for the death of Ms. Heo Jin-ju

1031
01:16:11,358 --> 01:16:15,779
during the investigation
by the Special Judicial Police in Bogil.

1032
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:29,668
President Park...

1033
01:16:44,016 --> 01:16:47,686
President Park Mu-jin has issued
an executive order to revoke

1034
01:16:47,811 --> 01:16:49,813
the designation of Mohyeon and Bogil

1035
01:16:49,896 --> 01:16:52,774
as Special Crime Investigation Zones
on March 6.

1036
01:16:58,196 --> 01:16:59,990
SPECIAL CRIME INVESTIGATION ZONE

1037
01:17:06,663 --> 01:17:09,666
-Thank God it's over.
-I know.

1038
01:17:11,418 --> 01:17:15,422
COMMIES GO HOME!

1039
01:17:15,922 --> 01:17:18,508
GO HOME!

1040
01:17:22,804 --> 01:17:23,680
Ms. Choe,

1041
01:17:25,057 --> 01:17:26,767
would you like to read The Gazette?

1042
01:17:26,850 --> 01:17:28,018
THE GAZETTE

1043
01:17:29,144 --> 01:17:32,064
The Special Judicial Police's
investigations will be transferred

1044
01:17:32,147 --> 01:17:33,982
to the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency,

1045
01:17:34,066 --> 01:17:35,692
and there will be

1046
01:17:35,776 --> 01:17:38,487
no prejudice or discrimination
as per the principle of legality.

1047
01:18:01,259 --> 01:18:03,845
Is this Ms. Heo Jin-ju's husband?

1048
01:18:11,478 --> 01:18:14,815
This is Acting President Park Mu-jin.

1049
01:18:26,159 --> 01:18:27,452
Are you going to the residence?

1050
01:18:41,133 --> 01:18:42,592
FAMILY OF THE MISSING

1051
01:19:27,220 --> 01:19:30,682
We have to wrap this up. Here you go.

1052
01:19:30,766 --> 01:19:33,435
-Check the revised document.
-Yes, sir.

1053
01:19:33,518 --> 01:19:34,936
Let's keep at it.

1054
01:19:35,187 --> 01:19:36,104
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

1055
01:19:42,027 --> 01:19:43,153
What is it this time?

1056
01:19:46,156 --> 01:19:47,324
What is it, Na-gyeong?

1057
01:19:49,284 --> 01:19:51,828
Who is less unfortunate?

1058
01:19:52,954 --> 01:19:54,706
Is it the family of the deceased...

1059
01:19:56,082 --> 01:19:57,125
or...

1060
01:19:57,417 --> 01:19:59,419
KIM JUN-O

1061
01:20:00,504 --> 01:20:02,047
...the family of the missing?

1062
01:20:05,759 --> 01:20:07,469
There's a survivor here!

1063
01:20:08,762 --> 01:20:09,888
It's a survivor!

1064
01:20:10,597 --> 01:20:11,848
They said they found someone!

1065
01:20:11,932 --> 01:20:14,184
-There's a survivor?
-They found someone? Oh, my!

1066
01:20:16,978 --> 01:20:18,396
You can't go any further!

1067
01:20:20,941 --> 01:20:22,275
There's a survivor!

1068
01:20:25,111 --> 01:20:27,405
Hang in there. We almost have you.

1069
01:20:27,989 --> 01:20:30,867
-On 3. 1, 2, 3.
-Hurry!

1070
01:20:31,368 --> 01:20:32,202
Unfold it!

1071
01:20:34,204 --> 01:20:36,248
-Get it ready now!
-Here he comes.

1072
01:21:03,650 --> 01:21:04,734
It's quite interesting.

1073
01:21:05,318 --> 01:21:08,488
Someone becomes a beacon of hope
just for being alive.

1074
01:21:08,572 --> 01:21:10,740
And another gains
the highest power in Korea

1075
01:21:10,824 --> 01:21:12,450
just for being alive.

1076
01:21:14,119 --> 01:21:17,455
Isn't it weird?
No one survived the collapse.

1077
01:21:17,539 --> 01:21:19,958
Assemblyman Kim's location at the time
is unexplainable.

1078
01:21:20,041 --> 01:21:23,253
Don't you know his political career
will be over if this video gets out?

1079
01:21:23,628 --> 01:21:26,172
It's my decision.
I'll take responsibility.

1080
01:21:26,256 --> 01:21:27,382
What's happening?

1081
01:21:27,465 --> 01:21:28,466
It's the Blue House.
