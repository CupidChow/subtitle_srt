ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
PLACES AND EVENTS ARE FICTIONAL.

2
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:10,528
IN THE ABSENCE OF THE PRESIDENT,

3
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:15,742
OR IF THE PRESIDENT IS UNABLE TO PERFORM
THE PRESIDENTIAL DUTIES,

4
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:20,163
THE PRIME MINISTER OR LAWFULLY CHOSEN
CABINET MEMBER SHALL BE ACTING PRESIDENT.

00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:26,002
ARTICLE 71,
THE CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA

6
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:30,423
THE ACTING PRESIDENT

7
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:36,054
Hi, it's Monday, March 4th,
and you're listening to TBN News Today.

8
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:37,931
At the Korea-US FTA negotiations today,

9
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:41,476
both parties agreed
to lower the emission standard

10
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:46,564
of diesel cars imported from the US.

11
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:48,066
I have something to tell you.

12
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:52,153
About 25 to 50 thousand vehicles

13
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:53,988
that are manufactured in the US

14
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:58,576
and in compliance
with the US safety standards

15
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:02,247
will be imported
starting on the 20th of next month.

16
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:06,042
Although the government announced
that it was a successful negotiation,

17
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:09,129
some environmental organizations

18
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,339
are voicing criticism,

19
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:14,717
saying that the EPA's
environmental impact statement

20
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,719
is excessively lower than that of Europe.

21
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:22,517
Vice ministers from the North and South
will meet at Panmunjom this afternoon.

22
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,646
We heard the opinions of those
at the site.

23
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,899
The current government...

24
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,067
What is it?

25
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:32,318
Well...

26
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:35,697
I have something to tell you.

27
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:36,948
Don't.

28
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:39,200
It's been less than a year
since you got a new computer,

29
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:41,828
six months since you got a new tablet,
and your phone...

30
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:45,957
Don't you think you should keep it
until your contract ends?

31
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,751
-That's not it.
-No?

32
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:51,838
Then go ahead and make your statement.

33
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:54,632
I'll decide afterward
whether or not I'll show mercy.

34
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:57,594
Loan guarantee, loan, gambling, women.

35
00:02:58,094 --> 00:02:59,596
Is it any of the above?

36
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:02,390
...air the administrative speech
to you live.

37
00:03:02,473 --> 00:03:05,268
Unprecedentedly, the ministers
of each government agency

38
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:06,352
and cabinet members are--

39
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:12,942
What?

40
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:15,195
Hey...

41
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:21,451
CHANGE IN INTER-KOREAN RELATIONS

42
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:32,128
Why are you here?

43
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:36,299
You said Si-jin
went on a field trip today, right?

44
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:39,802
Should we go pick her up?
Where did you say they went?

45
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:41,971
The National Assembly.

46
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,849
Oh, yes. That's right.

47
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,643
The National Assembly...

48
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,533
Shouldn't you be
at the National Assembly, too?

49
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:04,369
Next to the president?

50
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,166
I wonder what you're doing here
next to me instead of the president.

51
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:13,920
I'll tell you.

52
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:16,381
-Gang-yeon, I--
-No way.

53
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:19,425
Did you get fired?

54
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,220
Fired? Of course not.

55
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:35,984
Are you okay, Si-wan?

56
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,571
What is going on?

57
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:01,426
What the...

58
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:10,727
What?

59
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:35,001
CHANGE IN INTER-KOREAN RELATIONS

60
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:55,521
Honey. Get up.

61
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,026
Si-jin's teacher
isn't answering her phone.

62
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:04,447
What about Si-jin? We have to go get her.

63
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,282
Honey. Si-wan.

64
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:14,892
Hurry! This way!

65
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:41,502
DAY 60: THE ACTING PRESIDENT
EPISODE 1

66
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:22,084
THE DAY OF THE ATTACK, 9 A.M.

67
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:32,428
Safety and security,
the VIP's travel route, check.

68
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,056
The top center section is good to go.

69
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,517
Okay, good.

70
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:41,145
CHIEF SECRETARY OF PRESIDENTIAL PROTOCOL
CHOE HO-JEON

71
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:53,074
PROTOCOL ADMINISTRATOR
PARK SU-GYO

72
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:55,952
Isn't the president greeting people

73
00:08:56,536 --> 00:09:00,456
from 1, 2, 3 steps away

74
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,291
from the podium?

75
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,877
Listen, Mr. Park.

76
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:09,465
Are you trying to win a medal
for saving costs by using less tape?

77
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,843
The quick-tempered president
will be excited

78
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:15,096
and will pass right by it
unless it stands out.

79
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,764
Know what will happen then?

80
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:20,268
The opposing parties will come together

81
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:22,144
and have a ball.

82
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:25,064
They'll say the president
belittled the National Assembly

83
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:26,315
and that he has no class.

84
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:28,359
The newspapers will sing

85
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:30,403
and internet sites
will play accompaniment.

86
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:32,572
It's not even the World Cup,

87
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:35,491
but the whole nation
will come together as one.

88
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:39,412
How long has it been
since you worked at the Blue House?

89
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:44,041
It's been a year since I came to
the Blue House and served the president.

90
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:45,710
Su-gyo.

91
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:49,005
Being a protocol administrator

92
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:52,133
isn't about serving things
to the president on a silver platter.

93
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,969
You have to be more like a traffic light.

94
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,054
A traffic light?

95
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:58,431
Stop or go.

96
00:09:58,514 --> 00:10:00,808
Front or back. Left or right.

97
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,728
You signal everyone,

98
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:07,982
so the superiors
don't crash into each other.

99
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:10,901
It isn't that difficult.

100
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:15,448
If you save tape and cause our leader's
approval rating to drop,

101
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:18,451
it'll be on your shoulders.

102
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:22,580
-Is everything okay?
-Yes.

103
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:23,914
Let's go.

104
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,626
Let's pick up our leader.

105
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:50,358
CURRENT ECONOMIC TREND

106
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:51,400
SPEECH

107
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,820
PRESIDENT
YANG JIN-MAN

108
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:57,615
Mr. President, Secretary Choe called.

109
00:10:57,698 --> 00:10:59,992
The vehicles
and the National Assembly are clear.

110
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:02,286
You can leave as soon as you're ready.

111
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,877
Here is the approval rating

112
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:12,588
of the government administration
as of yesterday.

113
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:23,349
APPROVAL RATING

114
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:25,685
GOVERNMENT ADMINISTRATION EVALUATION

115
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:32,525
Do you know

116
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:34,735
who the easiest man

117
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:36,821
in the world is?

118
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,116
No, I don't.

119
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:43,536
One thing for sure is that it isn't me.

120
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:49,875
Who is the easiest man?

121
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:53,421
A president with a single-digit
approval rating.

122
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:58,008
If someone holds out a hand,
regardless of who they might be,

123
00:11:58,592 --> 00:12:00,469
he'd be willing to give up his soul.

124
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:05,057
Goodness, you guys.

125
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:07,309
Smile a little.

126
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:09,228
I'm not talking about myself.

127
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:12,940
It's a joke the Prime Minister of France

128
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:15,651
told me during the G20 Banquet.

129
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:16,736
It's a joke.

130
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:20,322
I'm ashamed, Mr. President.

131
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:23,576
Gang-ho.

132
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,035
Yes?

133
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:33,085
You can still provide for your family
even if you leave the Blue House, right?

134
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:34,670
Pardon?

135
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,005
Today,

136
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,215
after the State of the Nation Address,

137
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:41,135
if there seems to be
no chance for a rebound,

138
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:45,556
let's stop worrying about polls
and approval ratings.

139
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:47,767
I'm a failure anyway.

140
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:50,853
What good would checking numbers
every morning do me?

141
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:53,564
You'd just be embarrassed,

142
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,692
and I'd be shameless.

143
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:01,947
-But Mr. President--
-Secretary Cha.

144
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:06,118
Isn't it almost time to leave?

145
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:07,703
Yes, sir.

146
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:25,346
Is something wrong?

147
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:26,430
Give me a minute.

148
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:29,391
STATE MINISTER OF POLITICAL AFFAIRS
SIN SEONG-JUN

149
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,768
I heard something shocking

150
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:33,604
will be shared during the speech.
You know what it is, right?

151
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:36,941
Let's hear what the hidden card is.

152
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:39,485
If you and I both knew,
it wouldn't be a hidden card,

153
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:42,988
but an obvious card.
I don't know what it is.

154
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:45,699
Come on. We both know you're lying.

155
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,661
Let's ask the administrator
of the Speechwriting Office

156
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:51,080
for a copy of the speech.

157
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,833
I'm
the state minister of political affairs.

158
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:57,169
It's my responsibility to mediate between
the Assembly and the Blue House.

159
00:13:57,878 --> 00:14:00,881
The guys in the opposing parties
need something to choose sides.

160
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,259
Whether the fight be indoors or out.

161
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:06,387
The sun is harsh right now.

162
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,556
You don't want to be out there.

163
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:10,516
What do you think?

164
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:12,768
Should I have them buy sunscreen?

165
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:14,103
Should I?

166
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:19,525
You must be more worried
about the opposing party's assemblymen

167
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:21,068
than the president.

168
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:23,195
No, not really.

169
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,447
It isn't about the parties.

170
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,867
We're all partners
in government administration.

171
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:36,792
Is this the Speechwriting Office?

172
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:41,213
The script for today's
State of the Nation Address...

173
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:42,965
Yes.

174
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:46,051
Could you have

175
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:48,721
everyone and their mothers
talking about it already?

176
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:50,598
If you need to change buses,

177
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:52,725
buy a bus ticket with your own money.

178
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:55,311
Don't try to use the president's name
to secure a spot.

179
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:57,771
Yes, have a good day.

180
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:04,904
You think you're a founding contributor
of this administration, don't you?

181
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:07,698
Your career

182
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:10,075
ends with him.

183
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,953
He hasn't served half his term yet,

184
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:14,997
but he has a single-digit approval rating.

185
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:17,583
This ship is going down.

186
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:22,212
Start rowing, and row hard.

187
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,465
You have strong arms.

188
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:26,926
One, two. One, two.

189
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:39,813
Do you think North Korea will agree
to our requests by the end?

190
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:43,192
We need to settle on a peace treaty

191
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:46,195
within the year no matter what it takes.

192
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:49,573
Only then will we be free
from the attack of the opposing party.

193
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:51,742
If North Korea-United States relations
get resolved,

194
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:54,119
I doubt North Korea will slow down.

195
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:58,332
We can't let the American radicals
lead public opinion.

196
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:03,504
President Reynold must need something
to show his people.

197
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:05,756
The midterm elections are coming up.

198
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,760
The US has made

199
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:13,430
some unreasonable requests
for the FTA renegotiations.

200
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:16,558
They must know we're in no place

201
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:19,144
to turn it down.

202
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:21,438
He sells arms

203
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,315
and peace.

204
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:28,153
President Reynold
is quite the natural-born businessman.

205
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:31,031
Secretary Han.

206
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:34,034
What do you think?

207
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,453
Do you think

208
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:39,832
I still have a chance left?

209
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:41,375
Or...

210
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:49,591
Please bring the president
a warm cup of tea.

211
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:53,595
You've done a good job thus far.

212
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:56,557
A historian said

213
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,143
that ever since Noron ruled
during the Joseon Dynasty,

214
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:01,687
President Yang Jin-man's administration
was the first

215
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:04,273
to succeed in the change of regime.

216
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:22,958
So?

217
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:26,003
Am I supposed to be satisfied

218
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:28,505
with my title as the president
that succeeded in regime change

219
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:31,759
and sit here doing nothing
but securing my seat

220
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:34,219
for the rest of my term?

221
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:36,013
Is that it?

222
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:37,973
Is it?

223
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:44,646
I wanted to change history,
not just the government!

224
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,106
What I want...

225
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:50,444
is for you to stop getting hurt.

226
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:55,407
Whether you change the nation or history,

227
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:57,326
do as you please.

228
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:02,331
However, you can't force me to think
that there is anything more important

229
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:04,875
than you, Mr. President.

230
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:13,217
You don't have to worry
about the FTA renegotiations.

231
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:15,427
I've sent one of our people

232
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:17,429
to ensure our alliance
with the US won't suffer.

233
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:24,269
These are the president's wishes.

234
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:26,313
Okay.

235
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:32,736
I'll have to ask for your cooperation.

236
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,657
ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS EVALUATION

237
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:45,290
CHIEF OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
GU YONG-WAN

238
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:47,835
The US negotiating team
contacted us yesterday.

239
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,129
They asked us to lower
the environmental standards

240
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:51,672
for vehicles from the US

241
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:55,884
to fit the standards of the US, not Korea.

242
00:18:56,009 --> 00:19:00,180
The number of imported cars
will go up to 50,000 instead of 25.

243
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:03,392
However, I have attached the EPA's
environmental impact statement

244
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:06,311
which shows that the air pollution level
is very low,

245
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:08,063
as you can see.

246
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,318
I know, I know.

247
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:16,613
It's true. It's much lower

248
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:18,866
than Korea's emission control standard.

249
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:22,035
Of course the degree of air pollution

250
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:23,787
and fine dust will rise.

251
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:26,540
But what can we do?

252
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:28,750
We're dealing with the US.

253
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:33,839
When you encounter a tiger,

254
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:36,717
it's best to throw snacks its way.

255
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:38,552
Minister Park.

256
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:44,391
We can't let it rip our limbs off, right?
We have kids to feed at home.

257
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:48,020
Minister Park,

258
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:50,147
are you even listening to us?

259
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:02,117
MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENT
PARK MU-JIN

260
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,702
A contaminated plastic bottle

261
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:06,788
is no longer recyclable.
It's just regular garbage

262
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,082
that takes tax money to dispose of.

263
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:19,009
I see you take public interest
quite seriously.

264
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:23,472
Minister Park, it's time for the meeting.

265
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:38,862
Isn't this just as contaminated as well?

266
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:40,739
It can't be recycled.

267
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:44,368
Exhaust emissions?

268
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:48,789
Minister Park,
I almost forgot the most important part.

269
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:52,167
If this renegotiation falls through

270
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:55,128
and sparks a conflict
between the two nations,

271
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:57,714
then someone

272
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:00,175
will have to put their job on the line.

273
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:11,853
Excuse me, then.

274
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:25,784
What was the number again?

275
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:29,997
The number of cars that lowers
the exhaust emission standard to the US's.

276
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:32,749
The import quota is 50,000 vehicles.

277
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:35,794
I'm more than happy to tell you twice,

278
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:37,546
but at the negotiating table...

279
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:42,259
I don't think it's 50,000.

280
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:45,262
I think the calculation is incorrect.

281
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:47,180
Excuse me, then.

282
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,484
TOTAL OF 1.48 MILLION,
ABOUT 1.5 MILLION VEHICLES

283
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:03,697
I can't believe the president.
How could he threaten your job?

284
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:06,450
He's the one

285
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:09,286
who pulled you from teaching
to solve the fine dust matter.

286
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:12,914
Now he's telling you
to be his obedient puppet!

287
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:19,296
Let's take a photo.

288
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:32,225
Will Minister Park do as we wish?

289
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:37,147
A science prodigy in high school,
a professor at KAIST,

290
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:40,108
and now the youngest minister
in Korean history.

291
00:22:40,984 --> 00:22:42,569
What do you think all that means?

292
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:45,572
That he's a genius?

293
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:47,199
He's a goody-goody.

294
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,453
I doubt he wants to be fired
six months after being appointed.

295
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:55,624
He has probably never experienced
such dishonor in his life.

296
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:59,127
True. I hear they called him Cinderella

297
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:01,463
at the Sejong Office.

298
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:08,512
It fits.

299
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:12,641
He's a science professor
with no background in politics,

300
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:15,936
but the president personally
made him a minister.

301
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:43,964
The agriculture market
can't be an exception.

302
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:46,425
What? The agriculture market?

303
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:49,261
South Korea is already

304
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:52,431
effectuating the value of the FTA
the best.

305
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:56,977
Just look at the US's demand regarding
the importation of diesel vehicles.

306
00:23:57,644 --> 00:24:01,022
Lowering the exhaust emission guidelines

307
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:03,692
like the US is demanding

308
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:08,613
is unacceptable
to the Ministry of Environment.

309
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:10,240
How could we?

310
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:15,162
Due to concern and fear
regarding air pollution,

311
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:19,082
all countries are shifting
toward Europe's strict guidelines.

312
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:22,919
Still, after deep consideration
and serious debate...

313
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,339
Make sure you get that across.

314
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:28,842
Which word?

315
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:30,010
-Con--
-Deep consideration.

316
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:31,970
-Yes, that. Emphasize it.
-Okay.

317
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:34,598
However, after deep consideration,

318
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:38,477
we have decided to accept
the demands of the US

319
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,061
due to our amicable relationship.

320
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:43,440
We're willing to accept
the demands of the diesel vehicles,

321
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:45,609
so why are you
mentioning the agriculture market?

322
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:47,986
How are we supposed to react to that?

323
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:49,696
Isn't that right, Minister Park?

324
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:07,464
He's halting the negotiations for today.

325
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:09,299
What the hell?

326
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:24,231
...and deceive our long-time ally

327
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:26,650
into buying air pollutants.

328
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:30,445
Please, that's not what I meant.

329
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:02,852
He says it's the first time
in FTA history.

330
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:14,072
A bomb just went off somewhere unexpected.

331
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:17,659
He's trying to shake things up

332
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:19,286
and get a better deal.

333
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:35,176
He's going to seek
an opinion from Washington.

334
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:39,556
Could I apologize to you right now
and settle the matter?

335
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:42,392
Would it be okay if he just apologized
right here, right now?

336
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:55,822
It's between our countries.

337
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,033
Mr. Lee,

338
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:02,245
can I answer the question
you asked me earlier?

339
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:10,211
The air pollution level test result
provided by the EPA...

340
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:13,256
There’s an error in the numbers.

341
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:15,675
From my calculations...

342
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:27,479
Well, from my calculations...

343
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:31,608
Excuse me.

344
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:53,880
Just a second.

345
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:57,258
Where...

346
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:59,386
Minister Park, what is all this?

347
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:01,096
-What are you doing?
-I...

348
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:07,078
Is this how Minister Park is
at the Sejong Office too?

349
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:11,458
Did you not expect this at all?

350
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:17,756
It was an accident.

351
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:19,924
One that no one foresaw.

352
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:23,720
It would've been nice had I known.

353
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:28,433
We could've circulated press releases
and done a live broadcast on social media.

354
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:31,686
"Strong-arming US delegation,

355
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,314
Korea's minister of environment
provides cathartic blow."

356
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:37,859
You've got to admit
it's a shame more people didn't see it.

357
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:40,445
Well, congratulations.

358
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:42,655
Your wish came true.

359
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,662
#SOUTH KOREA-US NEGOTIATIONS

360
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:54,000
JEEZ, I FEEL LIBERATED, LOL

361
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:56,169
MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENT PARK MU-JIN?
WHO IS HE?

362
00:29:57,754 --> 00:29:59,130
Cathartic, did you say?

363
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:01,674
Well, you'll soon find out

364
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,677
how dangerous
Minister Park's actions were.

365
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:13,770
Hello? Jeong Su-jeong speaking.

366
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:36,292
Don't tell me
you're kneeling in contrition right now.

367
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:40,588
It isn't your fault
if the negotiation goes south.

368
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:41,881
The US is to blame.

369
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:45,009
Threatening, overpowering, extorting

370
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:46,261
aren't what an ally does.

371
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,054
That's what thugs do.

372
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:53,226
So hold your head up high, sir.

373
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:54,644
Please?

374
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:57,355
-Ms. Jeong.
-Yes?

375
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:00,859
Call Korea Environment Corporation for me.

376
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:06,281
I checked the fine dust level

377
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:08,741
of Gwanghwamun, stated on its website.

378
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:12,745
There's a huge discrepancy
with the actual measurement.

379
00:31:13,454 --> 00:31:16,291
There must be an issue
with the central measuring device.

380
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:19,252
Wait.

381
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:23,089
Is that what you've been
working on all this time?

382
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:26,718
The Blue House called.

383
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:30,763
The president is waiting for you.

384
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:34,976
If this renegotiation falls through

385
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:37,478
and sparks a conflict
between the two nations,

386
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:40,231
then someone

387
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:42,567
will have to put their job on the line.

388
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:48,364
If you need to explain yourself, do so.

389
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:50,575
If you need to apologize, do that as well.

390
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,495
Not even the Blue House
can easily dismiss you.

391
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:58,750
The president wouldn't openly admit
that he made a mistake by hiring you.

392
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:02,670
Are you worried?

393
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,797
No, I'm actually glad

394
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:06,341
that I'm not the president.

395
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:09,886
He has the power to fire employees,
but he can't exercise that right freely.

396
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,055
That's no fun.

397
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:13,681
Well, what happened earlier

398
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:16,059
in the conference room was very fun.

399
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,689
I've been serving you for six months now.

400
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:26,110
I'm too good of an adviser
to fall for such

401
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:28,029
lame acting.

402
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:32,909
Minister Park Mu-jin is here.

403
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,203
He's waiting for you.

404
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:45,213
Yes?

405
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:48,633
It's the last item on his agenda
before heading to the Assembly.

406
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:50,510
Right after today’s meeting,

407
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:54,055
the US delegation informed us

408
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:58,476
that they’re ceasing
the FTA renegotiation.

409
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:03,564
Minister Park, you're...

410
00:33:06,192 --> 00:33:07,110
our savior.

411
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:18,705
The news about you is spreading

412
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:21,207
all over the internet and social media.

413
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:26,587
When have we ever
talked back to the US, right?

414
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:28,256
I'm sure everyone's gratified.

415
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:30,717
The US delegation will now know

416
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:33,886
how enraged our citizens have been
regarding the pressure on trade.

417
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:36,222
Anyway,

418
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:40,727
the US delegation has just agreed
to return

419
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:42,478
to the negotiation table tomorrow.

420
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:48,693
It's more than all right
to take a stand against the US.

421
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:50,862
That’s what I called you over to say.

422
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:56,325
But Minister Park,

423
00:33:57,243 --> 00:34:00,997
about the environmental impact assessment
of the diesel vehicles...

424
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:05,710
Tomorrow,

425
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:08,254
let's just sign the agreement

426
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:12,175
as if we're being merciful and generous.

427
00:34:20,808 --> 00:34:23,311
Merciful and generous?

428
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:25,646
We’ll be showing good faith

429
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:29,525
by accepting the demands
despite the objections from the people.

430
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,861
The US won’t forget that.

431
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:37,408
Shall we head out then?

432
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:58,304
Those dress shoes look good on you,
Minister Park.

433
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:26,916
They're wrong.

434
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:28,751
The calculations.

435
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:37,552
Yes?

436
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:39,971
He's been summoned by our leader.

437
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:45,685
Our gunslinging cowboy.

438
00:35:45,768 --> 00:35:46,978
Minister Park?

439
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:48,896
Is he with the president?

440
00:35:49,772 --> 00:35:51,149
Keep the bottle clean.

441
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:54,193
Tax money has to be used
to dispose of contaminated bottles.

442
00:35:55,903 --> 00:35:56,904
Tax money.

443
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,032
Thank you.

444
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:03,995
Here, everyone.
Drink it but keep the bottles clean.

445
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:07,540
Contaminated bottles
are no longer recyclable.

446
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,459
Thank you.

447
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,087
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

448
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,338
I don't think it's 50,000.

449
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:18,342
I think the calculation is incorrect.

450
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:22,305
Isn't it 50,000?

451
00:36:22,388 --> 00:36:24,223
The import quota of US vehicles, I mean.

452
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:27,560
Vehicle manufacturers in Korea
will argue for equality

453
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:30,646
and ask that the exhaust emission
guidelines be reduced for them as well.

454
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:33,691
Also, if vehicles from Japan
that are released in the US

455
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:36,194
are allowed to apply
the modified FTA guideline,

456
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:41,199
the total amount of vehicles
we’re looking at is 1.48 million,

457
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:42,658
not 50,000.

458
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:46,621
That's why the EPA's assessment

459
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:50,166
of the environmental impact
based on 50,000 vehicles is wrong.

460
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:53,502
It's a dangerous miscalculation
if you consider the fact

461
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:56,797
that 60 percent of fine dust in Seoul
is from vehicle exhaust emission.

462
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:02,887
Please consider the toxins in the emission
that are harmful to the human body.

463
00:37:03,846 --> 00:37:06,891
Nitrogen oxide, volatile
organic compounds, and hydrocarbons.

464
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:08,309
-The particulate matters--
-Enough.

465
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:10,519
My friend,

466
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:13,940
how am I supposed to understand
such complex jargon?

467
00:37:14,857 --> 00:37:17,109
"Do you know what science
and politics have in common?"

468
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:21,113
That's what you asked me
the first day we met.

469
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:24,283
You told me the answer.

470
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:27,245
"In both fields,
it's hard to say who's lying."

471
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:32,541
That answer

472
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:35,211
is what made me cast my vote for you.

473
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:38,839
Because you were a good person
whom I could trust.

474
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:42,551
But now,

475
00:37:43,886 --> 00:37:45,805
you're telling me to lie,

476
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:48,975
to feign mercy

477
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:50,935
and generosity.

478
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:56,482
Minister Park,

479
00:37:57,441 --> 00:38:00,027
you do not know politics.

480
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:02,780
"You may not know politics,
but I'll let you argue policies."

481
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:06,701
It's what you promised me

482
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:08,327
that very day.

483
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:13,666
Then I'll make another one.

484
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:16,502
We agreed to renegotiate

485
00:38:16,585 --> 00:38:19,964
the guidelines once again after 2021.

486
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:22,842
So when that time comes--

487
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:24,051
Until then,

488
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:27,346
our kids will grow up
breathing this polluted air.

489
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:32,476
Are you saying that
you won't agree to this?

490
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,771
The EPA's assessment
on the environmental impact

491
00:38:36,355 --> 00:38:37,565
is wrong.

492
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:40,818
Are you willing to give up your job

493
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:43,988
because you won't approve a report?

494
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:47,533
I'm a scientist, sir.

495
00:38:48,951 --> 00:38:50,328
I believe that nothing

496
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:52,580
in this world is more valuable than data

497
00:38:53,706 --> 00:38:56,334
applied with responsibility
and interpreted honestly.

498
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:01,672
Then you leave me no choice.

499
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:07,178
Secretary Han,
please contact the Korean delegation.

500
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:12,058
Tell them
I'll be honoring Minister Park's wishes.

501
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:16,729
He will be held responsible
for today's incident

502
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,481
and dismissed from office.

503
00:39:24,945 --> 00:39:27,740
Let them know that
this is my way of showing a long-time ally

504
00:39:27,823 --> 00:39:29,658
my loyalty.

505
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,841
Minister Park.

506
00:40:02,024 --> 00:40:03,442
Is this where I should stand?

507
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:06,028
SIX MONTHS AGO

508
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:07,238
Hold on a second.

509
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:11,575
Something doesn't look right about him.
Don't you agree?

510
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:17,498
Yes, I see it too.

511
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:24,171
All right. Let's see.

512
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:27,883
Let's see.

513
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:32,721
I think we wear the same size.

514
00:40:34,348 --> 00:40:36,308
Could you bring a pair of shoes
from under my desk?

515
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:37,435
Yes, sir.

516
00:40:49,071 --> 00:40:50,656
Keep them on even if you don't like them

517
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:55,286
unless you want
tomorrow's headlines to read,

518
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:57,830
"Improper Dress Code, Lack of Discipline,

519
00:40:57,913 --> 00:41:00,249
Undignified Cabinet Members,"
things like that.

520
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:06,255
They may be uncomfortable at first,
but you'll get used to them quickly.

521
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:08,090
I was just like you.

522
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:11,343
Once you get calluses

523
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:14,722
and break those shoes in nicely,

524
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:18,642
you'll have become a true politician.

525
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:59,350
This is exactly why people at Sejong
call you "Cinderella."

526
00:41:59,558 --> 00:42:02,603
You take your shoes off anywhere.

527
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:06,857
Seeing how you're here already,

528
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:09,777
the talk must've gone well. Right?

529
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:13,405
I'm so relieved.

530
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:16,158
You have no idea how worried I was.

531
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:19,370
I may have grown up in a Christian family,

532
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:21,247
but I prayed for the first time today.

533
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:24,416
Ms. Jeong.

534
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:26,001
Yes, sir.

535
00:42:27,419 --> 00:42:28,504
Thank you...

536
00:42:32,132 --> 00:42:34,009
for your hard work today.

537
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:03,664
Look closely. Aren't I right?

538
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:05,541
It's a global issue.

539
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:20,514
Let's have some coffee while we work.

540
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:23,350
-Thank you.
-You must be tired.

541
00:43:27,062 --> 00:43:30,024
-It's a bit difficult to breathe.
-Right?

542
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:31,734
Let's try this one.

543
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:35,904
-It has a filter.
-It does.

544
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:41,535
The filter will keep the fine dust out.

545
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:43,120
-It'll filter it out.
-Right.

546
00:44:33,045 --> 00:44:36,340
Honey, it's me.
Should I pick you and Si-wan up?

547
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:38,884
What time do you finish?

548
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:47,601
THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY
OF THE PROVISIONAL ASSEMBLY OF KOREA

549
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:50,354
I hear you're boycotting the president's
State of the Nation Address.

550
00:44:50,437 --> 00:44:51,397
Is that true?

551
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:54,358
Is this your personal opinion
or that of the Seonjin Republican Party?

552
00:44:54,441 --> 00:44:57,528
I hear the president plans to push through
with the peace treaty this year.

553
00:44:57,611 --> 00:45:00,781
Are you against the process of bringing
peace to the Korean Peninsula?

554
00:45:02,908 --> 00:45:04,952
The Seonjin Republican Party and I

555
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:07,287
are not opposing peace
in the Korean Peninsula.

556
00:45:07,579 --> 00:45:10,916
We are against President Yang's
hasty actions toward North Korea.

557
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:14,378
President Yang,
who has lost his administrative power

558
00:45:14,461 --> 00:45:17,297
after his approval rates plummeted,
shouldn't use the peace treaty

559
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:19,758
and unification as a way to
regain his political standing.

560
00:45:19,842 --> 00:45:21,343
Don't you think the cost of unification

561
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:23,512
is too high for the citizens
if that's the case?

562
00:45:24,513 --> 00:45:25,848
I'd like to advise the president

563
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:29,351
that the government administration partner
he needs right now

564
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:31,562
isn't North Korea,
which sits beyond the 38th parallel,

565
00:45:31,645 --> 00:45:32,813
but us, the opposing party.

566
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:33,772
YUN CHAN-GYEONG

567
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:34,898
-Shall we go?
-Yes, ma'am.

568
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:39,194
What is your opinion on the meeting

569
00:45:39,278 --> 00:45:41,739
of the high officials in Panmunjom today?

570
00:45:42,197 --> 00:45:43,741
This is your second boycott.

571
00:45:43,824 --> 00:45:46,326
Doesn't this hinder
resolving matters of public welfare?

572
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:50,038
-One word, please.
-Ma'am.

573
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:54,460
That's what I mean.

574
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,628
-The president is here.
-Hello, sir.

575
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:08,182
THIS ECONOMY IS THE PROBLEM

576
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:09,641
MOM, WHAT IS UNIFICATION COST?

577
00:46:09,725 --> 00:46:11,310
PEACE SHOULDN'T BE PART OF A DEAL

578
00:46:21,403 --> 00:46:22,237
Hey.

579
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:27,534
What happened to your face?
Did you get hurt?

580
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:30,120
Did you get into a fight? Let me see.

581
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:33,207
Park Si-wan.

582
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:40,798
Slide over.

583
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:43,300
It's nothing.

584
00:46:43,383 --> 00:46:45,511
It was settled without going to
the advisory board.

585
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:53,769
What's wrong?

586
00:46:55,729 --> 00:46:58,315
He's only cold towards me. It's unfair.

587
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:02,152
It's karma.

588
00:47:02,694 --> 00:47:06,824
They say how your child treats you
is all karma.

589
00:47:07,449 --> 00:47:09,576
They say it's a reflection

590
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:11,411
of how good a parent you were.

591
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:24,591
What is it? Are you upset?

592
00:47:29,721 --> 00:47:30,848
Let's go.

593
00:47:31,431 --> 00:47:33,350
Si-jin is on a field trip. She'll be late.

594
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:36,937
A field trip? Where to?

595
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:39,815
Dear honorable citizens,

596
00:47:40,732 --> 00:47:44,444
the Cold War era is now over.

597
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:49,032
Our country, North Korea,

598
00:47:49,575 --> 00:47:53,203
the US, and China

599
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:58,292
have declared the end of the war
with North Korea

600
00:47:59,084 --> 00:48:03,171
and have agreed to sign the peace treaty.

601
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:07,467
-Really?
-Did you know?

602
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:09,761
They're signing the peace treaty.

603
00:48:10,762 --> 00:48:12,931
Sir, you knew, right?

604
00:48:15,517 --> 00:48:19,271
Don't you think the opposing party will
criticize him more for this hasty policy?

605
00:48:19,354 --> 00:48:21,523
They're not opposing the policy
on North Korea.

606
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:27,654
They're opposing President Yang Jin-man.

607
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:29,323
Pardon?

608
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:39,541
The North Korean working group
is also on their way.

609
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:41,668
I can't believe this is happening.

610
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:45,547
Just to be clear, I'm on my way
to Panmunjom as the negotiator

611
00:48:46,131 --> 00:48:47,299
for South Korea, right?

612
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:51,803
Do you think my face will be included
in the history books in the future?

613
00:48:52,387 --> 00:48:55,933
War, peace, irrevocable reality,

614
00:48:56,975 --> 00:49:00,562
and a future we must protect.

615
00:49:11,156 --> 00:49:13,408
You said Si-jin
went on a field trip today, right?

616
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:17,454
Should we go pick her up?
Where did you say they went?

617
00:49:17,829 --> 00:49:19,122
The National Assembly.

618
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:22,501
Oh, yes. That's right.

619
00:49:23,043 --> 00:49:24,252
If there are still those

620
00:49:25,087 --> 00:49:29,508
who fear peace in the Korean Peninsula,

621
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,927
I would like you to remember this.

622
00:49:32,761 --> 00:49:38,141
I will fight against you until the end
and gain victory.

623
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:44,189
This division is a past that needs
to be overcome.

624
00:49:45,357 --> 00:49:47,651
We cannot create a successful future

625
00:49:48,068 --> 00:49:52,948
for the Korean Peninsula or the people
of Korea if this division persists.

626
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:58,912
We must eliminate hostility
between the North and South.

627
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:02,332
Our country needs to come together

628
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:06,420
to obtain peace between the two Koreas.

629
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:13,885
According to a mutual non-aggression
treaty, the South and the North

630
00:50:14,636 --> 00:50:16,138
declared the end of war.

631
00:50:17,222 --> 00:50:18,807
In addition to the peace treaty,

632
00:50:19,808 --> 00:50:25,439
we have also come to an agreement on
a systematic disarmament.

633
00:50:27,649 --> 00:50:30,527
Therefore, our government will...

634
00:50:41,329 --> 00:50:42,372
Did you get fired?

635
00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:45,542
Fired? Of course not.

636
00:50:58,055 --> 00:50:59,264
Are you okay, Si-wan?

637
00:51:37,302 --> 00:51:39,387
CHANGE IN INTER-KOREAN RELATIONS

638
00:51:42,224 --> 00:51:43,809
-Stop the car.
-Pardon?

639
00:51:43,892 --> 00:51:44,851
Stop the car right now!

640
00:52:00,283 --> 00:52:01,284
Darn it.

641
00:52:02,869 --> 00:52:03,829
Sir.

642
00:52:14,005 --> 00:52:15,674
Would you call the liaison office...

643
00:52:16,591 --> 00:52:18,135
-Yes?
-...in Panmunjom please?

644
00:52:19,052 --> 00:52:20,595
Ask the North Korean working group

645
00:52:22,055 --> 00:52:23,181
for their understanding.

646
00:52:26,017 --> 00:52:27,018
We'll go...

647
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:30,605
to the Blue House.

648
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:43,076
-Isn't Mr. Kim there?
-Oh, no!

649
00:52:53,962 --> 00:52:57,424
Next station is Dangsan. Dangsan Station.

650
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:10,812
Honey. Get up.

651
00:53:13,064 --> 00:53:15,192
Si-jin's teacher
isn't answering her phone.

652
00:53:16,401 --> 00:53:17,861
What about Si-jin?

653
00:53:17,944 --> 00:53:19,613
We have to go get her.

654
00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:21,448
Honey. Si-wan.

655
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:41,092
Get it together, Su-gyo!

656
00:53:43,345 --> 00:53:45,722
Only focus on what you need to do.

657
00:53:46,806 --> 00:53:47,724
Focus.

658
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:51,853
Focus on how we can overcome this.

659
00:53:51,937 --> 00:53:52,854
Nothing else.

660
00:53:55,482 --> 00:53:57,192
Do you understand me?

661
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:09,579
Is this the Security Team?

662
00:54:10,455 --> 00:54:11,581
This is Secretary Han.

663
00:54:13,541 --> 00:54:14,709
How is the president?

664
00:54:23,009 --> 00:54:24,386
We've confirmed the location.

665
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:25,804
We are on our way.

666
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:26,930
Let's go!

667
00:54:35,397 --> 00:54:37,232
EXPLOSION AT THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY

668
00:55:40,462 --> 00:55:41,755
This area is restricted.

669
00:55:42,255 --> 00:55:43,381
My daughter...

670
00:55:43,465 --> 00:55:45,300
My daughter is in there!

671
00:55:45,925 --> 00:55:47,802
-Let me go!
-Please follow police orders!

672
00:55:47,886 --> 00:55:49,387
We can't enter the area!

673
00:55:49,471 --> 00:55:51,389
They're in the same position you are!

674
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:56,311
Let me in!

675
00:55:56,394 --> 00:55:57,937
Please step away.

676
00:55:58,021 --> 00:55:59,856
-You may not enter.
-Please back up.

677
00:56:00,899 --> 00:56:02,275
Please cooperate.

678
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:26,341
Goodness.

679
00:56:29,427 --> 00:56:30,387
Si-jin...

680
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:34,224
Si-jin...

681
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:40,105
-Si-jin!
-Are you her guardian?

682
00:56:40,188 --> 00:56:41,398
Yes. What happened?

683
00:56:41,481 --> 00:56:43,316
I think she's bleeding
due to external trauma.

684
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,943
-Si-jin.
-We must take her to a hospital.

685
00:56:45,026 --> 00:56:46,069
-Si-jin!
-Hold on.

686
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:48,613
-Please calm down. Take her.
-Si-jin!

687
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:51,199
-Si-jin!
-Please calm down.

688
00:56:51,282 --> 00:56:52,617
-Si-jin.
-My gosh.

689
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:55,370
-Is she okay?
-She's okay. She'll be okay.

690
00:56:55,453 --> 00:56:57,497
Only one of you can come with us.
Who will it be?

691
00:56:57,580 --> 00:56:58,957
-I'll go.
-Okay.

692
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:01,751
Okay. Come in.

693
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:02,836
Wait there.

694
00:57:02,919 --> 00:57:05,338
-She'll be fine. Don't worry, okay?
-Okay.

695
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:27,861
Dad.

696
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:40,999
It's all right.

697
00:57:42,208 --> 00:57:43,751
She'll be fine.

698
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:45,628
She'll be fine. Don't worry.

699
00:57:45,879 --> 00:57:46,880
Don't worry.

700
00:57:48,381 --> 00:57:49,507
She'll be okay.

701
00:57:50,675 --> 00:57:52,218
Are you Minister Park Mu-jin?

702
00:57:53,428 --> 00:57:54,637
You must come with us, sir.

703
00:57:56,097 --> 00:57:59,267
We've received orders to escort you.
Escort him to the conference room.

704
00:57:59,350 --> 00:58:01,060
-Yes, sir.
-This way, sir.

705
00:58:01,227 --> 00:58:02,145
Let's go.

706
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:08,026
-Gosh, you're so pretty.
-Are you the same Na-gyeong?

707
00:58:08,610 --> 00:58:10,612
-You look so pretty.
-Totally.

708
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:13,072
-My gosh.
-It looks great on you.

709
00:58:30,381 --> 00:58:32,467
There was an explosion
at the National Assembly

710
00:58:32,550 --> 00:58:34,969
during the president's
State of the Nation Address.

711
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:37,388
The main building
of the National Assembly...

712
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:38,806
EXPLOSION AT THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY

713
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:40,558
...has collapsed.

714
00:58:45,563 --> 00:58:48,233
It's me. I can't make it today.

715
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:50,985
I won't get off work for a while.

716
00:58:51,444 --> 00:58:54,739
I'm disappointed.
I wanted to see you in the dress.

717
00:58:59,077 --> 00:59:01,120
The person you have reached
is not available.

718
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:02,705
Please leave a message...

719
00:59:10,755 --> 00:59:15,468
I'M ON MY WAY TO THE SCENE.
PLEASE CALL ME.

720
01:00:09,939 --> 01:00:11,232
-Are you done?
-Yes.

721
01:00:12,025 --> 01:00:13,234
HAN NA-GYEONG

722
01:00:13,318 --> 01:00:15,528
I'm Han Na-gyeong
from the NIS Terrorism Task Force.

723
01:00:16,070 --> 01:00:18,281
Lieutenant Lee Jeong-hyeon
from Yeongdeungpo Station.

724
01:00:18,531 --> 01:00:20,491
Please give me a list of all the calls

725
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:22,869
sent or received through
this base station in the past week.

726
01:00:24,954 --> 01:00:26,122
Yes, ma'am.

727
01:00:26,956 --> 01:00:29,542
First, I'd like to see footage
from all nearby surveillance cameras.

728
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:32,045
Get me a list of all the vehicles
that passed through the area.

729
01:00:32,128 --> 01:00:33,421
Yes, ma'am.

730
01:00:59,947 --> 01:01:02,200
Hey! Na-gyeong!

731
01:01:05,036 --> 01:01:06,704
JEONG HAN-MO,
NIS TERRORISM TASK FORCE CHIEF

732
01:01:06,788 --> 01:01:09,374
-I'm your superior--
-This is the site of a terrorist attack.

733
01:01:10,041 --> 01:01:12,960
You would’ve been killed
if I had a gun on me right now.

734
01:01:13,044 --> 01:01:16,130
Hey. What have you guys been doing?

735
01:01:17,131 --> 01:01:19,008
While we were running around
in the rain and cold

736
01:01:19,092 --> 01:01:20,551
catching national security violators,

737
01:01:20,677 --> 01:01:23,388
you guys were sitting indoors
and staying warm.

738
01:01:23,471 --> 01:01:25,431
Then shouldn't you at least
earn your keep?

739
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:28,601
-How could you create this mess?
-I’m trying to earn my keep now.

740
01:01:30,019 --> 01:01:32,105
I'd like for you
to share your list with us.

741
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:35,316
The list of dissidents, rebels, and spies.

742
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:36,984
I’d like to compare it with our data

743
01:01:37,068 --> 01:01:38,569
-and classify them as--
-And do what?

744
01:01:38,653 --> 01:01:41,739
Do you think catching the culprit
will change anything at this point?

745
01:01:42,490 --> 01:01:45,702
Attacks? It’s all about prevention.
Nothing else matters.

746
01:01:45,785 --> 01:01:47,453
You're the NIS Terrorism Task Force!

747
01:01:48,413 --> 01:01:49,664
That's what

748
01:01:50,581 --> 01:01:52,041
you guys should’ve done.

749
01:02:10,268 --> 01:02:12,019
-Hurry up!
-It's dangerous. Stay away.

750
01:02:17,608 --> 01:02:18,818
GOING TO THE SCENE. CALL ME.

751
01:02:18,901 --> 01:02:21,195
UNREAD

752
01:02:21,279 --> 01:02:22,613
JUN-O

753
01:02:25,575 --> 01:02:28,161
The person you have reached
is not available.

754
01:02:29,328 --> 01:02:30,413
-It’s me.
-This stop is...

755
01:02:30,496 --> 01:02:32,290
-I can't make it today.
-...the National Assembly.

756
01:02:32,623 --> 01:02:34,667
-I won't get off work for a while.
-National Assembly.

757
01:02:35,084 --> 01:02:36,252
I'm disappointed.

758
01:02:38,379 --> 01:02:41,549
-It's me. I can't make it today.
-This stop is the National Assembly.

759
01:02:41,632 --> 01:02:44,093
-I won't get off work for a while.
-National Assembly.

760
01:02:55,438 --> 01:02:57,482
So the person you’re looking for is...

761
01:03:00,485 --> 01:03:01,486
KIM JUN-O

762
01:03:01,569 --> 01:03:02,945
He works here.

763
01:03:06,032 --> 01:03:07,909
I’m sure he’s not a bombing suspect.

764
01:03:07,992 --> 01:03:10,745
If this is for assistance,
you would've checked with his team.

765
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:14,457
Knowing you,
the fact that you called from the scene...

766
01:03:14,957 --> 01:03:16,501
KIM JUN-O

767
01:03:16,584 --> 01:03:17,502
Who is this guy?

768
01:03:18,211 --> 01:03:19,462
Please do this for me.

769
01:03:45,029 --> 01:03:46,781
-Go to the presidential residence.
-Okay.

770
01:03:47,615 --> 01:03:49,325
We’ve been waiting for you.

771
01:03:51,869 --> 01:03:54,121
The secretary of the first lady
will take care of your son.

772
01:03:54,205 --> 01:03:55,581
-This way.
-No.

773
01:04:03,130 --> 01:04:05,049
I’ll be attending to you from now on,
Minister Park.

774
01:04:05,341 --> 01:04:06,843
-Wait.
-Please come this way.

775
01:04:12,265 --> 01:04:17,520
YEOMINGWAN 1, YEOMINGWAN 2, YEOMINGWAN 3

776
01:04:17,603 --> 01:04:20,773
Where is the president? Is he okay?

777
01:04:21,274 --> 01:04:24,026
Sir, I just got a call from Chunchugwan.

778
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:26,737
They asked when the Blue House
will make an official announcement.

779
01:04:26,821 --> 01:04:28,364
Official announcement...

780
01:04:30,366 --> 01:04:33,286
Please tell them to wait.
We need to follow the process.

781
01:04:33,369 --> 01:04:34,704
Just tell them that for now.

782
01:04:37,373 --> 01:04:40,042
Sir, how should we treat those who died
in the attack?

783
01:04:40,126 --> 01:04:42,879
-I think we need someone to guide--
-Haven't the roles been divided yet?

784
01:04:42,962 --> 01:04:44,755
Ask the Minister of Veterans Affairs!

785
01:04:45,381 --> 01:04:46,591
He was...

786
01:04:47,592 --> 01:04:50,219
He was there
in the National Assembly Building today.

787
01:04:52,805 --> 01:04:54,640
Everyone who had the authority to decide

788
01:04:55,308 --> 01:04:58,769
anything regarding the national budget
or regulations were all there.

789
01:05:04,775 --> 01:05:06,277
Tell them to treat the dead...

790
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:10,531
with the utmost respect permitted.

791
01:05:12,241 --> 01:05:14,493
I’ll report
to the chief presidential secretary.

792
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:17,914
Yes.

793
01:05:18,331 --> 01:05:20,333
-I'm sorry.
-What are you saying?

794
01:05:20,416 --> 01:05:21,792
-Could you hurry?
-Where is he?

795
01:05:24,795 --> 01:05:26,088
I'm not sure.

796
01:05:26,714 --> 01:05:28,007
Yes. We're checking.

797
01:05:28,090 --> 01:05:31,218
What on earth are you doing right now?

798
01:05:31,302 --> 01:05:32,678
-Hey, come check this out.
-Yes.

799
01:05:33,262 --> 01:05:34,305
Divide this up.

800
01:05:38,768 --> 01:05:41,187
Is the president safe?

801
01:05:42,229 --> 01:05:44,774
Has his safety not been confirmed yet?

802
01:05:44,857 --> 01:05:48,319
-What about the prime minister?
-The president was confirmed dead.

803
01:05:50,655 --> 01:05:51,906
As well as the prime minister,

804
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:54,200
the speaker of the National Assembly,

805
01:05:54,575 --> 01:05:58,037
the ministers in attendance,
and the cabinet members.

806
01:06:02,208 --> 01:06:04,460
The only survivor
in the line of succession

807
01:06:04,543 --> 01:06:05,836
to the presidency

808
01:06:07,088 --> 01:06:09,215
as dictated by the Constitution is you...

809
01:06:10,716 --> 01:06:12,259
since you weren't in attendance.

810
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:55,469
Thank you for coming.

811
01:06:56,220 --> 01:06:59,098
They are the presidential secretaries
who will be helping you

812
01:06:59,473 --> 01:07:00,558
from now on.

813
01:07:02,977 --> 01:07:03,936
Hello.

814
01:07:06,439 --> 01:07:09,191
Based on Article 26, Paragraph 1
of the Government Organization Act,

815
01:07:09,775 --> 01:07:10,818
you have been entrusted

816
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:15,656
with all the authority and duties
of the President of the Republic of Korea.

817
01:07:17,158 --> 01:07:18,034
Pardon?

818
01:07:18,117 --> 01:07:21,954
From this moment forward,
you are now the acting president.

819
01:07:22,038 --> 01:07:24,248
Your term has already begun,
President Park.

820
01:07:31,297 --> 01:07:32,506
We are working on it.

821
01:07:33,215 --> 01:07:34,508
Come help us!

822
01:07:36,302 --> 01:07:38,929
-Did you find him?
-Yes. I located his cell phone.

823
01:07:43,851 --> 01:07:44,769
Where...

824
01:07:46,479 --> 01:07:47,938
Where is he right now?

825
01:07:48,022 --> 01:07:50,399
I’ll send you the link
that shows his current location.

826
01:07:50,483 --> 01:07:51,942
SENDING

827
01:08:04,038 --> 01:08:06,791
THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY

828
01:08:24,725 --> 01:08:27,937
EXPLOSIVE ORDNANCE DISPOSAL TEAM

829
01:08:33,275 --> 01:08:35,486
It’s a bomb! I found an explosive!

830
01:08:40,533 --> 01:08:41,909
Please evacuate! It’s a bomb!

831
01:08:41,992 --> 01:08:44,787
Please back away! A bomb has been found!

832
01:08:44,954 --> 01:08:47,123
-Please evacuate!
-Evacuate the area!

833
01:08:47,248 --> 01:08:48,791
-This way.
-Please evacuate.

834
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:51,752
-Hurry up.
-Evacuate everyone here.

835
01:08:52,837 --> 01:08:56,132
We fear there might be a second explosion.
Yes, sir.

836
01:09:08,018 --> 01:09:10,729
You'll be the acting president for 60 days

837
01:09:10,813 --> 01:09:12,523
until the next presidential election.

838
01:09:12,940 --> 01:09:15,192
We'll do our best to prepare

839
01:09:15,276 --> 01:09:18,237
your statement to the nation
as quickly as possible.

840
01:09:18,821 --> 01:09:20,865
-Hey, wait. I'm--
-First,

841
01:09:22,658 --> 01:09:24,368
you need to deal with urgent matters.

842
01:09:26,912 --> 01:09:29,039
It’s a declaration of martial law.

843
01:09:29,707 --> 01:09:30,624
Please sign it.

844
01:09:32,918 --> 01:09:35,087
DECLARATION OF MARTIAL LAW

845
01:09:36,213 --> 01:09:38,799
SIGNATURE OF THE ACTING PRESIDENT

846
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:45,598
By martial law, do you mean...

847
01:09:45,681 --> 01:09:46,849
This is

848
01:09:47,933 --> 01:09:50,394
a state of national emergency
similar to a time of war.

849
01:09:51,103 --> 01:09:53,564
When we can't secure public order
with the police force alone,

850
01:09:53,647 --> 01:09:56,025
the president,
who is the commander-in-chief,

851
01:09:56,525 --> 01:09:58,319
declares martial law.

852
01:10:01,947 --> 01:10:05,951
Right now,
the commander-in-chief of this country

853
01:10:07,703 --> 01:10:08,746
is you, sir.

854
01:10:31,602 --> 01:10:33,729
DECLARATION OF MARTIAL LAW

855
01:10:36,607 --> 01:10:38,609
SIGNATURE OF THE ACTING PRESIDENT

856
01:10:40,819 --> 01:10:41,695
Now,

857
01:10:44,031 --> 01:10:45,991
you just completed
your first official matter

858
01:10:46,825 --> 01:10:48,869
as acting president, President Park.

859
01:10:50,746 --> 01:10:51,789
This way, sir.

860
01:10:52,289 --> 01:10:53,540
Okay.

861
01:10:58,462 --> 01:11:01,298
Everyone’s waiting for you to arrive.

862
01:11:04,802 --> 01:11:07,972
We have no time to talk about
what measures we should take right now!

863
01:11:08,055 --> 01:11:10,724
We’re at war right now!
Do you not know what that means?

864
01:11:10,808 --> 01:11:12,893
We shouldn’t react emotionally.

865
01:11:13,477 --> 01:11:15,271
We need to figure out what happened first.

866
01:11:15,354 --> 01:11:18,190
It’s too soon to call it a war
and make rash judgments.

867
01:11:19,984 --> 01:11:21,610
CURRENT STATUS OF YEOUIDO

868
01:11:21,694 --> 01:11:23,028
KEY FACILITIES IN NORTH KOREA

869
01:11:23,112 --> 01:11:24,738
KEY FACILITIES IN SOUTH KOREA

870
01:12:09,658 --> 01:12:11,952
He has only six months
of experience in politics,

871
01:12:12,036 --> 01:12:13,787
and all he did was
measure fine dust levels.

872
01:12:13,871 --> 01:12:17,041
-What could he possibly do?
-I'm more afraid he might do something.

873
01:12:17,541 --> 01:12:20,919
That position doesn’t require someone
who will be a hero

874
01:12:21,003 --> 01:12:22,671
and save the world by some fluke.

875
01:12:23,255 --> 01:12:26,216
Sir. We have a problem.

876
01:12:26,342 --> 01:12:28,385
Are you insisting on waging a war
on the Korean Peninsula?

877
01:12:28,677 --> 01:12:30,346
We don’t have time, President Park.

878
01:12:30,637 --> 01:12:33,140
Give your consent to announce DEFCON Two.
