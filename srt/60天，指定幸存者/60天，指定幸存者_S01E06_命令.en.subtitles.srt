1
00:00:53,678 --> 00:00:59,726
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
PLACES AND EVENTS ARE FICTIONAL

2
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:20,330
FARMERS COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT

3
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:37,472
Sir.

4
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:41,643
Cambodia rejected our technology transfer
offer for water resources development.

5
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:43,478
WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT

6
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:44,729
Sir.

7
00:01:46,105 --> 00:01:47,732
The road network expansion plan

8
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:50,318
has been rejected as well.

9
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:53,613
PUBLIC HEALTH AND MEDICAL CARE

10
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:17,262
The Cambodian government rejected
all our offers for financial support

11
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,348
as well as our diplomatic proposals, sir.

12
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:26,521
They don't seem to want to negotiate
with our government

13
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:28,815
when it's under the leadership
of an Acting President

14
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:32,735
since the situation will change
with the new administration.

15
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:36,072
So we can't do anything
while Acting President Park is in office?

16
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:39,200
We put in an extradition request, which
got turned down as it's a conflict zone.

17
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:42,078
But they say if our troops go, it's
an invasion. And all negotiations...

18
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:47,250
We don't have time, sir.

19
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:50,503
The people won't wait any longer.

20
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:55,300
-Excuse me, coming through.
-Excuse me.

21
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:00,054
Don't forget this.

22
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:10,857
People are buying up necessities
from big supermarkets.

23
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:14,569
This is the first time people are
stockpiling food and necessities

24
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:18,114
since North Korea threatened to turn Seoul
into a "sea of fire" in 1994.

25
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,158
There's more.

26
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:33,338
All international flights are sold out,
every single day.

27
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,882
Be it the US, Southeast Asia,
or wherever else,

28
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:38,259
people just want to leave this peninsula.

29
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,476
Everyone is posting
pictures of this backpack

30
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:49,771
on social media,
so I brought it to show you all.

31
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,148
What's all this?

32
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,195
People call it

33
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:00,698
the "Survival Backpack."

34
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:03,826
Whoever came up with the name
did a good job. I wonder who named it.

35
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:08,122
We're not talking about
an abstract fear of war here.

36
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:11,960
It's solid and real.
It's become a part of our daily lives.

37
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:13,920
It's worse than immediately
after the bombing.

38
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:15,255
It's the worst now.

39
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,341
This was to be expected

40
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:20,093
when the video went public.

41
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:23,137
After all, we decided to use
the people's anxiety and fear

42
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:25,848
to divert public attention
from the President's dismissal.

43
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,729
The fear-based strategy worked,

44
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:33,690
and

45
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,401
we've just been billed for the damage.

46
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:39,737
The people are demanding that
we capture Myung Hae-joon immediately.

47
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:43,783
I'm sure there are other things
that Cambodia wants,

48
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:46,995
aside from financial aid
and technical support.

49
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:48,288
It's too risky

50
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:50,790
to keep wasting our time
while looking to Cambodia.

51
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,918
If we fail to provide the people
with a proper solution

52
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:55,962
for their anxiety and fear,

53
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,967
the controversy over your qualifications

54
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:02,927
may resurface, sir.

55
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:05,680
And as you're aware,

56
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,683
we've run out of cards to play.

57
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:11,102
No.

58
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:15,857
We still have

59
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:18,985
our last card.

60
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:38,504
DAY 52: COMMAND
EPISODE 6

61
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:46,554
Don't you want to find out
how Assemblyman Oh Yeong-seok

62
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:49,849
survived?

63
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:54,896
Find Room 119 in the blueprint
of the National Assembly Building.

64
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:03,529
Could you tell me where Room 119 is?

65
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:06,199
I can't find it in this blueprint.

66
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:07,700
Room 119...

67
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,118
Room 119?

68
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:12,997
There's no Room 119 in the main building.

69
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:15,708
There's no Room 119?

70
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:18,878
On the first floor, there's the lobby,

71
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:21,798
the mechanical room, the post office,
and the press center...

72
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:25,384
There is no Room 119.

73
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:32,266
What about here in B1?

74
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:36,854
There's nothing
but this emergency passage, which connects

75
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:38,272
the library to the assembly hall.

76
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:41,984
I don't see Room 119 anywhere.

77
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:47,990
Hey, have you ever seen Room 119
in the main building?

78
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:49,450
There's no Room 119.

79
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:54,997
He was a fixture at the Secretariat
for 20 years.

80
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:57,083
If he says it doesn't exist,
it's a sure thing.

81
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,209
It doesn't exist.

82
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:03,840
Wait, could it be shown

83
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:06,425
in a different blueprint?

84
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:08,427
One from when the building was built.

85
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:11,639
Or maybe, the room was added recently?

86
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:15,059
The blueprint
from the construction stage...

87
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:18,020
It might have been
at the Secretariat, but...

88
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:19,230
The Secretariat?

89
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:22,191
But as you can see and as you know,

90
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,902
everything is now gone
because of the bombing.

91
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:27,989
The Secretariat was part
of the main building, you know.

92
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:45,548
Do you have the location?

93
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:46,841
It was a pay phone.

94
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:49,218
He called you from a pay phone.

95
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:53,848
It's a residential area.

96
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,106
Yeonnamdong-ro?

97
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,734
I see 440...

98
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:07,737
It's 446, isn't it?

99
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:10,114
That's right.

100
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:12,200
The address is 446 Yeonnamdong-ro.

101
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:14,869
How did you know?

102
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:17,580
That pay phone

103
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:19,457
is right in front of my place.

104
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,589
So he waited in front of your place

105
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,842
and called you after making sure
you were home.

106
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:35,264
If he knows your address,
he must be someone you know.

107
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:38,100
Is there anyone that comes to mind?

108
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,019
It must be one or the other.

109
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,646
It's either a trap to set me up

110
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,941
or a crucial informant.

111
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:50,238
What about Room 119? Did you find it?

112
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:52,740
No, but I will.

113
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:55,117
I'm sure he called me,

114
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,662
trusting that I will find it.

115
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:02,542
Let's keep working
after we have some lunch.

116
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:05,503
There's no point in killing ourselves.

117
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,761
There's no Room 119 on the first floor,

118
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:16,138
but during the Internet cable lines
installation last year,

119
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,391
the facility team talked about
building a space

120
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:21,477
to protect communication equipment
in case of a fire or a flood.

121
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,896
Are there any blueprints
or documents remaining?

122
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,106
Anything that can confirm it?

123
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:27,567
I don't think so.

124
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:29,610
They must've all been destroyed, right?

125
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:33,489
The Secretary General at the time

126
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,242
might still have it.

127
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,536
Who was the Secretary General at the time?

128
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:43,082
How can I help you?

129
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:45,001
Is Ms. Yun in her office?

130
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:47,169
I'm from NIS.

131
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:55,553
"When the old world has fallen,

132
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:58,306
but the new world has yet to arrive,

133
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:01,934
that's always how a revolution begins."

134
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:06,063
That's what my former boss said.

135
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:13,321
So we're living in a revolutionary era,
you and I.

136
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,781
Do you also think

137
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:18,868
that I want you to join my camp

138
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:21,370
because of all the spotlight
you've been getting?

139
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:23,873
Is that not the case?

140
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:28,085
Many rookie politicians

141
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:30,254
burst on the scene like shooting stars.

142
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:34,050
They probably outnumber
the stars in the sky.

143
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:36,844
But they vanish
without making a name for themselves.

144
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:39,430
That's why I call them "shooting stars."

145
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:46,312
You're

146
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,482
a lot like me.

147
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:54,570
You hated the Yang administration

148
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,322
because he was an amateur and an idealist.

149
00:10:57,531 --> 00:10:59,617
And you despise
the corrupt, cliquey politicians

150
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,661
in the Seonjin Republican Party.

151
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:05,206
I, the first female executive

152
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:09,710
to become a delegate
of the Seonjin Republican Party,

153
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:13,297
am asking you, an independent
and the first assemblyman from Honam

154
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,758
elected to represent a TK district,
to join me.

155
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:21,013
Outcasts like us should change the world.

156
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:24,058
We're living in a revolutionary era,
after all.

157
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:27,478
So you'll become a President
who will change the world,

158
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:29,605
and you'd like me to be your pacemaker.

159
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:31,399
Is that it?

160
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:35,444
I'll make you the party leader.

161
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:38,489
And you'll be the next
presidential candidate.

162
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:42,576
Must I wait longer for your answer?

163
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:48,874
I'm considering

164
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:52,586
offering the position of
Acting Prime Minister to Assemblyman Oh.

165
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:58,092
I'd like him to aid us
in government operations.

166
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:01,971
Sir, are you saying he's our last card?

167
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,473
-I object to--
-I object to--

168
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:07,810
-At--
-At the memorial ceremony--

169
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:13,899
He openly criticized you
at the memorial ceremony, sir.

170
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:17,153
And thanks to that,
the "miraculous survivor"

171
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:19,864
suddenly stepped into the limelight
as a promising rookie politician.

172
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:22,783
One that everyone loves and supports.

173
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,370
Do you think it was an uncalculated move?

174
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:27,329
I, too,

175
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:30,416
-made my calculations.
-Pardon me?

176
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:33,711
You said we must deal with
the people's anxiety and fear.

177
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,505
That is why I chose Assemblyman Oh.

178
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,090
Our hiring decisions

179
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:42,595
send the most powerful message
that shows our determination.

180
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:49,310
No one has spoken for the people's
anger and anxiety better than he has.

181
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:53,439
If he were to join our government,

182
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,024
then

183
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:58,986
the love and support of the people
who identified with him

184
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:00,696
will provide an impetus to our operations.

185
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:04,116
It'll help us hold out until we capture
Myung Hae-joon, at the very least.

186
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:10,331
Science majors are impressive.

187
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:13,417
He's an extremely quick learner.

188
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:16,170
He already figured out
how to change the public sentiment.

189
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:18,047
Mr. Kim, what do you think?

190
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:22,176
Oh, right. I agree with you, sir.
A hundred percent.

191
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:26,597
What? It's a great idea.

192
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:29,850
A magnanimous leader
who embraces Assemblyman Oh,

193
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:31,310
who took a shot at him.

194
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:32,686
The media will be all over it.

195
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,605
It portrays his character
with a touching story.

196
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:37,274
Sure, it may be a blockbuster.

197
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:40,528
However, I'm certain
that it won't have a happy ending.

198
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:42,863
He's embarked on his political career.

199
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:45,449
He'll try to lock horns with the President
on every issue.

200
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,993
"I'm not like Park Mu-jin.
Park Mu-jin is wrong."

201
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:50,329
He'll need to prove that to the public.

202
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:53,165
Why must we engage
in such an exhausting war of attrition?

203
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,253
As the Acting President,
President Park has much to do,

204
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:58,796
but not much time.

205
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:03,551
Please rethink your decision,
Mr. President.

206
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:05,844
That's not necessary.

207
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:10,266
Assemblyman Oh won't join us.
He won't accept the offer.

208
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,769
I hear Ms. Yun is persuading him
to join her.

209
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:18,482
The Acting Prime Minister position
will only be for two months.

210
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:21,277
He won't choose it over future power.

211
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:25,656
We're not the ones holding the sword.

212
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:26,866
Oh Yeong-seok is.

213
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:39,837
You're right, Chief An. Let's drop it.

214
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:43,090
Secretary Cha.

215
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:46,802
Please contact Assemblyman Oh
and ask him to come to the Blue House.

216
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:49,597
-Mr. President.
-The choice is his.

217
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,724
We'll let Assemblyman Oh decide.

218
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:53,726
We should hear

219
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,311
what he'd like to do.

220
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:58,147
That's it for now.

221
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:10,367
Our President is very optimistic.

222
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:13,662
He doesn't give up.

223
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:31,680
I'm surprised.

224
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:34,934
Will you object as well?

225
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:40,606
Well, I didn't quite see this coming.

226
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:43,525
I didn't know you were looking
to make a political breakthrough.

227
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:47,571
May I ask you why you've changed, sir?

228
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:53,911
Was it Secretary Cha?

229
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:56,914
The person who leaked
the Myung Hae-joon video.

230
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:01,669
It had to be done to bury the controversy
surrounding my dismissal.

231
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:05,965
It had to be done?

232
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:08,801
There will be some adverse effects.

233
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:15,224
The people will demand
that you capture Myung Hae-joon at once.

234
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:18,978
Most things at the Blue House

235
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:21,814
are done like that.

236
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:26,944
There's no correct answer,

237
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:29,530
and yet the people always demand
the right answer.

238
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:31,365
Now.

239
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,117
Right this instant.

240
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:35,494
And right before their eyes.

241
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:39,373
They want an absolutely perfect solution.

242
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:40,791
For instance...

243
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:44,044
A policy that perfectly tackles
the fine dust issue.

244
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:49,425
I'm curious

245
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:51,218
as to

246
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:55,723
what kind of advice
you gave to President Yang in the past.

247
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:03,355
I recommended you.

248
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:06,483
"A young, competent man

249
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:10,446
whose political neutrality will enable him
to focus on policy development.

250
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:14,867
A former KAIST professor
as Minister of Environment."

251
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:20,581
Hiring decisions impart a message.

252
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,959
It sends the most powerful message

253
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:26,628
that shows the Blue House's determination.

254
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:39,308
You said that we must win.

255
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:45,397
Let's say I now know that I'm standing
in the midst of a battlefield.

256
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:50,319
I won't be stubborn and insist
on fighting with my bare hands.

257
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:52,237
I'm curious to see

258
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:56,450
whether or not
Assemblyman Oh will accept your offer.

259
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,389
Thank you for coming.

260
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:24,144
I know you've been through a lot,
Assemblyman Oh.

261
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:27,564
You've been through much more,
President Park.

262
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:30,150
The attack has changed

263
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:31,944
many people's fates.

264
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:38,367
Please have a seat.

265
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:48,168
Do you think he can really be
of help to President Park?

266
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:59,930
Would you be our Acting Prime Minister?

267
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:03,684
I would like you to head

268
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:07,187
the interim cabinet of the departments
that fell vacant due to the bombing.

269
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:13,485
Has all the negotiations with Cambodia
broken down?

270
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:17,239
You don't have to answer.

271
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:21,118
I suppose it's because you need my face,

272
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:23,829
that you want to appoint me
as Prime Minister.

273
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,417
If the Blue House is cornered
enough to require

274
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,169
such an extreme move,

275
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:33,505
that probably means they failed
to have Myung Hae-joon handed over.

276
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:35,382
Am I wrong?

277
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:39,136
We...

278
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:42,681
need you, Assemblyman Oh.

279
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:47,644
I'm afraid I must decline your offer.

280
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,940
Just because I'm a survivor,

281
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:55,485
it doesn't mean I'm qualified
to manage state affairs.

282
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:59,489
Why must our country's disaster

283
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:02,451
become my political asset?

284
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,578
I don't want to make a deal

285
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:07,873
using the people's support
for a position or power.

286
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:15,422
I can't accept
the position of Prime Minister.

287
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:21,553
Can't you

288
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:24,097
make a deal?

289
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,855
Our people are panicking

290
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:33,565
with anxiety and confusion.

291
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:36,652
Social unrest

292
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:40,239
is growing into another problem,
and it will take a toll...

293
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:43,325
on our people.

294
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:47,913
"A nation

295
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:50,457
must protect its people."

296
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:54,127
Didn't you say that?

297
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:58,090
For a stable government administration,

298
00:20:58,882 --> 00:20:59,883
I want

299
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:01,677
to make a deal with you.

300
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:11,103
I was right.

301
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,898
You want to use me to make a detour

302
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:17,859
and find a way to break through
into government operations.

303
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:21,738
But why do you use this detour strategy...

304
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:25,951
only in domestic politics?

305
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:45,345
Check all the bordering countries that
have diplomatic conflicts with Cambodia.

306
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:47,806
Not Cambodia, but its bordering countries?

307
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:50,809
One of them must be open
to negotiate with us.

308
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:53,103
I'm thinking of making a detour...

309
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:56,523
internationally as well.

310
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:59,776
Are you thinking of involving
a third-party country?

311
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:02,738
Yes, that's right.

312
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:05,824
I was the Secretary General then.

313
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:07,826
I was out of the party for a while.

314
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:10,120
So,

315
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,414
how can I help you?

316
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:14,291
I need the blueprint of the main building

317
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:16,209
that was used
for the LAN cable installation.

318
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:21,006
I heard you might have it
as you were the Secretary General then.

319
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,216
Shouldn't the Secretariat
have the blueprint?

320
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,301
Due to the bombing,

321
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:27,679
the Secretariat lost all their documents.

322
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:29,473
I see.

323
00:22:30,348 --> 00:22:31,349
Since that day,

324
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:35,562
we all are living in a different world.

325
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:39,733
Why do you need the blueprint?

326
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:43,320
Did you find a clue about the bomber?

327
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:47,032
We are still working on it.

328
00:22:49,993 --> 00:22:51,828
I'll see if I can find the blueprint.

329
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:53,163
I would appreciate it, ma'am.

330
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:57,084
Instead of appreciating it...

331
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:03,715
how about making a deal?

332
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:06,134
I want to be the first

333
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:08,011
to learn about any lead

334
00:23:08,678 --> 00:23:09,930
you get on the bomber.

335
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:11,807
Would that be possible?

336
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:17,771
I don't trust the current government's
concept of security.

337
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:20,357
I believe their mawkish view

338
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,901
on unification and North Korea
caused this tragedy.

339
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:27,155
As the opposing party's leader,

340
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:31,243
I can't let the Blue House investigate
the bombing alone.

341
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:33,912
Do you understand me?

342
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:36,414
I'm sorry.

343
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:39,668
I only follow our protocol
regarding to whom I report.

344
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:49,010
Mr. Baek, could you look for a blueprint
in the office supply closet

345
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:50,971
that I used to use
when I was Secretary General?

346
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:52,139
Okay, ma'am.

347
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:06,319
The ambassadors of Cambodia and Vietnam
have arrived.

348
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:13,869
Ambassador Su Dimanche is
in the stateroom...

349
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:20,333
and Ambassador Bao Ninh is in Baekak Room,
waiting for you.

350
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:21,793
I see.

351
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:24,546
This might be our last shot.

352
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:27,591
Don't scare me.

353
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:29,342
I'm also aware

354
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:32,679
of how important this negotiation is.

355
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:39,019
Mr. President.

356
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:01,833
Thank you for coming.
I have been waiting a long time for you.

357
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:05,462
I would like to give
my deepest condolences

358
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:08,673
for the tragedy
in Republic of Korea again.

359
00:25:09,507 --> 00:25:11,051
Please have a seat.

360
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:19,809
I heard Cambodia doesn't want

361
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:24,105
to make an alliance or an agreement
with Korea's Acting President.

362
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:26,524
Then...

363
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:30,528
How about we make a deal?

364
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:33,865
A deal?

365
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:35,825
We would like to send home

366
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:39,162
the two Vietnamese arrested
by our National Intelligence Service.

367
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:44,834
They were industrial spies
that were working

368
00:25:45,543 --> 00:25:46,836
in Pyeongtaek Industrial Complex.

369
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:51,508
Industrial spies?

370
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:55,679
They're just hard-working laborers
that traveled to a faraway land

371
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:58,348
to earn foreign money for their family.

372
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:03,853
Do you not wish to send them
back to their families?

373
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:11,236
What do you want from us?

374
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:15,073
Could you send
the Cambodian intelligence agent

375
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:18,702
arrested in Hanoi back to his country?

376
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:20,453
Well...

377
00:26:21,204 --> 00:26:22,706
Intelligence agent?

378
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:27,419
He's just an innocent man who went
on a vacation to a neighboring country.

379
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:28,545
That agent confessed

380
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:32,132
that he's a relative of the director
of the Cambodian intelligence agency.

381
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:36,428
And the director is the brother
of the Prime Minister of Cambodia, Hun Yo.

382
00:26:41,224 --> 00:26:43,601
So what you want is...

383
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:48,523
I want you to approve
our military's plan of operations

384
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:50,942
so that we can capture
Myung Hae-joon alive.

385
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:58,533
Vietnam will get
their two hard-working laborers back.

386
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:04,164
Cambodia will get
their innocent tourist back.

387
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:10,462
Would you like to make the deal?

388
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:30,231
-I mean...
-So...

389
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:34,361
Did we get
the Cambodian ambassador's approval?

390
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:38,823
We didn't.
We failed to get his approval, right?

391
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:42,994
They say dreams and hopes are
the virtues humans have,

392
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:45,372
but we need to think politically.

393
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:46,831
Both convincing Oh Yeong-seok

394
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:50,168
and the multilateral diplomacy
with Cambodia are not easy.

395
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,797
Yes, he should've made
a political judgement.

396
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,382
-Right.
-Chief An.

397
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:57,384
We received

398
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:00,011
the authorization.

399
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:05,767
The Cambodian government
authorized the deployment of Troop 707.

400
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:24,285
According to local intelligence,
Myung Hae-joon is laying low

401
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:27,288
in a small hospital
on the outskirts of Senmonari.

402
00:28:27,914 --> 00:28:29,416
Here are the satellite photos.

403
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:38,466
We must be careful
to avoid civilian casualties.

404
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:42,303
Troop 707 is currently running simulations
of every possible scenario

405
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:45,724
to successfully capture
Myung Hae-joon alive.

406
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:48,810
I'd like to meet
the commanding officer of this operation.

407
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:50,186
Where would he be?

408
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:56,693
The army has
a certain command system, sir.

409
00:28:57,318 --> 00:28:59,028
If you want,

410
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:01,322
we can have the officer here immediately.

411
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:04,784
Myung Hae-joon is the prime suspect
of the National Assembly Building bombing

412
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:06,619
and the only one that can give us answers.

413
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:09,497
We must capture him alive no matter what.

414
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:15,378
I want to ask the commander
to fulfill his duty.

415
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:17,505
That's why I will go to him.

416
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:27,640
So where are they training?

417
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,071
Tomorrow at 1700 hours,

418
00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:45,033
we will be transported to Cambodia
from Seongnam Airport.

419
00:29:45,658 --> 00:29:46,868
The ETA

420
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:49,120
is past midnight, local time.

421
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,559
The members of Troop 707
being dispatched for this mission

422
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,853
include 7 in Alpha Team and 7 in Bravo

423
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:15,438
for a total of 14, sir.

424
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:42,298
-Check.
-Check!

425
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:44,050
Check.

426
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:50,348
-Do better next time.
-Yes, sir.

427
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:53,434
We will arrive at
the base camp via helicopter.

428
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:55,019
We will secure the target

429
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:57,272
before sunrise KST

430
00:30:57,397 --> 00:30:58,690
the day after tomorrow.

431
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:02,986
Is that it?

432
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:04,696
Yes, that's it.

433
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:07,740
It's simpler than I expected it to be.

434
00:31:08,324 --> 00:31:11,327
A briefing of a military operation
is something even an amateur can do.

435
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:15,832
Professionals carry it out
and complete their missions.

436
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:24,340
My men have been training daily
for operations like this.

437
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:26,467
And

438
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:28,511
we're ready, sir.

439
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:34,058
I'm jealous.

440
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:39,939
It would've been nice

441
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:43,693
if I had time to train
before being thrown in as well.

442
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:49,073
Good job today, everyone.

443
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:52,911
I hope you'll follow my lead tomorrow
just like you did today too.

444
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:54,495
This is Sergeant Lee Gang-hun.

445
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:56,998
He specializes in cover fire.

446
00:31:57,498 --> 00:32:00,543
His wife is currently in the hospital.

447
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:04,255
Their first baby is due

448
00:32:04,964 --> 00:32:06,507
on the day of the operation.

449
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,595
Next to him is Staff Sergeant Jo.

450
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:14,557
-He specializes in explosives.
-Do you miss your wife?

451
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:17,560
He's been here
instead of on his honeymoon.

452
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:20,647
No, sir.

453
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:29,697
Let me ask you one thing.

454
00:32:30,865 --> 00:32:32,659
Colonel Kim ensured me

455
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:35,161
Myung Hae-joon will be captured alive.

456
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:38,748
Major Jang, I want to hear your opinion
as the operations commander.

457
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:41,626
We will succeed.

458
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:45,296
What are your chances?

459
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:49,634
We do not know
what Myung Hae-joon has planned.

460
00:32:50,426 --> 00:32:52,303
If he has bought off the locals,

461
00:32:53,262 --> 00:32:55,014
we might encounter
a large number of hostiles.

462
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:58,977
Furthermore, the North Korean Army
might be a variable as well.

463
00:33:02,438 --> 00:33:04,774
So what are your chances?

464
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:09,487
It's 50-50.

465
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:11,614
I give it 50 percent.

466
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:18,371
Good job.

467
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,540
-Thank you, sir.
-Thank you.

468
00:33:20,623 --> 00:33:22,166
To an operations commander,

469
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:24,502
a mission is filled with variables.

470
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:27,797
You only get one chance out on the field.

471
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:32,468
All the training is pointless.

472
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:44,522
This is Sergeant Lee Gang-hun.

473
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:46,649
Sergeant First Class Lee Gang-hun, sir.

474
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:49,235
I hope your child takes after you.

475
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:51,446
Strong and brave.

476
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:52,363
Mr. President,

477
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:55,491
he's having a girl.

478
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:05,334
Staff Sergeant Jo Seong-ju.

479
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:07,670
Staff Sergeant Jo Seong-ju, sir!

480
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:10,798
Once you get back,
go on your honeymoon first.

481
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:12,508
Yes, sir!

482
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:22,477
We will meet again.

483
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:24,645
Safe and sound.

484
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:27,440
Attention!

485
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:29,525
Salute.

486
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:30,985
-Unite!
-Unite!

487
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:51,047
I came here to ask you to make sure
you capture Myung Hae-joon alive.

488
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:54,926
We will do our best.

489
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:57,178
However,

490
00:34:58,221 --> 00:35:00,223
if things get too dangerous
out on the field,

491
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:02,767
you must...

492
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,733
shoot Myung Hae-joon to kill.

493
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:14,445
-Sorry?
-The safety of our men is more important.

494
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:17,573
Please do your best

495
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:19,784
to bring

496
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:22,453
all of them back home.

497
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:25,248
This is an order.

498
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,059
We received a tip

499
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:48,729
regarding a military drill
performed at Seongnam Airport.

500
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:51,440
Has it anything to do
with the capture of Myung Hae-joon?

501
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:53,359
Here!

502
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:59,532
The Blue House security team vehicle
was spotted near Seongnam Airport.

503
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:02,368
Was the President there
to encourage Troop 707?

504
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:04,912
Is a military operation imminent?

505
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:09,709
Even as we speak,

506
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:12,044
our military is on high alert
and is training day and night

507
00:36:12,628 --> 00:36:15,882
to ensure the safety of our nation
and its people.

508
00:36:16,632 --> 00:36:18,134
The transport aircraft take-off

509
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:20,386
is just one of those everyday drills.

510
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,555
The President visiting the troop

511
00:36:22,638 --> 00:36:26,267
was an everyday duty
of the Commander-in-Chief.

512
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:33,024
Has Myung Hae-joon been located?

513
00:36:35,651 --> 00:36:37,195
The people have the right to know.

514
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:39,113
Why is the Blue House hiding the truth?

515
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:53,169
Since the attack,
fear and anxiety have become

516
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:56,005
a part of our daily lives.

517
00:36:57,882 --> 00:37:01,302
So that the people
can safely enjoy their nights again,

518
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:03,930
the Blue House and the government

519
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:06,432
are doing our best.

520
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:08,559
That's all

521
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:10,686
I can say for now.

522
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:16,192
That was the Blue House briefing
of March 12.

523
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:19,320
I hope for the reporters to also enjoy

524
00:37:19,695 --> 00:37:24,242
a very normal, peaceful
and warm evening as well.

525
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:26,244
Thank you.

526
00:37:56,857 --> 00:37:58,859
MAJOR JANG JUN-HA

527
00:37:59,151 --> 00:38:01,153
SERGEANT FIRST CLASS LEE GANG-HUN

528
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:06,367
STAFF SERGEANT JO SEONG-JU

529
00:38:11,205 --> 00:38:13,708
Are you still up worrying?

530
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:16,919
It's already 2 a.m.

531
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,051
Do you know what I did today?

532
00:38:33,936 --> 00:38:35,396
On my way to the drill center,

533
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:38,232
I thought of only one thing.

534
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:42,111
Capturing Myung Hae-joon alive.

535
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:48,284
No matter what it took,
at whatever costs, I needed it done.

536
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:52,872
But?

537
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:56,917
I was reminded at the center

538
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:00,463
that the soldiers have families too.

539
00:39:03,382 --> 00:39:07,261
They have families
that are hoping for their safe return

540
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:08,763
just like me.

541
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:12,266
Can you believe

542
00:39:13,225 --> 00:39:14,435
that I can give such an order?

543
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:20,066
So?

544
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:22,026
Are you afraid

545
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:24,737
of becoming a bad person?

546
00:39:31,118 --> 00:39:33,329
What you did today

547
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:37,249
wasn't a good or a bad act.

548
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:40,169
You only made a decision

549
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:42,588
that was needed at the time.

550
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:55,768
Don't worry.

551
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:57,228
You

552
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:00,189
haven't changed a bit.

553
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:04,485
You're still up at this hour

554
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:08,072
feeling bad for the troop.

555
00:40:15,996 --> 00:40:18,707
SEONJIN REPUBLICAN PARTY

556
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:23,337
I'm glad that we still have
the blueprints.

557
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:26,215
I'm even
gladder because they're in our hands.

558
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:27,758
The Secretariat employee said

559
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:31,429
that the NIS agent
is looking for Room 119.

560
00:40:31,887 --> 00:40:33,180
Room 119?

561
00:40:35,224 --> 00:40:37,309
I don't see it on the first floor.

562
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:38,769
Here...

563
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:41,230
Hold on.

564
00:40:41,897 --> 00:40:43,524
When the building was renovated,

565
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:46,068
a new space was created.

566
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:48,946
And that's Room 119?

567
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:52,575
What is it doing in the basement?

568
00:40:57,079 --> 00:40:59,748
It might not be Room 119.

569
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:04,378
What if it's not Room 119,

570
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:06,881
but just 119.

571
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:09,467
If that's the case,

572
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:11,844
perhaps

573
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:15,347
it's a bomb shelter.

574
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:16,849
A bomb shelter?

575
00:41:20,227 --> 00:41:23,230
FLOOR PLAN OF
THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY BUILDING B1

576
00:41:24,773 --> 00:41:28,235
Will we now be able
to arrest the bomber then?

577
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:32,740
Yes, and it's all thanks to you
suggesting a detour.

578
00:41:35,117 --> 00:41:38,078
There's something I'd like to ask though.

579
00:41:42,124 --> 00:41:44,460
When I asked you
to join the administration,

580
00:41:45,377 --> 00:41:46,837
you turned me down.

581
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:51,175
So why did you help me with this?

582
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:53,260
Not wanting to make a deal with power

583
00:41:54,094 --> 00:41:55,221
and helping you

584
00:41:57,473 --> 00:41:59,225
are all because of one reason.

585
00:42:01,477 --> 00:42:04,230
I vowed to serve this country,

586
00:42:05,147 --> 00:42:08,359
and that hasn't changed once
since my 20th birthday.

587
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:14,615
Can you be at the Blue House tonight?

588
00:42:22,164 --> 00:42:24,416
That must've been someone high up.

589
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:29,922
Hearing you talk on the phone

590
00:42:30,005 --> 00:42:31,882
made me wonder who that was.

591
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:38,514
Someone who isn't

592
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:41,475
Blue House material.

593
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:50,651
I hope this helps catch the bomber.

594
00:42:51,443 --> 00:42:54,405
It's what you asked for.
We still had the blueprints.

595
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:57,116
Thank you, ma'am.

596
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:06,750
Room 119.

597
00:43:08,168 --> 00:43:10,879
It's a clue
that'll lead you to the bomber,

598
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:12,631
isn't it?

599
00:43:16,135 --> 00:43:17,803
All I have are suspicions at the moment.

600
00:43:17,886 --> 00:43:19,847
Once it becomes certain,

601
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:22,975
add me to the list of people
you must report it to.

602
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:24,685
National security

603
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:28,063
doesn't just lie with
the National Intelligence Service.

604
00:43:41,535 --> 00:43:42,536
Na-gyeong?

605
00:43:46,248 --> 00:43:47,499
My goodness.

606
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:50,628
It's been a while, Agent Han.

607
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:52,921
Seriously?

608
00:43:53,547 --> 00:43:54,923
Is this a joke?

609
00:43:55,257 --> 00:43:57,259
You stormed off
as if you were done with this place.

610
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:08,937
We received word from Cambodia.

611
00:44:10,105 --> 00:44:12,107
It seems Troop 707,
which just landed on the ground,

612
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:14,318
is in trouble.

613
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:16,278
What?

614
00:44:17,112 --> 00:44:19,323
While heading
to the outskirts of Senmonari,

615
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:22,660
the helicopter crashed.

616
00:44:30,959 --> 00:44:32,127
What happened?

617
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:34,588
The troop was trying to land

618
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:38,801
but bad weather limited its vision
which caused a crash-landing.

619
00:44:41,428 --> 00:44:44,807
-Are there any casualties?
-Sergeant Lee Gang-hun was injured.

620
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:46,725
Sergeant Lee?

621
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:51,980
How is he? How are the other men?

622
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:53,732
We are trying to contact them now.

623
00:44:54,817 --> 00:44:58,404
Major Jang, this is Colonel Kim.
Update me on the troop's status.

624
00:45:05,327 --> 00:45:06,703
Everybody is well, sir.

625
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:09,456
Sergeant Lee's injuries are minor.

626
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:12,459
Is he still able to participate
in the operation?

627
00:45:15,921 --> 00:45:17,005
Sit down.

628
00:45:19,299 --> 00:45:21,468
That's a negative. However,

629
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:25,889
we have men to replace him,
so we don't need to revise the operation.

630
00:45:26,932 --> 00:45:29,601
I will do my best to keep all my men safe.

631
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:34,440
The operation is still a go.

632
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:44,992
Major Jang,

633
00:45:45,492 --> 00:45:46,743
the operation

634
00:45:48,036 --> 00:45:49,121
will go forward as planned.

635
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:53,167
Move out!

636
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:25,032
What now?

637
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:28,994
What's with all the security?

638
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:30,662
You're making me nervous.

639
00:46:31,246 --> 00:46:32,873
It's about Assemblyman Oh Yeong-seok.

640
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:34,875
Hey.

641
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:36,877
You just got back

642
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:40,005
and you're barking up
the Oh Yeong-seok tree again.

643
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:44,426
You told me to bring
more substantial evidence.

644
00:46:46,887 --> 00:46:49,723
Assemblyman Oh was involved
in the bombing.

645
00:46:49,848 --> 00:46:50,682
I'm sure of it.

646
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:23,173
He played a crucial role
in getting Cambodia's approval.

647
00:47:23,799 --> 00:47:26,093
I wanted him to be here
so I asked him to come.

648
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:28,595
This way.

649
00:47:40,315 --> 00:47:41,316
There.

650
00:47:57,374 --> 00:47:58,750
Alpha Team, prepare the explosives.

651
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:06,174
We have guards and snipers in place.

652
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:08,635
Alpha Team is near the generator

653
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:11,346
and Bravo Team is waiting
at the back door.

654
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:30,407
Going in!

655
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:39,166
REMOTE RECEIVER

656
00:48:43,795 --> 00:48:45,589
Bravo Team, get ready for the blow.

657
00:48:54,931 --> 00:48:58,185
Once Alpha Team blows the door,
Bravo Team goes in first.

658
00:48:58,560 --> 00:48:59,770
Three seconds to explosion.

659
00:49:00,103 --> 00:49:02,939
Three, two, one.

660
00:49:03,565 --> 00:49:04,816
-Go.
-Go.

661
00:49:17,204 --> 00:49:18,997
The troops are going in.

662
00:49:39,101 --> 00:49:40,811
Go on.

663
00:50:11,258 --> 00:50:12,509
Bravo, report back.

664
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:15,011
We shot two of the hostiles.

665
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:17,222
We have the first floor
and basement covered.

666
00:50:24,771 --> 00:50:26,481
They have the place covered.

667
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:07,272
Civilian going out. Keep them safe.

668
00:51:17,824 --> 00:51:19,701
They're going up to the second floor.

669
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:40,991
He was just here.

670
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:48,540
Myung Hae-joon has disappeared.

671
00:52:50,166 --> 00:52:52,252
Myung Hae-joon has disappeared.

672
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,256
What the...

673
00:53:03,388 --> 00:53:05,849
Disappeared? Are you sure?

674
00:53:06,641 --> 00:53:08,894
This is the blueprint
used for the cable installation.

675
00:53:08,977 --> 00:53:12,063
Everyone who worked on this project
at the National Assembly building--

676
00:53:12,147 --> 00:53:13,565
They've disappeared?

677
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:16,943
They're dead.

678
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:17,986
They're...

679
00:53:21,656 --> 00:53:23,617
No, wait. Everyone dies.

680
00:53:24,117 --> 00:53:25,911
It could be a coincidence.

681
00:53:25,994 --> 00:53:27,996
You know the construction
for the cable installation

682
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:31,750
was to set up the detonating fuse
used in the bombing.

683
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:34,753
The person in charge of the project
died trying to cover up the tracks

684
00:53:34,836 --> 00:53:37,589
right before my very eyes.

685
00:53:40,759 --> 00:53:43,887
One died of a heart attack,
one in a fire, and one committed suicide.

686
00:53:45,096 --> 00:53:48,224
All eight people that were part
of the project were killed

687
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:50,685
in order to eliminate all proof.

688
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:54,272
What proof?
What kind of construction was it?

689
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:57,025
Ji-won.

690
00:53:57,108 --> 00:54:00,070
I was going to leave if you ignored me
for another 30 seconds.

691
00:54:01,446 --> 00:54:02,572
All right.

692
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:04,658
Watch closely.

693
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:08,662
This is the blueprint of the construction
Na-gyeong brought.

694
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:11,665
This is room 119 the informant
told us about

695
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:13,792
in a 3D design program.

696
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:19,214
These are steel beams.

697
00:54:19,297 --> 00:54:22,258
The surface is made of elastomer
that is highly durable.

698
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:25,887
Wait a minute. What is elas...

699
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:27,222
Elastomer.

700
00:54:28,848 --> 00:54:29,975
Just memorize it.

701
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:32,519
It doesn't collapse
even when there is an impact.

702
00:54:32,602 --> 00:54:35,063
In other words, it's an air raid shelter.

703
00:54:35,146 --> 00:54:39,234
-Room 119 was an air raid shelter.
-There was an air raid shelter

704
00:54:39,859 --> 00:54:41,945
in the National Assembly Building?

705
00:54:43,029 --> 00:54:44,155
But why?

706
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:46,199
Ji-won, show him the location

707
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:49,411
of room 119...
I mean, the air raid shelter.

708
00:54:50,996 --> 00:54:53,039
The location of the air raid shelter...

709
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:06,803
It's where Assemblyman Oh
was rescued, isn't it?

710
00:55:13,226 --> 00:55:15,812
Assemblyman Oh's survival
wasn't a miracle.

711
00:55:18,189 --> 00:55:19,315
It was a conspiracy.

712
00:55:20,233 --> 00:55:22,110
It was planned meticulously
from the beginning.

713
00:55:29,951 --> 00:55:33,496
I see the troop
moving to the end of the third floor.

714
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:26,257
Get out of my way.

715
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:30,095
It's Myung Hae-joon.

716
00:56:32,263 --> 00:56:33,848
Yes, it's Myung Hae-joon.

717
00:56:46,736 --> 00:56:47,737
Get out of my way!

718
00:56:54,619 --> 00:56:55,703
It's a detonator.

719
00:57:01,167 --> 00:57:02,252
Lower your guns.

720
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:06,673
Lower your guns!

721
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:08,383
I'll kill all of you!

722
00:57:17,559 --> 00:57:18,643
Come on out.

723
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:23,648
Come out!

724
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:42,101
Staff Sergeant.

725
00:58:42,435 --> 00:58:44,771
-What are you doing?
-He can't detonate the bomb.

726
00:58:45,688 --> 00:58:48,399
At this distance, we will all die.

727
00:59:27,272 --> 00:59:29,983
The hostile is within my range of fire.

728
00:59:36,698 --> 00:59:37,699
Staff Sergeant.

729
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:40,994
-Seong-ju.
-The bomb was made in a hurry.

730
00:59:41,077 --> 00:59:42,036
I just need 10 seconds.

731
00:59:49,043 --> 00:59:50,920
Should I shoot or wait?

732
01:00:28,207 --> 01:00:29,626
What happened?

733
01:00:29,709 --> 01:00:32,128
Alpha Team, answer me!
This is the situation room.

734
01:00:32,211 --> 01:00:33,588
What's going on?

735
01:00:33,671 --> 01:00:34,589
We've lost contact.

736
01:00:36,132 --> 01:00:37,884
We've lost contact

737
01:00:38,009 --> 01:00:40,136
with not only Major Jang,
but the entire unit.

738
01:00:41,137 --> 01:00:42,096
Darn it.

739
01:00:50,855 --> 01:00:51,939
The military

740
01:00:52,899 --> 01:00:54,942
must have much experience
with operations like this.

741
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:56,653
General Eun,

742
01:00:58,488 --> 01:01:00,740
do you ever get used to it?

743
01:01:05,036 --> 01:01:06,704
No, you don't get used to it.

744
01:01:07,664 --> 01:01:09,040
And you shouldn't get used to it.

745
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:12,335
Nothing is more dangerous

746
01:01:13,169 --> 01:01:14,921
than a fearless soldier.

747
01:01:32,814 --> 01:01:34,315
It may not have been a gunshot.

748
01:01:35,983 --> 01:01:38,361
It could have been a flare
to confuse the enemy.

749
01:01:42,365 --> 01:01:43,866
Try not to worry.

750
01:01:52,333 --> 01:01:53,418
Mr. President.

751
01:01:59,507 --> 01:02:00,383
Myung Hae-joon...

752
01:02:02,301 --> 01:02:03,594
has been captured alive.

753
01:02:07,098 --> 01:02:08,433
Have we succeeded?

754
01:02:10,893 --> 01:02:12,186
He's alive.

755
01:02:14,397 --> 01:02:16,441
Good job.

756
01:02:20,528 --> 01:02:21,696
Good job.

757
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:24,615
Good job.

758
01:02:26,868 --> 01:02:28,911
Good job.

759
01:02:30,455 --> 01:02:32,331
-Good job.
-Good job.

760
01:02:35,376 --> 01:02:36,586
Thank you.

761
01:02:39,338 --> 01:02:40,590
Good job.

762
01:02:41,841 --> 01:02:42,759
Mr. President.

763
01:02:43,718 --> 01:02:45,136
There has been a casualty.

764
01:02:49,432 --> 01:02:50,725
Major Jang...

765
01:02:52,351 --> 01:02:53,770
has died...

766
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:56,898
during the operation.

767
01:03:59,001 --> 01:04:00,002
Attention.

768
01:04:03,714 --> 01:04:04,757
Attention.

769
01:04:25,778 --> 01:04:28,322
Thanks to you, Troop 707

770
01:04:28,906 --> 01:04:31,075
was able to complete the mission.

771
01:04:31,659 --> 01:04:32,660
Thank you.

772
01:04:37,748 --> 01:04:38,666
Thank you.

773
01:05:09,614 --> 01:05:11,449
Hello, Mr. President.

774
01:05:18,789 --> 01:05:20,249
You did a great job,

775
01:05:20,875 --> 01:05:21,709
Staff Sergeant Jo.

776
01:05:24,128 --> 01:05:25,796
I just did my job.

777
01:05:29,550 --> 01:05:30,635
Major Jang...

778
01:05:32,803 --> 01:05:35,806
was supposed to lead the operation
from the base camp.

779
01:05:38,643 --> 01:05:42,063
When Sergeant Lee got injured
in the helicopter accident,

780
01:05:43,773 --> 01:05:45,942
he joined the operation
in Sergeant Lee's place

781
01:05:46,067 --> 01:05:48,736
to capture Myung Hae-joon alive
without changing the operation.

782
01:06:01,248 --> 01:06:03,042
The rest of our unit is safe.

783
01:06:04,085 --> 01:06:07,171
I believe Sergeant Lee will be able
to hold his baby soon.

784
01:06:18,933 --> 01:06:21,018
I was able to follow your order

785
01:06:21,102 --> 01:06:22,561
to return safely, sir.

786
01:06:25,815 --> 01:06:26,816
Thanks to...

787
01:06:28,442 --> 01:06:29,819
Major Jang.

788
01:06:50,131 --> 01:06:51,966
Please do your best

789
01:06:53,092 --> 01:06:54,051
to bring

790
01:06:55,511 --> 01:06:56,721
all of them back home.

791
01:07:10,526 --> 01:07:14,321
I will do my best to keep all my men safe.

792
01:07:54,445 --> 01:07:55,321
Why me?

793
01:07:56,697 --> 01:07:58,324
Why did you recommend me to the President?

794
01:07:59,617 --> 01:08:02,328
Why did you bring me here when I had plans
to go back to school?

795
01:08:02,953 --> 01:08:05,623
Did something happen?

796
01:08:05,706 --> 01:08:08,292
Didn't you say I just needed to fulfill
my duties as a citizen?

797
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:11,045
Then why...

798
01:08:13,255 --> 01:08:17,843
Why am I put in a position where
I take people's lives?

799
01:08:18,469 --> 01:08:21,472
Why? Why do I have to do this
because of you?

800
01:08:48,290 --> 01:08:50,167
Salute.

801
01:09:01,929 --> 01:09:02,805
He died because of me.

802
01:09:04,723 --> 01:09:06,433
I sent him to his death.

803
01:09:08,519 --> 01:09:10,604
I ordered him
to capture Myung Hae-joon alive.

804
01:09:11,522 --> 01:09:13,816
I also told him to make sure
his men returned home safely.

805
01:09:15,943 --> 01:09:17,444
I killed him.

806
01:09:18,696 --> 01:09:19,822
He died because of my orders.

807
01:09:20,698 --> 01:09:22,032
It's not your fault.

808
01:09:24,201 --> 01:09:26,787
He simply did all he could
to fulfill his duties.

809
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:27,955
He didn't run away.

810
01:09:28,873 --> 01:09:30,291
He handled it.

811
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:32,126
Just like you,

812
01:09:32,751 --> 01:09:34,628
who didn't return to school that day.

813
01:09:37,173 --> 01:09:38,674
And this is the same.

814
01:09:40,467 --> 01:09:41,760
President Park.

815
01:09:43,596 --> 01:09:45,890
Whether it's sorrow, guilt, or anger,

816
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:50,060
today is one of those days
when you must fulfill your duties

817
01:09:50,144 --> 01:09:53,814
without running away or making excuses.

818
01:09:56,025 --> 01:09:58,027
That is what

819
01:09:59,069 --> 01:10:00,196
all the survivors

820
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:02,573
must do.

821
01:10:08,829 --> 01:10:10,122
What about you?

822
01:10:14,877 --> 01:10:16,337
Why are you an exception?

823
01:10:19,924 --> 01:10:21,175
On that day,

824
01:10:22,801 --> 01:10:24,345
I told you that I wasn't qualified.

825
01:10:25,554 --> 01:10:28,057
I told you that neither power
nor politics suited me.

826
01:10:28,724 --> 01:10:31,018
And yet, you brought me this far.

827
01:10:34,438 --> 01:10:35,648
So take responsibility.

828
01:10:38,442 --> 01:10:40,152
Help me so that I can handle
this position.

829
01:10:43,489 --> 01:10:44,448
Please.

830
01:10:47,660 --> 01:10:49,036
Will you return...

831
01:10:51,247 --> 01:10:52,581
to the Blue House?

832
01:11:27,366 --> 01:11:29,660
The bomber made an air raid shelter

833
01:11:29,743 --> 01:11:31,578
in the National Assembly Building

834
01:11:32,371 --> 01:11:36,041
so that the survivor of the bombing,
Assemblyman Oh, would live.

835
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:39,878
Someone more frightening than North Korea
may have been behind the bombing.

836
01:11:39,962 --> 01:11:42,464
Please withdraw your proposal
for a nonparty cabinet.

837
01:11:42,548 --> 01:11:45,926
Do you still believe that an election
can change the world?

838
01:11:46,010 --> 01:11:48,345
I am the head
of this nation's administration, ma'am.

839
01:11:49,430 --> 01:11:51,515
Withdraw your proposal
for a nonparty cabinet,

840
01:11:51,598 --> 01:11:53,684
or I plan to have you impeached.

841
01:11:54,810 --> 01:11:56,812
