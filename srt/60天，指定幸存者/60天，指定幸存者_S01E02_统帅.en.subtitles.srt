1
00:00:53,678 --> 00:00:57,474
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
PLACES AND EVENTS ARE FICTIONAL.

2
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:25,376
It’s a bomb! I found an explosive!

3
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:31,758
Please evacuate! It’s a bomb!

4
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:34,761
Please back away! A bomb has been found!

5
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:37,138
-Please evacuate!
-Evacuate the area!

6
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:38,890
-This way.
-Please evacuate.

7
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:41,351
-Please evacuate!
-Evacuate the area!

8
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:45,814
We fear there might be a second explosion.
Yes, sir.

9
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:53,822
Based on Article 26, Paragraph 1
of the Government Organization Act,

10
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:55,573
you have been entrusted

11
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,661
with all the authority and duties of
the President of the Republic of Korea.

12
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:01,871
Pardon?

13
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:05,542
From this moment forward,
you are now the acting president.

14
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:08,086
Your term has already begun,
President Park.

15
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:28,481
It's a claymore.

16
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:48,418
What? It looks like a standard claymore
on the outside,

17
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,628
but it's not a simple claymore.

18
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:55,133
It's a type of explosive often spotted
in terrorist attacks in Algeria and Syria.

19
00:02:57,385 --> 00:02:59,596
Everyone’s waiting for you.

20
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:06,686
We have no time to talk about
what measures we should take right now!

21
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:10,106
We’re at war right now!
Do you not know what that means?

22
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:20,575
CURRENT STATUS OF YEOUIDO

23
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:22,577
SITE OF INCIDENT

24
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:43,014
We shouldn’t react emotionally.

25
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:45,058
We need to figure out what happened first.

26
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:47,727
It’s too soon to call it a war
and make rash judgments.

27
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,646
And who will make that decision?

28
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,522
Our commander-in-chief isn't here.

29
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:55,151
I will now deactivate the explosive.

30
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:27,600
This is the NSC,
the National Security Council.

31
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,979
The final decisions on matters
of national security,

32
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:32,981
unification, and diplomacy are made here.

33
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:34,983
You, sir, the acting president,

34
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:36,859
are the current chief of the NSC.

35
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:40,780
If a war breaks out on the Korean
Peninsula now, it'll be World War III!

36
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:43,574
Even if it means World War IV,
we must do what we must do!

37
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:45,743
-That's irresponsible!
-Should we sit back and watch?

38
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:48,371
-You can't be so emotional--
-The acting president is here!

39
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:50,039
We must think about our people!

40
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,417
Being bullheaded isn't a solution.

41
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,585
Whom are you calling bullheaded?

42
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:00,925
Sir.

43
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:04,053
This is Acting President Park Mu-jin.

44
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:47,597
DAY 60: COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF
EPISODE 2

45
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:09,619
The bomb has been deactivated.

46
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:25,301
We believe the bombers used
an explosive demolition technique

47
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:28,179
to blow up the National Assembly Building.

48
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:30,098
-"Explosive demolition"?
-That's correct.

49
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:34,519
You place the explosives
on the pillars or the walls in advance.

50
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:39,816
Using the weight of the building itself,

51
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:44,779
the explosives are detonated.

52
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:50,159
In 5 to 15 seconds, these explosives
can destroy large buildings.

53
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:54,205
Most importantly, a relatively
small amount of explosives is sufficient.

54
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:57,208
-It could've been difficult to spot--
-Next.

55
00:06:57,792 --> 00:07:00,503
Therefore, the amount of explosives
used was--

56
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:02,422
Enough with that. Next.

57
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:03,840
Sir?

58
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:06,050
Tell me the most crucial
piece of information.

59
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:08,719
Don't you know what I want to know?

60
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,639
So? Was it North Korea or not?

61
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:13,891
We're not sure about that yet, sir.

62
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:18,312
If it was, the military will take over.
If it wasn't, it'll go to the police.

63
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:20,857
Shouldn't this be your number one focus?

64
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:25,111
Wow, our deputy commissioner general
is very straightforward.

65
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,946
You're no-nonsense.

66
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:31,576
The president, prime minister,
ministers, and assemblymen,

67
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:33,786
over 100 high-ranking
government officials,

68
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,080
lost their lives at the same time
in an attack.

69
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:38,916
Is this the right time to discuss
jurisdictions?

70
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:40,751
You're right.

71
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:43,963
Over 100 high-ranking
government officials were massacred.

72
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:47,341
And in the center of Seoul,
the nation's capital.

73
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:51,804
The people will probably question
who did this.

74
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:55,516
And they'll wonder
who will take responsibility for this.

75
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:58,352
Do you know why? Because they're anxious.

76
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:03,983
The commissioner general needs something
to say to the people to save face.

77
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:09,322
You. Did you say
that you're from the Terrorism Task Force?

78
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:11,699
What's your take on this?

79
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:14,994
Who did it?

80
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:19,415
Who planted these explosives
in the National Assembly Building?

81
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,798
They're explosives used
in prior terrorist attacks.

82
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:31,552
They're the same explosives North Korea
has been exporting to its allies.

83
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,098
It's them.

84
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:40,853
Are they seriously trying to start a war?

85
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:44,524
They want to start a war!

86
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:47,360
This isn't a terrorist attack!
This is a declaration of war!

87
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:48,653
This is a preemptive attack!

88
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:50,196
"A declaration of war"?

89
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:53,157
Look. No movements have been spotted
in their camps.

90
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:55,785
All their missile launchers are in place.

91
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,954
Does it seem like
they're preparing for a war?

92
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,874
North Korea has made an announcement.

93
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:05,711
Here.

94
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:08,464
A disaster has occurred in South Korea

95
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,883
with the destruction
of its National Assembly Building.

96
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,010
The US and the hostile forces

97
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:16,931
are planning something wicked by

98
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:19,392
pointing their fingers at North Korea.

99
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:21,269
Such a scheme...

100
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:24,605
They're strongly asserting
that they have nothing to do with this.

101
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:27,608
This is the first time
they responded immediately

102
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:29,860
to the public sentiment in South Korea.

103
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:32,405
They were about to establish
diplomatic relations with us.

104
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:36,242
They're determined to be acknowledged
as a "normal" country.

105
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:37,618
Didn't you hear them?

106
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:39,704
They were preparing for the peace treaty.

107
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:42,748
Think about this logically.

108
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,917
"Logically"? My logic tells me

109
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:47,211
that a mad dog should be beaten

110
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:49,714
and that provocation should be punished.

111
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:50,965
"'Normal' country," you say?

112
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:54,176
North Korea is finally showing
their true colors.

113
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:56,095
Since the US isn't listening to them,

114
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:57,763
they used us as a sacrificial lamb!

115
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:00,016
They're saying, "Look!
We can do anything!"

116
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:02,893
We need to make a decision!

117
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:04,729
We should attack
the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun

118
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:06,397
or cross the demarcation line!

119
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,983
Better yet, we must destroy
their nuclear facilities.

120
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:12,820
That way, they won't be able
to start a war with us

121
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:14,405
since we're stronger than they are!

122
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:16,449
Is it even possible
to make such a decision?

123
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:19,619
Whether it be attacking the Kumsusan
Palace or crossing the demarcation line,

124
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:21,912
we do not have wartime control.

125
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:25,708
Our country is protected

126
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,920
by its alliance with the US.

127
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:34,592
It's a pride of our military.

128
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:38,095
If we don't show our determination
and will to fight immediately

129
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:42,183
and the power of our military,
which is stronger than North Korea's,

130
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:45,770
we may be subjected to
an even bigger attack.

131
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:49,023
During the September 11 attacks,

132
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:52,109
the terrorists' second target
was the Pentagon.

133
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,111
Did you all forget that?

134
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:59,617
Request the ROK-US Combined Forces
Command to declare DEFCON 3.

135
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:05,247
Furthermore, our military should prepare
for combat.

136
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:09,669
Are you insisting on waging a war
on the Korean Peninsula?

137
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,337
It's very reckless to conclude

138
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,839
North Korea was responsible
based on one bomb that was found!

139
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:15,299
Then who was it?

140
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:17,927
We are a divided country.

141
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,179
Our main adversary is situated
right above us.

142
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:21,722
If it wasn't them, then who was it?

143
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:24,767
Will you only believe it

144
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:27,269
if it reads "Made in North Korea"
on the explosives?

145
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:30,064
North Korea? Does that even make sense?

146
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:34,026
Hold on. How could you
defend them in this situation?

147
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,112
Something must be wrong with the NSC!

148
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:37,863
What did you say? Are you done?

149
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:40,533
-Then how am I to understand...
-Come on.

150
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:42,326
-...your reaction?
-How could you say that?

151
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,869
Did I say something wrong?

152
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,996
Then should we just sit still and take it?

153
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,416
-Think about our people!
-I explained the situation.

154
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:50,876
Why are you being so pigheaded?

155
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,712
-What are you afraid of?
-Our security

156
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:55,923
and the lives of our people are at risk!
I'm just asking you to be more careful!

157
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:23,534
You can chew with your gums
if you have no teeth, and

158
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:25,828
the acting president can fill in
if there's no president,

159
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:27,747
but if you have no toilet paper,

160
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,373
you're in trouble.

161
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:35,671
You went through so much today.

162
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:37,757
You should be happy.

163
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,968
Starting tomorrow,
we'll have an acting president.

164
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,190
It wasn't just
the National Assembly Building.

165
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:55,816
The Blue House was hit with a bomb too.

166
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:03,324
That acting president's nickname
was Cinderella. It's obvious.

167
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:06,619
He probably brown-nosed politicians
and became a minister through nepotism.

168
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:09,622
Just because he was lucky enough
to survive this attack,

169
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:12,124
he's become the head honcho of Korea.

170
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,837
He has only six months
of experience in politics,

171
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:19,089
and all he did was
measure fine dust levels.

172
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:21,217
What could he possibly do
against North Korea?

173
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,011
Actually, I'm scared
he might do something. Don't you agree?

174
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:39,985
Everyone says that you're so lucky.

175
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:47,785
The point I'm trying to make

176
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:51,831
is that you're very lucky
when it comes to your career.

177
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:07,847
I'm sorry, sir.

178
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:11,892
To be frank, I was a bit concerned
after reading your resume.

179
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:13,018
I apologize.

180
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:15,187
No.

181
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:19,942
You simply made a quick judgment
with the given data.

182
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:22,862
It's an understandable survival instinct.

183
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:27,283
After all, this is an emergency situation.

184
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:33,247
I'll be waiting for your call.

185
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:34,874
Excuse me.

186
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:38,544
Is the chief presidential secretary
still in there?

187
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:45,301
What happens if I step down
as acting president?

188
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:48,846
I'm unqualified.

189
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,056
Look.

190
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:55,603
If you're talking about competence,

191
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:58,647
there was only one person
who was qualified.

192
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:00,608
And today,

193
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:03,110
we lost him.

194
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:04,320
But...

195
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:08,657
-I'm sure you know as well.
-Is this because of what happened today?

196
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:17,541
Your termination had no legal effect.

197
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,335
MINISTER
PARK MU-JIN

198
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,462
There was no time to process it.

199
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:26,258
But if you resign,

200
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:29,595
your current position will be vacant.

201
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:35,476
The only individuals who can succeed
are ministers and cabinet members.

202
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:42,775
Who could've ever imagined
that such a disaster would occur?

203
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:43,776
Then

204
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,028
what happens after I resign?

205
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:49,448
Authority

206
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:51,951
does not permit vacancy.

207
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:56,205
The clearest and obvious power

208
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,666
will take control.

209
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:07,800
PAST PRESIDENTS

210
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:17,601
-Are you talking about a military coup?
-We've experienced such coups

211
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:21,105
several times in the past.

212
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:23,357
Sir.

213
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:25,818
We have a problem.

214
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:32,199
That's a Sawagiri vessel.

215
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:35,035
It's Japan's Self-Defense Forces'
Aegis destroyer.

216
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:39,623
Japan seems to have concluded
that a war is imminent.

217
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:41,625
But still.

218
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:44,294
How dare they trespass
into our waters without informing us?

219
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:46,046
It's a good opportunity for them.

220
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:49,008
Prime Minister Aso's approval rating
hit rock-bottom after the scandal.

221
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:51,510
It's good for them if we have problems.

222
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:53,971
Even better if their Self-Defense Forces
can intervene.

223
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:55,931
Leadership during a national crisis.

224
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,100
We've done that before as well.

225
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:00,811
This is because they have no respect
for our military.

226
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:02,312
It's obvious.

227
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:05,607
Japan has provoked us, and yet,
we're just watching.

228
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:07,818
Does that make sense?

229
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:10,029
We cannot prevent a war

230
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:12,489
unless we're prepared to fight one.

231
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:17,161
But our acting president doesn't
even realize something that simple.

232
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:23,333
Our nation pretty much doesn't have
a commander-in-chief right now.

233
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:29,631
There will be
no commander-in-chief either,

234
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,258
if you resign right now.

235
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:34,470
Mr. Secretary.

236
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,639
You should talk
with the Japanese ambassador.

237
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,350
If we don't solve this vessel issue
by daybreak,

238
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:42,770
things will get more complicated.

239
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:45,439
Their Self-Defense Forces
pretty much announced

240
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:47,274
that a war is imminent.

241
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:50,402
When morning comes, the stock markets
will be shaken up.

242
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:53,697
The foreigners in this country will look
for tickets to go back home.

243
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:56,033
If that happens, we won't be able
to calm the people down.

244
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:57,993
We're running out of time, sir.

245
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:01,622
Do you still think

246
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:04,291
you're unqualified?

247
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:10,380
I'm not asking you to exercise
presidential powers.

248
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:12,716
I'm asking you to perform
your duty as a citizen.

249
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:16,762
You were chosen as the acting president

250
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:18,388
based on...

251
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:21,475
this country's constitution.

252
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:32,611
Aren't you tired?

253
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:33,987
It won't take long.

254
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:35,072
Right.

255
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:36,198
This way.

256
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:43,622
JAPANESE AMBASSADOR TO KOREA
KENTO KIMURA

257
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:48,961
Prime Minister Aso sends
his deepest condolences.

258
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:51,380
Unfortunately, you are not here

259
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:54,341
to relay your condolences.

260
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:58,095
You have been summoned
because a Sawagiri vessel

261
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,389
has trespassed into Korea's waters.

262
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,273
We did not trespass into Korean waters.

263
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:11,817
This is an act of self-defense.

264
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,443
"An act of self-defense"?

265
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:22,119
COMMANDER OF CFC
BROWN BELL

266
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:26,039
My fellow Koreans,

267
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:29,001
Dokdo is our land.

268
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:33,672
Dokdo is a historical land
that was the first to get absorbed

269
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:38,135
by Japan during the pillage.

270
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,221
It was conquered by Japan

271
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:45,142
during the Russo-Japanese War...

272
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:49,813
"Statement to the Nation."

273
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:52,900
"Emergency Statement."

274
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:54,109
"Statement."

275
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,819
UPRIGHT SOCIETY OPENING STATEMENT

276
00:19:57,946 --> 00:19:59,740
FIRST ORAL STATEMENT AT BLUE HOUSE

277
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:06,663
For this upcoming Statement to the Nation,
I think it's of the utmost importance

278
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:11,627
for me to soothe their financial anxiety.

279
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:16,298
However, if I don't do it right,

280
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:21,553
I could aggravate their anxiety instead.

281
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:24,473
So I think...

282
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:35,943
Hey, Kim Nam-wook!

283
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:38,237
-Yes, sir.
-How could you snore in front of

284
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,154
the president?

285
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,782
Is this your way of protesting?

286
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,660
Are you saying you're fed up
with this old fogy?

287
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:46,870
No, sir.

288
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:49,248
I had so much work yesterday,

289
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:51,333
so I couldn't listen to your wise--

290
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,627
-Whine? What did you say?
-Your wise--

291
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:56,713
-I mean, wise--
-You need to enunciate.

292
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:58,465
Your wise words.

293
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:00,759
-Again.
-Wise words, sir.

294
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,054
-Are you sure about that?
-Yes, sir.

295
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:05,847
Gosh.

296
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:07,683
That's fine.

297
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:11,436
Oh, right. Let me restart the camera.

298
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,939
-Sure.
-We don't want that recorded.

299
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:16,358
Goodness.

300
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:19,653
-It's difficult, isn't it?
-No, sir.

301
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:21,655
I'm sorry.

302
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:45,137
Well... I was...

303
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:47,347
-Here.
-It's okay.

304
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,516
Well...

305
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:52,853
I heard that you were preparing
the Statement to the Nation.

306
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:55,897
As the speechwriter in charge,
I will be writing the speech myself.

307
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,357
You don't need to worry, sir.

308
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:58,984
Okay.

309
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:01,194
Hello.

310
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:09,786
Secretary Han asked me
to make sure you are comfortable.

311
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:13,665
Would you like to get some sleep?
Should I prepare a bed for you?

312
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:17,210
No, thanks. I'm good.

313
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:20,005
All right, then.

314
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,423
Thanks.

315
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:43,403
The Blue House staff and I

316
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:47,866
will take care of everything.

317
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:51,912
All you have to do sir,

318
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,498
is just sit there.

319
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:59,127
That way, this nation can maintain
at least a bit of constitutional order.

320
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:19,481
It’s me. How is Si-jin?

321
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,193
What did the doctor say?

322
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:26,947
There seems to have been
some internal bleeding in her brain,

323
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:30,117
but they were able to stop it.

324
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:37,958
Now,

325
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:43,004
we are waiting for Si-jin
to regain consciousness.

326
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:50,387
I have Si-jin’s hair tie.

327
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:53,306
She’ll look for it when she wakes up.

328
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:56,810
Tell her I’ll give it to her
when she comes to me,

329
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:59,771
so she should wake up soon and hurry over.

330
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:03,984
Si-jin will be fine.

331
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:08,155
I’ll worry about her.

332
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:13,034
You have so many other things
to worry about now.

333
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:19,166
We won’t be able to go home for a while.

334
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:22,169
I’m sorry I put you through this.

335
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:26,339
Do you really think I mind?

336
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:30,677
You...

337
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:35,307
You could have been there
when it happened.

338
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:39,311
At least...

339
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:42,981
we're still together.

340
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:52,282
Is it true

341
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:55,118
that a North Korean submarine vanished?

342
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:09,549
A North-Korean Romeo-class

343
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:11,885
submarine left from Shinpo Base
and didn't return.

344
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:16,598
It’s a submarine built to
transport nuclear warheads.

345
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:20,644
They advertised how it demonstrates
their top-class technology.

346
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:32,948
Do you understand now

347
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:36,284
why Japan dispatched the Aegis
to the East Sea?

348
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:38,787
...why Japan dispatched
the Aegis to the East Sea?

349
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:41,206
You should have discussed it
with our government first

350
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:44,167
if Japan is our ally.

351
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:46,378
Are you concerned about Korea Passing?

352
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:49,381
Are you concerned about Korea Passing?

353
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:52,384
South Korea has failed
to protect its own president.

354
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:55,554
Why would Japan discuss

355
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:58,056
national security with such a nation?

356
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,184
South Korea has failed
to protect its own president.

357
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:04,521
Why would Japan discuss
national security with such a nation?

358
00:26:04,604 --> 00:26:06,356
Are you kidding--

359
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,278
Let him speak.

360
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,711
Do you mean

361
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:30,589
you will join us as we prepare for war?

362
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:53,987
Where’s President Park now?

363
00:26:54,237 --> 00:26:56,156
Must we really consent to DEFCON 2?

364
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:59,159
If it’s true that North Korea’s sub
has moved south, yes.

365
00:26:59,242 --> 00:27:00,660
This is crazy.

366
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:04,039
This is exactly
what the American hard-liners wanted.

367
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:05,332
Just think about it.

368
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:08,293
To President Reynold, a provocation
from the North is a disaster.

369
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:10,086
His re-election is coming up soon.

370
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:12,964
I bet he’ll choose
the most aggressive military action

371
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:15,550
to show that they won’t be
strong-armed by North Korea.

372
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:17,469
It’ll be more than
what the hard-liners wanted.

373
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:20,430
A DEFCON was declared
only twice in Korean history.

374
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:22,974
The Panmunjeom axe murder incident in 1976

375
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:24,768
and the Rangoon bombing in 1983.

376
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,479
The US Army had to control the situation

377
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:29,314
in case Korean soldiers retaliated.

378
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:31,107
At levels over DEFCON 3,

379
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:33,818
the operation authority goes
to the Combined Forces Command.

380
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:35,278
And it’s the same now.

381
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:38,198
The US just wants
to have control over Korea.

382
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:41,368
It's too dangerous when there is tension
between the North and South like now.

383
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:43,119
Is the hotline still silent?

384
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:47,874
We can't seem to reach them.

385
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:51,336
There’s no response to the fax
we sent about the hotline either.

386
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:53,797
It’s the same situation
with the military communications line.

387
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,758
They’re not sending or receiving
any transmissions, both land and maritime.

388
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:58,677
This is obviously a refusal to talk.

389
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,888
They’re like teenagers, locking
their door whenever something happens.

390
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:05,016
If it’s true that
the submarine moved south,

391
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,686
then it could already be in front
of Jinhae Naval Base by now.

392
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:09,020
We can’t make hasty conclusions.

393
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:11,815
From the North’s point of view,
stationing the Japanese Aegis

394
00:28:11,898 --> 00:28:15,443
is a provocation by the South
Korea-US-Japan alliance. For the North,

395
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:18,613
refusing to communicate
is the strongest option for protesting.

396
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:23,410
June 1996, vice-ministerial level talks
between the two Koreas

397
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:24,327
and...

398
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:28,289
the first battle at Baengnyeong.

399
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:33,253
June 2010, the Inter-Korean Summit

400
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:35,714
and the Asan warship explosion.

401
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:38,425
March 2012,

402
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:41,219
an Inter-Korea Summit Agreement,

403
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,472
and the second battle
at Baengnyeong broke out.

404
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:45,515
And today,

405
00:28:46,933 --> 00:28:48,601
March 4th, 2019,

406
00:28:49,352 --> 00:28:51,187
the National Assembly Building,

407
00:28:52,188 --> 00:28:57,652
the assassination of the president
and government officials.

408
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:01,614
Don’t you get it?

409
00:29:02,782 --> 00:29:05,785
North Korea has always mocked
the government’s Sunshine Policy.

410
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:08,204
And always with the same method.

411
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:10,999
Do you still want to believe

412
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:14,377
-that they’re capable of communication?
-We don’t just believe it.

413
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:17,714
We know it.

414
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:20,717
We know that they need rice

415
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:23,887
as much as we need peace.

416
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:28,808
Peace isn’t something
you beg for with money.

417
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:32,937
It’s something you protect
with your blood.

418
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:38,151
Your amateurish concept of security
and your fantasy of reunification

419
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:39,652
cost you your boss.

420
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:41,196
And our military

421
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:44,073
lost our commander-in-chief.

422
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:02,008
We don’t have time, President Park.

423
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:04,469
Give your consent to announce DEFCON 2.

424
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:08,264
DEFCON 2...

425
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:14,145
Are you saying you’re certain
that North Korea is preparing for war?

426
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:17,774
Do you think any enemy
will ever let you know for certain?

427
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:20,568
If we fear the North,

428
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:23,154
it’s not because of their nukes
or their missiles.

429
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:30,119
It means we can never know them.

430
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:32,705
Just like the submarine.

431
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:51,474
You got information
on the submarine, right?

432
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:53,726
So what are the facts? Did it move south?

433
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:56,646
Is it provocation? Just a drill?
Or is it--

434
00:30:56,729 --> 00:30:58,648
That won't make any difference.

435
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,441
Pardon?

436
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:04,404
Do you know
why the government is like this today?

437
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:06,865
Well...

438
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:10,702
It’s because the arrogant president
made our military

439
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:14,414
and your intelligence service powerless
for the sake of peace.

440
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:18,084
I will never go back to those days.

441
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:20,628
Don't you agree?

442
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:26,175
I'm against this.

443
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:30,555
The moment President Park
consents to DEFCON 2,

444
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:34,893
the leadership of this nation will go over
to the military and intelligence

445
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:36,978
since it means
we’re in a quasi-state of war.

446
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:40,648
Then regaining that power
will be impossible, sir.

447
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:44,903
You really are young.

448
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:49,324
You have the strength
to think about the future.

449
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:02,795
You should’ve gone to the hospital
or taken a sick leave.

450
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:04,380
It’s not too late.

451
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:18,645
Do you really think
I could go to the hospital?

452
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:21,981
That would be shameless of me.

453
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:28,571
This is so unfair. I can't stand it.

454
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:33,952
Every step of the way for the past
two years to reach the peace treaty

455
00:32:35,161 --> 00:32:36,996
has been difficult.

456
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:40,041
We had to worry about upsetting the US.

457
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:42,752
and pacifying the brazen North.

458
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:48,174
We never got to eat peacefully
with our families

459
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:50,510
or take a vacation.

460
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:53,680
We worked so hard to get this far.

461
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:57,517
How could it all go up in smoke like this?

462
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,935
We still...

463
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:01,938
have time.

464
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:07,652
We’ll have to check the situation up north
as soon as possible.

465
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:10,321
Whether we use the intelligence from China

466
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:12,156
or from third countries...

467
00:33:12,281 --> 00:33:13,116
Mr. Ko.

468
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:16,786
Can you connect me directly

469
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:19,622
without going through NIS?

470
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:22,792
All right, sir.

471
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:24,961
Contact the Chunchugwan
and issue a press embargo.

472
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,631
Once the citizens start panicking,

473
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:32,802
we may not have any other choice.

474
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:36,931
Let's just...

475
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,518
think about one thing for now.

476
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,813
Peace on the Korean Peninsula...

477
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:48,568
was the president’s last unfinished work.

478
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,613
The submarine, sir.

479
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:55,908
Do you really think
North Korea is preparing for an attack?

480
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:58,828
It wasn't caught on radar
or in satellite photos,

481
00:33:58,911 --> 00:34:02,457
so it means it’s been underwater
this whole time.

482
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:05,626
It’s probably targeting
Jinhae Naval Base, right?

483
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,587
-Then, by now--
-By now,

484
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:11,424
they should rise
at least to raise their periscope.

485
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:14,052
If it left Shinpo Base on February 24th

486
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:16,679
and maintained an average speed
of 15 knots...

487
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:18,473
It's been nine days, so...

488
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:22,602
How did they get
oxygen inside the submarine?

489
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:25,938
They would have vaporized
liquid oxygen, right?

490
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:27,231
Yes.

491
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:34,363
If it’s a diesel engine,
then they’d use lithium batteries.

492
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:36,449
What do you think?

493
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:39,118
Well...

494
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,954
-Sir.
-Yes?

495
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:45,500
I... studied liberal arts.

496
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:49,629
Oh, I see.

497
00:34:52,381 --> 00:34:54,509
Is it that hard to understand?

498
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:56,719
It’s North Korea we're talking about.

499
00:34:58,387 --> 00:34:59,931
Even if they're starving,

500
00:35:00,014 --> 00:35:01,766
they'll commandeer all the fishing boats

501
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:03,726
to build submarines.

502
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:05,895
Why are you talking about college majors?

503
00:35:05,978 --> 00:35:07,230
What did you just say?

504
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:10,817
I was talking to Mr. Park.

505
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,819
No, the fishing boats.

506
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:15,404
You said they commandeered
all the fishing boats.

507
00:35:15,988 --> 00:35:18,991
Well, it's obvious.
Why else would there be no fishing boats

508
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:20,368
when it’s halfbeak season?

509
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:22,245
Are you sure? Do you have proof?

510
00:35:22,328 --> 00:35:23,621
Is that data reliable?

511
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:26,249
It’s where I was born and raised.

512
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:30,503
There, even if you’ve just scattered
your father's ashes in the sea,

513
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:33,172
you have to go fishing the next day
because that's your livelihood.

514
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:39,929
Mr. Kim is a North Korean defector
whom President Yang selected

515
00:35:40,012 --> 00:35:42,473
through special employment
to be a speechwriter.

516
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:54,819
Ms. Jeong.

517
00:35:56,028 --> 00:35:57,155
I need a favor.

518
00:35:57,655 --> 00:35:59,031
Out of the way.

519
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:04,036
How do you feel?

520
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:07,081
Are you okay?
I will do my best to help you.

521
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:09,333
Doctor, how is he?

522
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:10,751
He's losing a lot of blood.

523
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:14,964
We'll do our best to help you.

524
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:16,257
I'm so sorry.

525
00:36:17,091 --> 00:36:19,177
Ms. Yun. About the press interview,

526
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:22,013
would you like to do
the photo shoot first or the interview?

527
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:24,307
The reporters are waiting.

528
00:36:28,227 --> 00:36:30,605
I’m going to turn on my phone
as soon as I leave the hospital.

529
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:33,733
If I see a single picture of me here

530
00:36:33,816 --> 00:36:36,235
on TV, online, or in any paper,

531
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:38,070
you're fired.

532
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:44,577
Oh, no. It must hurt a lot...

533
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,329
Stop making them stand here.

534
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:48,289
Feed them and send them back.

535
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:51,792
-Can I help?
-The tent bar doesn't take credit cards.

536
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:53,336
Are you okay?

537
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:54,253
Oh, my.

538
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:55,546
Yes.

539
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,298
You will be okay soon.

540
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:00,718
She was trying her best.

541
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:03,554
She wanted to get you more coverage

542
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:06,933
and brought all the reporters who were
by the National Assembly Building.

543
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:09,518
There was a bombing
during the president's speech

544
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:11,771
at the National Assembly
that I was boycotting.

545
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:15,441
That alone stops me from being free
of any moral responsibility.

546
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:17,193
The injured are in the lobby

547
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:20,321
because the ER is full.
How could she bring cameras here?

548
00:37:20,696 --> 00:37:22,406
Do you think people
would view me favorably?

549
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:24,700
I'm sure she just wanted to show people

550
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:27,078
that you’re the first politician
to rush to the scene.

551
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:31,415
TV stations aren't the only ones
with cameras anymore.

552
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:35,294
Come over here.

553
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:36,963
Please come help.

554
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:38,881
Out of the way!

555
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:40,591
Where does it hurt the most?

556
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:41,676
#YUN CHAN-GYEONG

557
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:42,927
Hang in there.

558
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:45,263
#SHINING LEADERSHIP
SHE WAS THE FIRST CONGRESSWOMAN TO COME

559
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:46,597
Where does it hurt the most?

560
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:49,016
It looks like you hurt your head badly.

561
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:50,518
Could you come over here?

562
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:51,686
Just one second.

563
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:54,021
Are you okay?

564
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:56,524
Could you call a doctor?

565
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:58,401
-Please hurry...
-Hello?

566
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:00,361
What?

567
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:10,329
To the Blue House.

568
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:11,414
Yes, ma'am.

569
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:26,804
I’m sorry to keep you waiting.

570
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:30,349
It’s okay. We're in a time of emergency.

571
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:32,018
Please have a seat.

572
00:38:37,898 --> 00:38:40,443
So the Japanese ambassador was summoned?

573
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:44,030
I heard that the commander of
the Combined Forces Command was here too.

574
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,490
What’s going on, Secretary Han?

575
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:47,950
Who told you?

576
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:50,745
Was it the reporters?
Or a Blue House staff member?

577
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:52,330
Does that matter?

578
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:56,167
I won't use this to politically attack
the president.

579
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:59,462
President Yang’s administration
was terminated today anyway.

580
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:03,174
That Sunshine Policy you people
worshiped so dearly

581
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:05,259
-also came to an end.
-Ms. Yun.

582
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:07,219
Korea has no president, prime minister,

583
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:09,972
or a speaker of the National Assembly
right now.

584
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:13,517
I’m not just an opposition party leader.
I’m a representative

585
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:16,145
of the National Assembly.
No, the citizens.

586
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:18,606
I can’t be excluded

587
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:20,858
in such a situation
involving national security.

588
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,445
I’m saying I’ll share the responsibility.

589
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:31,577
I’m suggesting a coalition with our party.

590
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:38,542
It sounds like you’re telling us
to throw in the towel.

591
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:43,130
Thank you for understanding so quickly.

592
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:45,758
Although our president is gone,

593
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:47,885
we have our acting president,

594
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:51,055
and until the next election,

595
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:53,682
this is still
the Yang Jin-man administration.

596
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:57,937
We’re responsible
for this nation’s security.

597
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:02,733
And we’re going to carry out
our responsibilities to the fullest.

598
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:09,615
It’s March.

599
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:11,826
The nights are still long.

600
00:40:14,328 --> 00:40:15,621
If it turns out to be true

601
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:19,291
that the North Korean submarine
has moved south,

602
00:40:19,708 --> 00:40:21,127
I'm sure the people

603
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:24,713
will not wait out
the 60-day term of the acting president.

604
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:27,591
Would they entrust
their lives and property

605
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:31,429
with the acting president,
who has no experience in politics

606
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:34,390
or with national security
other than his military service?

607
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:37,268
In a quasi-state of war like now?

608
00:40:40,646 --> 00:40:41,897
It’ll be

609
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:45,025
an especially long night for you.

610
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:53,200
YEOMINGWAN 1

611
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:07,798
Here's the data on the marine ecosystem
on the eastern coast.

612
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:11,469
MARINE ECOSYSTEM AND LITHIUM POISONING

613
00:41:12,052 --> 00:41:15,723
We found fish
with lithium poisoning in the East Sea.

614
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:19,560
The report came into our ministry
on March 2nd.

615
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:22,146
That's after the submarine disappeared.

616
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:24,023
Lithium...

617
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:25,733
Lithium...

618
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:28,486
Lithium...

619
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:32,907
Lithium...

620
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:40,122
Lithium Batteries.

621
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:42,500
It’s the North Korean submarine’s
power source.

622
00:41:47,963 --> 00:41:49,048
The vanished fishing boats,

623
00:41:50,132 --> 00:41:53,511
fish with lithium poisoning,
the lithium-battery-powered sub.

624
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:55,513
Do you get what this all means?

625
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:57,473
Ms. Jeong?

626
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:02,061
Please excuse me.

627
00:42:07,149 --> 00:42:08,776
What about the intelligence in China?

628
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:11,362
They had a mass replacement recently.

629
00:42:11,445 --> 00:42:12,821
So it'll be a bit difficult.

630
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:14,782
How much time do we have?

631
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:17,409
Commander Brown wants
us to declare DEFCON 2

632
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:19,411
before sunrise.

633
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:24,667
Do you plan

634
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:26,835
to consent to DEFCON 2?

635
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:31,715
What happens

636
00:42:32,341 --> 00:42:35,010
if the submarine sank
and didn't infiltrate our waters?

637
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:42,309
What if the submarine is drifting
in our waters due to defects?

638
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:43,894
Is that true?

639
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:46,397
What’s the source of that information?

640
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:48,232
It's still

641
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:51,151
just a theory.
I’ll need to check a few things.

642
00:42:53,028 --> 00:42:54,113
So,

643
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:57,032
you’re saying you’ll risk
the people’s lives and safety

644
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:00,744
on something uncertain
that hasn’t even been confirmed?

645
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:06,333
It left Shinpo Base on February 24th.

646
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:13,841
If it maintained an average speed of 15
knots per hour, since it’s been nine days,

647
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:16,760
it would be somewhere in our waters.
Probably around here.

648
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:19,680
The last satellite photo of it above water

649
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:21,724
was on March 2nd.

650
00:43:21,807 --> 00:43:25,227
So the oxygen inside the submarine
after 69 hours is--

651
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:26,312
Stop.

652
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:28,939
If you’re going to talk

653
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:31,483
about stuff like data
and the ethics of scientists, stop.

654
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:35,613
This isn’t the school or lab

655
00:43:36,405 --> 00:43:38,157
where you were before.

656
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:08,062
Their families are waiting.

657
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:11,607
The submarine crew’s families

658
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:13,901
must be waiting for them.

659
00:44:16,528 --> 00:44:19,698
None of them would’ve imagined

660
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:23,410
that the day they left home
would be the last.

661
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:32,002
The window of time to save the crew
is almost up.

662
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:35,756
They have 69 hours to breathe
with the oxygen inside the submarine,

663
00:44:36,548 --> 00:44:37,966
and it’s almost over.

664
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:39,593
Let me ask you one thing.

665
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:42,596
What if

666
00:44:43,972 --> 00:44:45,557
it didn't sink

667
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:48,143
and did infiltrate our waters?

668
00:44:49,144 --> 00:44:49,978
Then...

669
00:44:52,398 --> 00:44:55,818
they’re just our enemies
that could threaten

670
00:44:57,319 --> 00:44:58,862
the safety of five million people.

671
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:01,782
Am I wrong?

672
00:45:05,285 --> 00:45:06,912
Give consent

673
00:45:08,872 --> 00:45:10,082
to declare DEFCON 2.

674
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:13,585
-But, Mr. Han--
-You promised

675
00:45:14,253 --> 00:45:16,255
to let me and the Blue House staff

676
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:19,967
take care of everything that happens here.

677
00:45:22,344 --> 00:45:23,262
I...

678
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:26,014
will not gamble

679
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:29,601
with this nation's security.

680
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:53,625
Are you planning to do
what Secretary Han said?

681
00:45:56,628 --> 00:45:58,130
I have no choice.

682
00:45:58,714 --> 00:46:02,342
Didn't you think the submarine sank?

683
00:46:04,887 --> 00:46:06,221
For now,

684
00:46:07,389 --> 00:46:09,892
it's just a hypothesis
that hasn't been proved yet.

685
00:46:10,225 --> 00:46:11,351
It is not data.

686
00:46:14,646 --> 00:46:17,149
No, I'll do it.

687
00:46:18,567 --> 00:46:19,568
You should get used to it.

688
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:21,695
It's protocol.

689
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:25,657
It's a bit too much.

690
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:29,495
Of course.

691
00:46:30,078 --> 00:46:31,121
Thank you.

692
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:36,502
I was told

693
00:46:37,419 --> 00:46:41,465
a protocol administrator is like
a traffic light.

694
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:46,053
"The Republic of Korea

695
00:46:47,387 --> 00:46:48,639
is still doing well.

696
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:50,474
So,

697
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:53,268
no one can mistreat us."

698
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:57,022
I must have wanted

699
00:46:57,606 --> 00:47:00,526
to send out that signal through you,
Mr. President.

700
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:03,070
I apologize

701
00:47:04,446 --> 00:47:05,864
if I made you uncomfortable.

702
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:12,162
That's a good expression,

703
00:47:13,747 --> 00:47:16,542
that a protocol administrator
is like a traffic light.

704
00:47:19,419 --> 00:47:21,463
The chief secretary
of Presidential Protocol

705
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:25,050
always said that.

706
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:29,721
Did I meet him today?

707
00:47:33,308 --> 00:47:35,060
He was accompanying the president

708
00:47:35,978 --> 00:47:37,437
at the National Assembly today.

709
00:47:39,481 --> 00:47:41,400
He went instead of me...

710
00:47:43,485 --> 00:47:44,987
because I wanted to go to Panmunjom.

711
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:09,094
Today,

712
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:13,599
we are standing here

713
00:48:14,766 --> 00:48:16,435
because we survived by chance.

714
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:37,331
Because it's old.

715
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:41,293
Secretary Choi.

716
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:10,781
-No...
-No, please.

717
00:49:11,531 --> 00:49:15,327
How could you leave us like this?

718
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:17,996
COME BACK ALIVE

719
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:20,207
PLEASE FIND MY BROTHER DAE-HYUN

720
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:21,833
HURRY HOME!

721
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:24,044
Please send him back to us.

722
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:28,173
No. Please don't go.

723
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:30,133
MY FRIEND, YOU LEFT US TOO SOON.
I LOVE YOU.

724
00:49:45,357 --> 00:49:46,900
Is anyone there?

725
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:50,862
Do you hear me? Please answer me!

726
00:49:50,946 --> 00:49:53,156
Are there any survivors?

727
00:49:53,615 --> 00:49:54,741
Anyone?

728
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:57,536
Do you hear me?

729
00:49:58,036 --> 00:49:59,871
What do you think the possibility is?

730
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,044
For there to be survivors
in this situation. Do you have statistics

731
00:50:06,128 --> 00:50:07,421
or examples from other countries?

732
00:50:09,631 --> 00:50:12,926
What I want to believe in
isn't probabilities,

733
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:19,558
but a miracle.

734
00:50:21,768 --> 00:50:24,855
I heard the NIS director
was on the list of the deceased.

735
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:30,027
Life is so unpredictable.

736
00:50:31,278 --> 00:50:33,822
If it were a normal administrative speech
by the president,

737
00:50:34,489 --> 00:50:36,491
the NIS Director would have
no reason to be there.

738
00:50:38,118 --> 00:50:41,455
He decided only yesterday morning
to attend

739
00:50:41,621 --> 00:50:43,832
because it was regarding
the Inter-Korean Peace Agreement.

740
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:50,714
I need to ask for a favor.

741
00:50:51,798 --> 00:50:53,425
That isn't a favor.

742
00:50:53,508 --> 00:50:55,510
It's an illegal act.

743
00:51:02,684 --> 00:51:04,644
So, you're asking me

744
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:07,439
to pull up the list of people
Agent Kim met and called

745
00:51:07,522 --> 00:51:09,399
before going
to the National Assembly Building

746
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:10,525
and the work he was doing.

747
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:13,528
Do you know
what they call it in two words?

748
00:51:14,112 --> 00:51:15,572
Illegal surveillance.

749
00:51:16,156 --> 00:51:17,657
What century do you live in?

750
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:20,327
I don't do anything that's out of trend.

751
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:24,456
Kim Jun-o is an agent
with Espionage Team Two.

752
00:51:24,664 --> 00:51:28,293
He has no reason to attend
the State of the Nation Address.

753
00:51:28,376 --> 00:51:30,420
But he was there right at that time,

754
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:32,589
and took the subway
instead of driving as usual,

755
00:51:32,672 --> 00:51:33,673
and he was alone.

756
00:51:36,218 --> 00:51:38,970
I just want to know the reason.

757
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:41,181
I want to know the reason too.

758
00:51:42,974 --> 00:51:45,811
Why you are reporting to people directly
without my knowing?

759
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:50,649
Na-gyeong, when matters
are as pressing as this,

760
00:51:50,732 --> 00:51:52,943
it's better to unify the channels.

761
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:56,488
If you report to my superiors
without going through me--

762
00:51:56,571 --> 00:51:58,240
I was just going to tell you.

763
00:51:59,491 --> 00:52:03,161
Is that so? Then go ahead and tell me.

764
00:52:05,664 --> 00:52:07,415
North Korea is acting weird.

765
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:09,292
What's new about that?

766
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:12,212
Are you telling me
the sun rises in the east?

767
00:52:12,462 --> 00:52:13,797
They are always acting weird.

768
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:16,466
Look at this. Is this normal?

769
00:52:18,051 --> 00:52:19,010
They're too quiet.

770
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:23,849
They are way too quiet

771
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:27,144
to assume North Korea did this
to provoke us.

772
00:52:29,354 --> 00:52:32,440
None of the diplomats in other countries
had their families

773
00:52:32,524 --> 00:52:34,526
take shelter or return
to their home country.

774
00:52:34,901 --> 00:52:37,362
Security hasn't been heightened
at the border of China,

775
00:52:37,445 --> 00:52:39,823
nor were any unusual activities detected.

776
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:41,283
You're the one that said

777
00:52:41,366 --> 00:52:43,368
the bomb found at the site
was made in North Korea.

778
00:52:43,952 --> 00:52:45,162
It was a dud.

779
00:52:46,246 --> 00:52:50,292
What if someone orchestrated it
to make us...

780
00:52:53,044 --> 00:52:54,337
suspect North Korea?

781
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:01,136
Who would do that?

782
00:53:06,099 --> 00:53:08,059
Do you approve of DEFCON 2?

783
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:10,020
What happens after that?

784
00:53:19,237 --> 00:53:21,114
NORTH KOREA'S MAIN NUCLEAR FACILITIES

785
00:53:21,198 --> 00:53:23,116
It's called the Bloody Nose Strategy.

786
00:53:24,242 --> 00:53:28,455
It is a restricted and precise
preemptive strike

787
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:31,333
to display superior military strength

788
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,293
and intimidate them.

789
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:35,212
NORTH KOREA BOMBING SIMULATION

790
00:53:53,146 --> 00:53:55,774
As commander-in-chief
of the ROK military...

791
00:53:58,985 --> 00:54:02,239
SINUIJU, PYONGYANG,
PREDICTED LOCATION

792
00:54:11,122 --> 00:54:12,666
-Sir?
-It's strange.

793
00:54:14,376 --> 00:54:17,462
The submarine moved south,
but instead of defending our seas,

794
00:54:17,545 --> 00:54:19,798
we're hitting North Korea's
nuclear facilities first?

795
00:54:22,008 --> 00:54:23,927
We're incapacitating
their nuclear facilities,

796
00:54:24,469 --> 00:54:26,346
so North Korea cannot provoke us again.

797
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:29,224
It's just one of the options.

798
00:54:31,851 --> 00:54:34,479
It won't affect the South.

799
00:54:36,189 --> 00:54:38,066
If they are capable
of thinking reasonably,

800
00:54:38,149 --> 00:54:40,110
they won't start a full-scale war

801
00:54:41,069 --> 00:54:43,280
against the US.

802
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:47,617
So, you're saying

803
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:50,203
this will only be successful
under the assumption

804
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:52,289
that North Korea
is reasonable and rational.

805
00:54:55,292 --> 00:54:57,460
Does North Korea seem like such a country

806
00:54:58,878 --> 00:54:59,713
to you, General Lee?

807
00:55:13,226 --> 00:55:14,853
Approve to increase to DEFCON 2.

808
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:16,980
The North Korean submarine

809
00:55:18,023 --> 00:55:19,941
may not have infiltrated our waters.

810
00:55:20,025 --> 00:55:21,401
-Wait--
-We learned that the

811
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:24,779
marine ecosystem along the submarine
routes has been polluted by lithium.

812
00:55:24,863 --> 00:55:28,658
It is highly likely they drifted south
due to faulty batteries.

813
00:55:32,704 --> 00:55:33,997
Can you prove that?

814
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:36,916
How could anyone prove that?

815
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:38,835
How would you prove it

816
00:55:38,918 --> 00:55:41,046
when it isn't caught on satellites
or sonars?

817
00:55:41,379 --> 00:55:43,381
Unless North Korea admits it,

818
00:55:43,465 --> 00:55:44,883
we won't be able to prove it.

819
00:55:49,929 --> 00:55:52,640
Then we have no choice.

820
00:55:55,268 --> 00:55:57,020
North Korea will have to confirm it.

821
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:11,659
You're defying Washington.

822
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:18,041
You have put the Korean-US alliance
at risk because of a guess.

823
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:23,129
It's my duty to report...

824
00:56:26,299 --> 00:56:27,967
We will abide by
President Reynold's decision.

825
00:56:39,354 --> 00:56:40,313
Tell him this.

826
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:42,774
Don't leave a single word out.

827
00:56:43,983 --> 00:56:45,485
The acting president

828
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:49,239
is carrying out his job well
as commander-in-chief of the ROK.

829
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:51,866
We have operational authority
in times of peace.

830
00:57:01,459 --> 00:57:03,128
The moment you go through that door,

831
00:57:03,503 --> 00:57:05,755
you'll be the only one doubting

832
00:57:06,548 --> 00:57:08,174
the Korea-US alliance.

833
00:57:42,375 --> 00:57:44,252
Sir.

834
00:57:45,753 --> 00:57:49,090
North Korea has shut down
all communication channels.

835
00:57:49,841 --> 00:57:51,634
You know they haven't responded

836
00:57:51,718 --> 00:57:54,220
to not only the communication lines,
but also the hotline.

837
00:57:58,683 --> 00:58:00,560
Why did they shut off the hotline

838
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:04,772
if the submarine really sank?

839
00:58:04,856 --> 00:58:07,650
They may be poor,
but they have self-respect.

840
00:58:08,610 --> 00:58:10,737
North Korea has been able
to last this long

841
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:12,947
because of their pride
in independent national defense

842
00:58:13,031 --> 00:58:15,200
like nuclear or war arms technology.

843
00:58:18,703 --> 00:58:22,040
They probably don't want
the whole world to know

844
00:58:22,123 --> 00:58:25,877
the submarine the VIP is most proud of
sank due to a defect,

845
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:27,545
especially not South Korea and the US.

846
00:58:27,754 --> 00:58:30,173
Then there is nothing we can do.

847
00:58:30,256 --> 00:58:33,134
North Korea won't suddenly
swallow their pride and admit it.

848
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:42,101
THE DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF KOREA
REPUBLIC OF KOREA, BLUE HOUSE

849
00:58:42,602 --> 00:58:43,728
Sir.

850
00:58:45,813 --> 00:58:48,900
Didn't you say there was
a defect in the submarine?

851
00:58:51,194 --> 00:58:54,572
Then why did you tell North Korea
it is drifting after hitting a rock?

852
00:58:57,909 --> 00:58:59,077
Someone told me...

853
00:59:00,787 --> 00:59:01,871
that they may be poor,

854
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:04,332
but that doesn't mean
they don't have self-respect.

855
00:59:07,794 --> 00:59:09,045
Now,

856
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:11,506
do we just have to wait

857
00:59:12,173 --> 00:59:14,259
for North Korea to reply
through the hotline?

858
00:59:15,927 --> 00:59:18,805
"After communicating through fax or phone,

859
00:59:18,888 --> 00:59:22,433
we are to reply through a direct call
between the leaders within 10 minutes."

860
00:59:24,143 --> 00:59:26,646
That's the rule of operation
of the hotline set by both Koreas.

861
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:30,441
If we don't get a reply within 10 minutes,

862
00:59:31,317 --> 00:59:33,820
we can assume North Korea has no intention

863
00:59:34,279 --> 00:59:36,155
of communicating with South Korea.

864
01:00:40,428 --> 01:00:43,264
This won't work.
I think we need a different plan.

865
01:00:44,766 --> 01:00:45,767
Where is Secretary Han?

866
01:00:52,023 --> 01:00:53,274
Maritime rescue?

867
01:00:53,733 --> 01:00:58,404
Yes, North Korea is asking China
and Russia for a rescue team,

868
01:00:58,488 --> 01:00:59,947
but it doesn't seem to be going well.

869
01:01:00,531 --> 01:01:01,366
I see.

870
01:01:02,617 --> 01:01:04,243
Then it's true

871
01:01:05,995 --> 01:01:08,081
that the submarine sank.

872
01:01:09,248 --> 01:01:10,625
Thank you.

873
01:02:25,783 --> 01:02:27,827
I have something to tell you.

874
01:02:27,910 --> 01:02:29,579
-Yes?
-The submarine...

875
01:02:33,666 --> 01:02:35,543
Secretary Han!

876
01:02:35,626 --> 01:02:36,836
Secretary Han!

877
01:02:36,919 --> 01:02:38,463
-He fainted.
-Guards!

878
01:02:38,546 --> 01:02:40,214
Guards!

879
01:02:40,298 --> 01:02:41,257
Secretary Han.

880
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:42,341
Wake up.

881
01:02:42,633 --> 01:02:44,385
-Wake up, Secretary Han!
-Emergency!

882
01:02:44,635 --> 01:02:45,678
Get him on my back.

883
01:02:46,929 --> 01:02:48,765
Secretary Han.

884
01:02:50,224 --> 01:02:51,434
Gosh.

885
01:02:53,019 --> 01:02:54,729
Move out of the way.

886
01:02:55,438 --> 01:02:56,314
Secretary Han.

887
01:03:25,426 --> 01:03:26,427
I...

888
01:03:28,221 --> 01:03:29,055
approve it.

889
01:03:31,182 --> 01:03:32,683
I initiate...

890
01:03:34,769 --> 01:03:36,020
DEFCON 2...

891
01:03:36,896 --> 01:03:38,022
on the Korean Peninsula.

892
01:03:41,984 --> 01:03:43,986
DEFCON 2 has been declared
for the entire military.

893
01:03:45,029 --> 01:03:47,782
DEFCON 2 has been declared
for the entire military!

894
01:03:47,865 --> 01:03:50,117
DEFCON has been declared.

895
01:03:51,869 --> 01:03:54,956
All troops get ready for combat.

896
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:56,874
Go!

897
01:04:13,891 --> 01:04:14,725
What did you say?

898
01:04:19,689 --> 01:04:20,648
Mr. President.

899
01:04:21,941 --> 01:04:25,695
North Korea has issued
Level 2 Combat Readiness.

900
01:04:32,118 --> 01:04:33,119
I know.

901
01:04:34,495 --> 01:04:37,081
Get them ready now.

902
01:04:38,583 --> 01:04:39,417
Okay.

903
01:04:43,004 --> 01:04:44,338
Call Washington

904
01:04:44,422 --> 01:04:46,507
and upgrade to DEFCON 1.

905
01:04:48,050 --> 01:04:49,594
Bloody Nose.

906
01:04:50,386 --> 01:04:52,722
It's time for that strategy.

907
01:05:22,668 --> 01:05:23,502
This is the Blue House.

908
01:05:29,258 --> 01:05:31,093
Mr. President has to answer.

909
01:05:51,364 --> 01:05:53,032
This is Park Mu-jin,

910
01:05:55,076 --> 01:05:56,243
the acting president.

911
01:06:02,625 --> 01:06:07,296
Did you say you have the coordinates
to the current location of our submarine?

912
01:06:12,802 --> 01:06:15,012
CALL OFF LEVEL 2 COMBAT READINESS

913
01:06:17,181 --> 01:06:18,516
Will you call off

914
01:06:19,266 --> 01:06:21,435
Level 2 Combat Readiness?

915
01:06:22,311 --> 01:06:24,105
Then I'll send you
the submarine's coordinates.

916
01:06:24,188 --> 01:06:27,316
The South breached
the ceasefire agreement first.

917
01:06:28,109 --> 01:06:30,403
You called in Japan's
Maritime Self-defense Force

918
01:06:30,486 --> 01:06:33,239
and went into combat readiness
with the US.

919
01:06:33,823 --> 01:06:37,159
It was the South, not us.

920
01:06:39,036 --> 01:06:42,164
Why would we lift combat readiness first?

921
01:06:43,791 --> 01:06:45,459
Is it because of the US?

922
01:06:46,627 --> 01:06:50,131
Because they have wartime authority,
not the South?

923
01:06:56,679 --> 01:06:59,015
NO NEGOTIATIONS WITHOUT AN ANSWER

924
01:07:00,266 --> 01:07:01,267
It's because...

925
01:07:03,686 --> 01:07:04,854
we aren't the US.

926
01:07:10,026 --> 01:07:12,278
The US doesn't want peace
on the Korean Peninsula

927
01:07:13,154 --> 01:07:14,321
as much as we do.

928
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:20,828
The crew of the submarine are still alive,

929
01:07:21,287 --> 01:07:23,956
but the window of opportunity
may close if you wait any longer.

930
01:07:25,624 --> 01:07:29,420
Isn't it the nation's duty
to save its people's lives?

931
01:07:31,213 --> 01:07:32,214
Today,

932
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:35,551
we failed to do so.

933
01:07:35,801 --> 01:07:38,137
However, you still have a chance.

934
01:08:12,922 --> 01:08:14,215
Look!

935
01:08:15,508 --> 01:08:18,636
North Korean combat planes are moving!

936
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:25,935
What did I tell you?

937
01:08:26,018 --> 01:08:28,562
They used this conversation
to take advantage of us!

938
01:08:29,563 --> 01:08:33,067
We gave North Korea time to attack us!

939
01:08:33,651 --> 01:08:35,361
No, we didn't.

940
01:08:35,444 --> 01:08:38,030
The combat planes are turning around.

941
01:08:39,073 --> 01:08:41,492
The fighter jets heading toward the MDL

942
01:08:41,575 --> 01:08:43,369
turned around and are going back!

943
01:08:50,626 --> 01:08:52,962
Okay, good. The North

944
01:08:53,462 --> 01:08:56,090
has lifted its combat readiness.

945
01:09:01,053 --> 01:09:03,139
President Park... Please.

946
01:09:03,305 --> 01:09:04,348
Right, of course.

947
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:16,193
These are the coordinates
to where the submarine drifted.

948
01:09:28,497 --> 01:09:29,540
Sir.

949
01:09:30,958 --> 01:09:33,961
Please lower our state to DEFCON 4.

950
01:09:46,223 --> 01:09:47,808
We are now at DEFCON 4.

951
01:09:48,559 --> 01:09:50,686
It's time to keep your promise.

952
01:09:56,150 --> 01:10:00,070
Will you remove the Sawagiri fleet
from Korean waters?

953
01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:46,700
It's just a cramp.

954
01:10:55,584 --> 01:10:58,921
SINUIJU

955
01:10:59,004 --> 01:11:03,217
PEACE AND PROSPERITY

956
01:11:12,476 --> 01:11:14,228
Is it being sent to NDFC?

957
01:11:14,812 --> 01:11:18,148
A photo or video of the explosion
would help,

958
01:11:18,232 --> 01:11:20,693
but I doubt there’s any.
Still, you never know.

959
01:11:20,776 --> 01:11:23,279
They could find a lead
in one of these devices.

960
01:11:24,154 --> 01:11:27,032
I don't know how much
forensics can recover, but still.

961
01:11:33,247 --> 01:11:36,000
Do we have consent
from all the victims' families?

962
01:11:37,084 --> 01:11:40,129
There are some from missing persons
who haven't been confirmed dead or alive.

963
01:11:54,351 --> 01:11:57,438
I'll wrap up things here
and send the evidence to NDFC.

964
01:11:57,771 --> 01:11:59,606
You should grab some breakfast.

965
01:12:01,608 --> 01:12:02,651
Are you sure?

966
01:12:04,153 --> 01:12:06,280
Let's go then. We'll see you later.

967
01:12:14,288 --> 01:12:15,914
CALLING JUN-O

968
01:12:45,861 --> 01:12:48,947
NA-GYEONG

969
01:12:51,742 --> 01:12:54,536
NA-GYEONG

970
01:13:04,213 --> 01:13:06,256
Wait, 880717.

971
01:13:06,382 --> 01:13:09,927
Happy birthday, dear Na-gyeong

972
01:13:10,594 --> 01:13:13,222
Happy birthday to you

973
01:13:20,104 --> 01:13:21,522
Then, 121225.

974
01:13:37,246 --> 01:13:38,831
Okay, 190330.

975
01:13:39,998 --> 01:13:41,458
Ta-da.

976
01:13:46,088 --> 01:13:47,798
WEDDING OF KIM JUN-O AND HAN NA-GYEONG

977
01:13:54,471 --> 01:13:56,723
Hey, 122937 Han Na-gyeong!

978
01:14:15,409 --> 01:14:17,453
Right, 122937.

979
01:14:25,002 --> 01:14:26,587
NA-GYEONG

980
01:14:26,670 --> 01:14:27,963
GOING TO THE SCENE. CALL ME.

981
01:14:56,658 --> 01:14:58,160
Right.

982
01:16:03,267 --> 01:16:05,769
You finally ended up in a hospital.

983
01:16:06,270 --> 01:16:07,271
Right.

984
01:16:08,272 --> 01:16:10,691
I don't know whether to be relieved
or worried,

985
01:16:11,441 --> 01:16:13,235
but you were treated in time,

986
01:16:13,819 --> 01:16:15,779
which prevented a cerebral infarction.

987
01:16:16,780 --> 01:16:21,118
You should take this opportunity
to rest for a few days.

988
01:16:22,119 --> 01:16:24,413
The doctor said
to avoid exhaustion and stress.

989
01:16:24,955 --> 01:16:26,873
It won't be possible at the Blue House.

990
01:16:27,457 --> 01:16:30,210
No, it won't be possible until I die.

991
01:16:31,420 --> 01:16:33,589
Why? What now?

992
01:16:34,172 --> 01:16:35,340
Secretary Han.

993
01:16:36,466 --> 01:16:37,467
Call President Park.

994
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:41,013
I need to see him.

995
01:16:46,184 --> 01:16:50,188
Thankfully, your theory
of the submarine sinking

996
01:16:50,939 --> 01:16:51,982
was right.

997
01:16:52,649 --> 01:16:53,900
Thank you.

998
01:16:55,319 --> 01:16:57,112
I never expected you

999
01:16:57,362 --> 01:17:00,407
to take my side
in front of Commander Bell.

1000
01:17:01,199 --> 01:17:04,911
Well, a greenhorn in politics
who has mostly worked

1001
01:17:05,704 --> 01:17:07,581
in academia his whole life

1002
01:17:08,206 --> 01:17:11,251
was about to compromise the alliance
between South Korea and the US.

1003
01:17:12,127 --> 01:17:13,962
I couldn't just sit back
and watch that happen.

1004
01:17:16,131 --> 01:17:18,759
The person in the most danger today
inside the bunker

1005
01:17:19,551 --> 01:17:22,346
wasn’t Commander Bell
or Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Lee.

1006
01:17:23,597 --> 01:17:24,723
Acting President

1007
01:17:25,932 --> 01:17:27,351
Park Mu-jin.

1008
01:17:28,185 --> 01:17:29,102
It was you.

1009
01:17:31,271 --> 01:17:32,481
What if

1010
01:17:32,564 --> 01:17:35,400
North Korea kept refusing
to answer the hotline?

1011
01:17:36,401 --> 01:17:38,070
What were you going to do?

1012
01:17:39,863 --> 01:17:41,823
Did you even think

1013
01:17:42,866 --> 01:17:44,701
of what could have happened?

1014
01:17:48,246 --> 01:17:51,875
That position doesn’t require someone
who will be a hero

1015
01:17:51,958 --> 01:17:53,835
and save the world by some fluke.

1016
01:17:57,547 --> 01:17:58,799
Do not assume

1017
01:17:59,925 --> 01:18:01,718
that luck is always on your side.

1018
01:18:02,928 --> 01:18:04,513
Today's the last day

1019
01:18:05,138 --> 01:18:07,057
that luck will be on your side.

1020
01:19:12,539 --> 01:19:14,583
TO ACTING PRESIDENT PARK MU-JIN

1021
01:19:14,666 --> 01:19:17,419
The Democratic People's Republic of Korea

1022
01:19:17,669 --> 01:19:20,756
has successfully rescued the entire crew

1023
01:19:20,839 --> 01:19:22,549
of the submarine.

1024
01:19:23,842 --> 01:19:27,554
The entire crew of 28 members have been

1025
01:19:27,637 --> 01:19:29,765
safely returned to their families.

1026
01:19:30,724 --> 01:19:35,353
As a fellow compatriot,
I send my deepest condolences

1027
01:19:36,188 --> 01:19:38,523
for your devastating tragedy.

1028
01:19:39,232 --> 01:19:41,860
THE DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF KOREA

1029
01:19:52,996 --> 01:19:53,997
Hello?

1030
01:19:54,414 --> 01:19:56,082
Si-jin's awake!

1031
01:19:56,166 --> 01:19:58,001
Her test results came back clean too.

1032
01:19:58,835 --> 01:20:00,420
You don't have to worry now.

1033
01:20:03,298 --> 01:20:04,382
Daddy.

1034
01:20:05,133 --> 01:20:07,135
Hey, Si-jin, is that you?

1035
01:20:07,469 --> 01:20:10,388
Daddy, do you have my hair tie?

1036
01:20:14,976 --> 01:20:15,977
Daddy?

1037
01:20:16,061 --> 01:20:17,896
Why aren't you answering me?

1038
01:20:20,357 --> 01:20:21,191
Yes.

1039
01:20:25,445 --> 01:20:26,571
Daddy?

1040
01:20:35,705 --> 01:20:37,791
Daddy, I miss you.

1041
01:20:40,627 --> 01:20:43,713
Okay, my baby...

1042
01:21:04,442 --> 01:21:05,610
Sir?

1043
01:21:08,405 --> 01:21:09,406
This...

1044
01:21:12,033 --> 01:21:13,034
Oh, right.

1045
01:21:14,953 --> 01:21:16,162
It's a better look.

1046
01:21:17,914 --> 01:21:18,915
Of course.

1047
01:21:48,486 --> 01:21:51,448
My fellow Koreans, hello.

1048
01:21:54,075 --> 01:21:55,577
I am Acting President

1049
01:21:56,536 --> 01:21:57,537
Park Mu-jin.

1050
01:22:17,140 --> 01:22:18,975
It's not that he never wanted power.

1051
01:22:19,059 --> 01:22:21,269
President Park just never had a chance.

1052
01:22:21,770 --> 01:22:24,814
Will you be the same
even after you witness

1053
01:22:24,940 --> 01:22:26,191
the world shifting by your word?

1054
01:22:26,274 --> 01:22:27,984
Power, you say?

1055
01:22:28,485 --> 01:22:30,528
That has nothing to do with me.

1056
01:22:30,612 --> 01:22:31,613
The bombers

1057
01:22:32,364 --> 01:22:34,991
detonated the bombs
using the building's internet cable lines.

1058
01:22:35,075 --> 01:22:38,286
There has been an act of violence
in the Bogil district.

1059
01:22:38,828 --> 01:22:41,289
I plan on fulfilling
my civic responsibility

1060
01:22:41,831 --> 01:22:44,501
