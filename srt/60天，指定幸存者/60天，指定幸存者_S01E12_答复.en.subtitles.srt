1
00:00:53,636 --> 00:01:00,602
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
PLACES AND EVENTS ARE FICTIONAL

2
00:01:42,101 --> 00:01:43,895
ACTING PRESIDENT
NOW A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE

3
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:45,939
ACTING PRESIDENT OH
TOP PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE

4
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:53,947
THE YOUTH HAVE BEEN WAITING
FOR A POLITICIAN LIKE THIS

5
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,335
DONGBUK DAILY, GUKIL NEWS

6
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:25,645
Minister Oh is pretty impressive.

7
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:31,192
He managed to fill
President Park's shoes in just one day.

8
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:32,569
And after that one day,

9
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,155
he's the favorite presidential candidate.

10
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,949
It's hard to believe
that he has never done this before.

11
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:41,119
Reopening the stock market
and gunning down the sniper

12
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:43,371
weren't easy decisions,
but he didn't hesitate at all.

13
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:47,417
He almost looked like a student
taking an exam with all the answers.

14
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,754
He naturally knows
how to charm the public.

15
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:55,300
Minister Oh is a natural-born politician.

16
00:02:58,803 --> 00:02:59,846
Are you implying

17
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:03,850
that you're giving up on President Park
as the presidential candidate?

18
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:09,606
Isn't he who you were looking for?
The one who knows how to win.

19
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:14,360
Minister Oh has a better chance
of winning than President Park.

20
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:25,580
It's only a temporary symptom.
You don't need to worry.

21
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:35,590
The Acting President...

22
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:38,927
I mean, Acting President Park
just regained consciousness.

23
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:42,639
I was worried as his doctor was concerned
about possible brain damage.

24
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:45,850
Thank god, right? Very soon, he'll be back
to his charming, intelligent self.

25
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:53,191
When can he return to work, then?

26
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:58,196
When do you think I can return to work?

27
00:03:59,113 --> 00:03:59,948
I'm not sure, sir.

28
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:03,159
You need absolute rest for now,

29
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:06,913
so I think we'll have to keep you here
and monitor you for about a week.

30
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:09,874
-Excuse me.
-Thank you.

31
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:20,593
Well, Ms. Jeong.

32
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:26,849
Does he have to return to the Blue House?

33
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:30,645
You know,

34
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:33,564
he's unable to perform his duties
at the moment

35
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:37,068
as described
in Article 71 of the Constitution.

36
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:42,740
And the Blue House already has
another Acting President.

37
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:45,535
Well, that's...

38
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:48,496
Then you should rest up

39
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:50,915
and register as a presidential candidate
right away, sir.

40
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:53,960
"A presidential candidate"?

41
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,338
As in, running for president?

42
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:58,339
Honey.

43
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,508
Can you

44
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:03,845
go talk to my doctor?

45
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,723
-What?
-Ask him if I can get some painkillers.

46
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:09,892
Are you in a lot of pain, sir?

47
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:13,938
On a scale of one to ten,

48
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:15,732
how would you rate your pain, sir?

49
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:17,567
Seven?

50
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:19,444
Mr. Park.

51
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:20,653
Yes, sir.

52
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,071
Would you accompany my wife?

53
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,866
Sure, no problem.

54
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:26,701
Oh, sir.

55
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:30,413
Here. I got your glasses.

56
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:34,584
There.

57
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:37,170
Let's go, ma'am.

58
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:38,588
Okay.

59
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,175
We'll be back shortly, sir.

60
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:01,944
I tried to dissuade Minister Oh
from gunning down the sniper

61
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:04,405
so that we could find out
who was behind him,

62
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:07,658
but he went ahead and gave the order
to shoot to kill.

63
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:10,995
What if...

64
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:15,875
he did that to conceal the mastermind
behind the assassination attempt?

65
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:21,214
Minister Oh has already garnered
overwhelming support from the people.

66
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:23,299
I'm worried about

67
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:25,343
what he'll do until you return

68
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:27,553
with all that confidence he has now.

69
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:31,891
But he isn't the only one

70
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:36,687
at the Blue House. The secretaries
are there to keep him in check.

71
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:38,523
And one of the secretaries...

72
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:41,651
colluded with the bombers.

73
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:46,197
The person who called
the Minister of National Defense...

74
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:48,908
I found out who it was, sir.

75
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:00,211
Are you the Minister of National Defense?

76
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,588
This is Secretary Cha Yeong-jin.

77
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:05,883
Please revoke Commander Lee Gwan-muk's
security clearance

78
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:09,637
for the file titled OP 5015-18.

79
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:23,568
DAY 37: ANSWER
EPISODE 12

80
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:34,245
Let me give you a word of advice.

81
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:37,165
If you're handed over
to the prosecution now,

82
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:40,751
being tight-lipped and exercising
your right to remain silent

83
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,421
as you're doing now
won't help you in any way.

84
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:46,799
The sniper was...

85
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,802
shot dead while he was being chased.

86
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:54,682
It means the only witness who could attest
to whether or not you're one of them

87
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:57,018
is now dead.

88
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:02,857
Conspiracy to kill Myung Hae-joon

89
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:05,318
and assassinate the Acting President.

90
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:08,821
On top of that, you'll continue
to exercise your right to remain silent?

91
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:13,075
That attitude will only increase
your sentence.

92
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:20,124
I'm thinking you'll probably
be sentenced to about 15 years.

93
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:26,797
Just admit it.

94
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:39,644
Let's do our best
to get your sentence mitigated, okay?

95
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:42,104
It'll be a waste

96
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:46,150
to spend the prime of your life in prison.

97
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,145
Where are you taking me?

98
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:25,231
This isn't the way
to the Prosecutors' Office.

99
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:39,620
Mr. President is waiting for you,
Agent Han.

100
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:58,431
NIS will be told that you're being held
in custody by the prosecution Services.

101
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:02,977
Agent Han, I heard that you've been
investigating this for some time.

102
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,229
Minister Oh Yeong-seok...

103
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,983
Is he really connected
with the mastermind behind the attack?

104
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:11,068
He knew about the attack in advance.

105
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:13,154
He evacuated to the air raid shelter

106
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:15,781
right before the explosion,
thus becoming the only survivor.

107
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:19,285
Would that have been possible
if he had no connection with the bombers?

108
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:26,584
Are you able to prove that, Agent Han?

109
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:29,337
I'm sorry, sir.

110
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:33,299
All the evidence we had gathered
were stolen by Tae-ik...

111
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:36,677
I mean, the sniper took them from us

112
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:38,554
on the day of the hearing.

113
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:44,685
They deleted all the videos of Minister Oh
evacuating to the air-raid shelter

114
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,604
on the day of the explosion.

115
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:51,275
I'm speculating that's why
Minister Oh unreasonably ordered

116
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:53,569
that the sniper be killed.

117
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:57,823
So you're saying it's impossible.

118
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:03,120
I'm letting you know that

119
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:05,081
I'll be starting again from scratch, sir.

120
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:14,882
The two of you are very much alike.

121
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:18,552
It'll be hard,

122
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:22,932
but you're talking as if
it's not a big deal at all,

123
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:24,975
just like Agent Kim Jun-o.

124
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:30,481
It's probably because

125
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:34,151
Agent Kim Jun-o was my mentor
and my role model

126
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:36,904
whom I emulated.

127
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,161
I have to say,

128
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:48,499
this position makes you utterly shameless.

129
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:52,753
It requires me to demand
the kinds of sacrifices

130
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:55,923
that I can never repay
as if it's not a big deal.

131
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:57,258
You are

132
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:01,387
also making a sacrifice, sir.

133
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,566
Then let's start...

134
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:17,903
with finding the accomplice
in the Blue House first.

135
00:12:24,743 --> 00:12:29,165
The North Korean defector, Myung Hae-joon,
admitted to executing the attack.

136
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:33,043
However, he was murdered by Tae-ik.

137
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:37,381
After Agent Kim Jun-o met
with President Park,

138
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:40,593
Tae-ik tried to assassinate
President Park.

139
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:43,971
And the person who gave the order
to gun Tae-ik down

140
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:47,475
was Minister Oh Yeong-seok.

141
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:53,230
Does that mean Oh Yeong-seok
is the mastermind behind the attack?

142
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:57,109
No, it isn't him.

143
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:59,320
Then who is it?

144
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:00,654
Jeez, you scared me.

145
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:04,033
Na-gyeong!

146
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:17,338
"Operation Plan 5015-18"?

147
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:26,639
Are you saying the person
who handed this OP file

148
00:13:27,806 --> 00:13:30,226
created by the NSC over to the bombers

149
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:32,561
is in the Blue House now?

150
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,898
One of the President's closest aides
with the authority

151
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:37,775
to revoke a security clearance
with one call.

152
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:42,613
And the only person
who knows about this file at the moment.

153
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:50,120
It's the best lead
to find the accomplice on the inside.

154
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,667
NAME: CHA YEONG-JIN

155
00:13:58,587 --> 00:13:59,505
Thank you.

156
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:01,757
We need your signature, Mr. Cha.

157
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,802
All internal communication recordings
have been restored.

158
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:08,973
You mean, the recordings had been damaged?

159
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:12,351
Yes. When the firewall breach occurred
last time,

160
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:15,271
all the communication recordings
were damaged.

161
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:18,732
Secretary Jeong Su-jeong
came by and checked.

162
00:14:18,857 --> 00:14:20,192
She didn't report it to you?

163
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:23,779
She asked for your call recordings,

164
00:14:23,862 --> 00:14:26,907
so I assumed
she had already reported it to you.

165
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:34,081
I don't think we should today.

166
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:35,875
Do you have work left?

167
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:37,710
Take your time. I'll wait.

168
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:39,837
No, don't wait. You can go.

169
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,921
I'm tired.

170
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:43,007
What brings you
to the Data Processing Office?

171
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,759
Secretary Jeong.

172
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:47,845
It's nothing important.

173
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:51,473
People say that President Park
benefited the most from this bombing,

174
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,475
and some say it's Minister Oh,

175
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:54,810
but they're wrong.

176
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,646
It's you.

177
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,273
Had it not been for the attack,

178
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:02,026
you wouldn't have even dreamed of a chance

179
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:04,570
to recreate the government

180
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,740
as none other than a kingmaker.

181
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:34,016
I wanted to bring President Park
some books to read at the hospital.

182
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:36,143
Why did you look up my call logs?

183
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:39,855
Are you suspecting me of something?

184
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:43,817
Answer me. Why?

185
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,946
Why me? For what reason...

186
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,869
Did President Park order you to do it?

187
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:58,457
Or was it something
that you did on your own?

188
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:00,668
Answer that first.

189
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:05,631
Will that change anything?

190
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:32,825
Apparently, the National Security Council
called a meeting.

191
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:34,785
Did you know about it?

192
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:40,457
How could there be an NSC meeting
without your knowledge?

193
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:03,856
You didn't hear
anything about this either?

194
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:05,190
No, nothing.

195
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:13,574
You cannot go in, sir.

196
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:19,747
I'm Minister Oh Yeong-seok's
chief secretary.

197
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:24,710
I'm the National Security Adviser,
and he's the Chief Secretary.

198
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:27,421
We're members of the NSC as well.

199
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:29,590
Why can't we go in?

200
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:31,925
We apologize, sir.

201
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:34,386
We're simply following
the Acting President's orders.

202
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:38,474
Gosh, this is... I'm speechless.

203
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:42,019
You didn't know at all either?

204
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:45,230
Jeez, what is going on?

205
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:51,320
All right. Shall we begin, then?

206
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:56,200
It's not like North Korea did anything
to provoke us.

207
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:59,703
Why hold an NSC meeting

208
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:03,165
and exclude the Blue House staff?

209
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,086
What the heck are they trying to do?

210
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,923
Find out who from the military and NIS
are at the meeting.

211
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:12,674
-Got it. I'll call you.
-Great.

212
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:13,759
Okay.

213
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:21,892
What brings you here?

214
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:28,148
Secretary Cha.
May I talk to you for a minute?

215
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:29,608
What's the matter?

216
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:32,736
You're now the subject
of the Security Team's investigation

217
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,446
according to the security regulations.

218
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,548
I'm Agent Han Na-gyeong
of the NIS Terrorism Task Force.

219
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:58,220
Agent Han, why are you here?

220
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,473
She was commissioned by President Park
to lead the investigation

221
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:04,518
-to find out who was behind the bombing.
-"Behind the bombing"?

222
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:32,171
How long will it take?

223
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:35,632
The Blue House's
security situation is volatile.

224
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:37,426
There's no time to waste--

225
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:39,428
And this is about national security.

226
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:46,935
A co-conspirator of the bombing
is in the Blue House.

227
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,604
That's nonsense.

228
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:53,066
Are you the Minister of National Defense?

229
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:55,527
This is Secretary Cha Yeong-jin.

230
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:59,031
Please revoke Commander Lee Gwan-muk's
security clearance

231
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:02,826
for the file titled OP 5015-18.

232
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,206
That was you, right?

233
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:08,957
Is there a problem with that?

234
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,211
I was just doing my job as a secretary.

235
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:25,307
Is this a re-enactment of the bombing?

236
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,433
What is this?

237
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:33,357
OP 5015-18.

238
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:36,485
This is the file

239
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:38,779
for which you revoked
the security clearance

240
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:41,531
of Commander Lee Gwan-muk in June of 2018.

241
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:43,825
And on March 4,

242
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,328
there was a bombing
at the National Assembly building.

243
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:48,538
Exactly as it provides in this file.

244
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,416
All NSC members who participated

245
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,919
in the top-secret project
were lost in the attack,

246
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:57,214
and Commander Lee Gwan-muk
had lost access to the file.

247
00:20:58,298 --> 00:21:00,717
The only person who knows
about the existence of the file--

248
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:03,637
I also had no access to the file.

249
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:05,806
Back then, I was only
a grade-three administrator.

250
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:08,767
-Then why--
-I called the Minister of National Defense

251
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:11,728
because I had to pass on the work orders
from higher up.

252
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:12,813
And who was that?

253
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:23,657
Han Ju-seung, the Chief
Presidential Secretary at the time.

254
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:32,708
Shouldn't you join the NSC meeting?
Better late than never.

255
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,502
We need to know what's going on.

256
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:38,088
We tried to figure it out
using our military and NIS connections,

257
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,465
but we have no clue.

258
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:44,636
I'm not even the Chief Secretary.
I'm not qualified to join the NSC.

259
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,513
You should go.

260
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,891
I'm sure Minister Oh will listen to you.

261
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,268
You're the most senior here.

262
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:54,021
Let's wait. I'm sure we'll find out
once the meeting is over.

263
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:56,231
-Mr. Han.
-Mr. Han.

264
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:00,944
Minister Oh

265
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:04,031
is the head of our administration
by law for now.

266
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:08,952
It's not right to disregard
the regulations

267
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:10,871
and the system.

268
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:20,339
However,

269
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:25,594
Mr. Han wouldn't know
the contents of this file either.

270
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:27,721
Why is that?

271
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:30,015
On the day the top-secret file
was completed,

272
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:33,060
Mr. Han was visiting the States
for the coordination

273
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:35,645
with the White House
before the inter-Korean Summit.

274
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:38,315
Top-secret files are available

275
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:41,151
only in the Blue House,
due to security reasons.

276
00:22:41,234 --> 00:22:42,819
Then after he came back--

277
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:45,906
When he got back,
this file didn't exist anymore.

278
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:49,076
It was the President's order.

279
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:53,413
He ordered that we collect all the files
and dispose of them

280
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:54,831
on the day they were completed.

281
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:57,834
"Dispose of them"?

282
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:01,963
Now I see why he ordered that.

283
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:06,426
The mere existence of the simulation

284
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:09,471
can be a great threat
to national security.

285
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:17,771
In the end,

286
00:23:18,855 --> 00:23:21,149
what the President feared came true.

287
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:32,702
HAN JU-SEUNG?

288
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:52,222
I got this from the Immigration Office.

289
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:55,809
Secretary Han left Korea on June 18, 2018

290
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:57,769
and came back on the 21st.

291
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:05,443
Here's President Yang's orders
to the Secretary

292
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:08,780
to dispose of the NSC top-secret project.

293
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:11,616
DELETE NSC'S TOP-SECRET FILE 5015-18

294
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,203
SEAL OF THE PRESIDENT

295
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:19,166
Mr. Cha told the truth.

296
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:43,690
Suspicions toward you have been confirmed
to be unfounded.

297
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:45,775
You may go now.

298
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:47,736
I will escort you.

299
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:57,454
Let me ask you one thing.

300
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:04,669
So...

301
00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:08,590
President Park thinks

302
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:12,552
I might be the mole

303
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:16,223
who handed over the classified file

304
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:20,060
to the bombers, is that it?

305
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,480
I...

306
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:25,857
don't trust myself.

307
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,318
So...

308
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:32,322
I have been relying
only on whatever the data says.

309
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:37,827
For now, all the data

310
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:42,958
indicates that Mr. Cha is the accomplice
to the bombing.

311
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,045
But even now,

312
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:49,965
I must want

313
00:25:51,132 --> 00:25:53,218
to trust Mr. Cha rather than the data.

314
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:01,559
Could you please clear up the suspicions

315
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:03,770
surrounding Mr. Cha,

316
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:05,522
Agent Han?

317
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:10,110
If he had suspected you as the traitor,

318
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:14,406
he would have had you
relieved of your duties first.

319
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:45,979
Are you here to visit the President?

320
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,273
He just fell asleep.

321
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:49,649
He did?

322
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:56,823
Agent Han...

323
00:26:58,700 --> 00:26:59,743
updated me.

324
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:03,830
Okay.

325
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:15,925
Well.

326
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:19,929
Look.

327
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:22,807
I would have done the same.

328
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:28,271
You just did what you had to do.

329
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:29,606
It was your duty.

330
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:31,691
So

331
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:35,028
you don't have to look at me
like I'm your teacher

332
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:36,738
making you write an apology.

333
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:39,616
I don't intend to give you demerits.

334
00:27:40,658 --> 00:27:41,826
Even so,

335
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:44,746
I guess we will never grab a beer...

336
00:27:47,874 --> 00:27:48,833
in Gwanghwamun.

337
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:34,087
Who could it be?

338
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:35,755
Who's the mole in the Blue House?

339
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:42,512
Who relayed this top secret file
to the bomber?

340
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:56,943
When a nation is going through a crisis,

341
00:28:57,485 --> 00:28:58,778
there's no other way.

342
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:01,448
The military should lead.

343
00:29:02,031 --> 00:29:05,243
To have a former member
of our own military in this position

344
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:07,412
gives me much relief.

345
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:10,039
There is still

346
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:12,041
no Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman,

347
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,210
so report to me for the time being.

348
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:17,130
Is that an order?

349
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:19,966
My good man, of course not.

350
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:22,844
All members of the military
have the same purpose.

351
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:25,472
You said so seven years ago as well.

352
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:27,223
Seven years ago?

353
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:30,059
During the Battle of Baengnyeong,

354
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:33,438
the Joint Chiefs of Staff
and operations command

355
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:36,024
ordered an army-centric military operation

356
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:38,359
which resulted in many casualties.

357
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:42,655
You, who were in charge
of the operation at the time,

358
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:45,366
said the exact same thing.

359
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:50,538
The army, navy, and air force are the same
when it comes to defending this nation.

360
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:53,458
-Minister Oh--
-Someone told me

361
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:55,877
that authority

362
00:29:56,878 --> 00:30:01,049
gives you the power to not take orders
from the person you loathe.

363
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:04,677
That was why

364
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:06,971
I left the navy immediately thereafter.

365
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:11,017
I put down the guns
and worked to gain power instead.

366
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:20,026
Don't ever give me an order again.

367
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:39,379
What were you talking about
so affectionately all this time?

368
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:43,049
The obvious.

369
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:46,344
He asked me for
future guidance and advice.

370
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:11,452
EAST ASIA MILITARY BASES

371
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:34,517
Have the reporters said anything?

372
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:37,645
Did any rumors start flying
after the NSC meeting yesterday?

373
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:39,188
Not really.

374
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:44,152
I can't ask any of them

375
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:46,446
since they might write
about how the Blue House

376
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:48,615
has inadequate communication.

377
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:52,493
What on earth
did they talk about here yesterday?

378
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:59,417
Yeong-jin, did you hear?

379
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:02,587
I found out

380
00:32:02,962 --> 00:32:05,298
why the NSC meeting was held yesterday.

381
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:11,971
The Gasan Island Naval Base.

382
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:15,099
While President Yang was in office,
the naval base was constructed

383
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:17,352
because it was a favorable location
for a naval port.

384
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:21,230
In preparation for China and Japan's
recent expansion of maritime power,

385
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:24,525
there were talks about expanding the base,

386
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:27,779
but it is being delayed due to opposition
from the residents and environmentalists.

387
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:31,824
I propose

388
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:35,119
that we finally move forward
with the expansion.

389
00:32:39,248 --> 00:32:42,210
The groundbreaking ceremony
took place this morning with the

390
00:32:42,877 --> 00:32:46,255
Ministry of National Defense, Navy
Headquarters and the construction company.

391
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:49,258
-What about the residents there?
-Of course they were livid.

392
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:51,928
Over 300 people gathered

393
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:54,764
to protest against the expansion.

394
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,850
The police had to use force

395
00:32:58,851 --> 00:33:01,562
which resulted in
many receiving major injuries.

396
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:06,526
-Yeong-jin!
-Mr. Cha!

397
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:18,037
May I help you, Secretary Cha?

398
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:30,717
Mr. Cha, come on in.

399
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:38,599
Secretary Cha?

400
00:33:42,311 --> 00:33:43,980
I only realized it just now

401
00:33:45,773 --> 00:33:48,693
that President Park never once
sat in that chair.

402
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:56,409
I doubt you came all this way
to tell me that great realization.

403
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:58,578
Right. Well...

404
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:01,205
Why did you order

405
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:03,458
the groundbreaking ceremony
of the naval base expansion

406
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:05,126
without a word to the secretaries?

407
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:07,545
During President Yang's regime,

408
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:09,589
the Naval Headquarters and the residents

409
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:11,799
already signed a legal agreement
on the matter,

410
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:14,135
so what's the issue?

411
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:17,722
Due to opposition from the residents
and environmentalists,

412
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:21,017
the project was stopped temporarily.

413
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:24,395
President Yang was going
to hold a public hearing to discuss

414
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:26,230
-and persuade--
-So?

415
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:30,401
Did discussions and persuasion
accomplish anything?

416
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:38,409
National security

417
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:41,537
must be what the community values the most

418
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:43,247
above anything else.

419
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:45,625
I am currently
this nation's Commander-in-Chief

420
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:48,586
and I did what was necessary
as head of the administration

421
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:51,464
in the fastest and most effective way.

422
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:54,300
Also,

423
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:57,595
you report to me,
not the other way around.

424
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:00,807
Right.

425
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:04,894
Where did you go

426
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:06,979
after leaving the Blue House yesterday?

427
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,908
As Chief Presidential Secretary,

428
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:21,077
I expect you

429
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:23,412
to fully carry out your responsibility.

430
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:25,164
Understood, Secretary Cha?

431
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:28,668
Yes, sir.

432
00:35:29,752 --> 00:35:30,878
I apologize.

433
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,935
Seeing you like this

434
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:48,980
may be too shocking for Si-wan and Si-jin,

435
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:51,691
so I told them not to come.

436
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:56,571
They must feel betrayed.

437
00:35:57,697 --> 00:35:59,448
I wouldn't go that far.

438
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:02,702
I'm sure they're just worried.

439
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:07,790
Since the tenth,
the people of Gasan Island...

440
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:10,918
The residents of Gasan Island
must feel betrayed.

441
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:14,630
They were promised a public hearing
to hear their thoughts,

442
00:36:15,923 --> 00:36:18,134
so they must think the government lied.

443
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:22,847
They could've negotiated
and reached an agreement,

444
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:26,809
but the Blue House
kicked away that opportunity.

445
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:30,938
What are your thoughts on this?

446
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:33,482
He was right.

447
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:36,485
It's true.

448
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:42,408
Are you really considering
running for President?

449
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:45,161
Me?

450
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:48,164
You might be here physically,

451
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:50,791
but your mind is in your office
at the Blue House.

452
00:36:57,381 --> 00:37:00,468
You almost died when you were
just the Acting President,

453
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:03,221
but you want to become President?

454
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:08,017
Aren't you terrified?

455
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:10,561
Of course I am.

456
00:37:14,106 --> 00:37:15,441
That's why

457
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:18,486
you don't have to worry about that.

458
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:30,915
The expansion of
the Gasan Island Naval Base...

459
00:37:30,998 --> 00:37:34,043
And that concludes
this morning's briefing.

460
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:39,799
Mr. Kim?

461
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:42,468
Why was the groundbreaking ceremony of

462
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:44,512
the naval base expansion
rushed out of the blue?

463
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:45,846
It wasn't rushed.

464
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:48,432
"Promptly" is a much nicer way to put it.

465
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:50,977
Details regarding this matter
will be provided

466
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,770
in a press release.

467
00:37:52,853 --> 00:37:55,606
Is it because Minister Oh
was formerly in the navy?

468
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,525
Why was there need

469
00:37:57,608 --> 00:38:00,611
to use excessive force
in order to break up the protest?

470
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:03,739
The fact that Gasan Island
is a conservation area

471
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:05,324
hasn't changed.

472
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:08,369
How will the administration handle
the backlash from environmentalists?

473
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:11,163
When will President Park
be back in office?

474
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:12,915
What are his thoughts on this matter?

475
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:15,751
Did he also take part
in making this decision?

476
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:19,630
Answer them one by one. We've got all day.

477
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:23,301
I noted them all.

478
00:38:24,176 --> 00:38:25,177
Right.

479
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:29,390
What do you think
is Minister Oh's intention?

480
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:31,600
Why are you thinking about that?

481
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:32,935
It's pretty obvious.

482
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:37,315
He's making his own brand.

483
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:41,986
"I, Oh Yeong-seok, was able
to do what President Yang couldn't

484
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:46,991
while showing formidable charisma
which President Park lacks."

485
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:51,287
Mayor Kang?

486
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:54,040
After announcing your candidacy,

487
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:58,252
your first official act
was to formally visit Assemblywoman Yun.

488
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,546
May I ask why?

489
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:05,384
Hostility between the ruling and
opposing parties is a thing of the past.

490
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:08,763
Our people have been
desperately demanding harmony,

491
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:12,475
and it's now our turn to meet that demand.

492
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:17,313
Like this.

493
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:18,397
There.

494
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:28,324
The naval base expansion
won't be a problem only in Gasan Island.

495
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:32,078
Environmental groups across the nation
will throw a fit.

496
00:39:32,995 --> 00:39:35,206
Minister Oh won't be able to handle it.

497
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:37,833
He'll finally realize

498
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:39,960
that what he thought was a jar of honey

499
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:41,754
was actually a beehive.

500
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:46,050
After he loses all the supporters
he gained.

501
00:40:12,284 --> 00:40:15,121
So you were at the Blue House after all.

502
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:19,291
I must have done something to upset you.

503
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:22,211
The naval base on Gasan Island.

504
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:25,631
The groundbreaking ceremony
was rushed out of the blue,

505
00:40:26,173 --> 00:40:28,634
and the police used excessive force

506
00:40:28,717 --> 00:40:30,719
in order to suppress the protesters.

507
00:40:32,346 --> 00:40:33,764
It never once happened

508
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:36,267
while you were here in the Blue House

509
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:40,312
during President Yang's
and President Park's regime.

510
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:44,316
Procedural democracy
and democratic legitimacy.

511
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:49,488
Aren't those what you value the most
as a politician?

512
00:40:50,322 --> 00:40:51,157
This way, ma'am.

513
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:53,701
Hold on.

514
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:57,538
Did this happen without your knowledge?

515
00:40:58,581 --> 00:41:00,499
Did Minister Oh make the decision alone?

516
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:03,919
None of this changes
anything for you though.

517
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:08,048
Whether it's President Yang,
Acting President Park,

518
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:09,508
or Minister Oh,

519
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:12,928
you'll oppose anyone
sitting in that chair.

520
00:41:16,098 --> 00:41:17,725
Keeping one's authority in check

521
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:20,603
is what I value most as a politician.

522
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:25,941
Minister Oh is waiting for you, ma'am.

523
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:34,700
I didn't expect to see you
in the Blue House so soon.

524
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:35,993
Please have a seat.

525
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:37,536
Conflicts are rising.

526
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:42,208
The naval base expansion should've
been a project for the next president,

527
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:46,128
so many are wondering
why you carried it out at this time.

528
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:51,550
Is it because you used to be in the navy?

529
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:54,345
Or did you expect to win over

530
00:41:54,428 --> 00:41:56,096
the people of that region

531
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,307
by boosting the economy by creating jobs?

532
00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:02,436
I only did what was necessary
for national security

533
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:04,939
since I'm in a position to.

534
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:09,443
What are you hiding this time
behind that justification?

535
00:42:12,154 --> 00:42:14,865
Everyone predicted
that the stock market would crash,

536
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:16,534
but you opened the market saying

537
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:20,871
that we needed to show
we're confident in our market.

538
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:24,250
The stock market tumbled as predicted

539
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:26,669
and only Sim Yong-hwan of Naseong Group
benefited from it.

540
00:42:27,419 --> 00:42:29,171
He was able to solve the succession issue

541
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:31,757
by buying Naseong Chemical's stocks
at a low price.

542
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:35,344
So what is it this time?

543
00:42:36,178 --> 00:42:37,638
What's your hidden agenda

544
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:40,349
behind that patriotic
justification of yours?

545
00:42:45,312 --> 00:42:47,565
You can't fool me, Minister Oh.

546
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:49,692
Fine then.

547
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:51,777
Give it a guess.

548
00:42:52,861 --> 00:42:54,446
What do you think I'm hiding?

549
00:42:55,489 --> 00:42:58,659
Whatever it is,
you won't get what you want.

550
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:03,372
I'm sure you're aware of this,

551
00:43:03,455 --> 00:43:06,000
but Gasan Island has favored
my party for a long time.

552
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:09,503
From the governor and Assemblymen
to local government leaders,

553
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:11,547
the majority in office are from Seonjin.

554
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:14,592
I will shake public opinion

555
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:18,053
with the help of the residents
and environmental groups.

556
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:21,140
From administrative litigation
to constitutional petitions,

557
00:43:21,223 --> 00:43:23,017
I will do whatever I can

558
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:25,561
to oppose the naval base expansion, no,

559
00:43:26,061 --> 00:43:28,814
whatever scheme you're concocting.

560
00:43:28,897 --> 00:43:29,857
No,

561
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:35,487
you won't be able to.

562
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:41,285
Hello, this is Kim Dan
with the afternoon news.

563
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:47,041
Protests from the people of Gasan Island

564
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:50,544
as well as environmental groups
have been quickly spreading...

565
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:52,504
Quickly spreading...

566
00:43:52,921 --> 00:43:55,007
Boss, the report has been revised.

567
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:56,717
Why? What happened?

568
00:43:56,967 --> 00:43:59,386
The residents of Gasan Island
who were against the expansion

569
00:43:59,511 --> 00:44:01,513
have been starting to approve it.

570
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:05,309
How could they change their stance

571
00:44:05,392 --> 00:44:06,268
in such a short time?

572
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:08,771
It's because they're human.

573
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:20,991
The Ministry of National Defense
and the construction company

574
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:23,369
offered the residents
a stupendous compensation.

575
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:26,955
Not just the area around the naval base,

576
00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:29,792
but the entire Gasan Island
will be a battlefield now.

577
00:44:30,709 --> 00:44:32,169
Think about it.

578
00:44:33,045 --> 00:44:35,464
Up until this morning, the residents

579
00:44:35,547 --> 00:44:37,257
were all on the same side.

580
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:39,343
But the additional compensation

581
00:44:40,135 --> 00:44:41,261
made them

582
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:44,723
either a traitor or a dormant traitor.

583
00:44:44,807 --> 00:44:45,683
Right.

584
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:50,312
Their hatred toward the navy and police

585
00:44:50,396 --> 00:44:52,106
will now be directed at each other.

586
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:56,568
There will now be no need for the police
to forcibly suppress protests.

587
00:44:57,694 --> 00:44:59,196
What about other environmental groups?

588
00:44:59,279 --> 00:45:01,323
If they're still against the expansion,

589
00:45:01,407 --> 00:45:03,158
it could lead to a big conflict.

590
00:45:07,162 --> 00:45:10,207
I highly doubt there will be
any objection to a national scale.

591
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:12,751
Take a look.

592
00:45:13,627 --> 00:45:14,795
WAS COMPENSATION THE ANSWER?

593
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:17,589
Comments on online communities,
social media,

594
00:45:17,798 --> 00:45:20,551
and web portal sites were already

595
00:45:21,009 --> 00:45:22,761
moving in a weird direction.

596
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:26,765
Weird direction, as in hate comments?

597
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:29,143
Are people accusing them of nimbyism?

598
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:33,313
No, ideological disputes.

599
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:39,695
IT'S BECAUSE YANG JIN-MAN
DIDN'T STOP PRO-COMMUNISTS

600
00:45:39,778 --> 00:45:41,071
THANK GOD FOR ACTING PRESIDENT OH

601
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:42,448
NOT PUNISHING COMMIES...

602
00:45:42,531 --> 00:45:45,784
THOSE IN MYEONGIN-RI
ARE RUINING THIS NATION

603
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:52,458
THOSE OPPOSING ARE COMMIES

604
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:53,500
NOT PUNISHING COMMIES...

605
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:54,668
THOSE IN MYEONGIN-RI...

606
00:45:59,882 --> 00:46:01,258
OPPOSING THE NAVAL BASE...

607
00:46:01,341 --> 00:46:02,926
COMMIES, LEAVE GASAN ISLAND!

608
00:46:04,511 --> 00:46:08,307
The public will now call on those
who are opposed to the expansion

609
00:46:08,807 --> 00:46:11,643
commies impeding national security

610
00:46:12,227 --> 00:46:15,564
who only want what's best for North Korea.

611
00:46:17,983 --> 00:46:19,860
Will you still oppose it regardless?

612
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:24,990
Do you believe people of this nation will
question my views on national security?

613
00:46:25,073 --> 00:46:27,451
If you're up against me, then yes.

614
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:31,580
The nation's hero who shed blood
to secure the NLL.

615
00:46:31,663 --> 00:46:35,334
The miracle survivor who still stands
after the nation's most tragic bombing.

616
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,045
Between you and me,

617
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:43,592
who do you think the people will believe?

618
00:46:56,688 --> 00:46:57,523
Ma'am.

619
00:46:57,606 --> 00:46:59,191
Mr. Cha,

620
00:47:00,859 --> 00:47:03,111
how much do you know about Minister Oh?

621
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:06,782
Sorry?

622
00:47:07,407 --> 00:47:08,450
Be careful.

623
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:10,994
He's much more dangerous

624
00:47:11,745 --> 00:47:13,330
than you can possibly imagine.

625
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:32,474
I heard that the residents of Gasan
are quickly changing their opinions.

626
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:34,560
It's just as I predicted.

627
00:47:35,477 --> 00:47:39,064
Your approval rating
is also at its highest.

628
00:47:39,898 --> 00:47:41,024
That's as expected too.

629
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:43,277
From this day on,

630
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,529
the people of Gasan
will hate and suspect each other.

631
00:47:45,612 --> 00:47:47,823
They'll ask whomever they meet
which side they're on

632
00:47:47,906 --> 00:47:49,616
and force them to answer.

633
00:47:49,908 --> 00:47:52,536
The larger navy base
was at the expense of their hometown.

634
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:54,663
Was this also something you predicted?

635
00:47:54,746 --> 00:47:56,873
We needed a larger navy base,

636
00:47:56,957 --> 00:47:59,543
and I chose the quickest
and most effective way.

637
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:01,670
The best outcome for you

638
00:48:01,753 --> 00:48:04,464
has become the worst
for the people of Gasan Island.

639
00:48:05,632 --> 00:48:07,009
Without the process in politics,

640
00:48:07,092 --> 00:48:09,886
it just becomes abuse with the help
of the law and system like now!

641
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:27,321
The law and system are always abusive

642
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:29,197
to those that are against the nation.

643
00:48:32,951 --> 00:48:34,328
Without that power,

644
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:36,496
governing is impossible.

645
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:39,541
Also,

646
00:48:40,542 --> 00:48:43,086
the law and system

647
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:46,173
has appointed one person
to government administration,

648
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:49,426
which is me, not you, Secretary Cha.

649
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:52,262
I've learned something
after meeting you, sir.

650
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:56,183
President Park...

651
00:48:56,975 --> 00:49:00,187
was someone who knew
to fear this position.

652
00:49:00,562 --> 00:49:01,688
That...

653
00:49:02,314 --> 00:49:05,484
is the reason I can trust him.

654
00:49:07,235 --> 00:49:08,945
While you are at the Blue House,

655
00:49:11,239 --> 00:49:14,701
I will do my best to carry out my duties
as Chief Presidential Secretary

656
00:49:15,243 --> 00:49:18,080
to make sure nothing like this
happens again.

657
00:49:19,081 --> 00:49:20,248
Good day, sir.

658
00:49:36,264 --> 00:49:38,517
You should've done better
in the first place.

659
00:49:52,364 --> 00:49:53,782
It was the President's order.

660
00:49:53,865 --> 00:49:56,451
He ordered that we collect all the files
and dispose of them

661
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:57,911
on the day they were completed.

662
00:49:58,995 --> 00:50:00,247
Ji-won.

663
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:05,544
If all the files were collected
and disposed of,

664
00:50:06,169 --> 00:50:10,132
doesn't that mean there is
a digital footprint of the disposal?

665
00:50:11,216 --> 00:50:14,428
It would be possible at a place
where classified information was shared.

666
00:50:21,727 --> 00:50:22,728
Damn it.

667
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:39,578
I'll start with the files transmitted
on June 20, 2018.

668
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:44,040
Who keeps the meeting minutes

669
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:46,042
during an NSC security meeting?

670
00:50:47,085 --> 00:50:48,920
The head of the Crisis Management Center.

671
00:50:49,004 --> 00:50:51,590
He also records everything
that happens in the bunker...

672
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:53,717
and manages it.

673
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:56,178
That means although
he isn't part of the NSC,

674
00:50:56,261 --> 00:50:59,139
he can see all the information
the NSC possesses,

675
00:50:59,639 --> 00:51:01,767
as well as what occurs at their meetings.

676
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:07,647
There was one more person that knew

677
00:51:07,856 --> 00:51:09,024
about the top secret file.

678
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:46,937
The naval base on Gasan Island
will now be built without problems.

679
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:50,982
Once the naval base is completed,

680
00:51:51,066 --> 00:51:54,152
the U.S. will have a Northeast Asian base

681
00:51:54,903 --> 00:51:56,988
for the Aegis to come and go freely.

682
00:52:03,995 --> 00:52:06,164
With the expansion
of the Northeast Asian base,

683
00:52:06,248 --> 00:52:08,583
the ROK-US alliance will become
even stronger.

684
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:27,602
NORTHEAST ASIAN MILITARY BASE INFORMATION

685
00:52:31,523 --> 00:52:34,109
NORTHEAST ASIAN MILITARY BASE INFORMATION

686
00:52:36,444 --> 00:52:38,029
You plan to go this late at night?

687
00:52:38,446 --> 00:52:40,323
The naval base matter
has been decided already.

688
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:42,200
What difference will
going at this hour make?

689
00:52:42,284 --> 00:52:43,952
-Na-gyeong.
-It isn't about the naval base.

690
00:52:44,035 --> 00:52:45,203
Then what?

691
00:52:46,538 --> 00:52:47,372
I get it.

692
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:50,417
I finally understand

693
00:52:51,376 --> 00:52:52,836
the reason for the bombing.

694
00:53:08,935 --> 00:53:12,063
The expansion of the naval base
on Gasan Island

695
00:53:12,147 --> 00:53:14,983
will proceed as Minister Oh wanted.

696
00:53:27,996 --> 00:53:29,915
It's Agent Han, sir.

697
00:53:30,498 --> 00:53:32,334
I have something to tell you, sir.

698
00:53:44,137 --> 00:53:46,306
That means I should leave, right?

699
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:50,185
I'll let you talk.

700
00:53:56,691 --> 00:53:57,859
What is it?

701
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:00,111
Seeing that you came this late,

702
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:03,073
it must be something serious, right?

703
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:09,454
Ms. Choe,

704
00:54:09,537 --> 00:54:11,039
would you like to get some rest?

705
00:54:11,957 --> 00:54:14,209
No, I'm fine.

706
00:54:14,292 --> 00:54:16,628
You look tired.

707
00:54:22,842 --> 00:54:24,386
I must be worried.

708
00:54:25,595 --> 00:54:26,638
Excuse me?

709
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:29,265
I'm worried...

710
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:33,770
he might muster up the courage.

711
00:54:37,315 --> 00:54:38,608
There was a reason

712
00:54:38,692 --> 00:54:41,194
Minister Oh rushed the groundbreaking
ceremony for the naval base.

713
00:54:41,695 --> 00:54:45,281
If the US uses Gasan Island
as its Northeast Asian base,

714
00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:46,783
not only North Korea,

715
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:49,411
but also China will be in an uproar.

716
00:54:49,536 --> 00:54:50,745
The Korean Peninsula

717
00:54:51,705 --> 00:54:55,083
will become the center
of military conflict in Northeast Asia.

718
00:54:59,045 --> 00:55:00,130
This could mean...

719
00:55:01,715 --> 00:55:03,883
that the peace treaty

720
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:05,802
President Yang was working on

721
00:55:07,178 --> 00:55:08,888
will never come true.

722
00:55:12,934 --> 00:55:15,270
President Park, that may be

723
00:55:15,729 --> 00:55:18,606
what the bombers wanted to achieve.

724
00:55:20,775 --> 00:55:23,236
They want to take Korea
and the Korean Peninsula

725
00:55:23,319 --> 00:55:25,488
back to before the peace treaty.

726
00:55:27,532 --> 00:55:29,951
The bombing occurred
right before the peace treaty signing,

727
00:55:30,035 --> 00:55:31,995
and they made Myung Hae-joon
confess to it,

728
00:55:32,078 --> 00:55:34,205
making it look
like North Korea was responsible.

729
00:55:34,414 --> 00:55:36,833
Now, they're expanding
their naval base on Gasan Island.

730
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:40,545
Their objective was clear

731
00:55:41,129 --> 00:55:42,756
and precise from the start.

732
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:46,551
They're bringing

733
00:55:47,969 --> 00:55:50,305
a new Cold War system
to the Korean Peninsula.

734
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:56,895
And?

735
00:55:58,063 --> 00:55:59,981
What do they get out of it?

736
00:56:01,399 --> 00:56:02,400
Fear.

737
00:56:03,109 --> 00:56:04,903
We inculcate fear,

738
00:56:04,986 --> 00:56:06,946
so no one can defy us.

739
00:56:08,448 --> 00:56:10,450
In this divided nation,

740
00:56:10,825 --> 00:56:14,245
ideological disputes
are still the best cure

741
00:56:15,246 --> 00:56:17,290
to shut up the troublesome people.

742
00:56:18,958 --> 00:56:21,836
You saw what happened
with Myungin Naval Base.

743
00:56:22,754 --> 00:56:24,756
Only after an ideological dispute began

744
00:56:24,839 --> 00:56:26,966
was it easily settled.

745
00:56:27,675 --> 00:56:30,178
We cut the people of the island off
from the rest of the nation,

746
00:56:30,678 --> 00:56:33,765
and had them become
suspicious of one another.

747
00:56:34,682 --> 00:56:36,518
It doesn't matter

748
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:38,728
where the conflicts began.

749
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:40,772
"Whose side are you on?"

750
00:56:41,481 --> 00:56:42,941
They just need to take sides.

751
00:56:51,908 --> 00:56:53,618
If it's that effective,

752
00:56:53,701 --> 00:56:56,121
we'll have to continue using it
for a long time.

753
00:56:56,204 --> 00:56:57,580
That's patriotism.

754
00:56:58,164 --> 00:56:59,415
The VIP

755
00:57:00,041 --> 00:57:01,918
thinks so as well.

756
00:57:04,838 --> 00:57:06,297
Minister Oh

757
00:57:06,881 --> 00:57:08,216
is a presidential candidate

758
00:57:08,299 --> 00:57:11,261
that was designed meticulously
from the beginning...

759
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:15,473
in order to create a country
the bombers want.

760
00:57:22,897 --> 00:57:26,025
-Hold the bottom.
-Move slowly.

761
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:27,610
Until the day the Republic of Korea

762
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:30,238
becomes so strong that no one
will dare mistreat our country...

763
00:57:35,493 --> 00:57:36,703
-No!
-It's a gun!

764
00:57:36,786 --> 00:57:39,205
-Get down!
-Watch out!

765
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:42,834
We will never condone
any threat to the safety

766
00:57:42,917 --> 00:57:45,378
or lives of our people.

767
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:48,715
And just as they planned,

768
00:57:49,382 --> 00:57:51,968
he's become the most favored
presidential candidate.

769
00:57:53,511 --> 00:57:56,973
He might really become the next President
at this rate.

770
00:58:03,646 --> 00:58:05,523
That's why Secretary Cha

771
00:58:06,274 --> 00:58:07,609
wasn't at the Blue House that day.

772
00:58:13,865 --> 00:58:15,492
Is he trying to cover up his wrongdoings?

773
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:21,831
When I'm at the Blue House,

774
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:24,709
that won't ever happen.

775
00:58:27,962 --> 00:58:30,173
-Good morning.
-Vote for Kang Sang-gu.

776
00:58:30,256 --> 00:58:31,341
Thank you.

777
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:33,718
-Good morning.
-Good luck!

778
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:35,011
Thank you.

779
00:58:35,261 --> 00:58:36,971
-Can I take a selfie with you?
-Of course.

780
00:58:37,055 --> 00:58:40,058
-Good morning.
-Vote for Kang Sang-gu.

781
00:58:41,017 --> 00:58:42,644
-Good morning.
-Vote for Kang Sang-gu.

782
00:58:42,727 --> 00:58:44,896
-It's an honor.
-Good morning.

783
00:58:44,979 --> 00:58:47,315
-Thank you. Bye.
-Bye.

784
00:58:47,398 --> 00:58:48,566
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

785
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:51,402
People know you the most,

786
00:58:51,486 --> 00:58:53,947
but your approval ratings are so...

787
00:58:54,989 --> 00:58:56,324
Good morning.

788
00:58:56,407 --> 00:58:57,575
Mr. Yun,

789
00:58:57,992 --> 00:59:00,078
you don't know
until the ballots are counted.

790
00:59:01,412 --> 00:59:04,916
Come on. You should've dyed your hair
or something.

791
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:07,835
Kids nowadays say that your looks
make up for welfare.

792
00:59:08,336 --> 00:59:11,756
Park Mu-jin and Oh Yeong-seok
are both good looking.

793
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:13,258
Dye my hair?

794
00:59:13,925 --> 00:59:16,177
The presidential election
isn't a popularity vote.

795
00:59:17,178 --> 00:59:19,180
You people should be ashamed.

796
00:59:19,764 --> 00:59:22,350
If the media verified
the candidates like it should have,

797
00:59:22,433 --> 00:59:26,062
unqualified people wouldn't be
the top two candidates.

798
00:59:26,145 --> 00:59:27,897
Hello, vote for Kang Sang-gu.

799
00:59:27,981 --> 00:59:29,148
Hello.

800
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:30,942
Hello, vote for Kang Sang-gu.

801
00:59:31,025 --> 00:59:33,778
Who? Who is unqualified?

802
00:59:34,654 --> 00:59:36,656
Park Mu-jin? Oh Yeong-seok?

803
00:59:37,073 --> 00:59:38,032
Whom do you mean?

804
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:43,037
Good morning. Vote for Kang Sang-gu.

805
00:59:43,913 --> 00:59:46,624
This is simply a tip that I'm giving you

806
00:59:46,708 --> 00:59:50,587
with the purest of intentions
so the media can verify it.

807
00:59:52,088 --> 00:59:54,632
I don't know how to do
negative campaigning.

808
00:59:55,592 --> 00:59:58,177
Good morning. Vote for Kang Sang-gu.

809
00:59:59,178 --> 01:00:00,805
The Chief Presidential Secretary.

810
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:03,808
You know him,

811
01:00:04,309 --> 01:00:06,144
the one that always sounds like a jerk.

812
01:00:11,524 --> 01:00:12,483
Me?

813
01:00:15,153 --> 01:00:16,571
What do you mean?

814
01:00:19,115 --> 01:00:20,408
It's just as I said.

815
01:00:20,908 --> 01:00:24,787
I heard you were investigated
by the security team

816
01:00:24,871 --> 01:00:25,913
regarding the bombing.

817
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:30,501
Who told you that?

818
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:35,965
So you were in fact investigated,

819
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:38,635
seeing that you're asking for the source.

820
01:00:41,054 --> 01:00:43,473
I was proved not guilty.

821
01:00:52,023 --> 01:00:54,525
I thought you knew everything
about the world of politics,

822
01:00:54,609 --> 01:00:56,361
but you can't seem to watch your own back.

823
01:00:59,864 --> 01:01:01,991
Until the real bomber is found,

824
01:01:02,075 --> 01:01:05,870
there will constantly be talk about you
just for being suspected.

825
01:01:05,953 --> 01:01:07,914
People don't care about the truth.

826
01:01:07,997 --> 01:01:09,666
They believe what they want to.

827
01:01:09,749 --> 01:01:11,876
-Ms. Woo.
-You are President Park's

828
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:15,213
Chief Presidential Secretary
and closest advisor.

829
01:01:15,296 --> 01:01:16,506
And President Park

830
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:20,343
is the biggest beneficiary of the bombing
no matter what anyone says.

831
01:01:21,719 --> 01:01:25,098
It's the perfect setting
for those who like conspiracy

832
01:01:26,265 --> 01:01:27,600
to imagine all they want.

833
01:01:38,569 --> 01:01:40,863
REPORTER LEE YONG-WON,
REPORTER JUNG BONG-HEE

834
01:01:46,661 --> 01:01:48,162
What is going on this early?

835
01:01:48,329 --> 01:01:49,664
Did you know, Secretary Jeong?

836
01:01:51,332 --> 01:01:54,168
Secretary Cha was being investigated
by the Terrorism Task Force.

837
01:02:00,883 --> 01:02:02,635
Even the Blue House didn't know.

838
01:02:15,857 --> 01:02:17,608
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

839
01:02:18,943 --> 01:02:21,070
Is that why you plan
to leave the Blue House?

840
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:25,116
It's the best I can do.

841
01:02:25,950 --> 01:02:28,661
It's better to stay at your job

842
01:02:29,662 --> 01:02:31,873
and fight against the media's attack,

843
01:02:32,331 --> 01:02:34,459
considering your political career.

844
01:02:35,126 --> 01:02:36,878
Considering the presidential election,

845
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:40,381
it's better for me to quit

846
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:45,303
as soon as possible
so I don't burden President Park.

847
01:02:47,138 --> 01:02:48,973
Did President Park give you an answer?

848
01:02:50,558 --> 01:02:53,352
Did he decide to run for President?

849
01:02:56,939 --> 01:02:58,107
I'm sure...

850
01:02:59,942 --> 01:03:03,404
he won't answer you to the end.

851
01:03:05,156 --> 01:03:08,409
It's important for him
to remain a good person.

852
01:03:09,577 --> 01:03:12,705
He can't stand getting dirt on his hands.

853
01:03:13,748 --> 01:03:14,999
He's clean

854
01:03:15,958 --> 01:03:17,126
and distant.

855
01:03:17,752 --> 01:03:19,003
President Park...

856
01:03:23,925 --> 01:03:25,676
will end up running for President.

857
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:37,772
Since he's a good person.

858
01:03:55,915 --> 01:03:58,417
Please take good care
of President Park, Secretary Jeong.

859
01:04:01,796 --> 01:04:02,922
But...

860
01:04:09,762 --> 01:04:11,556
Are you saying Secretary Cha quit?

861
01:04:12,682 --> 01:04:13,599
Yes.

862
01:04:14,308 --> 01:04:16,477
He said he didn't want
to be a burden on you, sir.

863
01:04:19,522 --> 01:04:22,525
That's why I'm here in his stead

864
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:23,985
to hear your answer.

865
01:04:27,488 --> 01:04:29,740
You haven't decided, have you?

866
01:04:35,454 --> 01:04:36,664
If this keeps up,

867
01:04:37,331 --> 01:04:39,584
Minister Oh will become President.

868
01:04:41,085 --> 01:04:44,005
Then it will become impossible
to find the people behind the bombing.

869
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:47,842
Tension will escalate
on the Korean Peninsula as they wish,

870
01:04:48,634 --> 01:04:50,803
and what happened with Gasan Island
will happen

871
01:04:51,095 --> 01:04:53,097
wherever there is a conflict
with the government.

872
01:04:53,472 --> 01:04:54,849
Is that okay?

873
01:04:58,978 --> 01:04:59,979
President Park,

874
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:02,315
will you be okay with that?

875
01:05:08,237 --> 01:05:09,238
I...

876
01:05:11,407 --> 01:05:12,700
am not qualified.

877
01:05:25,796 --> 01:05:27,048
Secretary Cha...

878
01:05:28,591 --> 01:05:30,509
sacrificed his political career.

879
01:05:32,178 --> 01:05:33,971
He believed you'd run for President...

880
01:05:37,975 --> 01:05:41,228
since you are a good person.

881
01:05:58,120 --> 01:06:00,456
Secretary Jeong, why don't you...

882
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:15,846
You're being stubborn and trying
to fight with your bare hands

883
01:06:15,930 --> 01:06:18,724
on the battlefield because you're scared
you'll get your sword bloody.

884
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:20,017
There can be two outcomes.

885
01:06:20,101 --> 01:06:22,520
You either die bleeding or surrendering.

886
01:06:22,603 --> 01:06:23,854
I...

887
01:06:24,438 --> 01:06:27,358
don't want to fight
under a commander like that anymore.

888
01:06:28,609 --> 01:06:29,986
I want to win.

889
01:06:33,072 --> 01:06:34,907
Even you said

890
01:06:35,533 --> 01:06:37,743
that I'm not cut out for this position.

891
01:06:39,328 --> 01:06:41,205
I wanted to see, just once,

892
01:06:42,748 --> 01:06:44,500
a world in which the good person wins.

893
01:08:03,496 --> 01:08:05,039
I am Park Mu-jin,

894
01:08:06,248 --> 01:08:07,500
the Acting President.

895
01:08:13,756 --> 01:08:16,300
President Park is back.

896
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:24,767
He's holding a press conference
at Chunchugwan.

897
01:08:38,155 --> 01:08:41,826
We heard the security team
investigated Secretary Cha Yeong-jin.

898
01:08:41,909 --> 01:08:44,703
I heard he violated safety regulations
regarding terrorist attacks.

899
01:08:44,787 --> 01:08:46,163
Is this true?

900
01:08:47,832 --> 01:08:50,334
-Please verify this, sir.
-Is it true?

901
01:08:50,417 --> 01:08:53,587
-Please give us an answer.
-Please comment.

902
01:08:53,671 --> 01:08:56,674
-Is this true?
-Please answer us.

903
01:08:56,757 --> 01:08:58,342
-Did he--
-It's true.

904
01:09:12,898 --> 01:09:16,026
I heard Secretary Cha
handed in his letter of resignation.

905
01:09:16,110 --> 01:09:17,736
Does that mean he admits he was involved?

906
01:09:22,491 --> 01:09:24,118
The internal investigation proved

907
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:27,246
that all suspicions surrounding
Secretary Cha

908
01:09:28,289 --> 01:09:30,541
were not true.

909
01:09:34,628 --> 01:09:38,257
I would like to make this clear
to everyone.

910
01:09:39,008 --> 01:09:40,509
Secretary Cha

911
01:09:41,051 --> 01:09:44,555
was not involved in the attack
of the National Assembly building.

912
01:09:45,973 --> 01:09:47,683
Notwithstanding your statement,

913
01:09:47,766 --> 01:09:49,685
until the real bomber is found,

914
01:09:49,768 --> 01:09:51,854
the fact that he was suspected
of involvement itself

915
01:09:51,937 --> 01:09:53,731
will raise the people's suspicions.

916
01:09:53,814 --> 01:09:55,357
What do you say about this?

917
01:09:55,816 --> 01:09:58,068
When did the Blue House become aware

918
01:09:58,152 --> 01:10:00,237
that Secretary Cha was being suspected?

919
01:10:00,654 --> 01:10:03,115
Were you going to cover it up
although you knew?

920
01:10:03,657 --> 01:10:06,660
Did the Blue House intend to replace him

921
01:10:06,744 --> 01:10:08,078
because of the pressure?

922
01:10:08,662 --> 01:10:11,749
-Please explain it to us.
-Sir.

923
01:10:11,832 --> 01:10:14,877
-Please answer us.
-Please give a comment.

924
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:17,922
-Please tell us.
-Sir.

925
01:10:18,005 --> 01:10:20,716
The reason why Secretary Cha
submitted his letter of resignation...

926
01:10:23,177 --> 01:10:24,261
was because

927
01:10:25,095 --> 01:10:27,806
he feared the media's reports,
based on mere speculations

928
01:10:28,307 --> 01:10:30,476
in the interest of gaining attention

929
01:10:31,018 --> 01:10:32,478
regardless of the facts at hand,

930
01:10:32,561 --> 01:10:36,065
would incite distrust between the people

931
01:10:36,148 --> 01:10:37,650
and the Blue House.

932
01:10:50,537 --> 01:10:51,789
We did not accept

933
01:10:53,290 --> 01:10:54,708
his resignation.

934
01:11:12,810 --> 01:11:14,019
It is because

935
01:11:14,603 --> 01:11:16,981
the Blue House and I believe

936
01:11:17,606 --> 01:11:19,149
the media's suspicions

937
01:11:19,858 --> 01:11:22,319
and verification are solely to support

938
01:11:22,569 --> 01:11:25,531
the people's right to know and
to serve the public interest at all times.

939
01:11:29,118 --> 01:11:31,870
I trust that you will protect

940
01:11:32,454 --> 01:11:34,164
our nation's dignity.

941
01:11:55,185 --> 01:11:56,854
I will be straightforward.

942
01:11:59,106 --> 01:12:00,691
Will you run for President?

943
01:12:01,775 --> 01:12:05,279
-He's running for President?
-Really?

944
01:12:10,909 --> 01:12:13,037
Were you aware of this?

945
01:12:13,329 --> 01:12:15,456
You're the one in charge
of public information.

946
01:12:15,539 --> 01:12:18,208
Exactly. What's Ms. Woo's problem?

947
01:12:18,292 --> 01:12:19,960
She's so direct.

948
01:12:28,052 --> 01:12:29,553
I'd like you to ask me

949
01:12:30,179 --> 01:12:32,431
a completely different question
and distract the reporters

950
01:12:33,182 --> 01:12:35,351
so that the press won't be fixated

951
01:12:35,851 --> 01:12:37,227
on Secretary Cha.

952
01:12:41,315 --> 01:12:42,399
Then

953
01:12:43,067 --> 01:12:44,401
please grant me

954
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:46,111
an exclusive interview.

955
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:52,451
Will you announce your candidacy

956
01:12:52,910 --> 01:12:54,244
for the presidential election?

957
01:12:54,828 --> 01:12:57,915
-Please answer the question.
-Tell us, sir.

958
01:13:15,557 --> 01:13:16,767
I'm sorry...

959
01:13:18,310 --> 01:13:19,353
for the late reply.

960
01:13:23,857 --> 01:13:25,275
I will be

961
01:13:26,568 --> 01:13:28,237
running for President.

962
01:14:21,123 --> 01:14:24,168
The people want a leader who has
the will for power.

963
01:14:24,251 --> 01:14:26,753
But they do not trust a politician
with a lust for power.

964
01:14:26,837 --> 01:14:29,673
Minister Oh is your rival.

965
01:14:29,756 --> 01:14:31,550
He's the strongest candidate.

966
01:14:31,633 --> 01:14:33,927
Would you be able to oppose
President Park if it were you?

967
01:14:34,011 --> 01:14:37,931
Are you planning to legislate
the Discrimination Act?

968
01:14:38,015 --> 01:14:38,932
Given the situation?

969
01:14:39,016 --> 01:14:41,435
Let's turn the tables
during this election.

970
01:14:41,518 --> 01:14:44,188
I need to prevent President Park
from running for President.

971
01:14:44,271 --> 01:14:45,689
I'm curious to find out

972
01:14:45,772 --> 01:14:47,566
who will be sitting here in 30 days.
