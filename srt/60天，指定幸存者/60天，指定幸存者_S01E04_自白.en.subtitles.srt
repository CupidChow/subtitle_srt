1
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:15,932
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

2
00:00:53,678 --> 00:00:59,559
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
PLACES AND EVENTS ARE FICTIONAL

3
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:09,402
You don't have to worry
about the FTA renegotiations.

4
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:13,239
I've sent one of our people to ensure
our alliance with the US won't suffer.

5
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:16,409
The air pollution level test result
provided by the EPA...

6
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:17,952
There’s an error in the numbers.

7
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:21,206
PREVIOUSLY

8
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:23,416
Please contact the Korean delegation.

9
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,710
He will be held responsible
for today's incident

10
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:27,420
and dismissed from office.

11
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:31,800
There was an explosion
at the National Assembly

12
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:34,010
during the President's
State of the Nation Address.

13
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:37,263
The main building of the National Assembly

14
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,892
has collapsed.

15
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:44,312
Thank you

16
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:46,481
for coming.

17
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:48,149
You have been entrusted

18
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:51,319
with all the authority and duties

19
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:53,113
of the President of the Republic of Korea.

20
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:56,491
What happens if I step down
as Acting President?

21
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:58,535
I'm unqualified.

22
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:02,872
Your termination had no legal effect.

23
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:03,957
MINISTER
PARK MU-JIN

24
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,459
There was no time to process it.

25
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:08,753
We’re at war right now!
Do you not know what that means?

26
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:11,256
We shouldn’t react emotionally.

27
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:13,341
We don’t have time, President Park.

28
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:16,386
Give your consent to announce DEFCON Two.

29
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:18,012
What happens

30
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:20,598
if the submarine sank
and didn't infiltrate our waters?

31
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:23,351
You’re saying you’ll risk
the people’s lives and safety

32
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:26,229
on something uncertain
that hasn’t even been confirmed?

33
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:27,689
Will you remove Sawagiri Fleet

34
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:30,692
from Korean waters?

35
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,904
The person in the most danger today
within the bunker...

36
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:38,825
Park Mu-jin. It was you.

37
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:42,036
There have been acts of violence
in Mohyeon and Bogil.

38
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,830
An executive order?

39
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:47,333
If you wish to issue an executive order,
you will have to fire me.

40
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:49,002
As of now,

41
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:50,962
Secretary Han is dismissed of his job.

42
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:55,341
It's a bomb! I found an explosive!

43
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:56,593
"Explosive demolition"?

44
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,846
The explosive demolition method
requires fuses planted

45
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:01,890
all over the building to make it work.

46
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:02,932
So?

47
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:07,187
The bombers detonated the bombs
using the building's Internet cable lines.

48
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,731
There was a bombing
during the President's speech

49
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:11,858
at the National Assembly
that I was boycotting.

50
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:15,904
That alone stops me from being free
of any moral responsibility.

51
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:18,740
Who is less unfortunate?

52
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:20,408
Is it the family of the deceased

53
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:22,285
or the family of the missing?

54
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:25,955
Do you still think you don't desire
power and authority?

55
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,458
It's not that he never wanted power,

56
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:31,377
but he just didn't have the chance.

57
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:51,689
DECEASED

58
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,858
MISSING

59
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,028
KIM JUN-O

60
00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:58,780
There's a survivor here!

61
00:03:58,863 --> 00:03:59,989
It's a survivor!

62
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:04,285
There's a survivor?

63
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:05,536
Where?

64
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:09,249
There's a survivor!

65
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,461
Where is the survivor?

66
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:17,048
-Over there.
-My gosh!

67
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:19,217
-Yes, we found a survivor.
-Gosh!

68
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:23,429
-Oh, my goodness.
-I hope he's okay.

69
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,561
My gosh!

70
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:34,023
-There.
-Hang in there. We almost have him.

71
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,526
Grab his arm first.

72
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:38,820
Be careful. Watch the arm.

73
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:40,405
One, two, three!

74
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:42,907
Hurry up!

75
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:45,827
-Dad! Dad...
-Hurry!

76
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:51,791
Hey, the feet too.

77
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:53,918
Cover him up.

78
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:00,341
-One, two, three!
-Three!

79
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:03,136
-Let's go.
-Dad!

80
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:07,348
-Dad!
-Move back, please.

81
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:12,478
Please move back.

82
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,237
Please move back.

83
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:23,614
Hold tight, okay?

84
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:26,117
-Dad!
-Go slowly.

85
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,535
Let's go slowly, okay?

86
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:28,870
Dad!

87
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,707
I got him. I'm holding him.

88
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:34,250
Slowly.

89
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:36,669
-Please move back.
-Hold on. I just want to see...

90
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,046
-Please let us...
-There he is!

91
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:39,630
-Dad!
-Please move back!

92
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:40,965
Do you remember the explosion?

93
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:42,383
-What happened?
-Let us through!

94
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:43,676
Please give us a comment.

95
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,262
How do you feel
about being the sole survivor?

96
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:48,139
Please identify yourself!

97
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:51,726
Do you remember the explosion?

98
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:53,561
Where were you during the explosion?

99
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:03,237
The survivor who was miraculously rescued
two days after the explosion

100
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:06,866
has been identified as an independent
first-term assemblyman Mr. Oh Yeong-seok.

101
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,994
The bombing resulted
in approximately 200 casualties,

102
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:11,662
which include the President,

103
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:13,998
the Prime Minister,
as well as members of the Cabinet.

104
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:16,584
The first survivor,
Assemblyman Oh Yeong-seok...

105
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:18,669
The youngest member
of the 21st National Assembly.

106
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:20,213
He's the first assemblyman from Honam

107
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:22,006
that was elected to represent
a TK district.

108
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:23,758
That was possible
because he's independent.

109
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:26,886
He beat a three-term assemblyman
who even served as a floor leader.

110
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:28,221
Don't you remember, sir?

111
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:33,684
Attention, everyone!

112
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:37,480
Work on a spotlight story
on Assemblyman Oh Yeong-seok.

113
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,857
What has he done for his district
and in the Assembly?

114
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:42,235
It's his first term,
so find out how he got into politics.

115
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:44,070
"The fighter, Oh Yeong-seok.

116
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:46,572
The messenger of hope
risen from the midst of despair."

117
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:47,990
Isn't it great?

118
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,659
Now, get to work!

119
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:54,205
ASSEMBLYMAN OH YEONG-SEOK
FOUND ALIVE

120
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:04,215
Assemblyman Oh's survival

121
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:06,134
is giving hope to our people

122
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:08,094
who were drowning in despair.

123
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:29,532
Life is quite interesting, isn't it?

124
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:33,744
Someone becomes a beacon of hope
just for being alive.

125
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:36,873
And another gains
the highest power in Korea

126
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:39,333
just for being alive.

127
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:42,462
With no qualifications

128
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:44,797
and without being vetted.

129
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:59,812
ASSEMBLYMAN OH YEONG-SEOK
DRAMATICALLY RESCUED

130
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,315
That's great news.

131
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:03,858
I hope we'll hear

132
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:06,277
about more survivors being rescued.

133
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:07,487
Mr. President.

134
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:10,531
Those at the site

135
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:12,700
don't think that is very likely.

136
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:17,872
By tomorrow, the 72-hour
golden time of rescue will expire.

137
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:20,750
And we're concerned
that there may be a secondary collapse.

138
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:22,502
I think

139
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:25,671
Assemblyman Oh could be
the first and last...

140
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:27,632
He may be the only survivor.

141
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:34,847
I'll arrange for a congratulatory letter
to be sent to him under your name, sir.

142
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:35,890
And please have a look.

143
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:39,977
It's your approval rating based on
your administrative operation work.

144
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:42,605
In the presidential candidate
preference poll,

145
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:45,107
you were ranked number five,
following Ms. Yun Chan-gyeong

146
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,317
and Mayor Kang.

147
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,279
I heard from the reporters

148
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,823
that many media outlets
are working on stories about you.

149
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:56,244
They'll probably be about whether or not
you qualify to run for President.

150
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:58,746
That makes me feel

151
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:00,331
a little uneasy.

152
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:05,211
I'll be going back to teaching in 60 days.

153
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,547
I don't want to be considered a candidate.

154
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,799
It's simply not right given the situation.

155
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:13,427
You want me to control the press because
it's not the kind of story you want?

156
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:17,431
Then they'll publish stories about how
the Blue House infringed on their rights.

157
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:18,599
-I meant--
-You know

158
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:20,268
that's not what he meant.

159
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:21,769
I'm saying he needs to know.

160
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,940
With even Secretary Han gone now,

161
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:29,735
every word you say will be a reflection
of the Blue House's political choice

162
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:32,697
regardless of your intention.

163
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:36,284
The media will continue to talk about you
as one of the presidential candidates.

164
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:37,201
And...

165
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:40,788
I welcome that.

166
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:45,751
What do you mean?

167
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:49,714
It's proof that the people are in support
of your leadership.

168
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:52,425
Do you think a mere Acting President

169
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:55,136
can have a more powerful tool than that
here in the Blue House?

170
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,391
What?

171
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,892
I guess the power went out.

172
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:03,352
No. Something's wrong.

173
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,396
The Blue House can't have a power outage.

174
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:07,732
Please don't leave the room!

175
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:10,026
Mr. President!
Away from the window, please.

176
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,278
What's happening?

177
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:13,863
It's the Blue House.

178
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,449
It seems like the Blue House
is the target this time.

179
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:31,756
DAY 58: CONFESSION
EPISODE 4

180
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,466
Yes, okay.

181
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,551
What's wrong? What's going on?

182
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:38,054
Our internal network firewall
has been breached.

183
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:39,347
Disconnect the link first.

184
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,224
Hurry up! Disconnect it!

185
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:44,894
The whole system is down, sir.

186
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:46,395
This is crazy.

187
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:48,814
Where's the breach?

188
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:01,118
Don't tell me
that our network has been hacked.

189
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:04,413
The Blue House's network
was designed to be breach-proof.

190
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:05,873
Then how...

191
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:08,584
Have you heard of the Trojan horse?

192
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:11,170
The firewall opened up internally

193
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:13,130
while the power was coming back on.

194
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:15,591
Is it possible to check
if there was a data breach?

195
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,218
That's not what they were after.

196
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,261
They left a video on our server.

197
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:21,180
Look.

198
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:44,412
Do you think it's true?

199
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:47,915
We won't be able to authenticate the video

200
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:52,044
until the NSC receives the report

201
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:53,337
from NIS.

202
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,047
If it's true,

203
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:58,175
the Blue House
will obviously be affected, right?

204
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,010
If the video is made public,

205
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:04,265
we can expect political attacks
against you, sir.

206
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,395
It may fundamentally jeopardize
your position as Acting President.

207
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:19,947
YEOMINGWAN

208
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:34,462
NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL

209
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:45,848
Shall we begin?

210
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:49,894
As you've heard,

211
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:51,937
the Blue House's network
was hacked last night.

212
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:54,607
And the hackers left this video
for our government.

213
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:02,239
This is a message for you puppets
in the South.

214
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:05,201
We want to propose a summit
between the North and South.

215
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,244
You talk about peaceful reunification,

216
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:10,998
and yet you're colluding
with American imperialists behind our back

217
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:12,583
while practicing nuclear attacks on us.

218
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:16,837
The National Assembly Building,
the heart of you political profiteers,

219
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:21,842
is hereby judged in the name of
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

220
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:25,012
Moreover, do not

221
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:28,808
mock the Republic
or the heroic people of the DPRK.

222
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:30,601
We still have

223
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:34,021
our powerful nuclear weapons.

224
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,024
Do not start bloodshed

225
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:40,361
on our sacred Korean peninsula.

226
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:43,447
Long live

227
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:47,284
the strong socialist nation,
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea

228
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:50,996
Long live
the great people of the Republic!

229
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:54,834
So...

230
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,878
North Korea just confessed

231
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:00,256
that they bombed
the National Assembly Building.

232
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:03,551
And they hacked the Blue House's network
to deliver this message.

233
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:07,179
First off,

234
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:11,100
would you please fill us in
regarding the video's authenticity?

235
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:13,060
Sure.

236
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:15,938
This is our counterterrorism agent,
who used to be

237
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:18,107
in the North Korea
and Counterintelligence Task Forces.

238
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:20,568
I'm Jeong Han-mo, sir.

239
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:24,154
NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE SERVICE

240
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:26,323
Agent Han Na-gyeong.

241
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,617
I'd like you to go on my behalf.

242
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,328
The survivor, you know.

243
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:32,955
Assemblyman Oh Yeong-seok.

244
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,125
I got a call from the hospital.

245
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:38,460
Visitation is allowed now.

246
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,046
Does he remember what happened?

247
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:44,425
Are you asking me to report to you?

248
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:45,759
Here, in my office?

249
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,344
My apologies, sir.

250
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:49,722
Go and find out.

251
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:52,182
Han-mo should go,

252
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:55,477
but he has to report something
to the higher-ups at this early hour.

253
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,813
"The higher-ups"? Do you mean...

254
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:00,566
BH.

255
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,492
The man in the video is...

256
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:17,166
the head of the Operations Bureau
of North Korea's RGB, Myung Hae-jun.

257
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,960
Myung Hae-jun is
Choe Seo-ryong's adopted son.

258
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:20,920
Choe Seo-ryong is...

259
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:24,214
one of the seven pallbearers.

260
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:27,635
In other words, he's one of the most
powerful officials in North Korea

261
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:30,387
who led the succession plans.

262
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:33,807
Choe Seo-ryong is one of
the best-known military officials,

263
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:36,936
who has been leading
North Korea's "Military First" policy.

264
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:39,188
Then,

265
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:42,107
are you saying the video isn't fake?

266
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:44,985
However, we checked through the hotline,

267
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:48,030
and the North strongly denied
knowledge regarding the video

268
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,073
as well as the attack.

269
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:52,076
They'd never admit
launching an attack on us.

270
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:55,454
From the Rangoon bombing in 1983

271
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:56,830
to the bombing at Gimpo Airport

272
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:58,832
during the 1986 Asian Games,

273
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,960
they've always denied everything
as they do now.

274
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:01,877
Strongly.

275
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:05,798
Then why?

276
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,469
Why is this an exception?

277
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,598
I just think it's a little odd.

278
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:17,267
Why did they confess?

279
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:20,354
And they sent us a video directly
using the Blue House's network.

280
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:24,483
Are you still going to defend
North Korea, Mr. Park?

281
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:27,486
He is the Commander-in-Chief
of the ROK military at the moment.

282
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:29,989
Would you please address him
appropriately, sir?

283
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,538
I'll keep that in mind.

284
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:42,126
I'm not defending North Korea.

285
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:45,004
I just want to make a logical deduction.

286
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:47,381
It's the same North Korea.

287
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:48,841
Why is it different this time?

288
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:51,593
In this case,

289
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,304
what's the most logical deduction
the intelligence agency can make?

290
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:58,142
We would suspect
there is an ulterior motive.

291
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:04,440
An ulterior motive?

292
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:08,444
Yes. Someone might have wanted
the Blue House to blame North Korea

293
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:09,987
for the attack.

294
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,488
Who?

295
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:14,116
For what reason? Why?

296
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,495
For now, Myung Hae-jun is the one
holding the key.

297
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:23,959
Can we find his whereabouts?

298
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,253
Yes, we tracked his IP address

299
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:29,840
and have confirmed that the video was
uploaded in Cambodia, not North Korea.

300
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:31,592
Cambodia?

301
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:33,886
Yes. Cambodia is
where Myung Hae-jun was dispatched

302
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:36,180
to earn foreign money.

303
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:39,016
INFORMATION ON MYUNG HAE-JUN

304
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:42,227
Are you saying Myung Hae-jun is
in Cambodia now?

305
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:45,230
We requested the Cambodian
intelligence agency to check on that.

306
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:47,816
We asked them to confirm
whether he had entered the country,

307
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,235
considering there is a chance
he might be in disguise.

308
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,154
It won't be easy.

309
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:56,283
Cambodia is much closer to North Korea
than us.

310
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:59,870
As North Korea is denying
the responsibility for the attack,

311
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:02,247
they will not hand him over to us.

312
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:05,751
NIS and the military,

313
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,921
please find a way to locate Myung Hae-jun.

314
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:11,256
One more thing.

315
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:16,428
This video clip must not be leaked.

316
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:19,973
Causing confusion regarding
the bomber at this point in time

317
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:21,475
would be devastating.

318
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:25,187
"Devastating." For whom?

319
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:28,982
Do you mean for national security...

320
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,904
or for your position?

321
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:56,051
If the video is leaked,

322
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,428
the people will completely lose
faith in President Park.

323
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:00,764
He rescued the North Korean submarine

324
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:03,559
and prohibited discrimination
against North Korean refugees.

325
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,936
He will look like he played
into North Korea's hands.

326
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:07,271
We can hush the press corps

327
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:09,314
regarding the Blue House power outage,

328
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:11,900
but what if an insider leaks the fact

329
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:14,319
that we got hacked and about the video?

330
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:15,863
There are so many online news sites.

331
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:17,990
Once one of them discovers this,
it will be...

332
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:22,244
I thought you were here
to do that difficult job.

333
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:25,455
I didn't ask if it's possible.

334
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:27,166
I want you to make it possible.

335
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,589
You're born with that, right?

336
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:38,260
You always say the right thing,
but you always sound like a douche bag.

337
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:47,936
Watch it, punk.

338
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:53,901
This has never happened before,

339
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:56,528
so we're studying other countries' cases.

340
00:19:57,696 --> 00:20:00,949
You can make decisions about the things
regarding the state funeral protocol

341
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,952
like the chief funeral commissioner
appointment at the meeting, sir.

342
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:09,499
Excuse me. Sir?

343
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,505
Where were we?

344
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:20,427
I'll escort him to the conference room.

345
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,221
Okay.

346
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:30,312
All right.

347
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:41,657
Don't worry.

348
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:45,786
General Lee said that
because he doesn't know you.

349
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:51,041
It must be hard for him to believe

350
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,836
that there's a politician
who is not concerned about his position.

351
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:58,215
General Lee was right.

352
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,841
I was...

353
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:03,053
worried about myself

354
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,013
when I first saw the video.

355
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:06,932
Sir.

356
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:14,356
I was afraid I was wrong.

357
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:19,152
It was the same with the submarine
and Mohyeon and Bogil.

358
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:25,117
Once I lose this position,
I can't get it back.

359
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:44,761
WRITTEN REPORT FOR THE PRESIDENT

360
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:47,639
PARK MU-JIN

361
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:54,438
So other than the Vice-Ministers,
who else is participating

362
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:56,815
the enlarged Cabinet meeting?

363
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:16,918
I guess I should go with a red tie.

364
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:18,587
Excuse me, sir?

365
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:21,381
The picture of me
that will be hung up here.

366
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:31,058
Mayor Kang may not care to be
the Chief Funeral Commissioner,

367
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:33,477
but he'll want to give the eulogy.

368
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:35,854
Mayor Kang is a natural politician.

369
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:38,940
He loves cameras so much.

370
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:46,156
Neither Yun Chan-gyeong and Kang Sang-gu
will budge an inch.

371
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,911
It will be hard to even decide
whether the funeral

372
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:52,871
should be 5 days long or 7.

373
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:57,250
Can't we just follow the protocol?

374
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:01,046
For the two of them,

375
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:04,633
this is similar to setting campaign rules.

376
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:06,885
MAYOR OF SEOUL

377
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:08,428
It should be seven days long.

378
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:10,222
Five days are enough.

379
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:12,974
It's a joint funeral

380
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:15,727
for the President, cabinet members,
and civilians.

381
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:19,564
This is a state funeral
we're talking about.

382
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:24,152
That state funeral is supposed to last
five days according to the law.

383
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:25,987
There must be a reason for that.

384
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:28,782
Our citizens need enough time to mourn.

385
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:30,826
They need some time to cry.

386
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:33,745
You can't say, "Time's up,"
and remove the tents.

387
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:36,957
It will break the people's hearts.

388
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:40,627
You can't just sit and cry
while using up all the savings.

389
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:43,171
Didn't you see the economic indicator
for the first half?

390
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:45,632
-We need national integration.
-We need national integration.

391
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:55,142
The longer the mourning period is,

392
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:58,228
the better it is for Mayor Kang.

393
00:23:59,312 --> 00:24:03,733
That way he can convert people's sympathy
for President Yang's tragic death

394
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:06,236
to votes for him.

395
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:10,866
In elections, there is one thing
that is scarier than regionalism.

396
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,453
Sympathy votes.

397
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:18,790
Then the opposition party

398
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:22,002
must want to end the mourning
as soon as possible.

399
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:26,131
Yun Chan-gyeong won't want to yield a bit.

400
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:27,507
Bingo.

401
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:31,553
SEONJIN REPUBLICAN PARTY DELEGATE

402
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:35,640
I will give in.

403
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:37,267
Let's make it seven days.

404
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:39,936
It will have to be
a Special Enforcement Ordinance.

405
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:45,066
I'll be the Chief Funeral Commissioner,
as I'm the leader of the opposition party.

406
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:49,321
For national integration.
Wouldn't that be better, Mayor Kang?

407
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:51,656
Oh, my. You'll have a lot on your hands.

408
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:55,619
How can I help lessen that burden?

409
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:56,995
Then...

410
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:01,208
-I can give the eulogy--
-The eulogy

411
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:05,128
must be given by someone
who can give new hope to the people.

412
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:09,925
So...

413
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:13,303
Are you saying that's you?

414
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:16,139
I was thinking
of Assemblyman Oh Yeong-seok.

415
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:19,809
Assemblyman Oh is a message himself.

416
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:23,813
The courage to power through hardships
and an iron will.

417
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:27,901
That's the message
our people want to hear right now.

418
00:25:29,152 --> 00:25:31,738
How is Assemblyman Oh's condition?

419
00:25:31,821 --> 00:25:33,782
Can he return to the Assembly?

420
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:35,283
Let me answer your questions.

421
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:38,203
When he was brought to the hospital,

422
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:42,165
he was suffering from
dehydration and malnutrition.

423
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:46,336
He had abrasions and contusions
all over his body.

424
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:50,131
His CT scan and blood test

425
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:53,843
came back clean
without any irregularities.

426
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:56,054
We consider it a miracle.

427
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:58,056
When will he be discharged?

428
00:25:58,139 --> 00:25:59,933
Does he remember the bombing?

429
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:03,395
No.

430
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:07,232
I can't recall anything.

431
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:09,442
Not a single thing.

432
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:17,284
I'm sorry for making you
relive the nightmare.

433
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:23,248
Your memory is the only lead
we have in figuring out

434
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:24,874
what happened that day.

435
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:31,256
Could you think long and hard for me?

436
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:35,343
Maybe you saw someone suspicious that day?

437
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:39,889
Was there anything unusual
that seems to have foretold the attack?

438
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:43,226
That day,

439
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:48,857
I was sitting in the auditorium
with my fellow assemblymen

440
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:53,695
listening to the President's
State of the Nation Address.

441
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:57,407
That is the present and...

442
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:59,117
The air turned solemn

443
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,410
...the future.

444
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:02,704
due to the minority party's boycott.

445
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:05,665
And then...

446
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:09,669
Then...

447
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:12,339
Therefore, our government will...

448
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:17,093
I apologize.

449
00:27:18,511 --> 00:27:20,013
I can't remember anything after that.

450
00:27:30,523 --> 00:27:32,150
I still can't believe it.

451
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:36,821
I feel like...

452
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,283
the whole world...

453
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:44,162
is playing a joke on me.

454
00:27:47,248 --> 00:27:49,417
The fact that there was a bombing,

455
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:55,173
that I'm the sole survivor,

456
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,221
and also...

457
00:28:09,562 --> 00:28:11,564
GET WELL SOON
ASSEMBLYMAN OH YEONG-SEOK

458
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:14,526
YOU ARE OUR HOPE
ASSEMBLYMAN OH YEONG-SEOK

459
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:18,738
I WISH YOU A QUICK RECOVERY

460
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:20,782
MIRACLE SURVIVOR
ASSEMBLYMAN OH YEONG-SEOK

461
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:22,784
I WISH YOU THE BEST!

462
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:26,788
Ever since the attack,

463
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:31,584
we've been waiting ardently...

464
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,298
for our loved ones to return to us alive.

465
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,261
We prayed for a miracle...

466
00:28:43,596 --> 00:28:44,973
that we never believed in before.

467
00:28:53,314 --> 00:28:56,693
Sir, you've become that miracle to us.

468
00:28:56,776 --> 00:28:57,902
But I lost everything.

469
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:01,781
My superiors who gave me dreams,

470
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:04,993
colleagues who gave me friendship,

471
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:09,497
and my staff with whom I spent more time

472
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:12,417
than my family.

473
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:17,464
Korea lost
its National Assembly Building that day,

474
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:22,302
but I lost everyone

475
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:27,390
I shared my dreams with.

476
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:30,977
Given all that,

477
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:36,941
must I still be happy...

478
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:41,946
about the fact that I lived?

479
00:29:56,252 --> 00:29:57,670
SEONJIN REPUBLICAN PARTY DELEGATE

480
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:01,466
MAYOR OF SEOUL

481
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:14,562
The eulogy,

482
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:20,443
as per Assemblywoman Yun's suggestion
as Chief Funeral Commissioner,

483
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:22,987
will be given
by Assemblyman Oh Yeong-seok.

484
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:36,793
This is a state funeral.

485
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:40,255
If a newly appointed assemblyman
gives the eulogy,

486
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:42,632
it'll be a mockery of the administration.

487
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:49,681
Mr. Mayor, Ms. Yun is a club owner.

488
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:53,643
What?

489
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:57,564
Is her party
taking over a pro baseball club?

490
00:30:58,481 --> 00:31:00,608
I mean that she knows which beat to play.

491
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:04,946
Would she have suggested
that Assemblyman Oh give the eulogy

492
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:06,948
without considering its significance?

493
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:24,591
Are you planning
to recruit Assemblyman Oh to your party?

494
00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:31,264
The man currently receiving
the public's entire attention

495
00:31:31,347 --> 00:31:34,058
gives a touching eulogy at the funeral.

496
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:37,812
He then states his support for you
and joins your party.

497
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:40,648
That itself
is a perfect election campaign.

498
00:31:42,358 --> 00:31:44,903
It's something even my advisers
don't know about.

499
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:49,032
No wonder President Yang
kept you by his side.

500
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:54,162
If we're talking secrets, I know one too.

501
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:57,874
The Blue House's network was compromised

502
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:01,669
and it has something
to do with the recent attack.

503
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,129
How am I doing so far?

504
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,090
I have no idea what you're talking about.

505
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,552
Lying isn't your forte, I see.

506
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,388
I was a long time member of the SCBA.

507
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:14,057
SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON BUDGET AND ACCOUNTS

508
00:32:14,557 --> 00:32:17,727
The Blue House computers
are being replaced ahead of schedule.

509
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:19,479
And in these urgent times, too.

510
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,441
It indicates something happened.

511
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:33,242
However, the reporters who are dying

512
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:35,995
for anything to write about
the Blue House are silent.

513
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:37,705
Why?

514
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:41,042
Because the Blue House
is desperately keeping it under wraps.

515
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:47,256
What is going on within these walls?

516
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:51,260
Let me enlighten you, ma'am.

517
00:32:54,597 --> 00:32:56,057
-Ms. Jeong.
-Yes?

518
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:59,352
Please escort Assemblywoman Yun
to the reception room.

519
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:01,562
Please follow me.

520
00:33:07,443 --> 00:33:08,861
You can't do this, sir!

521
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:12,073
You know how this will end. Moreover

522
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:14,784
this is Assemblywoman Yun.

523
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:17,370
There's no other way

524
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:19,455
than to tell her the truth.

525
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:22,125
Honesty only gets you a merit badge
in the Boy Scouts.

526
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:24,961
This isn't about right or wrong,
but your political choice.

527
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:26,671
You're right, Secretary Cha.

528
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:29,173
This is Assemblywoman Yun.

529
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:31,050
Now that she is suspicious,

530
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:34,012
it's a matter of time
before she finds out about the video.

531
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:35,888
However,

532
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:40,143
if we share this secret with her,
she won't be able to reveal it.

533
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:43,813
It'll be just as much
a political burden for her as well.

534
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:45,857
But Mr. President...

535
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:50,028
I have made the decision
as the person with the highest authority.

536
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:52,071
Honesty

537
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:54,699
is my political stance.

538
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:05,043
Long live
the great people of the Republic!

539
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,004
Who else knows about this video?

540
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:10,798
The members of the NSC.

541
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:12,050
NSC: NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL

542
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:15,136
Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman,
NIS Deputy Director, presidential aides,

543
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:17,930
and now you.

544
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:23,978
Why didn't you reveal it
upon receiving it?

545
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:25,938
At this moment,

546
00:34:26,105 --> 00:34:28,232
imprudent fear and panic
regarding the bombers

547
00:34:28,816 --> 00:34:32,195
will only bring the people
unnecessary strife and confusion.

548
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:34,280
Just like the incidents
in Mohyeon and Bogil.

549
00:34:34,363 --> 00:34:35,198
So?

550
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:37,492
Does that frighten you?

551
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:41,037
Unnecessary strife and confusion?

552
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:43,998
If it were me,

553
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:46,334
I would've used
a common enemy on the outside.

554
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:50,296
The greater the fear and panic,

555
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:52,757
the more compliant
the people will be to your authority.

556
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:54,801
But it may incite a war.

557
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:56,094
That is

558
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:58,346
just a possibility.

559
00:34:58,596 --> 00:34:59,764
It's not an actual war.

560
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:10,233
Would you please maintain confidentiality

561
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:13,611
until we locate Myung Hae-jun?

562
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,238
Sure.

563
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:18,157
After all, I don't hold
the highest authority in Korea.

564
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:19,909
You do.

565
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:36,092
Hot!

566
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:46,561
You should eat first.

567
00:35:51,023 --> 00:35:52,358
Wait, is this a protest?

568
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:55,570
The President passed away

569
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:57,363
and there's no
Chief Presidential Secretary,

570
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:01,742
so that makes you the only person
who can do the job properly.

571
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:04,829
Thus, you barely have enough time
to eat cup noodles,

572
00:36:04,912 --> 00:36:07,957
and you're showing us that
you alone are working like a dog.

573
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,377
Secretary Han would never have allowed

574
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:14,422
our sharing that video
with Assemblyman Yun.

575
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:18,384
President Park doesn't stand a chance
against her.

576
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:21,721
He currently holds the highest authority
in Korea.

577
00:36:22,638 --> 00:36:23,890
Who would challenge him?

578
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:26,100
Assemblyman Yun

579
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:28,436
is the first party executive

580
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:31,355
ever to become a minority leader.

581
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:34,442
It means that she will do anything
and is afraid of nothing.

582
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:42,283
Your three minutes are up.

583
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:44,869
President Park...

584
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:49,707
needs his Chief Presidential Secretary.

585
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:54,795
That's the first time
we agreed on something.

586
00:36:57,006 --> 00:37:00,051
No one in the Blue House
is currently on his side.

587
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:03,346
At least one should support his decisions

588
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:04,931
and be shield.

589
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:07,808
Just like you were
when he was the Minister of Environment?

590
00:37:09,101 --> 00:37:11,479
I had no idea you were aiming higher.

591
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:13,439
Well, I'm just as surprised.

592
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:16,692
Who knew that I was competent enough

593
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:18,778
to be a threat to you?

594
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:31,123
One, two. This way.

595
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:36,128
Alpha Team is ready.

596
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:42,677
Is it true

597
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,971
that you're seizing search and rescue?

598
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:47,390
We received the safety report.

599
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:51,352
The left side of the main building
is in danger of collapsing.

600
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:53,479
We can't risk more casualties.

601
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:57,650
The 72-hour golden time of rescue
has passed anyway.

602
00:37:58,067 --> 00:38:00,069
There has been no movement caught on sonar

603
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:01,529
by motion sensors.

604
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:03,614
There are no survivors.

605
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:06,325
There was one. Assemblyman Oh.

606
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:09,453
We all saw him survive
from under the rubble.

607
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:12,039
That's why we call it a miracle.

608
00:38:13,207 --> 00:38:14,417
It was a miracle.

609
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:28,848
Tell the rescue team
searching the conference room to move out!

610
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:30,433
Hurry!

611
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:31,934
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

612
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:44,322
It’s a bomb! I found an explosive!

613
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:53,164
Over here.

614
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:10,306
That day,

615
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:13,017
I was sitting in the auditorium
with my fellow assemblymen

616
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:15,853
listening to the President's
State of the Nation Address.

617
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:21,776
STATE OF THE NATION ADDRESS

618
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:31,243
WHERE ASSEMBLYMAN OH WAS RESCUED

619
00:39:31,827 --> 00:39:32,953
He was found here.

620
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:46,884
Assemblyman Oh told me

621
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:49,804
he was listening to the President
at the time of the explosion.

622
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:52,973
That's all the whole world
is talking about.

623
00:39:54,266 --> 00:39:55,184
Can't I get a break?

624
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:02,566
Assemblyman Oh was found
on the opposite side.

625
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:05,694
If he was buried
as the building collapsed,

626
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:07,822
he couldn't have been found there.

627
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:15,204
WHERE ASSEMBLYMAN OH WAS RESCUED

628
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:25,214
Are you sure about this?

629
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:29,802
Myung Hae-jun
and his adoptive father Choe Seo-ryong

630
00:40:29,885 --> 00:40:31,303
disappeared from the photos

631
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:33,556
of the National Committee
and the Founding Ceremony

632
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:35,891
along with the seven officials
from the state funeral.

633
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:41,480
It's likely that they were purged.

634
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:44,233
Choe Seo-ryong

635
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:48,112
was an artillery professor at
the North Korean VIP's college.

636
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:49,613
They were quite close.

637
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:51,490
Concluding that he was purged

638
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:53,742
is a bit of a stretch.

639
00:40:54,034 --> 00:40:56,162
North Korea wants to be a normal country.

640
00:40:56,328 --> 00:40:58,247
It could be a way of demonstrating

641
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:00,207
its will to abolish
the "military first" policy.

642
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:06,255
So Myung Hae-jun

643
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:08,799
rebelled against the purge

644
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:11,427
and defected to Cambodia?

645
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:15,181
Only that can explain
why his visions don't match North Korea's.

646
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:17,433
That's absurd.

647
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:20,227
Are you saying he acted alone?

648
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:26,525
Someone

649
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:29,320
other than North Korea
may be calling the shots.

650
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:49,673
Han-mo.

651
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,383
Jeez.

652
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:53,177
Chief Jeong.

653
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:56,555
Why are you saying my name like that?
You're scaring me.

654
00:41:56,722 --> 00:41:58,599
What are you about to say now?

655
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:01,435
One false step now,

656
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:04,104
and it won't be just my job on the line.

657
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:07,274
Claims about the government
being just a figurehead

658
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:08,776
will resurface.

659
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,696
We'll be shut down.

660
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:18,577
Are you absolutely sure about this?

661
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:26,710
We have located where Myung Hae-jun was
in the video.

662
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:27,878
What?

663
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:32,716
This is the recorded footage of the speech

664
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,218
from National Assembly Television.

665
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:35,594
The reality

666
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:38,889
and what we should protect...

667
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:40,349
Assemblyman Oh was seated...

668
00:42:46,021 --> 00:42:48,899
There. He's in the main auditorium.

669
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:53,404
Fast forward.

670
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:04,164
He wasn't lying.

671
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:16,802
Ji-won, what time
did the bomb go off again?

672
00:43:17,886 --> 00:43:19,179
It was 3:15 p.m.

673
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:26,186
There's a minute and 35 seconds missing.

674
00:43:29,064 --> 00:43:32,526
It must have been destroyed
from the impact of the explosion.

675
00:43:39,825 --> 00:43:40,909
Na-gyeong.

676
00:43:41,827 --> 00:43:44,913
Oh Yeong-seok's seat might be visible
on this phone's camera.

677
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:48,751
Find all the photos
that were taken at this time.

678
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:53,047
PRESIDENT

679
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:57,676
I don't think we can. She's dead.

680
00:44:03,932 --> 00:44:04,933
What?

681
00:44:07,603 --> 00:44:10,481
Do you want me to hack a victim's cloud
without a warrant or something?

682
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:12,232
Illegally?

683
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:30,334
Do you feel guilty
about illegal surveillance?

684
00:44:30,959 --> 00:44:33,295
I'll take responsibility.
Say you were following my orders.

685
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:34,922
That's even worse.

686
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:37,675
You'll get hurt.

687
00:44:38,717 --> 00:44:40,469
Even when it was due to orders from above,

688
00:44:40,552 --> 00:44:42,930
NIS didn't protect anyone. You saw that.

689
00:44:43,305 --> 00:44:46,517
I want to work here for a long time.

690
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:49,228
It's a good job with a good salary
and benefits

691
00:44:49,311 --> 00:44:50,979
as long as you don't make me
break the law.

692
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:52,314
Isn't it weird?

693
00:44:52,398 --> 00:44:54,525
No one survived the collapse.

694
00:44:54,608 --> 00:44:57,277
Assemblyman Oh's location at the time
is unexplainable.

695
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:02,700
How could a miracle that didn't happen
once to anyone else...

696
00:45:04,576 --> 00:45:06,537
happen twice?

697
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:16,213
SEONJIN REPUBLICAN PARTY

698
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:35,524
This is Yun Chan-gyeong.

699
00:45:36,859 --> 00:45:39,153
I have something that would interest you.

700
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:43,449
It'll probably be a good opportunity.

701
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:47,286
Then I'll have to seize that opportunity.

702
00:45:58,630 --> 00:45:59,798
Good night.

703
00:45:59,882 --> 00:46:02,801
Sir, please cut all the top news
of Part 2 of News Show.

704
00:46:02,885 --> 00:46:05,137
Why? Everyone put in their best effort

705
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:07,473
to put together the story
on Oh Yeong-seok's survival.

706
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:09,099
I have an exclusive.

707
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:12,770
The other media companies will be busy
writing follow-up stories for a week.

708
00:46:13,395 --> 00:46:14,438
Come on.

709
00:46:14,813 --> 00:46:18,066
Charm the viewers,
not the managing editor.

710
00:46:18,567 --> 00:46:19,610
What is it about?

711
00:46:19,902 --> 00:46:22,029
It's an exclusive interview
with President Park Mu-jin.

712
00:46:22,863 --> 00:46:24,031
President Park?

713
00:46:26,992 --> 00:46:28,202
You must have something.

714
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:38,378
-You have the location of Myung Hae-jun?
-Yes.

715
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:42,341
He's at a dense forest called Senmonari
at the border of Cambodia.

716
00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:46,345
It's where Myung Hae-jun
was a mercenary in the past.

717
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:51,391
After being purged
by the authorities of North Korea,

718
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:53,143
Myung Hae-jun defected

719
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:55,854
and apparently chose
a location where he stayed in the past.

720
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:00,859
Please ask Cambodia for assistance.

721
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:03,654
Request them for extradition
of Myung Hae-jun.

722
00:47:06,365 --> 00:47:09,660
The Cambodian government
is expressing disapproval.

723
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:14,790
The forest is a powder keg that
they've been disputing over with Vietnam.

724
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:19,711
They're worried that
sending in Cambodian troops

725
00:47:19,795 --> 00:47:23,632
to catch Myung Hae-jun would spark
a border dispute with Vietnam.

726
00:47:27,427 --> 00:47:28,720
We'll go.

727
00:47:30,305 --> 00:47:34,434
We'll send Troop 707
and NIS black ops agents

728
00:47:35,894 --> 00:47:38,272
to bring Myung Hae-jun back alive.

729
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:42,609
I've learned that is an intrusion
on Cambodian territory.

730
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:45,445
-It could cause a dispute.
-That's right.

731
00:47:45,571 --> 00:47:48,448
Troop 707 and our black ops agents

732
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:50,325
are highly trained people.

733
00:47:50,742 --> 00:47:53,287
If they secretly go through the jungle,

734
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:54,830
it could be possible.

735
00:47:55,622 --> 00:47:58,917
Do you know why North Korea
still denies responsibility

736
00:47:59,793 --> 00:48:01,086
for the Rangoong bombing?

737
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:08,010
It's because we weren't able
to catch the bombers ourselves.

738
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:11,513
If we don't catch Myung Hae-jun,

739
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:15,976
we'll repeat our mistake in history.

740
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:23,984
Deliver the thoughts of our military

741
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:27,362
to the Cambodian government.

742
00:48:27,863 --> 00:48:29,656
However, we can't move our troops

743
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:31,658
without their consent.

744
00:48:33,035 --> 00:48:35,162
Do you not want to catch Myung Hae-jun?

745
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:42,419
As much I want to catch him

746
00:48:43,045 --> 00:48:44,463
for national security,

747
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:46,548
I can't allow our troops

748
00:48:47,382 --> 00:48:49,635
to go to Cambodia for the same reason.

749
00:48:49,801 --> 00:48:50,636
This...

750
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:54,556
is an order as Commander-in-Chief,

751
00:48:54,973 --> 00:48:56,099
General Lee.

752
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:12,282
What's worse than a soldier
that was defeated in war...

753
00:49:14,493 --> 00:49:17,621
is a commander that learned nothing
through that defeat.

754
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:20,540
President Park is that kind of commander.

755
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:25,128
And I don't intend to follow
the orders of someone like that.

756
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:28,006
It sounds like you're considering
disobeying him.

757
00:49:56,952 --> 00:50:00,122
I think this was a first
since you were inaugurated.

758
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:04,501
Seeing you this firm.

759
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:11,299
The Presidents I served
were one or the other.

760
00:50:13,635 --> 00:50:16,513
They're either overly confident or timid.

761
00:50:20,225 --> 00:50:21,226
Which one

762
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:23,770
do you think I am?

763
00:50:29,568 --> 00:50:31,528
An exclusive interview
with President Park?

764
00:50:31,611 --> 00:50:34,114
TBN NEWS SHOW PART 2
INTERVIEW WITH PRESIDENT PARK

765
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:39,536
On News Show, and live at that?

766
00:50:42,789 --> 00:50:44,332
Let's not waste our energy.

767
00:50:44,416 --> 00:50:45,751
He doesn't like being on camera,

768
00:50:45,834 --> 00:50:47,335
and he isn't used to going on live.

769
00:50:47,419 --> 00:50:49,129
He wouldn't agree to do this.

770
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:54,509
Persuade your boss.

771
00:50:54,593 --> 00:50:57,763
Help me out. As one
low man on the totem pole to another.

772
00:50:58,346 --> 00:50:59,264
That's proper ethics.

773
00:51:01,183 --> 00:51:02,476
It's 4 p.m., Ms. Woo.

774
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:05,228
Is it proper ethics to ask now
to prepare for a 7 p.m. news?

775
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:09,816
Then I have no choice.

776
00:51:10,984 --> 00:51:12,778
I cut all the other news items

777
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:15,614
and I can't have them air nothing
during the news.

778
00:51:15,781 --> 00:51:16,865
What about this?

779
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:19,993
"Why did North Korea admit
to the bombing in a video?"

780
00:51:27,375 --> 00:51:29,127
Who was it? Who told you that?

781
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:32,047
Sources are my breadline.
I can't divulge that.

782
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:34,591
You won't be able to
write an article on that video.

783
00:51:34,674 --> 00:51:35,717
We'll put an embargo on it.

784
00:51:35,801 --> 00:51:37,219
I'll break the embargo.

785
00:51:37,886 --> 00:51:41,056
If I write it, the rest of the press
will follow.

786
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:44,935
Is it okay if you are banned
from here forever?

787
00:51:54,736 --> 00:51:57,948
My goal is to be an investigative
reporter, not a Blue House reporter.

788
00:52:10,585 --> 00:52:11,837
I'm against this.

789
00:52:12,045 --> 00:52:14,005
President Park isn't used to the media.

790
00:52:14,589 --> 00:52:16,424
We have to stop the leak of the video.

791
00:52:18,093 --> 00:52:20,470
What if there is an unexpected situation
while he's live?

792
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:22,139
Why take that risk?

793
00:52:22,222 --> 00:52:25,809
Don't you know his political career
will be over if this video gets out?

794
00:52:29,479 --> 00:52:30,480
Look.

795
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:34,401
Aren't all of you curious
about who leaked the video

796
00:52:34,484 --> 00:52:35,986
to Woo Sin-yeong?

797
00:52:36,069 --> 00:52:37,320
Who could it be?

798
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:38,822
It's obvious.

799
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:41,533
General Lee Gwan-muk,

800
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:43,326
NIS Director Ji Yun-bae,

801
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:44,744
and Assemblywoman Yun Chan-gyeong.

802
00:52:57,048 --> 00:52:58,383
What time do we go live?

803
00:52:58,967 --> 00:52:59,801
Mr. President?

804
00:53:00,385 --> 00:53:01,344
Tell them

805
00:53:02,554 --> 00:53:03,471
I'll do the interview.

806
00:53:03,555 --> 00:53:05,265
-What?
-Yes, sir. What?

807
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:11,938
It is my decision.

808
00:53:13,148 --> 00:53:14,524
I'll take responsibility.

809
00:53:22,324 --> 00:53:24,618
STATE OF THE NATION ADDRESS
WHERE ASSEMBLYMAN OH WAS RESCUED

810
00:53:29,497 --> 00:53:31,583
Na-gyeong, I have something to show you.

811
00:53:39,257 --> 00:53:41,676
This is a photo of the seats
taken with a cell phone.

812
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:44,221
It was saved on the cloud by that victim.

813
00:53:45,263 --> 00:53:46,848
Assemblyman Oh's seat...

814
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:49,935
is here.

815
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:56,650
You were right.

816
00:54:01,279 --> 00:54:02,906
It wasn't a miracle.

817
00:54:04,991 --> 00:54:07,202
Assemblyman Oh knew...

818
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:12,165
that the National Assembly Building
would explode.

819
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:18,546
Five minutes until we go live.

820
00:54:28,723 --> 00:54:30,475
Three minutes.

821
00:54:33,645 --> 00:54:35,021
Here comes President Park.

822
00:54:37,232 --> 00:54:38,900
Hello. Good afternoon.

823
00:54:40,277 --> 00:54:42,946
Mr. President, have some water.

824
00:54:43,029 --> 00:54:44,489
Take a deep breath.

825
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:49,160
Have some water.

826
00:54:49,244 --> 00:54:50,287
Yes, thank you.

827
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:52,747
Are you okay, sir?

828
00:54:53,748 --> 00:54:56,293
Go over the questionnaire carefully
one more time.

829
00:54:57,877 --> 00:54:58,920
Where is the questionnaire?

830
00:55:00,422 --> 00:55:01,756
-Where did it go?
-I...

831
00:55:04,217 --> 00:55:05,218
Here.

832
00:55:08,555 --> 00:55:09,931
Don't worry about it.

833
00:55:10,432 --> 00:55:12,017
I'll do my best.

834
00:55:15,478 --> 00:55:16,604
Here.

835
00:55:18,857 --> 00:55:20,233
You'll be in front of cameras,

836
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:22,902
but you just have to be yourself.

837
00:55:23,737 --> 00:55:25,572
If they realize what you're like,

838
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:27,282
it'll be hard for people to dislike you.

839
00:55:28,074 --> 00:55:29,075
Since you

840
00:55:30,243 --> 00:55:31,453
are a good person.

841
00:55:41,463 --> 00:55:43,006
Can we trust you,

842
00:55:43,089 --> 00:55:44,299
Ms. Woo?

843
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:47,177
I hope you don't put the President

844
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:50,555
in awkward situations by asking
questions not on the questionnaire.

845
00:55:51,556 --> 00:55:54,267
Like asking about the video

846
00:55:54,351 --> 00:55:55,727
for example?

847
00:55:55,810 --> 00:55:58,021
It concerns national security.

848
00:55:58,855 --> 00:56:00,690
I'll trust the conscience of a journalist.

849
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:10,950
Do you still think honesty
is your political choice, sir?

850
00:56:12,118 --> 00:56:14,287
Honesty becomes your weakness
in this world.

851
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:15,789
And when you show your weakness,

852
00:56:15,872 --> 00:56:17,749
you get attacked without fail,

853
00:56:17,832 --> 00:56:20,835
just like Assemblywoman Yun Chan-gyeong
made you a target of attack.

854
00:57:30,071 --> 00:57:31,781
I still have much room for improvement,

855
00:57:31,865 --> 00:57:33,450
but I ask for your trust and support.

856
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:37,454
As a citizen,
I'll be rooting for you as well.

857
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:42,750
There was a single survivor
of the tragedy.

858
00:57:42,834 --> 00:57:45,837
The survival of Assemblyman Oh
was a miracle.

859
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:47,046
What do you think?

860
00:57:48,256 --> 00:57:49,799
I believe

861
00:57:50,008 --> 00:57:52,760
it is a message of hope
in grave times like these.

862
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:56,723
I'll try my best to help
our nation get back on her feet

863
00:57:56,806 --> 00:57:59,684
with hope and anticipation
during this time of crisis.

864
00:58:00,602 --> 00:58:02,520
Time is almost up.

865
00:58:03,521 --> 00:58:06,357
Thank you for making time
to do this interview.

866
00:58:09,861 --> 00:58:12,071
PRESIDENT PARK MU-JIN,
ACTING PRESIDENT PARK MU-JIN

867
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:15,658
President Park's interview
is the top trending search term right now.

868
00:58:15,992 --> 00:58:18,369
"TBN News Show
receives highest viewership."

869
00:58:18,453 --> 00:58:19,621
I've never seen this before.

870
00:58:19,704 --> 00:58:21,581
This means he did well, right?

871
00:58:23,625 --> 00:58:25,960
Camera one is ready.

872
00:58:26,628 --> 00:58:27,629
And go.

873
00:58:27,712 --> 00:58:30,507
According to an announcement
of a polling organization this morning,

874
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:35,720
there seems to be quite some people that
want you to run for President next term.

875
00:58:35,803 --> 00:58:38,056
After seeing a beginner at politics

876
00:58:38,139 --> 00:58:41,017
become a presidential candidate
within three days,

877
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:43,686
some wonder if you consider
your role as Acting President

878
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:47,982
to be a stepping stone
to the presidency next term.

879
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:51,528
Do you plan to run for presidency
next term?

880
00:58:53,738 --> 00:58:56,908
As a public official,
I don't think it is appropriate

881
00:58:56,991 --> 00:58:58,743
to discuss the next presidential term.

882
00:58:58,826 --> 00:59:01,913
I'll do my best as Acting President

883
00:59:02,121 --> 00:59:04,290
until my term ends.

884
00:59:05,124 --> 00:59:06,125
I see.

885
00:59:06,626 --> 00:59:09,337
You are a man of principle as I heard.

886
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:13,800
However, the public already thinks of you

887
00:59:13,883 --> 00:59:16,177
as a presidential candidate,

888
00:59:16,261 --> 00:59:19,681
so I don't think you can avoid
inspection by the press.

889
00:59:20,181 --> 00:59:23,434
Inspection? She never mentioned that.

890
00:59:23,685 --> 00:59:24,852
Did she?

891
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:29,274
I have one last question for you.

892
00:59:32,902 --> 00:59:35,321
On the morning
of the National Assembly Building tragedy,

893
00:59:36,030 --> 00:59:38,658
I heard you were relieved of your post

894
00:59:38,741 --> 00:59:40,952
as Minister of Environment
by the late President Yang.

895
00:59:41,035 --> 00:59:42,161
Is that true?

896
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:45,582
Tell him not to answer.

897
00:59:45,665 --> 00:59:47,792
Stop airing this.
She wasn't supposed to ask that.

898
00:59:47,875 --> 00:59:50,378
What?
It would be catastrophic to air dead air.

899
00:59:50,962 --> 00:59:52,630
It's best to continue airing it.

900
00:59:52,714 --> 00:59:53,715
What the...

901
00:59:56,884 --> 00:59:58,636
DON'T ANSWER HER

902
01:00:02,098 --> 01:00:03,891
If this is true,

903
01:00:03,975 --> 01:00:07,729
will the people of our nation
be able to accept you

904
01:00:07,812 --> 01:00:09,814
as the head of administration?

905
01:00:11,316 --> 01:00:12,900
This was her plan from the start.

906
01:00:12,984 --> 01:00:14,152
Who did this?

907
01:00:14,402 --> 01:00:16,904
Who used his dismissal to set this trap?

908
01:00:20,825 --> 01:00:23,119
Woo Sin-yeong is quite something.

909
01:00:35,381 --> 01:00:38,885
IS IT TRUE YOU WERE DISMISSED
AS MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENT?

910
01:00:38,968 --> 01:00:39,969
I wonder

911
01:00:41,179 --> 01:00:42,555
if he really is a good person

912
01:00:43,222 --> 01:00:44,932
as they say.

913
01:00:56,194 --> 01:00:58,780
Members of Troop 707 stand by

914
01:00:58,863 --> 01:01:01,199
so you can go to Cambodia upon my order.

915
01:01:03,451 --> 01:01:04,952
President Park

916
01:01:05,328 --> 01:01:07,664
isn't qualified as Commander-in-Chief.

917
01:01:21,719 --> 01:01:23,012
Don't you watch the news?

918
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:25,390
I set everything up for you.

919
01:01:26,015 --> 01:01:28,101
Aren't you curious about his answer?

920
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:34,148
That's not important.

921
01:01:34,982 --> 01:01:38,444
He's finished, now that everyone knows
he was dismissed.

922
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:48,079
Do you admit you were dismissed?

923
01:01:53,793 --> 01:01:55,294
Please answer me, Mr. President.

924
01:01:56,337 --> 01:01:57,171
Is it true?

925
01:02:05,972 --> 01:02:07,640
DON'T ANSWER HER.
DENY IT.

926
01:02:39,255 --> 01:02:40,173
Yes, it's true.

927
01:03:19,545 --> 01:03:22,173
All the trending search terms
and related stories

928
01:03:22,256 --> 01:03:23,633
are regarding your dismissal.

929
01:03:23,716 --> 01:03:26,344
The people will doubt your competence.

930
01:03:26,427 --> 01:03:31,307
Do you truly believe that I can entrust
this country's safety to your hands?

931
01:03:31,390 --> 01:03:35,019
Assemblyman Oh might have known
in advance about the attack.

932
01:03:35,102 --> 01:03:37,188
He's a miraculous survivor.

933
01:03:37,271 --> 01:03:38,481
He's loved by the people.

934
01:03:38,564 --> 01:03:40,274
At the time of the bombing,

935
01:03:40,358 --> 01:03:42,318
where were you and what were you doing?
