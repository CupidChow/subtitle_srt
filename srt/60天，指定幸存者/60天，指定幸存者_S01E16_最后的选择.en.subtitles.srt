1
00:00:53,678 --> 00:01:00,602
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
PLACES AND EVENTS ARE FICTIONAL

2
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:08,735
Then keep your promise.

3
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:10,862
The VIP.

4
00:01:13,656 --> 00:01:16,618
Who is the mastermind behind the attack?

5
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:19,496
The VIP is...

6
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:26,795
The VIP is...

7
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:28,671
me.

8
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:34,552
What did he say?

9
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,055
It's me.

10
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:40,725
It's no one else.

11
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:43,937
It's me,
the person sitting in front of you.

12
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:54,364
Are you saying that you single-handedly
came up with the Assembly Building bombing

13
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:57,283
and put it into action?

14
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:03,039
I was against President Yang's policy
toward North Korea and planned it.

15
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:07,502
I disapproved of his economic policy
and funded it.

16
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:12,298
I despised him
for compromising with reality

17
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:13,842
and took part in the bombing.

18
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,096
President Yang's government

19
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:21,015
wasn't welcome anywhere.

20
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:23,685
Also,

21
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:28,189
this nation created numerous people
that wanted to get revenge.

22
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,193
Those people willingly

23
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:34,737
turned my plan into reality.

24
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:39,367
However,

25
00:02:40,034 --> 00:02:41,911
the plan wouldn't have been complete

26
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:46,541
if you weren't there at the beginning

27
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:49,252
and end of the attack,

28
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:51,796
President Park.

29
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:02,891
Park Mu-jin.

30
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:07,103
You helped complete the attack.

31
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:24,245
President Park's press conference
is at 2 p.m. tomorrow, right?

32
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:25,246
Yes.

33
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:30,209
His term will end in a day,
24 hours to be exact.

34
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:34,714
The press conference tomorrow
may be about his resignation,

35
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:36,674
but it's actually to announce

36
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:38,509
his candidacy.

37
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:42,180
He stopped the coup

38
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:45,391
and succeeded in arresting
the key suspect for the bombing.

39
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:49,979
It's a relief he produced tangible results
at the end of his term.

40
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:52,398
I hope it affects his ratings.

41
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:55,610
Secretary Cha.

42
00:03:57,987 --> 00:04:01,574
We have today's approval ratings of

43
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:04,369
the presidential candidates.

44
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:08,414
How does it look?

45
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,211
It's 11 percent.

46
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,431
Well,

47
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:28,643
it's okay.

48
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:31,813
We can work harder
during the official campaign period.

49
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:36,693
How much harder do we have to work?

50
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:41,072
President Park is 11 percent
ahead of Assemblywoman Yun,

51
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:44,450
becoming the most popular candidate
once again.

52
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:48,037
When people found out
he was working with her,

53
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:52,041
the approval rating seemed to have gone up
for his leadership.

54
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:54,544
Goodness.

55
00:04:56,337 --> 00:04:58,715
I thought his approval rating
was 11 percent.

56
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:01,217
Secretary Cha,

57
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:05,138
you don't look surprised at all.

58
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:08,558
You didn't even flinch.
Are you even human?

59
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:12,520
You both should hire lawyers.

60
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:13,771
I'm going to sue you

61
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:16,190
for attempted murder by gross negligence.

62
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:18,568
You almost gave me a heart attack.

63
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:21,487
Now he totally seems human.

64
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:25,116
Did the president see the result?

65
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,534
No.

66
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:29,245
He hasn't returned yet.

67
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:31,205
Did he go somewhere?

68
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:33,958
I thought he didn't have anything
scheduled for this afternoon.

69
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:39,505
What do you mean?

70
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:42,633
How did I help complete the attack?

71
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:47,555
It looks like you didn't see this coming

72
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,559
when you're the biggest beneficiary
of the bombing.

73
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,276
You said you're the VIP.

74
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:02,570
Then...

75
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:06,908
do you mean you used me
to complete the plan?

76
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:09,744
I have

77
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,914
never seen you before.

78
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,043
The bombing didn't just occur

79
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:20,505
because of the person that planned it.

80
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,758
Someone who knew it would happen,

81
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:26,427
but overlooked it, is also responsible.

82
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:30,014
That person completed

83
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:32,975
the attack through you.

84
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:34,477
Who is this person?

85
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:36,979
A pardon.

86
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:41,025
I want you to promise me a pardon.

87
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:44,112
Then I'll tell you who it is.

88
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:48,199
I'll tell you

89
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,661
who completed the bombing through you.

90
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:12,098
DAY 31: THE LAST CHOICE
EPISODE 16

91
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:16,644
Can I grant him a pardon?

92
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,313
Yes, according to the 79th Amendment,
we could claim

93
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:21,023
the lack of the right of arraignment.

94
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,192
However, the problem is

95
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,820
that only the president
has the authority to grant a pardon.

96
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:28,823
You only have a day left

97
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:30,616
and the election is in a month.

98
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:34,454
Although you are currently
the leading candidate--

99
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:35,580
My promise

100
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,707
could be meaningless right now.

101
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:42,753
Even if it is legally possible,
would it be the right choice?

102
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,631
The bombing caused over 300 casualties.

103
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:48,176
People were hurt beyond imagination.

104
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,428
How could he ask for a pardon?

105
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:52,972
He can never be forgiven.

106
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,601
I think we could grant him a pardon

107
00:07:57,226 --> 00:07:59,437
if we could learn the truth
about the bombing.

108
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:03,274
We should leave
a precise record in history

109
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:05,776
on who and why
such a tragic attack occurred.

110
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:09,030
I agree.

111
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:13,367
If you can figure out
the whole story behind the attack,

112
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:15,953
you should grant the pardon.

113
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:19,957
If Mr. Kim starts talking today,

114
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,959
you will have figured out the truth

115
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:25,296
about the attack during your term, sir.

116
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:28,591
I'm sure it'll be helpful
for the election.

117
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:35,306
What do you think, Secretary Han?

118
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:39,894
I'm against it.

119
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:45,107
The national sentiment
will be against granting the pardon.

120
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:46,859
With the election coming up,

121
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:50,571
it is dangerous to make a choice
contrary to the national sentiment.

122
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:54,700
More than anything, Mayor Kang
and Assemblywoman Yun

123
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:58,454
will bring the pardon up
for their campaign.

124
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:00,873
They'll use legal terms

125
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:03,209
and call it abuse of authority.

126
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:05,753
They will try to cause controversy
during the election.

127
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,849
You shouldn't look forward to a pardon,

128
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:21,269
since the election is coming up.

129
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:24,230
The leading candidate,

130
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:27,733
as you should know,

131
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:30,570
won't make decisions
that will affect his approval ratings.

132
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:35,491
President Park only has a day
left in his term

133
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:38,494
and you're locked up here.

134
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:44,208
There is no reason for President Park
to rush to pardon you.

135
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:53,092
So from now on, whether you
confess or put a deal on the table,

136
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:57,096
you should talk to me.

137
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:14,697
If I can't settle it legally,

138
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:18,492
can't I settle it politically?

139
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:33,841
What could President Park be up to?

140
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:38,387
He wants to see me as a candidate,
not the mayor of Seoul.

141
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:43,309
He said he'd meet us
as a presidential candidate,

142
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:44,977
not the president as well.

143
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:46,562
I'm sure he has a reason.

144
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:51,025
You want our consent for a pardon?

145
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:54,070
Only the president has the right
to grant a pardon.

146
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:58,032
Through the presidential election
in a month,

147
00:10:58,449 --> 00:10:59,700
one of us will probably

148
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:01,452
become president.

149
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:06,624
Whoever becomes president,

150
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:10,002
if you promise Mr. Kim a pardon,

151
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:13,464
he will start talking about the truth
behind the bombing.

152
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:15,424
You want him to talk,

153
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:18,761
but stop us from talking.

154
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:22,598
Since the three presidential candidates
agreed to it,

155
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:25,935
you don't want us using it
in our presidential campaign.

156
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:31,857
Will you agree to it?

157
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:33,275
Wait a minute.

158
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:39,573
This places a heavy weight
on our shoulders politically.

159
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:42,410
This isn't an amnesty
for a political prisoner.

160
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:44,662
He's a heinous bomber.

161
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:47,498
Why should we cut him a deal

162
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:49,959
under our names?

163
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,256
Because this bombing

164
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:58,634
didn't begin from the spite
of one evil person.

165
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:04,223
What's more important
than convicting him is to

166
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,810
uncover the truth of the bombing.

167
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:12,815
Isn't it

168
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:16,610
our responsibility to find out?

169
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:30,749
AGREEMENT FOR PARDON

170
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,127
This will get Mr. Kim talking.

171
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:37,339
I'll make him talk,

172
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:39,258
since we have this agreement.

173
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:41,927
I hope you do.

174
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:02,114
Answer me.

175
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:06,911
What do you mean President Park
completed the bombing?

176
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:20,966
Why? What is it?

177
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:22,885
What is it?

178
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:24,094
Damn it.

179
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:38,817
Call an ambulance immediately!

180
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,333
-I'll go with him.
-Okay.

181
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:56,335
We're going too. Follow us.

182
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:07,263
Let's go.

183
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:22,695
Could Mr. Kim have had
a chronic heart disease?

184
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:26,282
Why is he suddenly having heart problems?

185
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,200
It seems weird.

186
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,115
He'll wake up soon.

187
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,730
What is going on?

188
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,482
Turn the car around!

189
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:39,540
Ji-won? We lost the ambulance.

190
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:40,791
Find out where it is.

191
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:43,544
Yes, we're at the traffic light
at the fork.

192
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:45,421
Wait.

193
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:48,007
My gosh. Do you not know how to drive?

194
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,508
The ambulance...

195
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:50,926
Move it.

196
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,094
Move your car now!

197
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:53,971
I can't locate it.

198
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:57,391
-I don't see it.
-Move your car immediately.

199
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,204
A helicopter will be here soon.

200
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:29,506
Show me your hands! Don't move!

201
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:53,947
There's a location Mr. Kim
used for a rendezvous nearby.

202
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:56,617
It's where he met Oh Yeong-seok.

203
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:59,119
Where is it?

204
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,330
Mr. Kim!

205
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:54,633
He's dead.

206
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:19,408
PARK MU-JIN, KANG SANG-GU, YUN CHAN-GYEONG

207
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,535
AGREEMENT FOR PARDON

208
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:25,956
Mr. Kim was the biggest lead
we had on the mastermind.

209
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:27,791
Someone silenced him.

210
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,668
The accomplice in the Blue House must

211
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:34,214
be someone that's more deeply involved
with the government than we think.

212
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:37,301
It doesn't matter who it is.

213
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:38,719
The important thing

214
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:42,431
is for us to find a lead
on Mr. Kim's killer

215
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:44,183
before the press conference.

216
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:46,518
Catching Mr. Kim alive

217
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:50,397
is your biggest achievement
during your term, sir.

218
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:57,613
Mr. Kang.

219
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,156
Yes?

220
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:01,283
Tell the NIS agents

221
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:05,370
to report to the Blue House

222
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:06,955
as soon as they find a lead.

223
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:19,426
Is he still pleading the Fifth?

224
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:22,679
Mr. Kim was given a drug
for cardiac arrest

225
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:24,389
to get him out of the interrogation room.

226
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:26,767
That agent's confidential files show that

227
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:30,229
he was a spy sent to the North
at the same time as Mr. Kim.

228
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:34,316
Why is he abusing skills
he obtained through work?

229
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:38,612
So are you saying
he tried to help Mr. Kim run away,

230
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:41,281
since they got through
a life-or-death situation together?

231
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:47,996
This is from a CCTV

232
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,082
near the location where Mr. Kim was shot.

233
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:54,336
That face.

234
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:56,255
It's Tae-ik,

235
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:58,215
I mean Lee Gyeong-pyo.

236
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:01,635
Did Lee Gyeong-pyo betray Mr. Kim,

237
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,428
the VIP?

238
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:04,554
Why?

239
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:07,975
Someone wanted to help Mr. Kim run away

240
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:10,227
from the NIS

241
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:14,231
and someone wanted to silence him forever.

242
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:18,777
What could Mr. Kim's relationship
with them be?

243
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:25,117
The bombing didn't just occur

244
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:27,828
because of the person that planned it.

245
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:29,997
Someone who knew it would happen,

246
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:32,833
but overlooked it, is also responsible.

247
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:34,167
That person completed

248
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:37,337
the attack through you.

249
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:40,674
AGREEMENT FOR PARDON

250
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:46,555
My report with a warning
regarding a possible attack

251
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:50,559
was systematically buried
in the NIS as well as in the Blue House.

252
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:52,144
Then...

253
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:56,189
are you saying the person
who handed this top secret file

254
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:58,025
over to those who orchestrated the attack

255
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:01,236
was someone
inside the Yang administration?

256
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:19,671
Up until now,

257
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:23,425
we only thought of the accomplice
in the Blue House

258
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:29,222
as the person who handed
the OP file over to the bomber.

259
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:30,807
That's right.

260
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:34,102
If someone overlooked the bombing
even when he knew about it

261
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:39,691
and covered up the warning
against the attack,

262
00:22:41,234 --> 00:22:43,570
wouldn't he be the accomplice
in the Blue House?

263
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,531
That means...

264
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:50,660
If you were Agent Kim Jun-o

265
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:55,373
and learned about the attack,
whom in the Blue House

266
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,001
would you report to?

267
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:12,974
This is Kang Dae-han of the security team.

268
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:15,977
Is it possible to get a list
of the phone numbers that called

269
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:18,855
the security team during the week
before the bombing?

270
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:20,816
SPEECHES OF THE PRESIDENTS

271
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:28,740
Take a look at this.

272
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:32,786
This is a video
made by editing suggestions

273
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:35,247
that were posted on the petition board.

274
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:38,583
I need a house to get married.

275
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:41,586
I'm looking to rent a house
in Seoul or Gyeonggi Province...

276
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,380
But I'll need to get a loan

277
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:45,257
and the conditions for a loan are strict.

278
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:48,969
I may never get married in this state.

279
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:51,555
It's been three years since I got married,

280
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:53,473
but I can't even imagine having kids.

281
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:55,851
My husband and I both have to work.

282
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:58,645
I really hope the disability rating system
will be abolished.

283
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:00,939
They say it will be,
but nothing has changed.

284
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:02,858
However, there was a budget cut.

285
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,235
I hope the government
can be more sensitive.

286
00:24:05,318 --> 00:24:06,403
I live in a different region

287
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:09,906
and it's sad to see that only Seoul
has a safety system for women.

288
00:24:10,198 --> 00:24:12,200
I wish we had a safe
delivery system for women

289
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:14,494
or a system to help us get home safely.

290
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:18,915
I really wish Korea would become a country

291
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:22,419
where old retirees can find new jobs.

292
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:25,589
I'm thinking of adding this

293
00:24:26,464 --> 00:24:27,883
at the end of the press conference.

294
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:33,680
These are suggestions made
after the bombing.

295
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:39,227
It's the expectations, hope and vision
they have for President Park.

296
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:40,687
I've been thinking about

297
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:46,359
what the president should say
at the end of the press conference.

298
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:47,360
Yes?

299
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:50,030
I gave it some thought.

300
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:56,286
What if he says something we can also use

301
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:59,039
as a catchphrase
for his presidential campaign?

302
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:01,208
Okay.

303
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,043
Let's hear it.

304
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,377
Okay.

305
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:08,840
All right.

306
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:12,886
This is a catchphrase

307
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:15,972
with a vision for a welfare state
in the 21st century.

308
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:20,810
"Let's all go

309
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:24,105
to a happy nation."

310
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:29,402
Something like that.

311
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:35,325
Unbelievable.

312
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:41,373
I know retro is the trend, but...

313
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:44,793
I didn't like it much either.

314
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:47,963
Next.

315
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:51,216
This one

316
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:54,344
is to show his will

317
00:25:55,095 --> 00:26:00,183
to reconstruct the nation
after the bombing.

318
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:02,811
Here it is.

319
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:06,731
"Fresh scenery

320
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:09,401
in the Republic of Korea."

321
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:13,655
That's not it, is it?

322
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:16,574
It can't be. Right? I hope not.

323
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:27,335
It's okay.

324
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:31,131
Hiring experts at the right time

325
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:36,511
is also an ability
the chief presidential secretary needs.

326
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:42,225
Why don't we

327
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:44,102
outsource it?

328
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,397
Gosh, Secretary Han.

329
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:48,982
This is

330
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:50,442
the last one.

331
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:54,404
I feel

332
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:58,867
that the people

333
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:01,661
should feel proud

334
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:05,373
about overcoming the attack.

335
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:08,960
Finally,

336
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:11,338
"Our pride,

337
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:14,966
the Republic of Korea."

338
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,596
I like it.

339
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:23,850
Nice.

340
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:30,857
All right.

341
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:34,194
I like it.

342
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:36,404
-It's nice.
-Really?

343
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:38,156
-Can we use the first one?
-No.

344
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,158
That was a joke.

345
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:42,786
It didn't sound like a joke.

346
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:45,455
You sounded dead serious.

347
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:47,624
I just thought of it.

348
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:49,292
Of course you did.

349
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:51,961
Would you like to go in for a minute?

350
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:54,297
I think they're preparing
for the press conference.

351
00:27:56,966 --> 00:27:59,677
I'll be interrupting them. Let's go.

352
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:37,257
Do you like it?

353
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:40,510
What's this?

354
00:28:41,928 --> 00:28:43,930
See if you like it.

355
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:52,605
I...

356
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:55,900
don't know yet.

357
00:28:57,694 --> 00:28:58,695
I'm not sure if you

358
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:04,075
can really become president
like people say you will,

359
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:09,497
or if I'll be able to stand living here

360
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:12,792
if we move back in.

361
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:19,299
However,

362
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:21,342
there is one thing I know.

363
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,389
It's your decision,

364
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:29,476
so it can't be wrong.

365
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:32,812
You'll always be right.

366
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:38,359
Is it my birthday today?

367
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:42,447
You gave me a present
and shared sweet words of wisdom.

368
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:43,907
I got lucky today.

369
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:46,993
You...

370
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:52,457
always look for the best answer
when there isn't a right one.

371
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:55,460
You never give up.

372
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:00,715
I won't be of much help,

373
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:04,344
but during everything

374
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:06,304
you go through,

375
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:08,306
I'll be there by your side,

376
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:12,560
especially when no one is applauding you.

377
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:16,773
Remember it.

378
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:23,071
And today

379
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,740
isn't your birthday.

380
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:27,617
It's our wedding anniversary.

381
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:41,005
Honey. Wait a minute. Listen to me.

382
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:46,719
President Park Mu-jin will end
his official schedule as acting president

383
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:50,807
for the past 30 days
with the press conference this afternoon.

384
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:54,269
He is currently
the leading presidential candidate.

385
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:55,854
What would you do, Na-gyeong?

386
00:30:57,605 --> 00:31:00,275
Let's say you're
the leading presidential candidate.

387
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:02,277
Someone you know,

388
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:05,071
but aren't aware of
is the mastermind behind the attack.

389
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:09,325
That's what the bombers said,
but it wasn't verified.

390
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:11,119
What if it's true?

391
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:14,122
Can he reveal the truth

392
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:17,709
when all that power
is practically within his reach?

393
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:25,383
PRESIDENT PARK OFFICIALLY
JOINS PRESIDENTIAL RACE

394
00:31:29,178 --> 00:31:30,013
Na-gyeong,

395
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,599
do you know what I just found out?

396
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:36,394
Ji-won, you should shake that habit.

397
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:38,980
Don't start with a question
when you're reporting to a superior.

398
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:40,732
Sit down.

399
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:43,985
Whether I start with a question
or a statement,

400
00:31:45,111 --> 00:31:48,740
just focus on what I have to tell you.

401
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:52,577
Mr. Kim and the other anti-North spies

402
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:56,956
filed a suit for damages
against the country in 2011.

403
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,541
And? Did they win?

404
00:31:58,625 --> 00:31:59,584
They lost.

405
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:03,880
A quite reputable human rights lawyer
represented them

406
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:06,382
and that lawyer

407
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:08,676
was someone we know.

408
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:20,021
Who was the lawyer?

409
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:33,201
Hello, Mr. Kang.

410
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:34,661
What...

411
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:43,169
March 4, on the morning of the bombing,
Agent Kim Jun-o

412
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:46,047
called the Deputy of the Security Team.

413
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:50,093
Are you saying

414
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:53,846
that he's the accomplice
within the Blue House

415
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:55,640
who covered up Agent Kim's report?

416
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:56,975
My guess is

417
00:32:57,642 --> 00:32:59,394
that after he received Agent Kim's call,

418
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:01,604
he discussed it with another person
at the Blue House.

419
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:04,273
With his mind at ease,

420
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:06,067
he then escorted the President out.

421
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:11,948
Through the cameras, I retraced his steps

422
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:15,827
before he left for
the National Assembly Building that day.

423
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:17,036
Here.

424
00:33:21,624 --> 00:33:22,709
This is Deputy Kim Jong-min

425
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:25,003
of the Security Team
who died in the bombing.

426
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:31,592
If this person,
who he reported the attack to,

427
00:33:32,218 --> 00:33:33,761
didn't disregard the warning

428
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:35,805
and cover it up,

429
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:38,141
the bombing

430
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:42,854
may have never occurred.

431
00:34:00,496 --> 00:34:03,583
ANTI-NORTH SPIES
LOSE IN COURT AGAINST STATE

432
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:07,879
The lawyer of the case...

433
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:10,548
It's the same person
who's currently at the Blue House,

434
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:11,924
right?

435
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:17,388
It was Chief Presidential Secretary

436
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:19,640
Han Ju-seung.

437
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:38,576
ATTORNEY HAN JU-SEUNG

438
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:40,787
The attorney of that case.

439
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:43,790
The person who ordered you
to help Mr. Kim escape.

440
00:34:48,961 --> 00:34:50,213
That attorney.

441
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:53,216
Is Secretary Han Ju-seung

442
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:55,426
the mastermind?

443
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:07,355
Can you believe it?

444
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:09,148
That's absurd.

445
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:11,943
But it's too noisy.

446
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:13,236
Seriously.

447
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:19,492
Hope is a good thing.

448
00:35:20,993 --> 00:35:22,745
It masks the hardship

449
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:26,415
and gives you the strength to start over.

450
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:29,836
It also gives you the courage

451
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:31,254
to live a new life.

452
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:34,966
To them,

453
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:38,678
you're their greatest hope.

454
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:40,513
Oh, I get it now.

455
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:41,681
Unbelievable.

456
00:35:41,764 --> 00:35:43,266
Gosh.

457
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:45,601
It's the same hope I tasted

458
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:49,564
when I met President Yang
back when I was a public prosecutor.

459
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:51,732
And now,

460
00:35:53,025 --> 00:35:54,819
I'm feeling the same hope

461
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:56,821
with you.

462
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:08,040
Could I have some of your time?

463
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:13,504
There's something I'd like to discuss.

464
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:41,073
On the day of the bombing,

465
00:36:41,824 --> 00:36:45,536
the Blue House Security Team
received a report of a potential attack.

466
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:50,166
The report came from

467
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:52,126
Agent Kim Jun-o of the NIS.

468
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:57,089
Agent Kim Jun-o reported to
the Deputy of the Security Team

469
00:36:57,381 --> 00:37:00,676
that the top secret file of OP 5015-18

470
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:03,095
was in the hands of those
who could do harm

471
00:37:03,846 --> 00:37:07,308
and that they were plotting to attack
the National Assembly Building

472
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:09,602
as it is demonstrated on the file.

473
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:12,396
Even though Deputy Kim

474
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,732
was informed of this attack,

475
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:18,903
he still escorted President Yang
to the National Assembly Building.

476
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:23,491
Why do you think he did?

477
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:31,582
It's because

478
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:34,252
someone told him it was a hoax report

479
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:36,921
and put his mind at ease.

480
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:39,423
That day,

481
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:43,636
after Deputy Kim
received Agent Kim's call,

482
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:46,222
he met with someone before leaving for

483
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:48,057
the National Assembly.

484
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,558
It was me.

485
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:04,949
Do you know where Secretary Han went?

486
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:07,034
He was here just a minute ago.

487
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,997
He was talking to President Park.

488
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,331
Maybe they left together.

489
00:38:12,915 --> 00:38:14,417
Mr. Cha, don't you know?

490
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:18,004
I saw them together
a moment ago too, but...

491
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:21,340
Gosh.

492
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:22,967
Is something up?

493
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:24,802
Why?

494
00:38:26,178 --> 00:38:27,722
What was your reason?

495
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:30,975
You knew about the bombing.

496
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:34,645
President Yang was your friend
and a political ally--

497
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:35,730
This country

498
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:39,358
isn't worthy of a President like him.

499
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:48,367
Impatient, selfish,

500
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:49,744
and greedy.

501
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:52,955
The people of this nation
don't know how to be patient.

502
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:55,041
To those people,

503
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:57,877
President Yang and his view of democracy

504
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:00,880
was more than what they deserved.

505
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:04,008
President Yang's approval ratings

506
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:07,553
during his time in the office proves that.

507
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:10,056
President Yang and I...

508
00:39:12,224 --> 00:39:13,517
failed.

509
00:39:15,936 --> 00:39:17,772
I devoted my life

510
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:21,400
and put my faith
in the people of this nation.

511
00:39:23,235 --> 00:39:24,653
They are the ones

512
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:27,740
who betrayed us first.

513
00:39:29,241 --> 00:39:30,242
So...

514
00:39:31,577 --> 00:39:33,788
Was blowing up
the National Assembly Building

515
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:37,500
your way of seeking revenge
against the people?

516
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:38,876
I decided upon

517
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:42,755
a governing style
which well suited this nation.

518
00:39:45,132 --> 00:39:47,802
The most formidable type of power

519
00:39:50,262 --> 00:39:52,348
is fear and terror.

520
00:39:56,268 --> 00:39:57,561
The people

521
00:39:57,895 --> 00:40:00,564
fear and obey those

522
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:03,526
who reign over or govern them.

523
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:06,153
That's what I learned

524
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:09,281
through our failures.

525
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:12,576
By choosing someone like Minister Oh

526
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:14,328
to govern this country?

527
00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:17,373
Until

528
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:21,419
he won over the people
and became elected as the new President,

529
00:40:22,044 --> 00:40:24,046
you needed someone to manage this ship.

530
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:28,592
It's why you needed a puppet
who didn't know anything about politics.

531
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:32,888
You used me

532
00:40:33,889 --> 00:40:35,015
to complete

533
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:37,685
your grand attack

534
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:43,941
by joining forces with those
who you have been opposed to

535
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:46,277
all your life.

536
00:40:49,738 --> 00:40:50,906
None of them

537
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:54,702
are left in this world now.

538
00:40:56,203 --> 00:40:57,830
From this moment on,

539
00:40:58,914 --> 00:41:00,916
my plan is for you to take this seat

540
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:02,877
as Korea's President.

541
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:06,547
Do you want to be remembered

542
00:41:07,381 --> 00:41:09,842
as the one who completed this bombing

543
00:41:10,259 --> 00:41:11,260
or...

544
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:14,680
would you like to be remembered as

545
00:41:15,097 --> 00:41:17,433
the admirable President
who restored this nation?

546
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:21,187
It's your choice.

547
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:28,194
President Park should do
a dry run of his press conference.

548
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:30,321
His talk with Secretary Han
is taking a while.

549
00:41:30,404 --> 00:41:31,655
I wonder what it's about.

550
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:33,449
Don't you know anything?

551
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:37,244
How long do we have?

552
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:40,247
We might have to omit the dry run.

553
00:41:57,598 --> 00:41:58,933
Are you nervous

554
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:01,143
about the press conference?

555
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:06,315
Oh, I see it's already time.

556
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:08,484
Is it because

557
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:11,570
of the accomplice within the Blue House?

558
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:16,367
There's no need to worry about that, sir.

559
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,329
Nothing would be better than having

560
00:42:20,412 --> 00:42:23,874
the NIS reveal the accomplice
before your press conference.

561
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:26,752
It will be the best gift possible.

562
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:29,922
However, even if that's not the case,

563
00:42:30,005 --> 00:42:31,340
it'll still be all right.

564
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:34,593
We have another special event prepared.

565
00:42:42,434 --> 00:42:44,520
I've been searching for a job
while working part-time.

566
00:42:44,603 --> 00:42:46,272
I feel hopeless whenever I think about

567
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:47,439
continuing to live this way.

568
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:50,526
These are what the people wish for.

569
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:56,574
I'm upset whenever
my child is made fun of at school.

570
00:42:56,865 --> 00:42:59,785
I wish for a country that makes

571
00:43:00,202 --> 00:43:02,871
our schools safe for children like mine.

572
00:43:03,455 --> 00:43:04,748
I'm worried about my later years.

573
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:07,793
Educating my children
and supporting my parents

574
00:43:08,377 --> 00:43:10,462
will leave me

575
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:13,382
with nothing when I grow old.

576
00:43:13,465 --> 00:43:17,011
Whenever adults tell me
to go to a top university,

577
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:19,013
it feels like I'm standing on the edge
of a cliff.

578
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:22,016
Why must going to good colleges
dictate the rest of our lives?

579
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,101
It seems like

580
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:26,770
we'll have a lot to work on

581
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:28,564
in the future.

582
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:42,036
Sir?

583
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:46,999
Agent Han Na-gyeong
is waiting for you in your office.

ANTI-NORTH SPIES
LOSE IN COURT AGAINST STATE

585
00:44:09,521 --> 00:44:12,691
FORMER ANTI-NORTH SPY KIM SU-HYEON

586
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:16,111
ATTORNEY HAN JU-SEUNG

587
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:18,072
According to our investigation,

588
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:20,783
the accomplice within the Blue House

589
00:44:21,283 --> 00:44:23,952
turned out to be
former Chief Presidential Secretary Han.

590
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:30,042
Should we request help from

591
00:44:30,125 --> 00:44:32,044
the police and prosecutors
and investigate openly?

592
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:35,422
How many people

593
00:44:35,798 --> 00:44:37,132
know about your recent findings?

594
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:41,387
Currently, only us three
of the NIS Terrorism Task Force.

595
00:44:42,721 --> 00:44:45,599
Until I order otherwise,

596
00:44:45,891 --> 00:44:49,061
please keep these findings
between yourselves.

597
00:44:51,313 --> 00:44:53,482
Yes, sir.

ANTI-NORTH SPIES
LOSE IN COURT AGAINST STATE

599
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:38,235
From this moment on,

600
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:40,904
my plan is for you to take this seat

601
00:45:41,447 --> 00:45:42,948
as Korea's President.

602
00:45:58,881 --> 00:46:00,090
Don't tell me

603
00:46:00,674 --> 00:46:02,593
you're thinking about
confessing to the world

604
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:05,179
that I took part in the recent bombing

605
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:10,100
and that you were a part
of the grand puzzle too.

606
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:14,980
The people of this nation believe
that they overcame this tragedy with you.

607
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:16,940
Do you wish

608
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:19,485
to trample on that hope?

609
00:46:19,568 --> 00:46:23,489
They will feel more betrayed
than they did after the bombing.

610
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:25,657
Think about your secretaries.

611
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:30,204
They are dreaming of a chance
to build a new Korea with you.

612
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:33,332
Will you choose to let them down?

613
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:35,459
They...

614
00:46:37,169 --> 00:46:38,629
don't deserve that.

615
00:46:50,098 --> 00:46:52,768
Moreover, you're the kind of person

616
00:46:54,186 --> 00:46:57,397
who values being remembered
as someone respectful.

617
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:13,455
Secretary Han...

618
00:47:14,206 --> 00:47:15,415
You're a monster.

619
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:17,376
And I will continue to be one.

620
00:47:18,377 --> 00:47:19,586
You just sit there

621
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:21,630
and execute your views.

622
00:47:22,297 --> 00:47:24,383
Be the face of the people
like you've always wanted.

623
00:47:26,802 --> 00:47:28,387
The next generation to come

624
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:30,931
will fight in a better arena

625
00:47:31,431 --> 00:47:34,268
with better and more decent opponents.

626
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:36,812
That is

627
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:40,315
what I believe to be true patriotism

628
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:43,902
which will not make
those sacrifices be in vain.

629
00:47:47,197 --> 00:47:48,615
You killed too many

630
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:52,536
in the name of patriotism.

631
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:53,954
Without sacrifice,

632
00:47:54,913 --> 00:47:56,415
there can be no revolution.

633
00:48:00,168 --> 00:48:01,795
Punish me if you want.

634
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:05,007
I won't fight
the charges you bring upon me.

635
00:48:06,174 --> 00:48:08,844
I truly fear nothing, you see.

636
00:48:09,761 --> 00:48:10,721
However,

637
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:14,933
I will only let you do so
after the election is over.

638
00:48:17,185 --> 00:48:18,895
Don't you want to see

639
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:22,899
the new Korea
you, I, and the young secretaries

640
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:25,193
will build?

641
00:48:57,184 --> 00:48:58,226
Mr. Park.

642
00:48:59,728 --> 00:49:00,687
Yes, sir?

643
00:49:01,146 --> 00:49:04,316
Please inform Mr. Kim that I have arrived.

644
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:06,234
Yes, sir.

645
00:49:11,531 --> 00:49:13,325
I see you've made up your mind.

646
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:16,703
Did you make a choice?

647
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:27,339
I don't want to be remembered

648
00:49:29,257 --> 00:49:31,093
as a piece of this puzzle you created.

649
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:36,807
Will you wait for me in my office?

650
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:47,192
Sir?

651
00:49:47,943 --> 00:49:49,152
It's time.

652
00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:14,344
My fellow Koreans,

653
00:50:15,721 --> 00:50:17,222
greetings.

654
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:19,474
I am Park Mu-jin,

655
00:50:20,267 --> 00:50:21,727
the Acting President of Korea.

656
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:24,730
Today,

657
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:29,735
I stand before you to announce
my resignation as Acting President.

658
00:50:31,611 --> 00:50:33,029
It is

659
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:36,533
to officially announce my running

660
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:38,869
in the 21st presidential election.

661
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:49,838
PRESIDENT PARK ANNOUNCES CANDIDACY

662
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:03,518
My fellow Koreans,

663
00:51:07,272 --> 00:51:09,357
however, I will

664
00:51:10,442 --> 00:51:11,943
not run

665
00:51:13,653 --> 00:51:15,280
for President of Korea.

666
00:51:19,534 --> 00:51:20,535
What?

667
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:31,922
That's not the speech I wrote.

668
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:42,307
BLUE HOUSE

669
00:51:43,725 --> 00:51:45,852
RESIGNATION FROM OFFICE SPEECH

670
00:51:58,031 --> 00:51:59,741
RESIGNATION FROM OFFICE SPEECH

671
00:51:59,825 --> 00:52:01,451
The accomplice

672
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:04,287
who played a part

673
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:06,540
in the National Assembly Building bombing

674
00:52:07,582 --> 00:52:10,836
is a current member
of the Presidential Secretariat.

675
00:52:13,755 --> 00:52:16,341
As a member of this administration myself,

676
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:18,677
I must be held accountable

677
00:52:19,427 --> 00:52:21,012
for his actions as well.

678
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:31,773
I truly believe that we can overcome
the sorrows and hardships of the bombing.

679
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:34,901
Just like we've always been,

680
00:52:35,944 --> 00:52:36,945
we now face another task.

681
00:52:37,362 --> 00:52:41,199
The task of electing our next President.

682
00:52:43,368 --> 00:52:44,452
This election

683
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:47,706
won't be a stairway to heaven.

684
00:52:48,206 --> 00:52:50,458
It can't possibly make Korea a paradise

685
00:52:51,084 --> 00:52:54,504
that is free from all agony,
unfairness, and irregularities.

686
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:58,049
However, we can't deny

687
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:03,555
that an election
is the basic standard of democracy.

688
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:10,478
For this upcoming presidential election
to be fair and transparent,

689
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:14,482
I will fully execute my duties
as Acting President

690
00:53:14,774 --> 00:53:17,736
until my term officially ends.

691
00:53:26,745 --> 00:53:28,163
In every moment of our lives,

692
00:53:28,997 --> 00:53:29,998
the Republic of Korea

693
00:53:31,666 --> 00:53:32,667
must be

694
00:53:33,668 --> 00:53:34,753
a country

695
00:53:38,006 --> 00:53:39,841
we all take pride in.

696
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:06,785
PRESIDENT PARK ANNOUNCES CANDIDACY

697
00:54:07,786 --> 00:54:09,955
If President Park had entered the race,

698
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:13,583
I would've had a tough time winning.

699
00:54:16,211 --> 00:54:17,879
PRESIDENT PARK ANNOUNCES CANDIDACY

700
00:54:19,172 --> 00:54:22,217
He truly is an unbeatable opponent.

701
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:31,810
Should I ask him to join me?

702
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:34,479
After his term ends, of course.

703
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:38,775
Recruiting talent is what I do, remember?

704
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:56,835
Once again,

705
00:54:56,918 --> 00:54:59,504
you chose to be
the good guy in this scenario.

706
00:55:01,464 --> 00:55:04,009
My good will
is not what I based this decision on.

707
00:55:06,052 --> 00:55:09,014
The laws and regulations
that operate this nation

708
00:55:09,931 --> 00:55:11,516
are what I chose.

709
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:15,854
Do you think I failed
because I'm not as assiduous as you?

710
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:18,440
Do you think

711
00:55:18,773 --> 00:55:22,861
I failed because I am not as passionate
as you for this country?

712
00:55:28,658 --> 00:55:29,743
The world

713
00:55:31,244 --> 00:55:32,620
will never change, President Park.

714
00:55:34,581 --> 00:55:36,332
Yes, you're right.

715
00:55:38,043 --> 00:55:39,711
The world might never change.

716
00:55:41,421 --> 00:55:42,589
That's why

717
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:45,383
I won't change either.

718
00:55:50,305 --> 00:55:51,389
Mr. Kang.

719
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:01,066
Please take

720
00:56:02,567 --> 00:56:03,401
Secretary Han.

721
00:56:04,944 --> 00:56:07,781
Agent Han and other NIS agents
are waiting for us.

722
00:56:11,534 --> 00:56:14,037
You will also fail.

723
00:56:15,413 --> 00:56:16,956
Just like President Yang.

724
00:56:17,707 --> 00:56:19,584
President Yang didn't fail this nation.

725
00:56:20,752 --> 00:56:21,753
I don't intend

726
00:56:22,504 --> 00:56:23,671
on doing so either.

727
00:56:26,007 --> 00:56:28,051
We could experience trial and error.

728
00:56:28,593 --> 00:56:30,470
But isn't that

729
00:56:31,513 --> 00:56:33,056
what we call history?

730
00:57:54,846 --> 00:57:55,722
Mr. Han...

731
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:31,674
How could you make this decision alone?

732
00:58:33,593 --> 00:58:34,802
Why?

733
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:43,394
Did you think I'd be against this?

734
00:58:43,937 --> 00:58:45,563
-Is that why--
-I...

735
00:58:48,316 --> 00:58:49,901
was embarrassed of

736
00:58:54,155 --> 00:58:56,741
Mr. Han who put this plan in motion

737
00:58:56,991 --> 00:58:58,201
and even our generation.

738
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:09,170
I apologize

739
00:59:10,171 --> 00:59:12,423
to you and the rest of the secretaries.

740
00:59:14,884 --> 00:59:17,762
Even if you choose to leave this office--

741
00:59:19,597 --> 00:59:21,099
Have you forgotten, sir?

742
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:23,393
I...

743
00:59:25,353 --> 00:59:27,188
am here to protect you.

744
00:59:29,732 --> 00:59:31,276
Not just you,

745
00:59:34,153 --> 00:59:37,240
but even your views

746
00:59:38,074 --> 00:59:39,158
and beliefs.

747
00:59:53,548 --> 00:59:55,758
Sin-yeong, let's write up a column

748
00:59:55,842 --> 00:59:59,721
with Ms. Yun and Mayor Kang going
head-to-head and air it this evening.

749
01:00:00,638 --> 01:00:01,764
Sure.

750
01:00:01,973 --> 01:00:03,349
Seriously?

751
01:00:08,146 --> 01:00:09,606
What do you think?

752
01:00:09,731 --> 01:00:12,066
Who do you think will win the election?

753
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:14,652
Ms. Yun may have
better approval ratings right now,

754
01:00:14,986 --> 01:00:18,072
but you never know what'll happen

755
01:00:18,156 --> 01:00:20,074
between this moment and a month from now.

756
01:00:20,158 --> 01:00:23,077
The top two choices,
President Park and Minister Oh,

757
01:00:23,161 --> 01:00:24,996
dropped out of the race simultaneously.

758
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:29,876
You can't say that
President Park is out of it completely.

759
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:34,464
President Park

760
01:00:34,547 --> 01:00:37,133
probably won over the people even more.

761
01:00:37,425 --> 01:00:40,595
This next election
won't be the last one, right?

762
01:00:52,732 --> 01:00:55,401
Yes, I'm leaving the country.

763
01:00:56,027 --> 01:00:58,446
What happened to Mr. Kim?

764
01:00:58,529 --> 01:01:01,783
It will be deemed as me going rogue.

765
01:01:02,533 --> 01:01:03,534
Yes, sir.

766
01:01:03,826 --> 01:01:05,828
I will head to Vladivostok

767
01:01:06,788 --> 01:01:08,998
and wait for further instructions.

768
01:01:17,423 --> 01:01:20,635
DEPARTURES, ARRIVALS

769
01:01:25,098 --> 01:01:26,557
The VIP...

770
01:01:27,141 --> 01:01:28,643
Was it really Mr. Kim?

771
01:01:29,602 --> 01:01:31,604
I still can't believe

772
01:01:31,854 --> 01:01:34,232
that he orchestrated this grand scheme.

773
01:01:34,816 --> 01:01:36,317
It's like he said.

774
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:40,947
There were many who would benefit
from this attack.

775
01:01:41,656 --> 01:01:43,866
It's safe to say that they were all VIPs.

776
01:01:44,992 --> 01:01:46,285
Na-gyeong, what do you think?

777
01:01:46,786 --> 01:01:50,081
What the bombers wanted
were a strained inter-Korean relation

778
01:01:50,164 --> 01:01:51,874
and a new Cold War.

779
01:01:52,458 --> 01:01:54,210
The VIP could refer to anyone

780
01:01:54,585 --> 01:01:57,839
who doesn't want peace
in the Korean Peninsula.

781
01:01:59,757 --> 01:02:01,843
I'm almost sure she's taking classes.

782
01:02:02,051 --> 01:02:03,886
One can't speak that well
without being coached.

783
01:02:14,939 --> 01:02:18,192
A PLEDGE FOR THE NATION

784
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:27,869
You did well,

785
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:29,704
Agent Kim Jun-o.

786
01:02:30,913 --> 01:02:31,998
May you rest in peace.

787
01:02:55,438 --> 01:02:56,689
I promise

788
01:02:57,815 --> 01:02:59,400
to be happy.

789
01:03:00,276 --> 01:03:01,819
I'll try my best.

790
01:03:09,702 --> 01:03:13,664
DAY 29

791
01:03:13,748 --> 01:03:16,125
-Candidate one, Kang Sang-gu.
-Candidate one, Kang Sang-gu.

792
01:03:16,209 --> 01:03:18,461
-Candidate one, Kang Sang-gu.
-Candidate one, Kang Sang-gu.

793
01:03:18,544 --> 01:03:19,420
-Hello.
-Hello.

794
01:03:19,545 --> 01:03:21,881
For a tough Korea,
vote for candidate number two,

795
01:03:21,964 --> 01:03:23,549
-Yun Chan-gyeong.
-Yun Chan-gyeong.

796
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:25,092
-A better Korea...
-A better Korea...

797
01:03:25,176 --> 01:03:27,261
REBUILD KOREA WITH KANG SANG-GU

798
01:03:27,345 --> 01:03:29,514
YUN CHAN-GYEONG FOR A SECURE NATION

799
01:03:29,597 --> 01:03:33,601
DAY 14

800
01:03:33,684 --> 01:03:37,104
That's what it seems to be.

801
01:03:37,188 --> 01:03:38,356
-Are you sure?
-Yes, sir.

802
01:03:38,439 --> 01:03:40,817
DAY 14

803
01:03:43,402 --> 01:03:46,322
DAY 8

804
01:03:46,405 --> 01:03:51,327

805
01:03:51,410 --> 01:03:55,915

01:03:56,999 --> 01:04:02,129

807
01:04:02,213 --> 01:04:03,965
DAY 5

ACTING PRESIDENT PARK MU-JIN

809
01:04:05,299 --> 01:04:06,968
DAY 2

810
01:04:07,051 --> 01:04:10,972
DAY 1

811
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:14,725
BALLOT BOX

812
01:04:25,069 --> 01:04:27,446
Currently, 75 percent of the votes
have been counted.

813
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:30,658
We will soon find out who
the next president of Korea will be.

814
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:34,537
The final result of the election
has been given.

815
01:04:34,662 --> 01:04:37,456
Congratulations to
the 21st president of Korea.

816
01:04:41,836 --> 01:04:43,963
-Good work, everyone.
-Great job.

817
01:04:47,717 --> 01:04:49,176
We will now end the broadcasting

818
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:51,762
for the inauguration of
the 21st president of Korea.

819
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:54,473
Thank you, everyone, for watching.

820
01:06:29,819 --> 01:06:30,987
Thank you.

821
01:06:32,029 --> 01:06:32,989
Great job.

822
01:06:33,072 --> 01:06:34,865
You did well, sir.

823
01:06:36,742 --> 01:06:38,077
Good work.

824
01:06:38,661 --> 01:06:39,787
Thank you, sir.

825
01:06:51,382 --> 01:06:52,258
Great work.

826
01:06:52,341 --> 01:06:53,592
Thank you for everything.

827
01:06:57,555 --> 01:06:58,431
Thank you, sir.

828
01:06:58,514 --> 01:06:59,765
Thank you.

829
01:07:01,434 --> 01:07:02,560
Thank you, sir.

830
01:07:04,895 --> 01:07:05,813
Good work.

831
01:07:06,105 --> 01:07:07,106
Thank you, sir.

832
01:08:18,094 --> 01:08:19,553
I have something to confess.

833
01:08:19,637 --> 01:08:20,638
Again?

834
01:08:23,891 --> 01:08:25,101
Don't tell me

835
01:08:26,936 --> 01:08:30,439
you were fired from the school.

836
01:08:32,066 --> 01:08:33,234
No, it's not that.

837
01:08:34,068 --> 01:08:36,737
We're on our way to go camping.

838
01:08:37,154 --> 01:08:39,573
But if you suddenly tell me that you need
to confess something,

839
01:08:40,241 --> 01:08:41,867
wouldn't I be startled?

840
01:08:42,827 --> 01:08:45,412
So what is it?

841
01:08:45,913 --> 01:08:48,457
I made sure to bring everything.

842
01:08:48,749 --> 01:08:51,877
I got the burner and equipment
for the campfire and sleeping bags.

843
01:08:51,961 --> 01:08:55,506
I even brought a beam projector
so you and the kids could watch movies.

844
01:08:58,134 --> 01:08:59,802
Mom, I want to watch Frozen.

845
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:03,931
Aren't you sick of that? Watching it
every day won't turn you into Elsa.

846
01:09:04,181 --> 01:09:05,474
And you look like Olaf.

847
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:08,185
Mom, Si-wan said--

848
01:09:08,269 --> 01:09:11,397
Si-jin, if you cry right now,
I won't let you watch it.

849
01:09:11,564 --> 01:09:13,107
Si-wan, if you keep teasing her,

850
01:09:13,190 --> 01:09:15,234
I'll deduct 30 minutes
from your game time.

851
01:09:17,361 --> 01:09:18,904
And you, keep talking.

852
01:09:22,491 --> 01:09:23,659
I forgot

853
01:09:24,910 --> 01:09:26,245
the tent.

854
01:09:29,790 --> 01:09:30,624
What?

855
01:09:30,708 --> 01:09:31,542
-Dad!
-Dad!

856
01:09:39,884 --> 01:09:42,136
ANSAN, AUTO CAMPING SITE

857
01:09:51,478 --> 01:09:54,607
Can you take these inside?

858
01:09:55,191 --> 01:09:56,317
Over there.

859
01:09:58,110 --> 01:10:00,362
We could place this here.

860
01:10:04,575 --> 01:10:07,411
They even lent us a tent. It's great.

861
01:10:07,494 --> 01:10:09,038
Next time, we should come empty-handed.

862
01:10:10,414 --> 01:10:11,582
Here.

863
01:10:12,958 --> 01:10:14,835
I think we're done.

864
01:10:16,754 --> 01:10:18,297
Would you like to walk with me?

865
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:28,599
Hey.

866
01:10:30,226 --> 01:10:31,727
There's something else, right?

867
01:10:34,146 --> 01:10:37,441
How could a meticulous person like you
forget to bring the tent?

868
01:10:39,652 --> 01:10:42,905
There seemed to be something
on your mind these days.

869
01:10:44,031 --> 01:10:47,451
Is that why you wanted to camp
even though you had a big trial next week?

870
01:10:49,745 --> 01:10:53,499
This is how much I care about you.

871
01:10:57,461 --> 01:10:58,587
To be honest,

872
01:11:01,382 --> 01:11:05,010
Stanford University contacted me.
They'd like me to replace Professor Jeong.

873
01:11:06,345 --> 01:11:08,347
They invited me to become a member

874
01:11:08,973 --> 01:11:10,516
of their Air Pollution Society.

875
01:11:12,059 --> 01:11:12,935
Stanford?

876
01:11:15,771 --> 01:11:17,064
What do you want to do?

877
01:11:26,824 --> 01:11:28,242
I heard there's an ocean nearby.

878
01:11:28,325 --> 01:11:30,160
We can't miss it when we came
all the way here.

879
01:11:41,755 --> 01:11:43,090
They're so cute.

880
01:11:49,888 --> 01:11:51,098
This is unexpected of you.

881
01:11:53,392 --> 01:11:54,518
That's the best school

882
01:11:55,394 --> 01:11:56,854
when it comes to Environmentology.

883
01:11:57,771 --> 01:11:59,064
Aren't the conditions quite nice?

884
01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:02,276
What is it?

885
01:12:02,901 --> 01:12:03,944
What's bothering you?

886
01:12:09,950 --> 01:12:10,951
If I go,

887
01:12:11,577 --> 01:12:13,370
I'll be staying there
for at least five years.

888
01:12:14,288 --> 01:12:16,832
How will you manage to work
and take care of them singlehandedly?

889
01:12:22,254 --> 01:12:23,464
Apart from that,

890
01:12:25,090 --> 01:12:27,968
is there anything else
that's holding you back?

891
01:12:41,857 --> 01:12:43,984
It feels great to get some fresh air.

892
01:12:44,818 --> 01:12:46,528
The sunset is beautiful too.

893
01:12:59,750 --> 01:13:01,460
I've heard a lot about you.

894
01:13:01,877 --> 01:13:04,880
I heard you're the best in our country
when it comes to political technology.

895
01:13:06,048 --> 01:13:07,591
Thank you for calling me over.

896
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:09,635
-Sit down.
-Yes, sir.

897
01:13:09,718 --> 01:13:13,013
I heard that you supported
both the late president Yang Jin-man

898
01:13:13,097 --> 01:13:14,640
and the acting president, Park Mu-jin.

899
01:13:16,266 --> 01:13:17,893
Yes, I did serve them.

900
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:22,773
Do you have any plans to help me

901
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:25,901
run for president after two years?

902
01:13:27,069 --> 01:13:29,405
I'm from TK.

903
01:13:29,613 --> 01:13:32,574
I went to school
in South Gyeongsang Province, Busan.

904
01:13:32,658 --> 01:13:34,076
My in-laws are from Honam.

905
01:13:34,159 --> 01:13:38,080
My parents and brothers run a large farm
in Chungcheong Province.

906
01:13:38,163 --> 01:13:39,331
That's great.

907
01:13:39,581 --> 01:13:44,253
My religion is Christianity,
the largest single religion.

908
01:13:44,336 --> 01:13:45,671
My wife is Buddhist.

909
01:13:47,673 --> 01:13:49,133
The majority

910
01:13:50,092 --> 01:13:52,261
of the faction in my party
is supporting me.

911
01:13:52,386 --> 01:13:55,848
Well, I guess you could say
that they're my political assets.

912
01:13:56,473 --> 01:14:01,603
It seems like you've had it easy
up until now.

913
01:14:03,313 --> 01:14:05,190
You've never had to sacrifice anything.

914
01:14:08,527 --> 01:14:10,404
I'm afraid I won't be able
to help you, sir.

915
01:14:12,698 --> 01:14:14,283
Are you disappointed in me?

916
01:14:16,952 --> 01:14:21,623
I seek benefits practicality
more than moral obligations.

917
01:14:21,790 --> 01:14:23,792
It's the 21st century.
Politics ought to change.

918
01:14:25,335 --> 01:14:28,088
You should try calculating
our chances of winning.

919
01:14:28,797 --> 01:14:30,966
In a political technological way, that is.

920
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:33,177
There is a master key

921
01:14:34,303 --> 01:14:35,471
when it comes to

922
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:37,431
political technology.

923
01:14:38,891 --> 01:14:40,017
Sacrifice.

924
01:14:40,976 --> 01:14:43,562
The supporters feel like
they owe something to you.

925
01:14:44,521 --> 01:14:47,858
They think,
"We should at least vote for that fool."

926
01:14:48,233 --> 01:14:50,319
It's an investment with a high profit.

927
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:52,488
In politics,

928
01:14:52,821 --> 01:14:55,365
I think being faithful to a cause is

929
01:14:55,449 --> 01:14:58,243
the most practical and pragmatic choice.

930
01:14:58,327 --> 01:14:59,244
That's why I--

931
01:14:59,328 --> 01:15:00,537
Politically speaking,

932
01:15:01,038 --> 01:15:03,707
you have no chance of winning.

933
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:06,585
And I don't do losing battles.

934
01:15:08,837 --> 01:15:11,590
Do you have anyone in your mind?

935
01:15:16,220 --> 01:15:18,931
We're gathering signatures for
the enactment of the Discrimination Act.

936
01:15:19,014 --> 01:15:20,015
May I explain briefly?

937
01:15:20,098 --> 01:15:21,517
Could you take a look at this?

938
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:23,268
I'm good. Later.

939
01:15:24,603 --> 01:15:26,146
Would you like to take a look at this?

940
01:15:26,230 --> 01:15:27,856
-I'm busy.
-Please take a look.

941
01:15:27,940 --> 01:15:29,525
We're gathering signatures.

942
01:15:29,608 --> 01:15:32,319
Everyone, this law
is against any discrimination

943
01:15:32,402 --> 01:15:35,322
based on medical history, appearance,

944
01:15:35,405 --> 01:15:36,907
hometown, and race in Korea.

945
01:15:36,990 --> 01:15:39,451
Your cooperation would be
very much appreciated.

946
01:15:40,244 --> 01:15:43,956
"Signature campaign for
the enactment of the Discrimination Act."

947
01:15:47,125 --> 01:15:49,628
A minority group is campaigning

948
01:15:49,711 --> 01:15:52,172
to make a law for minorities.

949
01:15:52,256 --> 01:15:54,716
You can't make the law like this.

950
01:15:56,176 --> 01:15:58,136
Forget the signatures.

951
01:15:58,220 --> 01:16:00,055
Let's propose a bill.

952
01:16:00,889 --> 01:16:02,474
The Discrimination Act.

953
01:16:05,102 --> 01:16:06,687
In the new Blue House.

954
01:16:13,068 --> 01:16:15,070
Thank you, sir.

955
01:16:15,821 --> 01:16:19,116
Sir, there will be Mr. Wang's
speech about the business strategy

956
01:16:19,199 --> 01:16:20,993
regarding next year's economic growth rate

957
01:16:21,076 --> 01:16:23,745
at the presidential meeting
this afternoon.

958
01:16:23,829 --> 01:16:24,997
The document from yesterday--

959
01:16:29,793 --> 01:16:30,794
Yes, sir.

960
01:16:34,548 --> 01:16:36,508
Mr. Park, do you know

961
01:16:36,592 --> 01:16:38,969
why I keep you despite your high salary?

962
01:16:39,803 --> 01:16:40,762
Pardon, sir?

963
01:16:40,846 --> 01:16:42,848
The Protocol Administrator

964
01:16:42,931 --> 01:16:44,558
serves me as my servant.

965
01:16:44,641 --> 01:16:46,184
What a sight to see, right?

966
01:16:47,769 --> 01:16:50,105
So stop talking

967
01:16:50,439 --> 01:16:52,357
and focus on serving.

968
01:16:57,237 --> 01:16:59,489
Your next appointment is...

969
01:17:05,245 --> 01:17:06,955
Yes, sir. I'll contact him right away.

970
01:17:07,039 --> 01:17:08,040
Sir.

971
01:17:08,123 --> 01:17:09,958
Okay, thank you.

972
01:17:10,042 --> 01:17:11,293
Please take good care of it.

973
01:17:20,135 --> 01:17:21,386
Sir.

974
01:17:22,471 --> 01:17:23,764
This is not a protocol.

975
01:17:28,018 --> 01:17:29,686
This is called a power trip.

976
01:17:31,355 --> 01:17:32,522
And

977
01:17:33,273 --> 01:17:34,274
I don't want

978
01:17:35,525 --> 01:17:37,527
to be your employee

979
01:17:39,613 --> 01:17:40,656
any more.

980
01:17:53,377 --> 01:17:54,378
Let's go.

981
01:17:54,795 --> 01:17:56,338
Before they see me shivering.

982
01:18:03,637 --> 01:18:05,055
A JOURNEY WITH READING, YOUTH

983
01:18:05,138 --> 01:18:06,139
Hi.

984
01:18:06,765 --> 01:18:11,019
Thank you very much
for sitting through the lecture today.

985
01:18:11,812 --> 01:18:13,105
When I was young,

986
01:18:13,438 --> 01:18:16,525
I traveled to over 200 countries

987
01:18:16,650 --> 01:18:18,276
and met people.

988
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:19,361
Sir.

989
01:18:19,569 --> 01:18:22,614
The number of countries that the current
Korean passport allows you to travel

990
01:18:22,698 --> 01:18:24,533
is 166.

991
01:18:26,660 --> 01:18:30,622
Isn't Ms. Jeong one smart woman?

992
01:18:31,623 --> 01:18:33,417
Please give us a second. Come here.

993
01:18:36,253 --> 01:18:38,213
You just humiliated me
in front of the press.

994
01:18:38,547 --> 01:18:40,382
Are you trying to get attention?

995
01:18:41,425 --> 01:18:42,968
What did you learn in the Blue House?

996
01:18:50,308 --> 01:18:51,768
-Yes, Jeong Su-jeong speaking.
-Hi.

997
01:18:52,269 --> 01:18:54,688
You did great.

998
01:18:55,605 --> 01:18:58,066
-Thank you.
-Okay. I see.

999
01:19:01,695 --> 01:19:03,572
-Could you look over here?
-Sir.

1000
01:19:04,865 --> 01:19:07,075
This is what I learned in the Blue House.

1001
01:19:07,159 --> 01:19:11,079
The most important thing in managing
communication with the people and press

1002
01:19:11,663 --> 01:19:13,081
is honesty and trust.

1003
01:19:14,833 --> 01:19:17,002
Those are the basics in politics.

1004
01:19:27,721 --> 01:19:30,766
Yes, we're at the bus stop
right in front of the entrance.

1005
01:19:31,808 --> 01:19:33,477
Yes. Hey.

1006
01:19:39,524 --> 01:19:40,984
-Have you been waiting long?
-No.

1007
01:19:41,860 --> 01:19:44,446
Let's go. There are people waiting.

1008
01:19:45,322 --> 01:19:46,239
I got you coffee.

1009
01:19:46,364 --> 01:19:49,284
What's going on between the two?
Is something going on or has it happened?

1010
01:19:49,367 --> 01:19:51,995
Why don't you ask them?
It's not like they're strangers.

1011
01:19:52,537 --> 01:19:55,457
I can't ask them
because they're not strangers.

1012
01:19:57,083 --> 01:19:59,628
Long time no see, Mr. Kim Nam-wook.

1013
01:20:01,004 --> 01:20:02,923
Are you two seeing each other? Are you?

1014
01:20:07,469 --> 01:20:08,804
What?

1015
01:20:09,012 --> 01:20:10,013
Yes.

1016
01:20:13,767 --> 01:20:14,684
Have you been well?

1017
01:20:16,353 --> 01:20:18,522
Yes, what about you?

1018
01:20:21,399 --> 01:20:22,651
HEARING ON FINE DUST REDUCTION

1019
01:20:22,734 --> 01:20:24,528
The domestic emissions have a huge impact

1020
01:20:24,611 --> 01:20:25,987
on the fine dust level in Korea

1021
01:20:26,071 --> 01:20:29,533
as well as the emissions outside of Korea.

1022
01:20:29,908 --> 01:20:33,245
It has been already proved
with numerous scientific evidence.

1023
01:20:33,829 --> 01:20:36,122
In order to reduce
the fine dust level in Korea,

1024
01:20:36,206 --> 01:20:38,083
and in order to instigate cooperation

1025
01:20:38,166 --> 01:20:40,877
with our neighboring countries

1026
01:20:40,961 --> 01:20:43,088
for the fine dust reduction,

1027
01:20:43,171 --> 01:20:47,133
we must reduce the cause
of domestic emissions.

1028
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:54,850
In Korea, there are two major factors
that need to be reduced.

1029
01:20:54,933 --> 01:20:57,310
First, in the metropolitan area,

1030
01:20:57,394 --> 01:20:59,980
the emissions from old diesel vehicles

1031
01:21:00,063 --> 01:21:02,983
are the main cause that increases
the fine dust concentration.

1032
01:21:03,233 --> 01:21:06,778
We must produce fewer diesel vehicles
and develop environment-friendly vehicles

1033
01:21:06,862 --> 01:21:10,323
like electric vehicles, hydrogen vehicles,

1034
01:21:10,407 --> 01:21:12,784
and hybrid vehicles.

1035
01:21:16,121 --> 01:21:20,083
On a national scale, the illegal emissions
from manufactories are the biggest cause.

1036
01:21:20,584 --> 01:21:22,419
We need continuous supervision over them

1037
01:21:22,502 --> 01:21:25,839
to have the corporations
fulfill their environmental responsibility

1038
01:21:25,922 --> 01:21:28,842
and protect people's right to health.

1039
01:21:30,552 --> 01:21:31,761
I have a question.

1040
01:21:39,936 --> 01:21:42,230
I think the calculation is a bit wrong.

1041
01:21:43,982 --> 01:21:45,317
Do you really believe so?

1042
01:22:00,790 --> 01:22:01,625
It's been a while

1043
01:22:01,708 --> 01:22:06,504
since we have seen the blue sky
in spring because of the fine dust.

1044
01:22:07,005 --> 01:22:09,174
Just by turning the diesel vehicles

1045
01:22:09,257 --> 01:22:12,177
into environment-friendly vehicles
and with a couple of reduction policies,

1046
01:22:12,260 --> 01:22:15,221
do you really think
we can reduce the fine dust?

1047
01:22:17,891 --> 01:22:18,975
Do you really believe

1048
01:22:19,184 --> 01:22:20,852
the policies and politics

1049
01:22:21,394 --> 01:22:23,271
can solve the problem?

1050
01:22:24,731 --> 01:22:26,983
If politics can't,

1051
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:28,610
what else can?

1052
01:22:31,488 --> 01:22:32,864
Politics

1053
01:22:33,281 --> 01:22:36,117
is an endless human endeavor

1054
01:22:36,701 --> 01:22:39,454
to find answers to all the pains
given by the Almighty.

1055
01:22:52,676 --> 01:22:56,096
I heard Stanford University had offered
you an academic position.

1056
01:22:56,805 --> 01:22:58,264
Are you taking the offer?

1057
01:22:58,848 --> 01:23:01,476
I think it'll be of great help
to my fine dust research.

1058
01:23:02,060 --> 01:23:05,146
I thought you just said
politics must solve the fine dust issue.

1059
01:23:07,148 --> 01:23:09,234
You're always against whatever I do.

1060
01:23:10,318 --> 01:23:11,528
You haven't changed, Mr. Cha.

1061
01:23:11,611 --> 01:23:13,530
Some things have changed.

1062
01:23:16,032 --> 01:23:19,703
Usually, I don't make
more than three offers.

1063
01:23:21,705 --> 01:23:23,832
But you're an exception.

1064
01:23:26,835 --> 01:23:29,838
Would you run
for the next presidential election?

1065
01:23:31,464 --> 01:23:32,507
We...

1066
01:23:33,967 --> 01:23:35,176
will be with you.

1067
01:23:39,556 --> 01:23:41,057
I would like to see it too.

1068
01:23:43,059 --> 01:23:45,603
A world where good people win. Wait, no.

1069
01:23:46,521 --> 01:23:49,149
A world where people win
because they are good.

1070
01:23:53,528 --> 01:23:55,238
I want to be

1071
01:23:55,697 --> 01:23:57,574
with a man who deserves

1072
01:23:58,408 --> 01:23:59,492
my service.

1073
01:24:02,787 --> 01:24:03,788
Could you

1074
01:24:05,999 --> 01:24:07,167
give us your answer?

1075
01:25:15,401 --> 01:25:22,408
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING
DESIGNATED SURVIVOR: 60 DAYS
