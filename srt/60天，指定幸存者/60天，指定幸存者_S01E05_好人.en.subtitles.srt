1
00:00:53,762 --> 00:01:00,769
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
PLACES AND EVENTS ARE FICTIONAL

2
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:09,903
On the morning
of the National Assembly Building tragedy,

3
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:13,198
I heard you were relieved of your post

4
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:15,450
as Minister of Environment
by the late President Yang.

5
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:16,910
Is that true?

6
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,830
If this is true,

7
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:23,333
will the people of our nation
be able to accept you

8
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:26,586
as the head of administration?

9
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:31,758
Did Mr. President...

10
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,969
Ms. Jeong, did he know?

11
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:37,138
It won't change anything.

12
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:39,849
He was duly appointed Acting President.

13
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:42,352
Public sentiment can be more influential
than the actual law.

14
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:44,646
Admitting it would be like
committing political suicide.

15
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:53,446
IS IT TRUE THAT YOU WERE DISMISSED FROM
YOUR POST AS MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENT?

16
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:22,308
WERE YOU DISMISSED FROM YOUR POST?

17
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:31,025
WERE YOU DISMISSED FROM YOUR POST?

18
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:42,745
Please answer me, Mr. President.

19
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:44,414
Is it true?

20
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:54,424
DON'T ANSWER HER.
DENY IT.

21
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:23,745
Yes, it's true.

22
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,315
Sorry? Which newspaper?

23
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:53,983
The clip from the news?

24
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:54,943
Oh, sir.

25
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:56,486
Right, I'll get back to you.

26
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:57,654
-The real-time ratings?
-Yes.

27
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:58,655
How's it looking?

28
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,240
-Yes, right.
-It hit the roof.

29
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:03,034
Isn't it the highest rating
in the history of TBN News?

30
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:05,411
You're a political reporter.

31
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:07,372
Shouldn't you be a little more ambitious?

32
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:09,666
Getting the highest rating won't cut it.

33
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,292
For the next week or so,

34
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:14,212
all newspapers and public networks
will be copying our headlines.

35
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:15,630
"TBN is where you get the news."

36
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:18,174
It'll be engraved in the viewers' heads.

37
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:19,842
-Do you understand?
-Yes, sir.

38
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:20,927
How's the public reacting?

39
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,553
Obviously, everyone's talking about it.

40
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:25,348
All the trending keywords
and related stories

41
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:27,725
are regarding your dismissal.

42
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:30,645
No one saw it coming, you know.

43
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:34,148
I think the people
are deeply shocked by the news.

44
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:37,151
Most of the social media posts are about

45
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:40,280
the Blue House and President Park
conning the people.

46
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:44,534
The President and all of
the Cabinet members died in the bombing.

47
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,412
The Acting President was the only survivor

48
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:50,915
and the sole successor
designated by the Constitution. But now,

49
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:53,751
his qualifications are being questioned.

50
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:55,044
Everyone is panicking,

51
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,462
from the people

52
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:58,423
to us, the Blue House staff.

53
00:04:58,506 --> 00:04:59,882
THE BLUE HOUSE WILL ANSWER

54
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:03,344
The total number of petitions
requesting the removal

55
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:05,847
of the Acting President from office
has exceeded 15,000.

56
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:07,890
In just...

57
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:11,352
an hour since the interview aired.

58
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,480
This is the most heated response
we've seen

59
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:16,524
since the Blue House petition site opened.

60
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,360
It won't be easy to calm them down,

61
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:21,529
don't you think?

62
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:28,786
You should've denied it, sir.

63
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,539
Then it would've been seen
as a rude question by a brazen reporter.

64
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:32,623
No.

65
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:36,336
That reporter, Woo Sin-yeong, knew about
his dismissal when we didn't even know.

66
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:37,837
And it was being broadcast live.

67
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:39,589
It could've been worse.

68
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:41,299
Public opinion

69
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:43,885
will calm down by tomorrow afternoon.

70
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:48,097
I've asked MOLEG
for their authoritative interpretation.

71
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:52,226
You know that you were appointed
Acting President

72
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:54,187
due to the President's death

73
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:56,689
before your dismissal was finalized.

74
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:58,024
There won't be any issues.

75
00:05:58,107 --> 00:06:01,402
That's why you should've just denied it
until the bitter end.

76
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:03,488
No one else needed to know about it.

77
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:06,240
But now, the whole world knows
thanks to your honest confession.

78
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:09,660
The people will doubt your qualifications.

79
00:06:15,374 --> 00:06:16,751
So are you saying

80
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,837
I should've lied?

81
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:21,339
To myself

82
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:22,882
and to our citizens?

83
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:26,594
I'm...

84
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:30,014
not capable of doing such a thing.

85
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:32,225
Is it because it's not the truth?

86
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:35,353
You see, there can be only one truth.

87
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:37,230
The choice that is politically favorable.

88
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:41,776
This is why we need
a Chief Presidential Secretary

89
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:44,612
who can serve
as the President's political bodyguard.

90
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:48,157
-Did you say "political bodyguard"?
-Because we must protect the President...

91
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:53,621
from the good man, Park Mu-jin,
whose righteousness and honesty

92
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:56,666
always puts the acting presidency at risk.

93
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:15,184
DAY 57: A GOOD PERSON
EPISODE 5

94
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:18,312
Who could've set up a trap like this
to take President Park down?

95
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:23,151
Whoever it is, that person
told Woo Sin-yeong

96
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:25,778
about the President's dismissal
and the video from Myung Hae Joon.

97
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:31,075
It must be someone inside the Blue House

98
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:34,203
or someone with an informant here,

99
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:35,997
don't you think?

100
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,544
Let me add one more thing.

101
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:46,841
Someone who needed the President
ousted at this point in time.

102
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:56,476
TBN NEWS SHOW PART 2
INTERVIEW WITH PRESIDENT PARK

103
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:11,949
It's me, Cha Yeong-jin.

104
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:14,785
You got back to me sooner
than I had expected.

105
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,204
Oh, well...

106
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:19,624
I can't deny
that it's an intriguing offer.

107
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:26,380
It's me, Yun Chan-gyeong.

108
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:29,467
I have some interesting news for you.

109
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:33,387
It'll probably be
a good opportunity for you.

110
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:37,892
Well, I'm not sure
I'd say it's a good opportunity.

111
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:41,604
You will remain in the Blue House

112
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:44,899
even after the administration changeover
60 days from now.

113
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:48,152
You have my word. Is that not enough?

114
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,577
I don't think I can join...

115
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:01,290
your camp, ma'am.

116
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:06,379
Don't tell me this is about loyalty.

117
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:09,799
Are you trying to stay loyal
to the previous administration

118
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:12,468
or remain faithful to the late President?

119
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:14,011
Is that it?

120
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,351
I didn't think
you'd be this old-fashioned.

121
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:23,020
It makes me valuable.

122
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:26,232
I mean,
it's a rare character trait in this field.

123
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:29,318
That's true. I heard
all the secretaries at the Blue House

124
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,654
are busy sucking up
to the majority party's candidates

125
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:33,614
to ensure their own survival.

126
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:37,326
That's how the word
about President Park's dismissal got out.

127
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:43,457
It was given to the favored candidate
of the ruling party

128
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:45,293
like war booty.

129
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:50,089
Did you say, "the ruling party"?

130
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:57,221
It won't be easy for you
to enter the Blue House from now on.

131
00:09:57,513 --> 00:09:58,639
What do you say?

132
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:00,558
Be my marksman.

133
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:04,729
Thanks to the scoop you scored,
I'm now pretty much

134
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:08,232
the sole presidential candidate
of the ruling party.

135
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:11,402
You need to take responsibility for it,
until I win the election.

136
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:15,948
Let's have a great campaign and...
Ms. Woo.

137
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:19,535
Join me and let's go to
the Blue House together.

138
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:20,911
This time,

139
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,749
as the Blue House Press Secretary. Okay?

140
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:33,341
Well, Mr. Mayor. I'm--

141
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:35,926
Who said you can recruit her
without my permission?

142
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,183
Blue House Press Secretary?

143
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:46,020
It's a temporary position that will last
five years at most.

144
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:48,814
Sir, what brings you here?

145
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:50,775
He spoke very highly of you.

146
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:53,778
He said you're ambitious and fearless.

147
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,572
He told me
you're a reporter with a wild side,

148
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:58,991
which is a rarity these days.

149
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,790
Since I'm ambitious and fearless,

150
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,543
I'd probably bite
without thinking about the consequences.

151
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:12,338
Is that why I got the story?

152
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:15,800
And that's why you gave me the tip?

153
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:18,344
Goodness,

154
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:21,430
I foolishly thought I scored
a big scoop that will go down in history,

155
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:25,017
when in reality,
I was just helping your campaign.

156
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:33,984
I shouldn't drink anymore.

157
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:40,324
I'm just scared

158
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:43,786
I might bite something else
without considering the consequences.

159
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:59,760
Hey, Sin-yeong.

160
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:02,179
Use this for cab fare.

161
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:06,016
I'll be Press Secretary. How about you?

162
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:07,935
Minister of Culture, Sports, and Tourism?

163
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:09,603
Did you say no as it's a temporary job?

164
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:11,522
Then what? CEO of TBN?

165
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:14,859
I'm mortified.

166
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:18,529
You should've just been
honest with me from the get-go.

167
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:20,156
Then would you have done it?

168
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:23,617
You would've gone on about how your rights
are being infringed by the higher-ups,

169
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:24,743
like you're doing now.

170
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,958
Let's just focus on the facts, okay?

171
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,626
You got a scoop,

172
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:35,504
and TBN News got the highest rating.

173
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:38,215
Isn't it a win-win for everyone involved?

174
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:02,990
You will be released from the hospital
at 8 a.m. tomorrow.

175
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:06,494
Would you like to go home first,
and then to the memorial?

176
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:14,251
Ms. Yun asked me to make sure
I escort you to the best of my ability.

177
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:18,422
I don't know how.

178
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:24,261
How can I repay
all the kindness I've received?

179
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,932
MAYOR OF SEOUL KANG SANG-GU,
YUN CHAN-GYEONG

180
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:36,106
Allow me to discreetly investigate
Assemblyman Oh Yeong-seok.

181
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:38,025
Investigate?

182
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:41,904
He might have known about the attack
on the National Assembly Building.

183
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:44,782
Hey, what are you talking about?

184
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:50,538
Assemblyman Oh, who was
supposedly listening to the speech,

185
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:53,499
was seen stepping out of the room
at 3:14 p.m.,

186
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:54,750
right before the explosion.

187
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:58,796
And as a result, he ended up being
the only survivor of the attack.

188
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:19,400
It makes no sense.

189
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:22,152
Let's say he knew about the attack.

190
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:24,405
Then he should've left Yeouido
to ensure his safety.

191
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:26,073
Why stay and suffer like that?

192
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:28,742
He must've had a reason
to stay in the building.

193
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:32,788
-Through the investigation--
-He's a miraculous survivor.

194
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,373
He's loved by the people.

195
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:37,751
Sure, you can be suspicious of him.

196
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:41,463
However,
you need firm, irrefutable evidence

197
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:43,674
if you want to officially raise
such suspicions.

198
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,260
Otherwise,
it'll just be seen as a witch hunt.

199
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:57,479
THE GOVERNMENT OF
THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA

200
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,023
MAKE PLANS TO VISIT HISTORICAL SITES

201
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:55,663
What were you doing?

202
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:02,169
Tell your mom the truth.

203
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:07,424
Is something going on with you?

204
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:11,011
Are you being bullied at school?
Is that it?

205
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:12,638
Yes?

206
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:14,848
-Si-wan--
-What did I do?

207
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,315
What's going on?

208
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:31,865
He's doing things
he has never done before.

209
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:33,534
I caught him going through my wallet.

210
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:35,744
I told you I didn't!

211
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:40,290
Then why were you so startled?
What was it?

212
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:53,637
You should've told me if you needed money.

213
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:04,273
Is it for something you can't tell us?

214
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:08,652
Is that why you lied?

215
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,035
Everyone can make mistakes
and do bad deeds.

216
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:20,873
But it's cowardly to lie
to evade responsibility.

217
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:23,208
That's what I think.

218
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:26,211
I wasn't stealing her money.

219
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:29,923
Then what was it?

220
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:35,095
Just tell me.
You can be honest with me, Si-wan.

221
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:40,601
Sometimes in life, there are things

222
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:43,562
that you just can't say.

223
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:49,276
Right.

224
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:53,697
Yes, there are.

225
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:58,494
You're all grown up, Si-wan.
You even have secrets now.

226
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:02,623
All right.

227
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:05,000
Go to bed early, okay?

228
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:08,253
Dad.

229
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,095
You've...

230
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,848
never lied to me,

231
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:23,060
right?

232
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:30,317
MEMORIAL GATE

233
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:36,115
DAY 54

234
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:38,200
MEMORIAL CEREMONY FOR THE VICTIMS

235
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:44,498
Please check for risk of danger
near the seats

236
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:46,208
and the path for the procession.

237
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,292
Okay, ma'am.

238
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:49,670
Is Block A clear?

239
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:54,258
MEMORIAL PROGRAM

240
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:58,929
EULOGY BY ASSEMBLYMAN OH YEONG-SEOK

241
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:02,474
What's the matter?

242
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:05,727
The eulogy will be...

243
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:08,772
given by Assemblyman Oh Yeong-seok.

244
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:31,628
Do we have
the authoritative interpretation now?

245
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:40,470
"By law, a Minister's term ends

246
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:43,682
when the next Minister is appointed.

247
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:45,809
Therefore,

248
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:47,978
even if his termination was approved,

249
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:49,688
as the President

250
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:52,983
passed away during his term of office,

251
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,235
it is hereby confirmed that

252
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:59,114
the Acting President was duly appointed

253
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:03,660
by law."

254
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:14,504
Now, they won't be able to raise the issue

255
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:17,549
regarding his qualifications
because of his termination, right?

256
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:20,552
Neither politicians nor the people.

257
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:22,095
The people

258
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:26,141
didn't vote for Acting President Park.

259
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:29,686
They voted for President Yang Jin-man.

260
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:34,316
The trust in President Yang
enables and defines

261
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:36,693
the Acting President's authority.

262
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:41,073
Through news of the termination,
we learned

263
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:45,327
that President Yang didn't trust

264
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:47,371
Minister Park Mu-jin.

265
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:51,750
What can the Blue House do now?

266
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:52,960
Ms. Min.

267
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:55,087
Don't worry.

268
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:58,048
I'll record only
the authoritative interpretation.

269
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:11,395
She's such a bully.

270
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,564
She bullies you with the facts.

271
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:16,733
Mr. Kim.

272
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:18,026
Yes?

273
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:22,239
Please make sure the press reports
about the authoritative interpretation.

274
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,826
I'll send every media company
a press release

275
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:28,662
and make sure it's spread
on social media sites as well.

276
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,798
It's a relief

277
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:43,468
that we got the authoritative
interpretation before the memorial.

278
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:46,263
This memorial plays an important role

279
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:48,265
in changing the public opinion.

280
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:51,059
When they see their leader...

281
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:55,981
being steadfast
at an official national event,

282
00:21:57,524 --> 00:21:59,943
the public opinion
might change drastically.

283
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:08,577
Assemblyman Oh left the hospital
and went home.

284
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,537
He said he would come
to the memorial right away.

285
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:14,666
Do you think he will listen to you?

286
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,669
Just having him standing at the memorial

287
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:19,504
-is good enough for me.
-Pardon?

288
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:23,633
President Yang's administration was
incompetent and amateur,

289
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:26,678
chasing after an ideal the whole time.

290
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:30,640
Now, even their only weapon,
morality, has failed.

291
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,022
President Park

292
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:40,484
shouldn't be mentioned
as a presidential candidate any more.

293
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,820
We should send him back
to where he belongs.

294
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:46,615
Then...

295
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:49,701
Assemblyman Oh will make that happen

296
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,703
at the memorial today.

297
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:55,874
Ma'am!

298
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:03,548
Assemblyman Oh isn't qualified
to give a eulogy.

299
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:05,425
Na-gyeong, that again?

300
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:07,886
We still have no idea what he was doing

301
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:09,721
or where he was

302
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:12,182
at the time of the explosion.

303
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:16,061
I can't let him stand
as a miraculous survivor

304
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:19,397
before the victims' portraits.

305
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:25,445
Is this because of Kim Jun-o?

306
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:32,869
Are you bitter

307
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:34,704
that Kim Jun-o died
and Oh Yeong-seok lived?

308
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:38,792
Is that why you get so emotional
when it comes to Assemblyman Oh?

309
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:42,796
-Han-mo--
-Kim Jun-o, a counterintelligence agent.

310
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:46,174
You guys were engaged.

311
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:50,470
What? You thought I didn't know that?

312
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:53,974
I have been working for the agency
for 15 years.

313
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:56,810
I have been an intelligence agent
for 15 years.

314
00:24:00,063 --> 00:24:02,816
You need to choose one.

315
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:04,192
Na-Gyeong.

316
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:10,115
Are you a NIS Terrorism Task Force
analyst

317
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:12,534
or a bereaved family member?

318
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:15,412
Choose.

319
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:06,838
I thought I told you everything last time.

320
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:10,050
Do you still have questions for me?

321
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,225
Please have a seat.

322
00:25:42,832 --> 00:25:45,752
These are two pictures of your seat
in the main conference room

323
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:47,337
taken on the day of the attack.

324
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:00,558
What about them?

325
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:03,436
You said you were in the main
conference room the whole time,

326
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,230
but at 3:15 p.m.,

327
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:10,026
the time of the bombing,
you weren't in your seat.

328
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:12,862
Tell me.

329
00:26:13,446 --> 00:26:14,990
Where were you

330
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:17,701
and what were you doing
at the time of the bombing?

331
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:24,791
I don't remember.

332
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:27,836
As I told you,

333
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:30,880
I was listening to the President's
State of the Nation Address.

334
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:32,674
That's all

335
00:26:33,591 --> 00:26:36,845
I can remember and say about that day.

336
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:41,599
One thing is for sure.

337
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:44,477
Either you

338
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:47,564
or the pictures are lying to me.

339
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:02,912
Could you please leave now?

340
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:05,165
I'm supposed to attend the memorial.

341
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:14,758
I'll see you at the memorial then.

342
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:25,060
Did you say you wanted to know
where he was on that day?

343
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:26,436
Don't, Jae-hak.

344
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:29,272
You don't deserve
to be treated like a criminal.

345
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:31,524
-That day, you were--
-Petty Officer Im Jae-hak.

346
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:37,989
Stop it.

347
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:46,915
I apologize.

348
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:51,211
Now please leave my house.

349
00:27:51,544 --> 00:27:52,796
Right now.

350
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:09,270
Hey, Ji-won.

351
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:13,566
What's the name of the army base
where Assemblyman Oh was...

352
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:38,216
Seven years ago,

353
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:40,927
we were all on that ship

354
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,638
off the shore of Baengnyeong Island.

355
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:48,601
Are you talking about
the Battle of Baengnyeong?

356
00:28:49,185 --> 00:28:52,564
When the Fleet Admiral,
the Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman,

357
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:58,903
and even the Blue House...
When the entire nation abandoned us,

358
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:02,532
Lieutenant Commander Oh

359
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:04,784
saved our lives.

360
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:30,185
He doesn't deserve
to be treated like some criminal.

361
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:34,689
Petty Officer Im Jae-hak

362
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:39,402
has been suffering from PTSD
ever since he returned from the battle.

363
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:43,531
Lieutenant Commander Oh
left his seat to call him that day.

364
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,074
To deal with a crisis!

365
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:49,078
Why didn't he tell me that

366
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:51,414
if it were the truth?

367
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:52,791
You...

368
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:55,293
will...

369
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,214
never understand us.

370
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:17,440
I'd like someone's call records.

371
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:20,610
Oh Yeong-seok's cell phone on March 4

372
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:23,363
between 3:13 p.m. and 3:18 p.m.

373
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:25,073
Right.

374
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:28,243
The sooner, the better.

375
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:51,182
MEMORIAL GATE

376
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:53,476
-Excuse me.
-Back away.

377
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:57,856
-Do you have a comment?
-Is it true?

378
00:30:57,939 --> 00:30:59,399
Please give us a comment.

379
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:01,317
-Please say a word.
-He's coming in.

380
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:02,735
-Sir!
-Let's head inside.

381
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:06,489
Mr. President, why did you
cover up your dismissal?

382
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,658
What was the reason for your dismissal?

383
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:11,536
What do you think about
the current controversy?

384
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:13,663
What will be your next course of action?

385
00:31:13,913 --> 00:31:16,082
Do you intend on recusing yourself?

386
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:17,667
-Mr. President.
-A few words, please!

387
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,752
Will you officially apologize
to the people?

388
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:21,296
Just one comment, sir.

389
00:31:21,796 --> 00:31:23,256
Please say something.

390
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:43,526
MEMORIAL CEREMONY FOR THE VICTIMS

391
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:36,287
Next will be the flower tribute
and incense burning.

392
00:32:50,426 --> 00:32:56,015
MEMORIAL CEREMONY FOR THE VICTIMS
OF THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY BUILDING BOMBING

393
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:24,377
What's going on out there?

394
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:49,235
-Quiet, people!
-From the Blue House?

395
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:52,739
GUARANTEE FUNDING

396
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:53,906
I apologize.

397
00:33:54,782 --> 00:33:57,076
I'm afraid I can't promise you

398
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:59,454
any funding for the youth science program.

399
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:06,210
Young men and women
who are less educated than you.

400
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:11,632
Young men and women
whose jobs are not as good as yours.

401
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:14,343
The young men and women

402
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:18,639
who must face the harsh reality
of this world more than you.

403
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:22,101
To me,
funding their employment comes first.

404
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:23,311
GUARANTEE FUNDING

405
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:24,479
-What?
-Let's go.

406
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:27,732
Don't expect my vote then.

407
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:29,067
And off they go.

408
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:33,529
I just lost 500 votes, didn't I?

409
00:34:36,365 --> 00:34:40,244
One's policies and visions
must not change to win an election.

410
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:44,916
What I wish to change
isn't the owner of the Blue House.

411
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:47,168
It's the Republic of Korea!

412
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:50,046
I wish to change our future!

413
00:34:50,963 --> 00:34:54,133
Thank you. Thank you so much.

414
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:57,220
Goodness. I lost votes.

415
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:00,598
And I killed the mood too.

416
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:02,308
So I'll sing you a song.

417
00:35:03,142 --> 00:35:04,143
Right.

418
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:08,564
Dongbaek Island

419
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:11,776
Where flowers bloom

420
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:43,015
MEMORIAL CEREMONY FOR THE VICTIMS
OF THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY BUILDING BOMBING

421
00:36:45,077 --> 00:36:47,413
Did you check
Assemblyman Oh's phone records?

422
00:36:50,666 --> 00:36:53,544
Assemblyman Oh Yeong-seok
will now give a eulogy.

423
00:36:57,131 --> 00:37:01,302
He will give a eulogy
to commemorate the lives that were lost.

424
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:15,001
I will not...

425
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:18,129
give a eulogy.

426
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:28,222
It's because...

427
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:32,476
I can't mourn their deaths.

428
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:39,442
I am too embarrassed

429
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:42,945
and ashamed to do so.

430
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:47,783
An incompetent nation
that couldn't protect its people.

431
00:38:49,368 --> 00:38:52,121
A nation that is yet
to find its attacker.

432
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:54,540
And

433
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:58,252
a government that is too cowardly to take

434
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:00,546
actions of revenge.

435
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:06,552
An unfortunate nation with leaders

436
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:09,930
that aren't qualified.

437
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:13,434
That is our country,

438
00:39:15,394 --> 00:39:16,729
and I am

439
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:19,648
deeply ashamed of it.

440
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:23,652
However,

441
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:26,781
what mortifies me the most

442
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:30,618
is the fact

443
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:33,788
that I'm here just because

444
00:39:35,664 --> 00:39:36,999
I survived.

445
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:42,546
To an attack we should not tolerate,

446
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:44,465
I helplessly lost

447
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:49,011
my beloved friends and colleagues.

448
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:52,515
Why must I become a miracle personified?

449
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:58,604
Seven years ago,
I asked myself the same thing.

450
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:01,941
All I did was survive

451
00:40:02,441 --> 00:40:04,568
when my brothers in arms didn't.

452
00:40:06,153 --> 00:40:09,615
How is that worthy of this heavy medal?

453
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:12,952
To me,

454
00:40:13,452 --> 00:40:15,621
it felt like I had been given an order.

455
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:20,709
A strict command

456
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:22,878
that ordered me

457
00:40:23,462 --> 00:40:27,341
to forbid
the loss of any more innocent lives

458
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:30,136
in this nation.

459
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:34,098
I failed my mission,

460
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:36,892
and that's why I can't dare to even mourn.

461
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:41,147
This will be the last time I will be

462
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:43,482
a shameful survivor.

463
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:48,320
Until the day

464
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:50,739
the Republic of Korea

465
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:53,909
becomes so strong

466
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:55,911
that no one

467
00:40:56,912 --> 00:40:58,539
will dare

468
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:02,084
mistreat our country or our people,

469
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:07,214
I will give back

470
00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:11,510
this medal that I was once proud of,
given to me...

471
00:41:16,098 --> 00:41:17,266
by the Republic of Korea.

472
00:41:38,412 --> 00:41:40,206
Assemblyman Oh was telling the truth.

473
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:42,917
At 3:14 p.m., when he had left his seat,

474
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:46,795
he was on the phone with
war veteran Im Jae-hak.

475
00:41:47,546 --> 00:41:48,672
There's one more thing.

476
00:41:49,256 --> 00:41:53,761
He has never missed a call
from Im Jae-hak.

477
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:55,930
Na-gyeong,

478
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:59,558
maybe we're wrong about Assemblyman Oh.

479
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:18,118
I won't let this have been in vain.

480
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:06,625
The Cambodian government
gave us an ultimatum?

481
00:43:07,209 --> 00:43:09,169
They won't cooperate
with our troops anymore?

482
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:12,256
Well, the agents of
the Reconnaissance General Bureau

483
00:43:12,339 --> 00:43:14,216
are tracking Myung Hae Joon as well.

484
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:18,470
They are assassins who track
deflected high-ranking officials.

485
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:21,307
According to the NIS,
the North was flustered

486
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:23,684
to hear about Myung Hae Joon's video.

487
00:43:24,476 --> 00:43:27,605
They would be,
if they had nothing to do with the attack.

488
00:43:28,188 --> 00:43:30,774
Since Myung Hae Joon is in Senmonari,

489
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:33,986
a region of conflict
between Cambodia and Vietnam,

490
00:43:34,069 --> 00:43:37,823
the Cambodian government must be worried
about a possible military collision.

491
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:40,034
Then,

492
00:43:41,243 --> 00:43:43,829
is it now impossible
to bring Myung Hae Joon in?

493
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:46,874
Well...

494
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:50,002
SECRETARIAT OF THE NSC

495
00:43:50,085 --> 00:43:52,296
That's why there's a bit of an issue.

496
00:43:58,761 --> 00:44:01,972
Our soldiers will head
to Cambodia from Seoul Park.

497
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:02,931
SENMONARI

498
00:44:03,015 --> 00:44:04,767
They will parachute down

499
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:06,101
and strike where they land...

500
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:34,880
I thought I made myself clear.

501
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:39,176
Deploying our soldiers without consent
from the Cambodian government--

502
00:44:39,259 --> 00:44:41,804
Do you still think you have the right

503
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:46,016
to give orders as
this nation's Commander-in-Chief?

504
00:44:47,726 --> 00:44:50,104
It was made clear at the memorial.

505
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:54,817
You covered up your dismissal

506
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:57,444
and used a national crisis
as a stepping stone

507
00:44:57,736 --> 00:45:01,198
to take the seat
of this nation's highest authority.

508
00:45:01,573 --> 00:45:02,783
Do you still believe

509
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:07,287
that the people of the Republic of Korea
can trust you

510
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:10,040
with their safety?

511
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:23,262
I, the Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman,
have the operational command authority.

512
00:45:24,596 --> 00:45:26,890
What needs to be done
for our nation's safety

513
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:28,475
will be considered

514
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:30,310
and decided by me...

515
00:45:33,188 --> 00:45:34,356
from this moment forth.

516
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:51,081
Mr. President!

517
00:45:56,795 --> 00:45:58,839
Please turn on the news.

518
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:03,844
The man in the video
is North Korean soldier Myung Hae Joon.

519
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:05,971
He appears in his uniform

520
00:46:06,054 --> 00:46:08,849
claiming to be the bomber
of the National Assembly Building.

521
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,852
He is the adopted son of Choe Seo Ryong,

522
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:14,855
who is one of the high-ranking officials

523
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:17,191
that led the succession
of North Korea's Supreme Leader.

524
00:46:17,691 --> 00:46:19,151
Following this revelation,

525
00:46:19,651 --> 00:46:22,946
the authorities have been looking
into the possibility of...

526
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:26,825
Who the hell leaked this to the press?

527
00:46:38,712 --> 00:46:40,464
Are you sure it wasn't you?

528
00:46:40,547 --> 00:46:43,759
Not many know about that video,
and you're one of them.

529
00:46:45,093 --> 00:46:46,512
Are you saying

530
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:48,847
that a TBN reporter gave KBC a tip?

531
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:50,349
A big exclusive like this?

532
00:46:50,432 --> 00:46:51,892
Can you think of anyone then?

533
00:46:52,809 --> 00:46:55,479
The person who sent you the video
could've leaked it.

534
00:46:58,232 --> 00:47:02,027
Even I know that national security
trumps any big exclusive.

535
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:05,197
And I know how to protect
the anonymity of my sources.

536
00:47:06,698 --> 00:47:07,866
But...

537
00:47:19,419 --> 00:47:20,420
Mr. President.

538
00:47:23,048 --> 00:47:26,301
The fact that North Korea
denied Myung Hae Joon's actions

539
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:29,513
and the Blue House's official statement
that we're working hard to capture him

540
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:31,598
have been announced to the public.

541
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:34,142
However, it's uncertain
whether it'll calm the people...

542
00:47:35,477 --> 00:47:37,646
Oh, that's just something
I scribbled down.

543
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:40,857
Have you checked to see if anyone

544
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:43,735
in the Office of Communications
was in contact with KBC?

545
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:45,028
That's impossible.

546
00:47:45,112 --> 00:47:48,532
I'm the only one in Communications
who knew that the video existed.

547
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:50,284
Also...

548
00:47:52,995 --> 00:47:56,290
Me?
It definitely wasn't me, Mr. President.

549
00:47:57,749 --> 00:48:01,295
Why would someone from the Blue House
leak this video to the press,

550
00:48:01,878 --> 00:48:03,255
especially at a time like this?

551
00:48:06,091 --> 00:48:07,259
Mr. President.

552
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:09,886
There's someone outside of the Blue House

553
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:13,140
who knows about this video.

554
00:48:16,476 --> 00:48:17,603
If it were me,

555
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:20,564
I would've used
a common enemy on the outside.

556
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:24,860
Yun Chan-gyeong.

557
00:48:25,819 --> 00:48:27,404
I must see her immediately.

558
00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:38,540
So, you're saying I leaked
the video to the media?

559
00:48:39,124 --> 00:48:41,084
And broke my promise to you?

560
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:43,295
You wanted

561
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:46,214
to make it public from the start.

562
00:48:47,924 --> 00:48:51,219
But why would I go through
all that trouble for you?

563
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:55,140
Congratulations, sir.

564
00:48:57,851 --> 00:48:58,810
What do you mean?

565
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:01,438
The controversy
regarding your qualifications

566
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:03,899
to be Acting President will end soon.

567
00:49:06,985 --> 00:49:08,236
It's changing.

568
00:49:09,237 --> 00:49:10,447
It's changing.

569
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:13,575
The public opinion on social media
regarding President Park is changing.

570
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:17,621
No one is complaining about
his dismissal disqualifying him anymore.

571
00:49:17,704 --> 00:49:21,124
Look. "We need to stand in unity
in order to catch the bombers.

572
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:23,752
It's time to unify under President Park.

573
00:49:23,835 --> 00:49:26,463
We should be aiming our anger
at Myung Hae Joon and the attackers."

574
00:49:26,546 --> 00:49:27,547
That's right.

575
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:30,258
The trending keywords changed too.

576
00:49:30,592 --> 00:49:31,677
"Myung Hae Joon, bomber,

577
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:34,096
bomber video,
Myung Hae Joon's whereabouts."

578
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:37,432
The dismissal issue is completely gone.

579
00:49:37,516 --> 00:49:38,475
That's impressive.

580
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:41,353
It's the same on the Blue House's
petition site.

581
00:49:41,728 --> 00:49:44,022
Instead of petitioning
for the President's dismissal,

582
00:49:44,106 --> 00:49:46,650
over 100,000 people have petitioned

583
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:50,862
to locate Myung Hae Joon's whereabouts
within the last hour.

584
00:49:51,613 --> 00:49:53,365
What about the media?

585
00:49:53,448 --> 00:49:54,783
Why are you even asking?

586
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:58,787
Shelf everything on President Park
and Oh Yeong-seok!

587
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:01,498
The authenticity of Myung Hae Joon's
video, who he is,

588
00:50:01,581 --> 00:50:03,250
the possibility North Korea did it...

589
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:05,419
Must I spell it out for you?

590
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:09,297
You come with me.

591
00:50:09,923 --> 00:50:12,134
-After watching the video...
-Right now!

592
00:50:12,217 --> 00:50:14,636
in which Myung Hae Joon claims
to be the bomber,

593
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:17,055
people have been voicing
their fear and anxiety,

594
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:21,351
while insisting that the government
locate Myung Hae Joon quickly.

595
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:25,313
Meanwhile, academic and religious leaders

596
00:50:25,897 --> 00:50:29,151
have issued statements saying
political battles must stop for now,

597
00:50:29,735 --> 00:50:33,655
and we should focus on
overcoming this national crisis.

598
00:50:35,824 --> 00:50:38,034
You bury an issue with a different issue.

599
00:50:39,327 --> 00:50:40,620
You need something like the video

600
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:42,831
to kill the issue
regarding your dismissal.

601
00:50:43,248 --> 00:50:47,002
Nothing comes before
national security in Korea.

602
00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:49,254
Whether it's just a suspicion
or a controversy,

603
00:50:49,671 --> 00:50:51,548
nothing can beat it.

604
00:50:53,925 --> 00:50:57,179
I'm jealous you have such a good staff.

605
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:01,725
Secretary Han isn't at the Blue House
anymore,

606
00:51:01,808 --> 00:51:03,059
so I wonder who it was.

607
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:04,895
That person is very good.

608
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:13,570
President Park!

609
00:51:14,196 --> 00:51:16,990
The approval rating will be released

610
00:51:17,073 --> 00:51:20,452
to the press tomorrow morning,
so be ready for that.

611
00:51:20,952 --> 00:51:23,121
Is 500 people enough?

612
00:51:23,205 --> 00:51:26,374
Yes, but let's make the questions
easy and clear.

613
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:28,585
That's better for setting up
positive answers.

614
00:51:28,668 --> 00:51:29,836
-Okay.
-Good.

615
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:31,880
Mr. President.

616
00:51:34,216 --> 00:51:35,842
You don't have to worry.

617
00:51:37,135 --> 00:51:39,513
If the approval rating rises
in the public survey,

618
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:42,974
your dismissal issue won't hinder
government operations any longer.

619
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:45,477
Is that why...

620
00:51:47,646 --> 00:51:49,147
you leaked the video?

621
00:51:56,863 --> 00:51:58,198
I was on my way to tell you.

622
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:12,170
Please get back to work.

623
00:52:30,188 --> 00:52:32,566
Myung Hae Joon's video was classified.

624
00:52:34,776 --> 00:52:37,028
You leaked that to the public

625
00:52:37,112 --> 00:52:38,405
without telling anyone

626
00:52:39,197 --> 00:52:40,115
or getting permission.

627
00:52:43,076 --> 00:52:45,078
Is putting national security in danger

628
00:52:46,454 --> 00:52:48,039
part of your political choice?

629
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:52,752
You can punish me

630
00:52:54,379 --> 00:52:57,507
for leaking a state secret
or public endangerment by causing havoc.

631
00:52:58,675 --> 00:53:01,344
-Then why did you do this?
-It was to protect you!

632
00:53:03,221 --> 00:53:04,806
General Lee

633
00:53:05,098 --> 00:53:08,018
will be willing to fight Cambodia
to catch Myung Hae Joon.

634
00:53:08,101 --> 00:53:10,812
He doesn't approve of you
as Commander-in-Chief.

635
00:53:10,896 --> 00:53:13,315
This is the price for your honesty.

636
00:53:17,944 --> 00:53:20,655
Do you know why you admitted
that you were dismissed?

637
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:25,535
You wanted to prove
you don't have any desire for power

638
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:28,246
and that you're a good person
unlike other politicians.

639
00:53:29,581 --> 00:53:32,709
You're being stubborn and trying
to fight with your bare hands

640
00:53:32,792 --> 00:53:35,503
on the battlefield because you're scared
you'll get your sword bloody.

641
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:36,922
There can be two outcomes.

642
00:53:37,005 --> 00:53:38,965
You either die bleeding or surrendering.

643
00:53:44,763 --> 00:53:45,639
I...

644
00:53:49,851 --> 00:53:52,354
don't want to fight
under a commander like that anymore.

645
00:53:58,401 --> 00:53:59,861
I want to win.

646
00:54:03,198 --> 00:54:05,116
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

647
00:54:37,148 --> 00:54:38,316
Did you find out

648
00:54:39,275 --> 00:54:41,444
who among the Blue House staff
leaked the video?

649
00:54:47,534 --> 00:54:50,286
Is General Lee still here?

650
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:53,415
What about cover
for the aircraft to Cambodia?

651
00:54:53,498 --> 00:54:57,085
F-18 fighter jets are also ready.

652
00:54:57,544 --> 00:54:59,796
Our Air Force will take the troops

653
00:54:59,879 --> 00:55:01,756
to the location in Cambodia.

654
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:04,759
As for Cambodian airspace,
cyber military troops

655
00:55:04,843 --> 00:55:07,262
will lift the air defense network
to open up the airway.

656
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:11,558
General Lee,
shouldn't you notify President Park--

657
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:13,643
Contact the Special Ops team.

658
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:16,104
Tell them to gather at Seoul Airport.

659
00:55:27,782 --> 00:55:30,618
Do you plan to dispatch troops
to Cambodia?

660
00:55:30,702 --> 00:55:33,121
The President of our country

661
00:55:33,204 --> 00:55:36,458
and some 200 people were victims
of this tragedy.

662
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:38,209
Not only that,

663
00:55:40,712 --> 00:55:44,507
he sent a video to the Blue House
to mock us.

664
00:55:45,216 --> 00:55:47,343
Since the video was leaked,

665
00:55:47,427 --> 00:55:50,305
our people are suffering
in fear and anxiety.

666
00:55:51,473 --> 00:55:54,059
It is the duty of a sovereign state

667
00:55:54,142 --> 00:55:56,853
to catch Myung Hae Joon and punish him.

668
00:55:59,272 --> 00:56:03,818
I won't hand Myung Hae Joon
over to North Korea easily.

669
00:56:03,902 --> 00:56:05,987
A diplomatic dispute with Cambodia

670
00:56:06,988 --> 00:56:08,990
will bring greater anxiety and fear.

671
00:56:09,074 --> 00:56:12,410
All diplomacy eventually leads to war.

672
00:56:13,244 --> 00:56:14,579
Our military

673
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:17,749
exists for when that happens.

674
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:25,048
The enemy must be

675
00:56:26,841 --> 00:56:28,468
suppressed with force.

676
00:56:30,011 --> 00:56:31,513
President Park,

677
00:56:32,138 --> 00:56:34,557
you should use power if you have it...

678
00:56:37,393 --> 00:56:39,395
without hesitating or wavering.

679
00:57:03,503 --> 00:57:05,046
You're right, General Lee.

680
00:57:12,053 --> 00:57:15,140
I'll use my power since I have it
without hesitating or wavering.

681
00:57:21,563 --> 00:57:24,107
I am revoking your military authority.

682
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:35,994
General Lee Gwan-muk,
you are relieved of your post.

683
00:57:40,373 --> 00:57:41,332
As of now,

684
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:45,920
anyone who gives orders to the military
without my permission...

685
00:57:48,923 --> 00:57:51,384
will be punished
for conspiring to start a rebellion.

686
00:57:54,429 --> 00:57:55,597
There will be...

687
00:58:04,397 --> 00:58:05,440
no exceptions.

688
00:58:24,542 --> 00:58:26,920
We have the approval rating
survey results.

689
00:58:27,003 --> 00:58:28,838
We decided to release it in the morning,
right?

690
00:58:29,714 --> 00:58:33,009
Should we also post it on the Blue House's
official social media account then?

691
00:58:33,676 --> 00:58:34,636
Talk to

692
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:37,514
Spokesperson Kim about it.

693
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:39,974
He's in charge of the media.

694
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:51,069
Are you changing desks?

695
00:58:53,613 --> 00:58:54,614
You didn't mention that.

696
00:58:56,074 --> 00:58:57,492
Do I need your permission?

697
00:58:59,118 --> 00:59:00,036
Look,

698
00:59:00,578 --> 00:59:05,124
didn't you learn nice and pretty words
like "discuss, consult, or confer"

699
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:07,085
when you were in school?

700
00:59:08,962 --> 00:59:11,005
That also goes for
the Myung Hae Joon video.

701
00:59:11,464 --> 00:59:13,883
You could have discussed it
with me beforehand.

702
00:59:15,051 --> 00:59:16,469
If I told you,

703
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:20,974
would you have agreed to it?

704
00:59:21,933 --> 00:59:23,101
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

705
00:59:23,184 --> 00:59:25,395
CHA YEONG-JIN

706
00:59:42,328 --> 00:59:43,496
It's Park Mu-jin.

707
00:59:45,331 --> 00:59:46,791
I need to talk to you.

708
00:59:48,001 --> 00:59:51,337
Should I go to your office?

709
00:59:53,548 --> 00:59:54,924
Yes, got it.

710
00:59:57,969 --> 00:59:59,554
What could it be?

711
01:00:00,054 --> 01:00:02,390
Do you know anything?

712
01:00:02,974 --> 01:00:06,311
You're the one who knows
President Park the best.

713
01:00:08,313 --> 01:00:11,399
Let's finish this talk when I get back.

714
01:00:55,985 --> 01:00:58,613
TOTAL OF 1.48 MILLION,
ABOUT 1.5 MILLION VEHICLES

715
01:01:01,157 --> 01:01:02,575
I can't leave the position

716
01:01:04,077 --> 01:01:06,537
of Chief Presidential Secretary
vacant any longer.

717
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:08,873
After much thought,
I have come to a decision.

718
01:01:11,626 --> 01:01:14,796
From when I was in Sejong
to my time at the Blue House,

719
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:17,674
the person that understood me the best

720
01:01:18,633 --> 01:01:19,842
was you, Ms. Jeong.

721
01:01:30,061 --> 01:01:31,312
I don't think that's right.

722
01:01:37,694 --> 01:01:38,903
I've decided to appoint...

723
01:01:43,157 --> 01:01:45,785
Secretary Cha Yeong-jin
as the Chief Presidential Secretary.

724
01:02:01,759 --> 01:02:05,054
I thought it would be best
if I told you in person.

725
01:02:09,517 --> 01:02:12,729
Because I might be disappointed and hurt?

726
01:02:18,317 --> 01:02:19,360
It is a bit surprising.

727
01:02:21,821 --> 01:02:24,824
I thought you didn't like

728
01:02:25,032 --> 01:02:27,660
the way Secretary Cha did things.

729
01:02:28,244 --> 01:02:30,288
Was I wrong?

730
01:02:36,002 --> 01:02:37,044
I need him.

731
01:03:03,154 --> 01:03:04,155
I won't be able to sleep

732
01:03:04,614 --> 01:03:06,574
unless we finish our conversation.

733
01:03:08,493 --> 01:03:10,495
If you had asked me
to go public with the video,

734
01:03:10,578 --> 01:03:12,205
yes, I would have been against it.

735
01:03:12,830 --> 01:03:14,916
But if you had explained the reason,

736
01:03:16,751 --> 01:03:18,711
I'm sure I would have agreed.

737
01:03:20,546 --> 01:03:22,256
Because I know...

738
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:25,176
how competent you are.

739
01:03:29,764 --> 01:03:30,681
Congratulations,

740
01:03:32,099 --> 01:03:34,143
Chief Presidential Secretary
Cha Yeong-jin.

741
01:03:41,025 --> 01:03:43,194
Wait, Ms. Jeong.

742
01:03:50,368 --> 01:03:51,744
Well...

743
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:55,623
Want to get chicken and beer with me?

744
01:03:56,374 --> 01:03:57,375
I...

745
01:03:58,835 --> 01:04:01,504
know a good place by Gwanghwamun.

746
01:04:06,759 --> 01:04:07,677
You know,

747
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:11,305
since we didn't have dinner.

748
01:04:14,225 --> 01:04:15,184
That's why I asked.

749
01:04:18,104 --> 01:04:19,021
No, I don't want to.

750
01:04:22,233 --> 01:04:23,818
I'm not mature enough

751
01:04:23,901 --> 01:04:25,987
to buy you a celebratory drink
on a day like this.

752
01:04:27,113 --> 01:04:28,698
And it doesn't feel nice to think

753
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:32,243
that I look so pathetic

754
01:04:32,827 --> 01:04:34,078
that I need a consolation drink.

755
01:04:44,755 --> 01:04:46,340
Did I say chicken and beer?

756
01:04:46,465 --> 01:04:47,550
Gosh.

757
01:04:54,307 --> 01:04:55,474
What is this?

758
01:04:59,353 --> 01:05:03,649
HANGOVER CUP NOODLES

759
01:05:05,318 --> 01:05:06,777
My gosh.

760
01:05:20,917 --> 01:05:23,210
Excuse me, sir.

761
01:05:23,502 --> 01:05:26,505
Aren't you going home?

762
01:05:28,174 --> 01:05:31,469
I'm not sure if he likes to drink.

763
01:05:32,553 --> 01:05:34,513
Whom do you mean?

764
01:05:38,142 --> 01:05:39,602
Make sure it's clear.

765
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:48,778
I wanted to ask you today.

766
01:05:57,536 --> 01:05:58,829
I thought perhaps

767
01:06:01,457 --> 01:06:02,959
the late President

768
01:06:05,127 --> 01:06:06,671
was lonely and burdened

769
01:06:07,421 --> 01:06:08,255
throughout his term.

770
01:06:08,756 --> 01:06:09,924
That sounds like

771
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:13,010
you're lonely and burdened.

772
01:06:23,312 --> 01:06:24,397
Was I...

773
01:06:27,149 --> 01:06:28,859
also one of those people?

774
01:06:30,486 --> 01:06:32,947
One of the people that made

775
01:06:34,782 --> 01:06:36,242
the President feel lonely.

776
01:06:40,913 --> 01:06:42,248
Don't you...

777
01:06:46,335 --> 01:06:48,879
already know the answer to that, sir?

778
01:07:54,028 --> 01:07:56,739
Are you that mad at Minister Park?

779
01:07:57,323 --> 01:07:58,949
I had no idea you'd dismiss him.

780
01:08:03,454 --> 01:08:04,580
It's the opposite.

781
01:08:05,664 --> 01:08:08,501
I'm going to let him go
before I get greedy.

782
01:08:10,586 --> 01:08:13,506
That man isn't suited for politics.

783
01:08:15,925 --> 01:08:17,343
There will be a ring of hell.

784
01:08:19,512 --> 01:08:23,140
I'll be the only one dragged into the ring
and bloodied.

785
01:08:24,725 --> 01:08:26,018
No one else.

786
01:08:54,922 --> 01:08:58,050
What in the world are you doing?

787
01:08:58,801 --> 01:09:01,095
We need all the help we can get.

788
01:09:10,729 --> 01:09:11,897
You were right.

789
01:09:15,109 --> 01:09:16,318
About what?

790
01:09:16,610 --> 01:09:19,655
I was merely a bereaved family member.

791
01:09:21,907 --> 01:09:24,243
I'm not fit for this place.

792
01:09:53,355 --> 01:09:54,481
Na-gyeong!

793
01:09:55,691 --> 01:09:57,234
Shit.

794
01:10:10,289 --> 01:10:12,249
NIS TERRORISM TASK FORCE

795
01:10:23,093 --> 01:10:26,096
TO: HAN NA-GYEONG,
FROM: ARAN STUDIO

796
01:12:36,393 --> 01:12:38,020
RESTRICTED NUMBER

797
01:12:41,815 --> 01:12:45,861
Don't you want to find out
how Assemblyman Oh Yeong-seok survived?

798
01:13:03,212 --> 01:13:06,340
Would you like to change the world
with me?

799
01:13:19,311 --> 01:13:20,979
Find Room 119 in the blueprint

800
01:13:21,980 --> 01:13:23,607
of the National Assembly Building.

801
01:13:31,198 --> 01:13:32,241
OH YEONG-SEOK

802
01:13:35,994 --> 01:13:37,079
PERSONAL INFORMATION

803
01:13:37,746 --> 01:13:39,081
TRAGIC ATTACK ON NATIONAL ASSEMBLY

804
01:14:12,948 --> 01:14:14,074
It must be one or the other.

805
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:16,201
It's either a trap to set me up

806
01:14:16,702 --> 01:14:18,328
or a crucial informant.

807
01:14:18,412 --> 01:14:22,791
I'm considering offering the position of
Acting Prime Minister to Assemblyman Oh.

808
01:14:22,875 --> 01:14:27,337
Why must our country's disaster
become my political asset?

809
01:14:27,421 --> 01:14:31,341
Assemblyman Oh was involved
in the bombing. I'm sure of it.

810
01:14:32,009 --> 01:14:36,388
It seems Troop 707, which just landed
on the ground, is in trouble.
