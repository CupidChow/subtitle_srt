1
00:00:53,636 --> 00:01:00,602
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
PLACES AND EVENTS ARE FICTIONAL

2
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:10,695
All right, here we go!

3
00:01:20,997 --> 00:01:22,123
Thank you, Na-gyeong.

4
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,336
I won't forget

5
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,256
what you did for Jae-min.

6
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:35,428
Han-mo, we're going to start over, right?

7
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:44,354
The bomber's accomplice is
still in the Blue House.

8
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:48,775
I was given authority of the investigation

9
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:50,568
and I need your help.

10
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:51,694
I can't put

11
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:54,155
my family...

12
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:57,617
in danger again.

13
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:00,245
Sorry.

14
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:10,880
Jae-min!

15
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:56,509
It doesn't seem like Chief Jeong
will join Agent Han.

16
00:02:56,593 --> 00:03:00,346
Na-gyeong should be behind bars,
not roaming the streets freely.

17
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:07,604
This acting President of ours
couldn't care less about disrupting

18
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:09,564
the nation's law and order.

19
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,946
Secretary Cha and I made a bet.

20
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:20,116
He asked me to join your election campaign
if your approval ratings

21
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,659
exceed Minister Oh's.

22
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,121
Will you really do that?

23
00:03:25,204 --> 00:03:26,456
I hear that you'll be discussing

24
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:29,334
the Discrimination Act
at the Cabinet meeting.

25
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,504
Once the bill is passed on
to the National Assembly,

26
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,506
you'll get your wish,

27
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,301
but your approval ratings

28
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:41,721
will keep on declining.

29
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:47,101
Yesterday, those who were against the act

30
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:49,229
turned their back on you.

31
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:50,980
Tomorrow,

32
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:55,526
those who think
that you're ignoring their opinions

33
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:57,654
will leave your side.

34
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,990
Are you so reckless that you don't realize

35
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:05,662
how crucial the polls are at this time

36
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:08,665
for the election

37
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:10,792
or are you just arrogant?

38
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:13,670
Is this bill

39
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:16,881
a desire and passion of yours,

40
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:19,050
or is it you being stubborn?

41
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:22,762
Whatever it may be,

42
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,266
there will be no scenario where I...

43
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:28,434
join your campaign.

44
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:44,033
Administrator Kim will need
an extra copy, right?

45
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,451
-Sure.
-Got it.

46
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:47,161
I was surprised.

47
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,038
I didn't think

48
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:53,126
you'd ever agree
to President Park's decision to enact

49
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:54,294
the Discrimination Act.

50
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:59,674
I thought the voters' opinions
were all that mattered to you.

51
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:07,181
Secretary Cha isn't a cold-blooded man
who only cares about winning.

52
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:10,810
He's actually quite a softy
and he's bad at basketball.

53
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:12,020
Darn.

54
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,566
Touching moments make him weak as well.

55
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:20,111
My speech on humanitarianism
got to you, didn't it?

56
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:21,738
Seriously?

57
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,366
I never agreed to anything.

58
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:28,953
President Park

59
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:32,332
seems to be forgetting his position
as a presidential candidate,

60
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:33,833
so what else can I do?

61
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:35,960
He'll have to learn first-hand

62
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:38,171
how grueling it is
to bring back approval rates

63
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:40,673
that have already plummeted.

64
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:42,967
Then are you...

65
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:45,136
You're trying to tame him, aren't you?

66
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:48,347
We haven't begun any proper campaigns yet.

67
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,768
And there's still some time to fix this.

68
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:55,563
I take it back. He's as cold as it gets.

69
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:03,362
It happened just as you wanted it to.

70
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:05,198
The Discrimination Act

71
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,909
will be discussed
in today's Cabinet meeting.

72
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:11,329
President Park

73
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:15,333
has yet to have a political mindset.

74
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:22,340
KIM'S TAILOR

75
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:02,338
I must meet the VIP.

76
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:05,800
Mr. Kim!

77
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,597
Have you already forgotten, General Eun?

78
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,976
You made a pledge from the very beginning.

79
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:18,729
"Never be curious
about each other's identities.

80
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:21,649
Meeting the VIP

81
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:26,112
will only happen
when the VIP requests it."

82
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:28,281
-But--
-You even know why.

83
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:35,580
It's to ensure the safety
of you and all of us.

84
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:37,540
"All of us"?

85
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:44,881
That indicates there are other accomplices
besides General Eun.

86
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:48,593
Just how many more are there?

87
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:51,846
Well, it's safe to assume
that this Mr. Kim is the liaison.

88
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:54,098
Na-gyeong,

89
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:58,060
could Mr. Kim be Tae-ik?

90
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:02,064
What about the handwriting analysis?

91
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:05,193
We'll have the results soon.

92
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:06,360
Mr. Kim,

93
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:08,696
I know more than you think.

94
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:12,825
This isn't your average tailor shop.

95
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:16,704
You, a former spy of the South
who was sent to the North,

96
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:18,915
aren't ironing clothes at this place

97
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:21,292
because of a belatedly discovered talent.

98
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:25,880
People who are rich enough

99
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:28,090
to afford suits at a place like this...

100
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:30,468
Well, this is the place

101
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:32,845
to meet those
who have joined the operation

102
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:35,473
without having it seem
suspicious by anyone.

103
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:42,063
There's no need to let us
meet others in the operations,

104
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:44,774
and you've been controlling us

105
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:47,568
by relaying the VIP's messages to us.

106
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:51,239
And just like a tailor
would have the clients' information,

107
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:53,074
you have ours as well.

108
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:56,661
It's the sole purpose
of this tailor shop's existence.

109
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:59,247
For someone who knows that,

110
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:01,958
you seem to be

111
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,378
-quite adamant about meeting the VIP.
-Don't be mistaken.

112
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:12,134
You're not the VIP.

113
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:16,180
I wish to hear from the VIP in person

114
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:19,350
whether I can be well-protected or not.

115
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:25,314
I'll relay your message,

116
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:27,191
but like always,

117
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:29,151
the decision will be the VIP's.

118
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:37,368
I'll trust you for now.

119
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:41,539
Just so you know,
soldiers are quite naive.

120
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:44,792
All they do is follow orders

121
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,211
in the name of protecting their country.

122
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:49,213
Please tell that

123
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:51,299
to the VIP as well.

124
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,301
Will do.

125
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:55,780
KIM'S TAILOR

126
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:12,088
I have the handwriting analysis report.

127
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:17,635
After comparing

128
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:21,514
Myung Hae-joon's dying message
to his written statement...

129
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:30,773
It doesn't say Tae-ik.

130
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:34,944
Tae-ik...

131
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,738
It's more like an L than a K.

132
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:40,449
Tae-il.

133
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:44,495
Not Tae-ik,

134
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:46,539
but Tae-il?

135
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:02,054
KIM'S TAILOR

136
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:17,653
DAY 34: THE OUTCOME
EPISODE 14

137
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,586
Mr. President, it's time to head out

138
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:35,045
for the Cabinet meeting.

139
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:38,841
THE DISCRIMINATION ACT BILL

140
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:57,693
Do I look all right?

141
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:00,237
Yes, sir.

142
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:25,846
I see you chose to discuss
the Discrimination Act.

143
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:32,061
I heard your speech
requesting that I withdraw my proposal.

144
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:33,812
Do you believe that the citizens

145
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:37,399
will genuinely support
the Discrimination Act?

146
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:41,737
What do you mean by that?

147
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:46,367
Due to ethnic background,
disability, nationality, affiliation,

148
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,827
race, religion,

149
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:50,746
and even beliefs...

150
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:53,457
In every way,

151
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,794
people have found a way
to discriminate against others.

152
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,673
It's how one can be at a slight advantage

153
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:02,883
in this dog-eat-dog world.

154
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,262
It's basic instinct.

155
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:09,265
-But humans--
-Because we're human,

156
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:13,185
we can never openly admit to it, though.

157
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:17,022
No one would dare say
that they support discrimination.

158
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:21,485
It's why people

159
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:24,780
are using homosexuality as an excuse to
voice their objections

160
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:29,493
by hiding behind the justification
of religion and tradition.

161
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,874
Underneath our masks, we're selfish beings

162
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:36,917
who support discrimination
and oppose equality.

163
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,210
That's the ugly face

164
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:42,172
of the power

165
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,508
that propels the world.

166
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,221
Do you really believe that?

167
00:14:58,939 --> 00:14:59,940
Tomorrow,

168
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:03,068
I will announce
my candidacy for President.

169
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:04,445
I'm joining the race.

170
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:07,615
Even though

171
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:10,284
you dream of a nation

172
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:14,788
that supports discrimination
and is against equality?

173
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:16,248
Voters

174
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:20,252
tend to lean towards the person
who advocates for them.

175
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:22,922
Don't you know that?

176
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,719
Mr. President,

177
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:34,183
you can never defeat me.

178
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,490
Hi, Minister Oh.

179
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,035
President Park is present.

180
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:12,262
MINISTER OF NATIONAL DEFENSE

181
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:13,847
MAYOR OF SEOUL

182
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:15,474
CABINET MEETING ITEMS FOR CONSIDERATION

183
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:16,433
Secretary Cha,

184
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:18,769
do you still think the same way?

185
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:23,565
You really think the people of Korea

186
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:26,402
oppose the Discrimination Act, and that

187
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:29,488
it won't help my approval ratings?

188
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:31,156
Yes.

189
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,828
Ask me 100 times if you want.
My answer will still be the same.

190
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:36,745
It's a fact.

191
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,249
This will hurt you in the elections.

192
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,002
I...

193
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:46,588
disagree.

194
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:05,190
Let us begin the fourth Cabinet meeting.

195
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,578
MAYOR OF SEOUL

196
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,750
THE DISCRIMINATION ACT BILL

197
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:31,383
The next item on the agenda

198
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:34,428
is the Discrimination Act.

199
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,015
MAYOR OF SEOUL

200
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:39,808
MINISTER OF NATIONAL DEFENSE

201
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:47,149
The Discrimination Act...

202
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:52,488
MINISTER OF NATIONAL DEFENSE

203
00:17:58,202 --> 00:17:59,411
Its legislation will be...

204
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:04,249
delegated to the next administration.

205
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:06,376
THE DISCRIMINATION ACT BILL

206
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:12,257
Is this your doing?

207
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:13,383
No.

208
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,852
That concludes the fourth Cabinet meeting.

209
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:24,937
Thank you all.

210
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:32,778
Good job today.

211
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:39,201
What happened? Why did he...

212
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,995
He chose to become
a true presidential candidate,

213
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:44,206
just like Secretary Cha wanted.

214
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:57,302
Approval ratings
can be quite scary, right?

215
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:02,975
I had no idea that President Park
would fold his cards so easily.

216
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,566
Will you be all right?

217
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:26,540
President Park withdrew the proposal
for the Discrimination Act.

218
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:32,379
He's the only person who has managed

219
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:34,756
to not move as you expected.

220
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:38,427
Maybe it's because he's not from Yeouido.

221
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:41,013
He keeps throwing curveballs instead.

222
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:43,682
So much for being called
the club owner, right?

223
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:48,270
From the party's general meeting

224
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:50,522
to the conference meetings I have with

225
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:52,149
the Judiciary Committee and the HRC,

226
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:55,027
cancel everything regarding
the Discrimination Act.

227
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:57,029
Yes, ma'am.

228
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:10,751
Were you preparing to truly pass
the Discrimination Act?

229
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:14,755
I thought you proposed
the idea to President

230
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:16,632
Park for a political reason,

231
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:19,551
but you were actually supportive of it?

232
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:29,770
Mr. Park.

233
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,230
Yes?

234
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:35,025
Can I leave the premises?

235
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:37,945
There's someone I need to see.

236
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:40,697
Yes, like that.

237
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:45,160
If you look at this, the first scene...

238
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:48,163
Director Noh, over there.

239
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:04,012
I read the article.

240
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:08,600
I knew it wouldn't be an easy choice.

241
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:12,104
You didn't have to come all this way.
I don't hate you for--

242
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:13,438
For the first time,

243
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:18,110
I desperately have the urge
to win the election.

244
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:22,155
I wish to make Korea a country

245
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,409
that doesn't have to think twice

246
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:27,995
about laws against discrimination.

247
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,626
I plan on winning the election.

248
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:39,589
When I truly run the office,
the first order of business

249
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:42,759
will be the Discrimination Act.

250
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:45,470
I came here to promise you that.

251
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:46,847
But then...

252
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:50,434
you'll be faced with
another reason to renounce it.

253
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:55,105
My girlfriend and I
love each other more than anything,

254
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:58,317
but we can't be a family.

255
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,527
The law won't recognize us as one.

256
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:07,617
The Discrimination Act
doesn't provide preferential treatment.

257
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:11,872
To people like us, we need that law

258
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:14,916
to become normal citizens.

259
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:25,719
Don't come to see me like this again
as if you are doing me a favor.

260
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:30,474
You just failed to
fully perform your duty.

261
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:47,616
But now,

262
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:50,410
you're telling me to lie,

263
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:53,622
to feign mercy

264
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:56,041
and generosity.

265
00:22:57,793 --> 00:22:58,835
Minister Park,

266
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:02,547
you do not know politics.

267
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:05,050
"You may not know politics,
but I'll let you argue policies."

268
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:08,345
It's what you promised me

269
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:10,847
that very day.

270
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:15,977
Then I'll make another one.

271
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:18,980
We agreed to renegotiate

272
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:22,317
the guidelines once again after 2021.

273
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:25,112
So when that time comes--

274
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:26,571
Until then,

275
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:29,825
our kids will grow up
breathing this polluted air.

276
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:49,177
It's your mom.

277
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:51,346
How's the weather in New York?

278
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:57,435
I'm glad you're both doing well.

279
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,314
It's good to hear you sound happy.

280
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:05,360
That's enough for me.

281
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:11,992
Sure, you stay healthy as well.

282
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:29,134
KIM'S TAILOR

283
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:33,722
If what General Eun said is true,

284
00:24:34,347 --> 00:24:37,767
there will be information on the bombers
inside that tailor shop,

285
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:41,271
as well as any leads on Oh Yeong-seok.

286
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:47,277
We can hear inside the tailor shop
even though General Eun isn't there.

287
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,696
This could be a trap.
It's too dangerous to go in alone.

288
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:52,866
Oh Yeong-seok is declaring
his candidacy tomorrow.

289
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:55,327
We must prove his involvement
with the bombing

290
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:57,871
before he becomes
a presidential candidate.

291
00:24:57,954 --> 00:25:00,290
-Na-gyeong--
-Besides, I'm not alone.

292
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:02,292
I have you watching my back.

293
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:06,338
Before we have solid evidence,

294
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:08,423
it's safer to keep it on the down-low.

295
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:12,844
Deactivate the auto security system.

296
00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:18,767
Be careful, Na-gyeong.

297
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:25,106
The security system has been deactivated.

298
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:34,801
Play the recording after General Eun left.

299
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:37,095
Just a second.

300
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:46,456
Run the vault keypad sound recording
on our decryption program.

301
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:03,848
I just sent you the passcode.

302
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:07,537
Na-gyeong?

303
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:10,331
What's going on?

304
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:12,625
Answer me.

305
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:14,127
Na-gyeong?

306
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:15,545
Na-gyeong!

307
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:20,091
Damn it.

308
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:03,968
Check the security cameras
in the vicinity.

309
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:05,053
Sure.

310
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,597
This is Na-gyeong's comm device.

311
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:10,391
Where could she have been taken?

312
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,230
Did you locate Agent Han?

313
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:18,441
When we arrived at the scene,
she was gone as well as whoever took her.

314
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:22,111
We assume the bombers have taken her,

315
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:24,989
and we've started checking
security cameras on nearby streets.

316
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,537
I'll keep you posted with any news I get.

317
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:31,996
Sir.

318
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:37,502
Mr. Kang.

319
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:39,712
Yes?

320
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:48,972
I don't want anyone else

321
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:52,100
to be a victim of the terror attack.

322
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:55,019
Please make sure of that.

323
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:29,762
Tell the VIP

324
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:32,348
that I want a face-to-face meeting.

325
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:35,518
I have lost

326
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:38,688
my trust in you.

327
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:41,774
Do you still lack faith?

328
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:46,738
Everything is going as the VIP planned.

329
00:31:48,114 --> 00:31:49,699
The National Assembly Building bombing,

330
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:52,327
your miraculous survival,

331
00:31:53,369 --> 00:31:54,787
and your approval ratings.

332
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:57,040
Do you really think
that everything is going as planned?

333
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:01,336
Acting President Park and--

334
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:04,714
You do not need to worry
about Agent Han Na-gyeong.

335
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:09,135
She won't be a nuisance anymore.

336
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:13,222
She will never say another word again.

337
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:14,933
Agent Han

338
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,352
is the lead investigator of the bombing

339
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:21,189
whom President Park gave
full authority to.

340
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:24,192
If something happens to her--

341
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:25,652
Even so,

342
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:29,781
President Park won't be able
to do anything about it.

343
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:32,784
She is currently

344
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:35,370
held up in a detention center right now

345
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:37,288
as an offender.

346
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:45,338
In 30 days,

347
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,715
you will become this nation's President.

348
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:50,343
Right now,

349
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:53,596
all you need to focus on
is your candidacy announcement tomorrow,

350
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:57,100
Presidential Candidate Oh.

351
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:00,645
You listen to me.

352
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:03,022
Once I become President,

353
00:33:03,856 --> 00:33:07,402
the VIP will not be able to do anything
without going through me.

354
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:10,321
The VIP may have given me
a chance to begin with,

355
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:14,575
but now I'm offering
the VIP a chance in return.

356
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:17,787
Let the VIP know

357
00:33:19,288 --> 00:33:23,334
that I must have
a face-to-face meeting immediately.

358
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:30,425
After your announcement tomorrow,

359
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,677
I'll set up a meeting.

360
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:17,889
Lower it and fix it to the wall.

361
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:20,725
-And check the flags on both sides.
-Okay.

362
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:25,104
Reporters, you can come in
and set up your cameras.

363
00:34:26,355 --> 00:34:28,149
There isn't much space,
so put two on the right

364
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:30,485
-and leave one on the table.
-Please come this way.

365
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:33,154
I marked the location.
You'll be able to see it.

366
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:36,032
Please check the script
we gave you as well.

367
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:37,450
Okay.

368
00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:45,083
MIRACULOUS SURVIVOR OH YEONG-SEOK
RUNS FOR PRESIDENT

369
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:54,342
My presidential campaign will
officially begin this afternoon.

370
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:57,136
They'll appoint a secretary to me there.

371
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:02,975
You did a great job, Sang-min.

372
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:05,269
It was an honor.

373
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:08,606
You don't have to be
so uptight with me now.

374
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:12,568
You're the only one who believes
I'm a true soldier, sir.

375
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:27,542
Any news on Agent Han yet?

376
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:29,001
I'm sorry, sir.

377
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:32,338
I should do something.

378
00:35:33,714 --> 00:35:36,300
Let's ask the police and prosecution
to start an open investigation.

379
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:38,469
But President Park, Agent Han is--

380
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:41,430
I'll shoulder the political burden.

381
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:54,110
I've taken care of Agent Han

382
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:56,529
like you told me to.

383
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:03,494
It hasn't been that long
since the bombing,

384
00:36:04,787 --> 00:36:06,789
but how is everyone so relaxed?

385
00:36:07,915 --> 00:36:09,709
If Agent Han was the target,

386
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:13,171
it could have been better
to do it more quietly.

387
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:18,050
You...

388
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:20,511
seem to be doing some thinking nowadays.

389
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:26,851
You...

390
00:36:27,768 --> 00:36:29,061
talk too much.

391
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:38,613
Minister Oh is announcing
his presidential candidacy today.

392
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:40,698
I should at least send flowers.

393
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:49,558
People nowadays...

394
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:53,854
forget too easily.

395
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:03,155
When people are scared,
they don't think about anything else.

396
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:07,827
We should show people that
anything can happen anytime.

397
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:09,578
And to Minister Oh as well.

398
00:40:58,289 --> 00:40:59,999
Na-gyeong, are you okay?

399
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:02,168
Where are you right now?

400
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:16,390
Na-gyeong.

401
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:18,350
What happened?

402
00:41:25,065 --> 00:41:27,485
Minister Oh's press conference venue
hasn't changed, right?

403
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:30,988
Why? Are you actually going to go there?
In this state?

404
00:41:34,408 --> 00:41:35,659
I need to use your phone.

405
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:39,455
Agent Han?

406
00:41:41,123 --> 00:41:42,124
Are you safe?

407
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:44,543
I've called to report...

408
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:50,257
that I've secured evidence that
Minister Oh is connected to the bombers.

409
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:58,849
SENDING FILE

410
00:42:03,979 --> 00:42:07,858
Would you help us arrest Minister oh
as a suspect

411
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:10,528
of the bombing?

412
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:16,992
May I have the attention
of all the reporters in the room?

413
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:19,870
We will soon begin
Minister Oh's press conference

414
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:22,873
to announce his presidential candidacy.

415
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:24,268
-What is going on?
-He's late!

416
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:25,853
What's this?

417
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:27,730
Who are you?

418
00:43:29,398 --> 00:43:30,858
Where is Minister Oh?

419
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:32,735
I'm not sure either.

420
00:44:03,098 --> 00:44:04,767
You've gone through so much, Agent Han.

421
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:11,857
Thank you for returning safely.

422
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:14,568
I'm sorry.

423
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:17,321
I've failed...

424
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:19,490
to arrest Minister Oh.

425
00:44:23,577 --> 00:44:26,830
Considering how he canceled
the press conference and disappeared,

426
00:44:27,414 --> 00:44:30,834
he must know by now
that he's being investigated

427
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:32,086
for the bombing.

428
00:44:33,128 --> 00:44:35,130
He has been banned from traveling overseas

429
00:44:35,631 --> 00:44:37,341
and he is known to the public.

430
00:44:37,716 --> 00:44:41,011
Even if he is on the run, arresting him
is only a matter of time, sir.

431
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:46,558
If the truth is revealed,

432
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:52,106
our people will be in great shock.

433
00:44:53,732 --> 00:44:57,736
The Blue House won't be free
from criticism

434
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:00,531
for appointing him
as Minister of National Defense.

435
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:03,200
It could be the opposite.

436
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:07,621
If you arrest Minister Oh during your term

437
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:11,041
and reveal at least a part of the truth
regarding the bombing,

438
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:13,544
it could become your biggest achievement.

439
00:45:13,627 --> 00:45:16,713
It will definitely work as an advantage
in the election.

440
00:45:28,684 --> 00:45:32,479
OH YEONG-SEOK CANDIDACY ANNOUNCEMENT

441
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:42,364
MR. KIM

442
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:52,749
The person you are calling is unavailable.

443
00:45:55,043 --> 00:45:56,628
After your announcement tomorrow,

444
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:58,255
I'll set up a meeting.

445
00:46:07,764 --> 00:46:09,308
You're right, Minister Oh.

446
00:46:10,893 --> 00:46:12,186
Benito Mussolini,

447
00:46:12,811 --> 00:46:14,104
Adolf Hitler

448
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:15,647
and Hugo Chavez...

449
00:46:17,774 --> 00:46:18,984
They were all

450
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:23,030
young politicians each chosen
by their VIPs.

451
00:46:24,072 --> 00:46:25,407
Like you, Minister Oh.

452
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:29,077
However, the situation changed

453
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:31,288
when they were chosen by the people.

454
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:33,999
Like you said, Minister Oh.

455
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:39,087
Do you know that

456
00:46:41,548 --> 00:46:42,716
none of them...

457
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:47,304
ended their lives beautifully?

458
00:46:56,897 --> 00:46:58,148
I hope...

459
00:46:59,441 --> 00:47:01,360
it ends differently for you.

460
00:47:09,201 --> 00:47:11,870
GENERAL EUN HUI-JEONG

461
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:21,547
This is Eun Hui-jeong.

462
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:27,052
Have you considered my offer?

463
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:29,596
The military option... No,

464
00:47:30,556 --> 00:47:32,849
you probably have no other options now.

465
00:47:33,642 --> 00:47:34,851
What does that mean?

466
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:37,271
Mr. Kim...

467
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:41,942
No, the VIP won't protect you any longer.

468
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:46,530
Do you plan to take all the blame
for the National Assembly bombing

469
00:47:46,613 --> 00:47:48,740
and be remembered as a criminal
in history?

470
00:47:52,077 --> 00:47:54,204
How would that change...

471
00:47:56,915 --> 00:47:58,333
if I join hands with you?

472
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:02,337
If you get rid
of President Park's administration

473
00:48:02,421 --> 00:48:04,423
before an investigation starts,

474
00:48:06,091 --> 00:48:10,220
you'll remain the miraculous survivor,
not a bomber,

475
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:12,639
and a political leader

476
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:15,392
that ended the incompetent
administration of President Park.

477
00:48:15,976 --> 00:48:18,437
History is a record of winners.

478
00:48:19,187 --> 00:48:20,564
You have to win...

479
00:48:21,648 --> 00:48:23,692
by any means necessary.

480
00:48:35,704 --> 00:48:37,706
Will Minister Oh listen to you?

481
00:48:37,956 --> 00:48:39,583
Do you think he will join us?

482
00:48:39,666 --> 00:48:41,209
He will.

483
00:48:41,835 --> 00:48:43,629
I designed it that way.

484
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:47,507
-Excuse me?
-To plot a rebellion,

485
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:49,926
you need a cause and a representative.

486
00:48:50,802 --> 00:48:53,430
I can't say I raised an army

487
00:48:53,513 --> 00:48:55,891
because I was suspected
to be related to the bombing.

488
00:48:59,728 --> 00:49:03,815
As much as we need
the miraculous survivor for our plan,

489
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:07,861
I made sure he needs us too,

490
00:49:08,236 --> 00:49:09,321
just like now.

491
00:49:37,933 --> 00:49:39,434
Did you set up a trap

492
00:49:39,935 --> 00:49:41,561
so Agent Han would obtain

493
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:44,022
evidence on Minister Oh?

494
00:49:44,606 --> 00:49:47,818
That was the only way
to make him work with me.

495
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:52,197
Have you agreed to accept
General Eun's offer?

496
00:49:52,864 --> 00:49:54,324
Do you plan...

497
00:49:55,367 --> 00:49:56,993
to join hands with the military?

498
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,581
This was my decision.

499
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:05,043
I can't end it like this.

500
00:50:07,546 --> 00:50:08,422
We...

501
00:50:11,174 --> 00:50:13,427
made a promise
in front of our dying comrades.

502
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:16,179
We promised...

503
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:19,349
we wouldn't let fake peace exist in Korea

504
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:22,018
and that we'd never forgive
hypocrites in high places.

505
00:50:24,062 --> 00:50:25,480
I can't let that promise...

506
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:29,109
come to nothing.

507
00:50:30,902 --> 00:50:32,320
I haven't even started.

508
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:36,074
I need power right now. No,

509
00:50:38,785 --> 00:50:40,537
I need time.

510
00:50:43,081 --> 00:50:44,791
You don't have to explain to me.

511
00:50:46,626 --> 00:50:48,295
Whatever you do at any time or place

512
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:52,466
won't change the fact that you
are a hero to me, sir.

513
00:50:55,552 --> 00:50:57,804
I'll take you straight
to the Capital Defense Command.

514
00:51:19,367 --> 00:51:24,122
First, we'll quickly move the divisions
on the outskirts of Seoul.

515
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:27,501
They will gather in front
of the Capital Defense Command

516
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:30,504
by 2300 when we will launch our operation.

517
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:33,799
Special Ops and the Army Air Command

518
00:51:33,882 --> 00:51:36,134
are with us and are waiting for orders.

519
00:51:36,718 --> 00:51:39,596
We plan to send
the mechanized infantry division

520
00:51:39,679 --> 00:51:42,182
and the armored division with tanks
to Yeouido and Gwanghwamun.

521
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:45,852
The military...

522
00:51:46,394 --> 00:51:50,357
has decided to end this strategy
of being patient.

523
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:54,152
We've agreed that we can
no longer accept President Park

524
00:51:54,236 --> 00:51:57,280
as the commander-in-chief of our military.

525
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:10,210
We're asking him to pay for the confusion
ever since the bombing.

526
00:52:11,503 --> 00:52:13,839
More importantly, President Park

527
00:52:13,922 --> 00:52:17,300
released General Lee of his post
and even locked him up

528
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:19,469
when he stands for our military.

529
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:23,348
Why should the military
be humiliated like this?

530
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:26,518
We are the ones

531
00:52:27,185 --> 00:52:29,855
that have been defending democracy!

532
00:52:34,609 --> 00:52:35,610
Tonight,

533
00:52:36,278 --> 00:52:38,738
we are tightening the discipline
of our country.

534
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,409
It is now time for the military

535
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:45,412
to lead the history of Korea.

536
00:52:51,251 --> 00:52:55,297
STRONG SECURITY AND RESPONSIBILITY

537
00:53:09,936 --> 00:53:11,438
Tonight at 11 p.m.

538
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:18,612
Ji-won, it's Han-mo.

539
00:53:19,237 --> 00:53:21,031
Listen carefully to what I say.

540
00:53:34,336 --> 00:53:35,503
Han-mo?

541
00:53:54,606 --> 00:53:55,607
Han-mo.

542
00:53:58,193 --> 00:53:59,611
You're an outstanding agent.

543
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:03,740
You tapped my phone and tailed me.

544
00:54:06,451 --> 00:54:07,535
Director Ji,

545
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:09,955
turn yourself in

546
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:12,540
now,

547
00:54:13,541 --> 00:54:14,542
before it's too late.

548
00:54:21,257 --> 00:54:24,135
I'm driving at 180km an hour
on an 8-lane highway.

549
00:54:26,012 --> 00:54:27,263
How can I stop?

550
00:54:29,391 --> 00:54:31,518
If I brake, it'll cause a huge accident.

551
00:54:32,477 --> 00:54:33,687
If I make a U-turn,

552
00:54:34,312 --> 00:54:35,397
it'll cause a catastrophe.

553
00:54:36,398 --> 00:54:37,315
Am I wrong?

554
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:41,861
Do you have the location yet?

555
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:43,697
Give me a second.

556
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:46,449
I found him.

557
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:48,785
It's near the Capital Defense Command.

558
00:54:54,499 --> 00:54:55,500
Han-mo.

559
00:54:56,793 --> 00:54:58,545
Let's go our separate ways.

560
00:55:08,179 --> 00:55:09,180
Director Ji.

561
00:55:18,523 --> 00:55:20,859
Beat him up until he's barely alive
and bring him to me.

562
00:55:23,111 --> 00:55:25,739
Make sure all he can do is scream.

563
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:28,950
Yes, sir.

564
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:31,494
You bastard!

565
00:56:33,139 --> 00:56:34,641
Damn it.

566
00:56:39,813 --> 00:56:41,022
Shit.

567
00:56:47,654 --> 00:56:48,822
Damn it.

568
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:56,955
-Run!
-Run!

569
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:10,343
Are you okay?

570
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:14,681
Na-gyeong.

571
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:19,978
What happened?

572
00:57:20,562 --> 00:57:22,522
You said you'd stay away from danger.

573
00:57:23,898 --> 00:57:26,526
Isn't Jeong Han-mo one excellent agent?

574
00:57:26,943 --> 00:57:30,864
He fooled Han Na-gyeong,
the best analyst in our team.

575
00:57:32,949 --> 00:57:33,992
My gosh.

576
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:38,288
Are you okay, Han-mo?

577
00:57:42,375 --> 00:57:43,418
Sir.

578
00:57:55,972 --> 00:57:58,266
Do you think it's true?
How is that possible?

579
00:57:58,892 --> 00:58:02,353
We all assumed something would happen
after the bombing.

580
00:58:03,897 --> 00:58:05,315
EXTRA TROOP DEPLOYMENT IN SEOUL

581
00:58:05,398 --> 00:58:08,568
There's a chance
that the military will use force,

582
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:11,738
led by General Eun Hui-jeong,
Minister Oh Yeong-seok,

583
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:13,406
and NIS Deputy Director Ji Yun-bae.

584
00:58:13,531 --> 00:58:16,910
In other words, there's a sign of a coup.

585
00:58:19,245 --> 00:58:20,955
Have you also found out

586
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:23,791
why they're suddenly trying to show force
using the military?

587
00:58:23,875 --> 00:58:27,378
We've found evidence proving
that Minister Oh Yeong-seok

588
00:58:27,462 --> 00:58:29,255
and General Eun Hui-jeong are moles

589
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:32,717
related to the bombing
at the National Assembly building.

590
00:58:34,135 --> 00:58:35,178
Sir.

591
00:58:36,262 --> 00:58:38,473
The H-hour is 11:00 p.m.

592
00:58:38,556 --> 00:58:43,269
The troops near the metropolitan area will
assemble near the Capital Defense Command.

593
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:46,064
They're planning to put
the mechanized infantry division,

594
00:58:46,147 --> 00:58:48,358
the armored brigades, and tank forces

595
00:58:48,441 --> 00:58:51,277
in Yeouido and Gwanghwamun.

596
00:58:54,489 --> 00:58:55,698
Is that possible?

597
00:58:58,493 --> 00:58:59,827
This is Korea in the 21st century.

598
00:59:01,162 --> 00:59:04,666
The consciousness of our soldiers
is at a higher level than before.

599
00:59:04,749 --> 00:59:07,210
Do you still think

600
00:59:08,461 --> 00:59:09,671
there can be a coup?

601
00:59:11,089 --> 00:59:13,341
With the support
of the Capital Defense Command,

602
00:59:13,925 --> 00:59:16,594
the Special Ops,
and the Aviation Operations Command,

603
00:59:17,136 --> 00:59:20,223
Seoul and the metropolitan area
will easily fall.

604
00:59:20,306 --> 00:59:23,935
In the military, hierarchy is
what matters the most.

605
00:59:24,018 --> 00:59:25,186
Once the leaders are resolved,

606
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:27,313
the consciousness of each individual
doesn't matter.

607
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:31,317
Still, General Lee Gwan-muk was

608
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:33,152
the most trusted man in the military.

609
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:36,281
There's no way that General Eun
could've perfectly made an ally

610
00:59:36,364 --> 00:59:38,408
of the Capital Defense Command,
the Special Ops,

611
00:59:38,783 --> 00:59:42,203
and the Aviation Operations Command
in such a short time.

612
00:59:43,663 --> 00:59:46,916
This strategy is impossible.

613
00:59:49,002 --> 00:59:50,253
General Eun is leading

614
00:59:51,045 --> 00:59:53,673
the biggest private elite group,

615
00:59:54,257 --> 00:59:56,259
the Milky Way Society.

616
00:59:58,886 --> 01:00:00,138
The Milky Way Society?

617
01:00:02,015 --> 01:00:05,101
It's a private elite group

618
01:00:05,184 --> 01:00:08,396
with top Military Academy graduates
as members.

619
01:00:08,855 --> 01:00:11,691
It's named "Milky Way"
because there are many stars.

620
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:14,110
The current chief of the Special Ops,

621
01:00:14,193 --> 01:00:16,904
the commander of Capital Defense Command,

622
01:00:16,988 --> 01:00:20,617
the commander of the Aviation Operations
Command, and the commander of DSSC

623
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:22,493
are members of the society.

624
01:00:24,996 --> 01:00:26,623
General Eun has carried out

625
01:00:26,706 --> 01:00:29,667
the changes in personnel
right before the bombing.

626
01:00:29,751 --> 01:00:31,002
He seems to have considered

627
01:00:32,045 --> 01:00:36,507
a military provocation after the bombing
from the beginning.

628
01:00:46,392 --> 01:00:48,978
Finally, you're listening to me. Mr. Kim.

629
01:00:49,604 --> 01:00:54,942
The VIP passed on
his great concerns about the matter.

630
01:00:55,026 --> 01:00:58,529
He said you have his full support, sir.

631
01:00:59,906 --> 01:01:01,324
"Full support"?

632
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:04,494
What a beautiful phrase.

633
01:01:05,411 --> 01:01:08,706
I'd love to hear that nice phrase
from him in person.

634
01:01:09,707 --> 01:01:12,377
I'd like to hear him say it himself
before my eyes.

635
01:01:16,839 --> 01:01:21,052
The VIP is the person
I think he is, right?

636
01:01:24,555 --> 01:01:26,557
Well, whoever it is, it doesn't matter.

637
01:01:28,810 --> 01:01:30,228
Tomorrow,

638
01:01:30,937 --> 01:01:33,106
he'll be the one to beg me to see him.

639
01:01:34,232 --> 01:01:37,318
Tell him I will make
some time for him then

640
01:01:37,402 --> 01:01:39,445
for your sake, Mr. Kim.

641
01:01:39,946 --> 01:01:41,656
Tell him the world has changed.

642
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:44,283
I changed

643
01:01:45,159 --> 01:01:46,369
the world.

644
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:02,844
REGIONAL FORCES UNDER MARTIAL LAW

645
01:02:02,927 --> 01:02:05,596
NORTH JEOLLA PROVINCE,
SOUTH JEOLLA PROVINCE

646
01:02:12,311 --> 01:02:15,356
What we need to do now is appoint
someone in the military we can trust

647
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:17,859
and quell the rebel forces

648
01:02:18,067 --> 01:02:19,152
before 11:00 p.m.

649
01:02:22,822 --> 01:02:25,116
But do you think
there's someone reliable in the military

650
01:02:26,117 --> 01:02:29,162
that will listen to the Blue House?

651
01:02:30,455 --> 01:02:32,915
Someone we know for sure
is on Mr. President's side.

652
01:02:44,302 --> 01:02:45,344
There's one person

653
01:02:47,388 --> 01:02:50,600
who can stand against General Eun.

654
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:58,232
I'm not sure
if he'll take my side, though.

655
01:02:59,150 --> 01:03:00,485
Who is that person?

656
01:03:11,746 --> 01:03:13,581
Since the house arrest was canceled,

657
01:03:14,582 --> 01:03:17,627
I thought the ill-fated relationship
between us was over.

658
01:03:21,923 --> 01:03:24,008
What brings you all the way here?

659
01:03:27,887 --> 01:03:31,432
I would like to reinstate you
to the Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman.

660
01:03:33,184 --> 01:03:35,144
Did you say you would reinstate me?

661
01:03:35,228 --> 01:03:36,854
We have found

662
01:03:38,064 --> 01:03:40,691
that General Eun is plotting a coup.

663
01:03:43,903 --> 01:03:48,366
You want to use me to stop
the military from resorting to force.

664
01:03:48,699 --> 01:03:49,700
Am I right?

665
01:03:52,078 --> 01:03:53,120
Mr. President.

666
01:03:54,121 --> 01:03:56,999
My whole life, I have been
putting honor before everything.

667
01:03:57,375 --> 01:04:00,419
And you humiliated me twice.

668
01:04:00,795 --> 01:04:01,879
Did you forget that?

669
01:04:04,090 --> 01:04:07,635
Do you think I will just listen
to whatever you say?

670
01:04:11,347 --> 01:04:13,140
General Lee Gwan-muk

671
01:04:13,808 --> 01:04:16,644
is a typical elite military general

672
01:04:17,478 --> 01:04:19,564
who is extremely proud,
ambitious, and competitive.

673
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:24,026
I'm sure you have hurt him pretty badly.

674
01:04:25,653 --> 01:04:27,238
You will have to make a sincere apology

675
01:04:27,321 --> 01:04:29,907
and agree to whatever he says

676
01:04:31,325 --> 01:04:33,035
in order to convince him.

677
01:04:35,913 --> 01:04:37,039
General Lee, but--

678
01:04:37,123 --> 01:04:38,249
What if I turn you down?

679
01:04:39,292 --> 01:04:42,753
What are you going to do

680
01:04:43,838 --> 01:04:46,507
if I even join General Eun?

681
01:04:48,301 --> 01:04:50,428
Then this offer

682
01:04:51,012 --> 01:04:54,891
will basically be suicide for you.

683
01:04:56,267 --> 01:04:58,936
You don't know anything about the military

684
01:05:00,479 --> 01:05:04,275
to be called Commander-in-Chief.

685
01:05:12,533 --> 01:05:13,451
Let's make it clear.

686
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:21,626
Are you turning down my offer?

687
01:05:26,631 --> 01:05:28,341
If you are,

688
01:05:28,841 --> 01:05:31,052
as the Commander-in-Chief of this country,

689
01:05:31,510 --> 01:05:32,887
I have to use another way.

690
01:05:34,847 --> 01:05:37,516
As far as I know, the air force
and the navy

691
01:05:37,808 --> 01:05:41,646
were not so happy about the Korean
military focusing on the land force.

692
01:05:43,773 --> 01:05:46,692
They won't be so keen on the coup
that is led by Army Chief of Staff...

693
01:05:47,443 --> 01:05:50,154
and the Milky Way Society,
a private group.

694
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:54,909
We're going to quell the rebel forces
using the Underwater Demolition Team,

695
01:05:56,410 --> 01:06:00,122
the 2nd Marine Division,
Incheon Naval Sector Defense Command,

696
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:04,043
and the 10th Fighter Wing.

697
01:06:05,586 --> 01:06:08,089
Both the leaders
of the AOC and the Special Ops

698
01:06:08,422 --> 01:06:09,966
are from the Milky Way Society,

699
01:06:10,758 --> 01:06:13,844
but all the brigade commanders
are not Military Academy graduates.

700
01:06:14,595 --> 01:06:16,722
They are hostile to the Milky Way Society.

701
01:06:18,182 --> 01:06:19,433
I will assemble them

702
01:06:20,142 --> 01:06:22,603
and command them
to remove the coup leaders in advance.

703
01:06:23,187 --> 01:06:24,146
Mr. President.

704
01:06:24,230 --> 01:06:26,399
We won't be able to avoid bloodshed.

705
01:06:27,858 --> 01:06:31,570
But the rebel force will
definitely be quelled.

706
01:06:32,571 --> 01:06:33,447
Because

707
01:06:34,448 --> 01:06:36,117
our people have learned

708
01:06:36,742 --> 01:06:39,286
a big lesson from history.

709
01:06:41,914 --> 01:06:42,873
Do you

710
01:06:44,542 --> 01:06:46,919
want me to make that happen?

711
01:06:54,802 --> 01:06:56,012
Let's stop here.

712
01:07:15,740 --> 01:07:16,907
Mr. President.

713
01:07:18,534 --> 01:07:20,327
We must leave now.

714
01:07:42,808 --> 01:07:44,226
Let's get some rest.

715
01:08:17,593 --> 01:08:20,971
We need to go in at exactly the same time.

716
01:08:22,473 --> 01:08:23,974
We have an issue, sir.

717
01:08:26,393 --> 01:08:27,561
Go.

718
01:08:35,402 --> 01:08:36,737
I think

719
01:08:37,154 --> 01:08:39,448
the Blue House might know about our move.

720
01:08:42,368 --> 01:08:43,369
I

721
01:08:44,078 --> 01:08:46,872
looked into it through my information
line, and it seems like they do.

722
01:08:51,085 --> 01:08:56,423
REGIONAL FORCES UNDER MARTIAL LAW
EXTRA TROOP DEPLOYMENT IN SEOUL

723
01:09:02,930 --> 01:09:04,348
Then we have no choice.

724
01:09:05,850 --> 01:09:07,476
We should make our move

725
01:09:08,394 --> 01:09:10,104
before they counteract.

726
01:09:17,653 --> 01:09:20,030
Hello, it's me, Eun Hui-jeong.

727
01:09:20,781 --> 01:09:24,827
General Lee, we are ready.

728
01:09:26,162 --> 01:09:27,913
Will you join us?

729
01:09:33,085 --> 01:09:35,588
Where did you say we'd be meeting?

730
01:09:37,506 --> 01:09:39,884
Was it necessary to invite him as well?

731
01:09:41,135 --> 01:09:42,970
The more people we have to share with,

732
01:09:43,053 --> 01:09:45,848
the smaller the size of the pie we'll get.

733
01:09:47,641 --> 01:09:49,476
General Lee

734
01:09:50,060 --> 01:09:54,023
is trusted the most by the soldiers.

735
01:09:55,399 --> 01:09:58,569
Since the Blue House insulted him,

736
01:09:58,652 --> 01:10:00,321
they have passed a vote of nonconfidence.

737
01:10:03,782 --> 01:10:06,994
We need someone influential
who's not a part of the Milky Way Society.

738
01:10:10,247 --> 01:10:12,333
General Lee will give us a justification,

739
01:10:12,416 --> 01:10:16,670
and Minister Oh will be
our representative.

740
01:11:12,268 --> 01:11:13,269
Sir.

741
01:11:33,038 --> 01:11:35,082
Thank you for everything, Sang-min.

742
01:11:41,797 --> 01:11:43,132
Sir.

743
01:12:34,892 --> 01:12:38,062
You need to remain a hero until the end.

744
01:12:42,316 --> 01:12:43,567
I will protect you.

745
01:12:43,650 --> 01:12:44,777
Put that gun down.

746
01:12:45,861 --> 01:12:47,363
Put it down!

747
01:13:33,992 --> 01:13:35,452
Didn't you hear something?

748
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:40,541
Sir.

749
01:13:40,749 --> 01:13:43,669
General Lee has just arrived.

750
01:14:26,628 --> 01:14:28,130
General Lee has arrived

751
01:14:28,422 --> 01:14:30,507
at the Capital Defense Command.

752
01:14:34,386 --> 01:14:36,555
I believe he has joined hands
with General Eun.
