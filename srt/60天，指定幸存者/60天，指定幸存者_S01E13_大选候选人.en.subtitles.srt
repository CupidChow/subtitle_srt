1
00:00:53,762 --> 00:01:00,602
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
PLACES AND EVENTS ARE FICTIONAL

2
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:07,776
Will you announce your candidacy

3
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:09,569
for the presidential election?

4
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:12,030
-Please answer the question.
-Tell us, sir.

5
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:20,914
I will be

6
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:23,875
running for President.

7
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:31,424
I guess it's too hard
to let go of power once you obtain it.

8
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:34,677
I'm not sure.

9
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:38,306
Perhaps he's just beginning to recognize
his lust for power

10
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:40,767
and his competitiveness.

11
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:46,064
You said

12
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,191
that one needs

13
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:51,444
a story, charisma, and luck
to be elected President.

14
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:53,404
So?

15
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:55,240
President Park.

16
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:59,494
The bombing has turned
the powerless Minister of Environment

17
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:01,412
into the most powerful man in Korea.

18
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:03,706
He even recovered from
the assassination attempt

19
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,041
and returned to the Blue House.

20
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:09,129
Do you think President Park
has everything it takes as well?

21
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:13,216
Do you still think Minister Oh
has a better chance of winning?

22
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:15,093
Take a guess.

23
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:18,096
Woo Sin-young.

24
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:19,889
If you guess correctly,

25
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,808
I'll give you the evening news

26
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:24,102
in the upcoming reshuffle
scheduled for May.

27
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:40,910
President Park is here, sir.

28
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,088
Thank you

29
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:55,466
for handling government administration
during my absence.

30
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:58,261
I simply did

31
00:02:58,428 --> 00:02:59,846
my duty, sir.

32
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:08,897
But I'm curious to find out

33
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:11,608
who will be sitting here

34
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:14,319
in 30 days.

35
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:27,624
OH YEONG-SEOK, PARK MU-JIN,
YUN CHAN-GYEONG, KANG SANG-GU

36
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,709
Now that President Park
has announced his candidacy,

37
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:32,211
the polls will fluctuate dramatically.

38
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:35,632
His approval ratings will go up
even more, right?

39
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:38,134
The people wanted him
to enter the presidential race.

40
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:41,554
The people want a leader who has
the will for power.

41
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:44,849
But they do not trust a politician
with a lust for power.

42
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:48,519
He announced his candidacy
while he is still in office.

43
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:51,481
What will the people think of him?

44
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:56,778
Then should that be the gist
of our official statement?

45
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:59,656
Strongly condemning
President Park's lust for power.

46
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:02,533
No, let's be graceful.

47
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:05,578
There are plenty of others

48
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:08,039
who would criticize him
in such a crude manner.

49
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:10,667
Who? Me?

50
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,170
Why would President Park make me anxious?

51
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:18,216
If he joins the majority party,
he will most likely be nominated.

52
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,052
Isn't that why you dyed your hair, sir?

53
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:23,137
Not to be outdone by his looks.

54
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:33,523
Ms. Jang.

55
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:38,403
Who is the most fickle-minded person
on the entire planet?

56
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:39,696
You...

57
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:42,615
are definitely not, of course.

58
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:45,159
The answer is, the Korean voters.

59
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:48,288
Park Mu-jin is no longer
the Acting President of this country.

60
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:51,040
He is just a rookie politician now.

61
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,959
Those who applauded him for being

62
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:54,711
a breath of fresh air
when he was an amateur

63
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:56,671
will criticize his lack of experience

64
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:59,215
and point fingers at him now.

65
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:01,676
Right, people are cruel.

66
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,430
The presidential election
is an opportunity for the powerless

67
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:08,766
to finally gain the upper hand
after four years of waiting.

68
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:12,353
We should let them enjoy it a little,
don't you think?

69
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:18,985
Anyway, will President Park

70
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,697
really be nominated by...

71
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,743
I mean, will he really join the party?

72
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:31,289
When will you join a party, sir?

73
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:34,625
If you consider the nomination process,
the sooner the better.

74
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:35,877
Must I

75
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,212
join a party?

76
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:40,673
Well...

77
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:43,426
There has been

78
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:46,637
no independent candidate
who was elected President.

79
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:47,805
It's all about team power.

80
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,974
The majority party's team power
is already nonexistent

81
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:51,350
because of the bombing.

82
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:54,437
But they still have a solid group
of supporters who will vote for them.

83
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:01,861
Does the idea of joining a political party

84
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:03,529
still make you uncomfortable, sir?

85
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:04,906
I'm already...

86
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:09,160
a politician,
and no one can deny that, Secretary Cha.

87
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:10,995
Then why...

88
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:15,249
The battle against the bombers
will continue for a while

89
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,877
even after
the next administration takes office.

90
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:21,464
Transparent investigations
and political decisions

91
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:22,840
that strictly abide by the law

92
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:24,717
will be required every moment.

93
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,719
If this process

94
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:30,348
is tainted by partisanship
and a faction war,

95
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,100
it will be very unfortunate

96
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:35,103
for the people
as well as for the government.

97
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,066
I'm sorry.

98
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:43,069
Secretary Cha,

99
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:47,532
you probably wanted to recreate
the government with the majority party.

100
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:52,370
It will be

101
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:56,582
a major handicap for you
during the election, sir.

102
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:01,796
But...

103
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:05,299
let's give it a shot.

104
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:10,304
Since you're right.

105
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:24,318
I don't agree with you.

106
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:27,238
I don't understand
why you're against this, sir.

107
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:28,948
What suits President Park

108
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:32,160
is returning to academia
after completing his 60-day term.

109
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:34,871
That's all he is here to do.

110
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:38,249
Do you think he is unqualified
to be the next president?

111
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,753
I thought you cherished and trusted him
more than anybody else.

112
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:44,380
Was I wrong, sir?

113
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:46,549
Sir!

114
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:50,219
President Park...

115
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:53,973
isn't the one I can't trust.

116
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:57,018
It's the people of this country.

117
00:07:58,144 --> 00:07:58,978
Have you

118
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:01,564
already forgotten?

119
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:03,900
President Yang

120
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:08,237
dedicated his whole life
to the betterment of this country,

121
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:10,531
and yet people mocked
his good intentions...

122
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,159
And then he ended up...

123
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:23,377
Have you forgotten?

124
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,881
Have you?

125
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,969
This country...

126
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:36,933
does not deserve a good president.

127
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:41,020
-Sir.
-The people of this country

128
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:46,108
chose Minister Oh, a man who wants
to wield power as he pleases.

129
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:48,069
You saw his approval ratings.

130
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:52,073
In the end, President Park...

131
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:56,244
won't be chosen by the people.

132
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,496
And you

133
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,040
will ultimately

134
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,668
fail.

135
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,461
Just like me.

136
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:08,714
What if he gets chosen?

137
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,968
If the people choose President Park,

138
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:16,514
please do as I wish.

139
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:21,519
Park Mu-jin, an independent candidate
and a rookie politician,

140
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:26,148
really needs
a seasoned political aide like you, sir.

141
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:28,859
Someone whom the people
can trust and support.

142
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:36,158
If he passes Minister Oh in the polls,

143
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:40,580
will you join his campaign?

144
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:02,602
DAY 35: PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE
EPISODE 13

145
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:49,732
I know...

146
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:52,985
this hasn't been easy for you.

147
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:05,414
The Blue House Security Team
permitted this visit.

148
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,459
You can speak freely.

149
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:19,428
Tae-ik, Myung Hae-joon's real killer,

150
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,431
fled the scene
after taking a shot at President Park

151
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,351
and was killed.

152
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:31,440
You're the only one left

153
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,609
who had contact with Tae-ik
and the bombers.

154
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:41,492
I know that you confessed

155
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:44,620
to Myung Hae-joon's murder
because of your son, Jae-min.

156
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:48,374
Tell me anything you have
on Tae-ik and the bombers.

157
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:49,875
So that I can help you.

158
00:11:57,925 --> 00:12:00,344
Let's say that you're right,

159
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:05,558
and they blackmailed me
by holding Jae-min hostage.

160
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:09,395
Do you think I would tell you a thing?

161
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:10,855
My boy...

162
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:15,317
could die.

163
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:18,487
I will...

164
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:21,740
save Jae-min.

165
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:23,742
I promise you.

166
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:30,624
It's the only way to clear your name
as Myung Hae-joon's killer.

167
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:42,052
First, bring Jae-min home safely.

168
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:44,388
Then,

169
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,266
we'll talk about my situation.

170
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:52,897
RESTRICTED AREA

171
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:12,082
Ji-won, where are we on Jae-min?

172
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:14,835
Still?

173
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:04,718
May I eat this?

174
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:45,801
Hey. What's wrong. Hey!

175
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,845
Kid, what's wrong?

176
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:49,513
Hey!

177
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:19,043
Starting today,

178
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:22,922
your security team will be cut down
to make you seem more approachable.

179
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,549
To your posts.

180
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:31,013
Mr. President, are you all right?

181
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:38,020
We want to increase your contact
with the people as much as possible.

182
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:39,355
That's why a cultural event

183
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,982
was chosen as your first outing
as a presidential candidate.

184
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:46,028
We can subtly show the people
how much you've recovered.

185
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:48,447
Also, a political event

186
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:51,033
might be seen as premature campaigning.

187
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:55,788
When shaking someone's hand,
make sure your grip is slightly stronger.

188
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:57,164
Hold their gaze

189
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:58,916
for about two seconds.

190
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:02,252
If you want to shake your arm,
keep it between three to five times.

191
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:07,383
There's the advanced course
of a two-handed handshake,

192
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,510
but we'll practice that some other time.
It's simple.

193
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:12,554
Think of it as winning over a vote

194
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,723
every time you shake a person's hand.

195
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:19,895
Now that you've announced your candidacy,

196
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:23,732
you are a presidential candidate
to whom every single vote

197
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:24,984
is very precious.

198
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,241
I hold their gaze

199
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:34,702
for two seconds, correct?

200
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:35,953
That's right.

201
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:37,913
Two seconds.

202
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:46,046
CELEBRATING DIRECTOR NOH'S
INTERNATIONAL AWARD

203
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:56,306
This is Director Noh Ju-yeong.
He is President Park Mu-jin.

204
00:16:57,891 --> 00:17:00,019
Congratulations on your award.

205
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:05,649
This is a strange way to promote a movie.

206
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:07,818
Yes.

207
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:16,827
We'll do our best
to make sure the movie is a success.

208
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:29,923
The poster must be in the photo.

209
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,430
Could you two shake hands?

210
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:44,605
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

211
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:56,784
Mr. President,

212
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:59,703
this is your first official outing
since announcing your candidacy.

213
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:01,997
Are you here to congratulate her
on winning the award

214
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,999
or to send a political message?

215
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,962
What have you thought in the past

216
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:10,631
about Director Noh's work?

217
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:14,551
If you've taken all your photos,
we should wrap this up.

218
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:16,095
To everyone here, time is money...

219
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:21,100
I mean, votes.

220
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:35,405
"A freedom that's above all taboos."

221
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:40,661
Ever since Director Noh's debut movie,

222
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,663
this has been a constant theme,

223
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:44,373
and it was quite memorable

224
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,709
in this movie as well.

225
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:53,674
Did I get your message right,
Director Noh?

226
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:57,344
Director Noh,

227
00:18:57,594 --> 00:19:00,889
what are your thoughts on that?
Do you agree?

228
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,434
I'm not sure.

229
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:07,729
Is that what my movies say?

230
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:10,691
So what does the message
"A freedom that's above all taboos",

231
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:14,153
something that you've been expressing
continuously over the past 20 years,

232
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:16,446
mean to you personally?

233
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:30,669
Love.

234
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,008
It's the freedom to love.

235
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,833
She is the person I love.

236
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:16,924
-What?
-Seriously?

237
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:18,800
Above all taboos.

238
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:22,512
Freely.

239
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,743
THE REVEAL THAT SHOCKED EVERYONE

240
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,329
ACTING PRESIDENT PARK MU-JIN
CAN'T HIDE HIS SHOCK

241
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:49,289
THE COUPLE OF THE CENTURY!
PRESIDENT PARK SHOCKED

242
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:50,332
COURAGEOUSLY COMING OUT

243
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:54,544
Was there really no heads up
before she made this huge announcement?

244
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:57,381
This is his first outing
since his announcement.

245
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:58,757
Do you think they'll believe me?

246
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:01,385
Look at President Park's expression.

247
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:04,096
If this is an act, he deserves an Oscar.

248
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:08,892
Is it because she's a movie director?

249
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:10,477
Her life is like a movie.

250
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:14,523
Hold on. Why did she have to take
the spotlight away from President Park?

251
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:15,565
How irritating.

252
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,234
But he's still the scene-stealer.

253
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:21,154
The Discrimination Act?

254
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:25,075
It's the bill that
the UN Committee on Social Rights

255
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:26,868
has been pressing us to pass.

256
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:29,997
We'll send a document
stating how we reviewed the matter

257
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,375
and leave it at that for now.

258
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,628
We'll only send a report
saying we reviewed it?

259
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:39,381
Are you saying we should
just end it as a formality?

260
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:41,174
We have a good excuse to give to the UN.

261
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:42,843
This is good.

262
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:46,013
Since the election is coming up,
we'll defer it to the next administration.

263
00:21:48,932 --> 00:21:51,601
It's the Discrimination Act, sir.

264
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:54,604
It's the bill that has been a burden

265
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:55,814
to every administration.

266
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:04,239
That's why the UN has been urging us
for the past ten years.

267
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:09,077
The UN will be making
its evaluation on Korea

268
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:12,706
sometime in the second half of this year.

269
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:16,626
-Ms. Jeong.
-Yes, Mr. President?

270
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,170
Contact MOLEG.

271
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:22,257
Tell them to prepare a bill
for the Discrimination Act.

272
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:25,427
You don't mean

273
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:29,431
you plan to enact
the Discrimination Act, do you?

274
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:30,515
At this moment in time?

275
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,684
I don't think it's a good idea, sir.

276
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:35,979
Being so close
to the presidential election--

277
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:36,980
Chief An,

278
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:42,235
what exactly is stipulated
in the Discrimination Act?

279
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:49,367
No one may be discriminated against
or harassed

280
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:51,411
based on ethnic origin,

281
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:54,247
educational background,
age, disability, nationality,

282
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:56,666
place of birth,
sexual orientation, and the like.

283
00:22:57,959 --> 00:23:00,462
Isn't that a basic equal right

284
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:03,256
that any and all citizens of this nation

285
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,800
should be given?

286
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:09,596
What else must I consider?

287
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,650
I just can't understand him.

288
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:24,486
He announced his candidacy.

289
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:28,115
He should be focusing on his campaign,

290
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:31,034
not this Discrimination Act.

291
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:33,036
How can he be so reckless?

292
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:35,872
He doesn't know

293
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:39,417
what the Discrimination Act
means in the Korean society yet.

294
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:43,755
Tell me what this means.

295
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:49,302
COURAGEOUSLY COMING OUT

296
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:52,639
"Acting President Park
supports same-sex relationships."

297
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:55,308
Is that what it is?

298
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:59,479
This is his first
political message that he's conveying

299
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:01,606
as a presidential candidate.

300
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:04,484
Mr. Min,
how many times must I tell you this?

301
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:06,778
This was completely expected.

302
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:08,947
Look at President Park's face.
Look at his eyes.

303
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,198
You can tell he's flustered.

304
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,492
Is this the expression
of someone delivering a message?

305
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:16,079
Well, I guess you're right.

306
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:19,040
He does look quite shocked and flustered.

307
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:20,584
Right? What did I tell you?

308
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:21,668
Then...

309
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:23,962
is he against same-sex relationships?

310
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:26,965
He's against same-sex marriage as well.

311
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:31,887
Why are you being so unreasonable today,
Mr. Oh?

312
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:35,473
Same-sex relationships and marriage

313
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:39,352
isn't something you can easily state
your opinion about.

314
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:41,062
But you said so yourself.

315
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:45,442
President Park seems
quite flustered and shocked.

316
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:50,697
Maybe his hatred toward
same-sex relationships came through.

317
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:53,867
No, President Park isn't like that at all.

318
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:56,661
He has great understanding
when it comes to minorities' civil rights

319
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:58,455
and their right to pursue happiness.

320
00:24:58,538 --> 00:25:01,625
That's why he's pushing
the Discrimination Act...

321
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:04,002
The Discrimination Act?

322
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:06,171
Hold on.

323
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:09,090
That means he supports

324
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:10,675
same-sex relationships.

325
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:14,554
I'm right, aren't I?

326
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:23,772
You must recant the Discrimination Act.

327
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,691
Let the next administration handle it.

328
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:29,194
It's impossible to legislate it

329
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:32,364
and have it passed
during your current term.

330
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:34,783
If I get the bill rolling,

331
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:36,743
someone will finish it.

332
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:39,579
However, if I don't start it,

333
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:41,164
no one can get this passed

334
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:43,416
before UN's assessment this year.

335
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:45,418
-Sir--
-Here.

336
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:49,714
The US' Civil Rights Act,

337
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:51,007
the UK's Equality Act,

338
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:52,884
and Germany's Equal Treatment Act.

339
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:56,179
Australia and Canada also have an act

340
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:59,140
that promote civil rights
and prohibit discrimination.

341
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:02,602
Even Japan has an act
that is similar to these.

342
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:07,816
Are you saying
that Korea's civil rights and democracy

343
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:09,651
are inferior to theirs?

344
00:26:11,444 --> 00:26:13,738
The fact that the UN has been advising us

345
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:17,617
to legislate this act
for the past ten years

346
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:18,952
also indicates

347
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:23,123
that it will take more than ten years

348
00:26:23,206 --> 00:26:27,127
for this law to be accepted by Koreans.

349
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:32,632
Haven't you thought that perhaps
there was a reason behind the stall?

350
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:36,386
Sir.

351
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,142
I think I've made a huge mistake.

352
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,855
What is it?

353
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,489
DISCRIMINATION ACT TO BE PASSED

354
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:57,866
The media is saying

355
00:26:57,949 --> 00:27:01,453
that Director Noh coming out
at the celebratory event

356
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:04,205
was in fact a political campaign of yours

357
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:07,250
to convey your support
for same-sex relationships.

358
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:12,339
The comments on social media
and posts online

359
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:15,175
are saying that you fully support
same-sex relationships.

360
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:17,886
People are already
stating their opinions about you--

361
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:21,056
The press must have thought
the story was worth it.

362
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:23,391
At your first outing as a candidate,

363
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:26,519
Director Noh came out
about her sexual orientation.

364
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,230
And then you announced

365
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:31,399
you'd pass the Discrimination Act
to the senior aides.

366
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:35,653
Just because

367
00:27:36,571 --> 00:27:38,990
the Discrimination Act stipulates that

368
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:42,994
no one may be discriminated against due to
their sexuality or sexual orientation,

369
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:45,372
the people believe

370
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:47,624
that the law supports...

371
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:51,294
No, that it promotes and encourages
same-sex relationships.

372
00:27:52,128 --> 00:27:53,338
That is the society we live in.

373
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:58,593
Now do you realize

374
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:01,763
why the act was never legislated

375
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:06,267
even though UN urged us to for ten years?

376
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:13,608
I ask Acting President Park

377
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:17,362
to recant his decision
to legislate the Discrimination Act.

378
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:21,699
As the Minister of National Defense,

379
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:24,536
I can't approve same-sex relationships.

380
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:29,374
However,

381
00:28:31,459 --> 00:28:32,710
I do not oppose it either.

382
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:35,755
-What?
-What's he saying?

383
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:39,134
One's love for another isn't something

384
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:43,513
that the government
or other people can approve or oppose.

385
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:45,807
MINISTER OH YEONG-SEOK RELEASES STATEMENT

386
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:47,183
However, in Korea,

387
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:51,396
those who believe a family
with a mother and father to be customary

388
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:55,108
and procreation to be
the providence of God

389
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:57,986
exceed those who don't.

390
00:28:58,653 --> 00:29:01,322
Minister Oh knows how to play the game.

391
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:04,701
He used the word "customary"

392
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:06,244
to target the Confucianists

393
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:07,954
and mentioned "God"

394
00:29:08,037 --> 00:29:09,748
to target religious groups.

395
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,625
He made President Park the common enemy

396
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:16,588
while wearing that just and virtuous mask.

397
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:18,298
Hampering the unity of people...

398
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:20,049
Can you and President Park

399
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:22,427
take him on?

400
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:27,015
With the people of this nation...

401
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:31,060
Cha Yeong-jin speaking.

402
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:33,229
I will fight against it.

403
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:35,064
Yes.

404
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:40,487
Sure thing.

405
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:44,115
They are also people of this nation.

406
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:46,868
MINISTER OH YEONG-SEOK RELEASES STATEMENT

407
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:48,369
Acting President Park

408
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:52,207
acted rashly, only factoring in
his personal preference and opinions,

409
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:55,919
in deciding to legislate an act
that goes against the views of the people.

410
00:29:58,129 --> 00:29:59,547
Hampering the unity of people...

411
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:03,384
The Confucianists and religious groups
against this act

412
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:05,094
are gathering to write a petition

413
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:07,138
that demands your early resignation.

414
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:11,392
I will fight this to the end
along with all of you.

415
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:12,769
Religious groups

416
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:15,897
have the money and solidarity
to pull this off.

417
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,607
No politician has won against them.

418
00:30:18,691 --> 00:30:19,943
If the fight prolongs,

419
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:22,987
you'll be the only one getting hurt.

420
00:30:24,572 --> 00:30:26,699
This could severely damage your standing

421
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:28,451
in the first poll

422
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:30,411
since your candidacy announcement.

423
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:33,164
-But Mr. Cha--
-Sir.

424
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:40,630
You are now a presidential candidate.

425
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:44,342
The polls are everything.

426
00:30:58,731 --> 00:31:02,110
I guess reporters these days
don't care about fact checking.

427
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,486
Give me a second.

428
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:05,238
Connecting the Discrimination Act

429
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,532
with Director Noh's coming out
to say President Park

430
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:09,868
supports same-sex relationships

431
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:12,579
-is a bit too much.
-I allowed it.

432
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:15,123
Boss?

433
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:18,334
MINISTER OH YEONG-SEOK RELEASES STATEMENT

434
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:20,753
Wait...

435
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:23,715
Is it because of Minister Oh?

436
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:26,050
No, it was to help our newsroom.

437
00:31:27,343 --> 00:31:28,720
What are you talking about?

438
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:30,889
Whether it's President Park,
Minister Oh, or Mayor Kang

439
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:32,765
is none of my concern.

440
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:36,644
We just need to show that we still
have the power to shake up this game.

441
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:40,148
-Sir--
-What else do we have left to go on?

442
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,942
Personal media has taken over,

443
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:45,361
and we can't even bring in advertisements.

444
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:47,405
What can we actually do?

445
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:09,344
Please take a look at the kid.

446
00:32:13,514 --> 00:32:14,557
This way, sir.

447
00:32:16,225 --> 00:32:17,268
This way.

448
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:20,980
What did he eat?

449
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:25,151
He had a cream bun with milk.

450
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:27,487
I need 0.3mg of epinephrine. Now!

451
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:28,780
Yes, doctor.

452
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:32,951
What's wrong with him?

453
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:37,246
Is he going to live? Tell me.

454
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:41,501
Anaphylaxis... In layman's terms,
he's having an allergic reaction.

455
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:44,796
Weren't you aware of his allergies?

456
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:49,842
He suffers from severe allergies.

457
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:52,720
He might go into respiratory distress

458
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:56,099
if he eats certain kinds of
dairy products or bread.

459
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:01,729
Sir, are you really his father?

460
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:18,079
REQUESTING COOPERATION

461
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:20,498
PLEASE CONTACT THE NUMBER BELOW
IF YOU SPOT THIS CHILD

462
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,255
Yes, thank you.

463
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:30,216
Na-gyeong, they found Jae-min.

464
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:32,010
What? How?

465
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:34,887
Jae-min's allergic
to dairy products and flour, remember?

466
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:37,098
So I sent his photo and details
regarding his allergies

467
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:38,558
to every emergency care center.

468
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:41,102
That's smart of you.

469
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:44,564
You know, I've been a pretty decent guy
for some time now.

470
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:53,364
Then should I have left the boy to die?

471
00:33:57,076 --> 00:33:59,579
NIS hasn't been all over our asses

472
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:02,165
because we have the boy.

473
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:09,380
Don't worry, Mr. Kim.

474
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:12,800
I never make mistakes.

475
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:29,484
Where's my mommy?

476
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:33,112
I'm sick,

477
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,616
but my mommy didn't come?

478
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:38,493
Not even my dad?

479
00:34:43,372 --> 00:34:47,293
It's why I ate the cream bun.

480
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:59,514
You ate it on purpose?

481
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:25,623
Which way is the ER?

482
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:43,057
He's this way.

483
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:50,898
He was here.

484
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,360
Did he run, knowing we were coming?

485
00:35:56,529 --> 00:35:57,697
He couldn't have gotten far.

486
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:10,960
HYUNSUNG HOSPITAL

487
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:26,767
Na-gyeong, what is it?

488
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:29,437
It's Tae-ik.

489
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:32,481
Tae-ik is alive.

490
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:35,109
But he was gunned down.

491
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:37,403
-He died--
-No.

492
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:39,614
It was him. I'm sure of it.

493
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:07,183
Jae-min.

494
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:13,481
You're Jae-min, right?

495
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:19,737
Are you all right?

496
00:37:23,157 --> 00:37:26,118
He must've let Jae-min go
while making his escape. Thank God.

497
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:35,795
Let's go home now.

498
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:43,886
Jae-min?

499
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:46,138
Mommy!

500
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:48,516
Oh, my poor baby.

501
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:55,898
Are you all right?

502
00:37:57,024 --> 00:37:58,734
My baby.

503
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:07,034
Now that we've found him,

504
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:10,371
Han-mo will be able to come out as well.

505
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:12,873
Yes, he should.

506
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:29,390
I wonder why he left Jae-min behind.

507
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:33,185
What could've changed his mind?

508
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:34,895
Are you sure

509
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:37,523
you saw Tae-ik earlier?

510
00:38:38,899 --> 00:38:40,276
I should check.

511
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:44,739
I'll start with the corpse
that supposedly belongs to him.

512
00:38:46,198 --> 00:38:48,451
The front of his body,

513
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:51,579
especially his face,
was damaged quite severely.

514
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:54,832
I'm not sure if he'll be recognizable.

515
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:05,259
His ear.

516
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:08,346
He doesn't have a cauliflower ear.

517
00:39:09,263 --> 00:39:11,015
This isn't Tae-ik's body.

518
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,769
Tae-ik is still alive.

519
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:17,646
Ji-won,

520
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:21,150
we should start over,
starting with identifying Tae-ik.

521
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:23,778
You said

522
00:39:24,236 --> 00:39:27,406
this physical deformity occurs
to wrestlers or judo athletes.

523
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:30,910
I'll start with a list of known athletes

524
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:33,537
around his age.

525
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:41,337
Yes, I checked.

526
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:44,256
The Director of
National Crisis Management Center

527
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:46,050
when OP 5015-18 was drawn up...

528
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:49,762
Who was it?

529
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,126
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

530
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:52,283
June 20, 2018,

531
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:55,536
when the OP 5015-18 file was finalized

532
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:57,621
and demonstrated
in front of President Yang,

533
00:40:57,872 --> 00:41:01,750
you were a member
of the National Security Council.

534
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:03,002
Am I correct?

535
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:07,506
Is my diligence a problem now?

536
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:09,341
You learned

537
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:11,886
the contents of that top secret file,

538
00:41:12,386 --> 00:41:16,015
and now you're the only person alive
who has seen the contents of that file.

539
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:19,560
Why have you remained silent?

540
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:24,398
The National Assembly Building was bombed
in the same manner as the simulation.

541
00:41:24,523 --> 00:41:27,026
Why didn't you tell us about the file?

542
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:29,778
Are you accusing me
of being an accomplice?

543
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:33,365
The President's Security Team

544
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:35,367
only investigates the leakage
of classified information

545
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:37,286
and violation of security regulations.

546
00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:42,458
Mr. Kang.

547
00:41:42,958 --> 00:41:44,668
Would you have been able to say something?

548
00:41:46,795 --> 00:41:49,924
If you were the only survivor
that knew the contents of the file,

549
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:54,053
could you tell people
that you had seen it before?

550
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:59,266
Knowing very well what you kind
of suspicions you'd draw upon yourself?

551
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:03,479
I only saw it being demonstrated.

552
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:05,564
I didn't share it with anyone.

553
00:42:06,148 --> 00:42:08,776
I didn't have access to the file.

554
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:29,296
While this was an informal interrogation,
this is the procedure.

555
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:31,840
Thank you for complying
with the regulations.

556
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:42,726
Then...

557
00:42:44,436 --> 00:42:46,647
Are you saying General Eun

558
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:48,774
is an accomplice?

559
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:51,527
He denies leaking the information,

560
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:54,029
and it's true that he didn't have
access to the file.

561
00:42:57,616 --> 00:43:00,578
The important thing is to find
solid evidence about the relationship

562
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:04,498
between Minister Oh, the mole,
and the bomber.

563
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:10,421
Can't we take Agent Han's
internal investigation

564
00:43:10,504 --> 00:43:13,007
to the police and prosecution

565
00:43:13,799 --> 00:43:15,134
for an open investigation?

566
00:43:15,217 --> 00:43:17,928
We're dealing with Minister Oh.

567
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:20,306
He's the most favored
presidential candidate.

568
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:25,561
BEHIND THE BOMBING?
OH YEONG-SEOK

569
00:43:25,644 --> 00:43:28,480
If we accuse him of working
with the bomber with no solid evidence

570
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:30,149
and request an investigation,

571
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,152
it could cause a backlash.

572
00:43:35,154 --> 00:43:36,030
Backlash?

573
00:43:38,365 --> 00:43:41,035
I believe he will start a rumor
that you slandered

574
00:43:42,244 --> 00:43:44,288
the miraculous survivor Oh Yeong-seok

575
00:43:44,371 --> 00:43:46,373
and abused your authority

576
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:48,751
to get rid of your strongest opponent.

577
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:51,128
Is it...

578
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:53,964
because I've announced...

579
00:43:55,382 --> 00:43:57,051
that I'll be running for President?

580
00:44:27,289 --> 00:44:28,123
Drink this.

581
00:44:30,709 --> 00:44:31,543
Thanks.

582
00:44:41,303 --> 00:44:42,304
Honey.

583
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:45,099
You haven't explained

584
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:47,810
or given me any excuses yet.

585
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:53,440
Shouldn't you say something to me
by today?

586
00:45:02,157 --> 00:45:04,910
I was so worried you'd run for President.

587
00:45:06,286 --> 00:45:08,038
How could you do this when you know that?

588
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:13,836
You could have given me a heads-up.

589
00:45:14,503 --> 00:45:16,922
How could you
make me find out through the news?

590
00:45:17,005 --> 00:45:18,090
You...

591
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:22,261
would have been against it.

592
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:27,933
I was worried I'd reconsider it
because of that.

593
00:45:39,194 --> 00:45:40,237
Do you

594
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:42,614
feel okay?

595
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:48,454
The coffee is good.

596
00:45:52,207 --> 00:45:53,083
GONG DU-PAL

597
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:54,126
HWANG DU-SIK

598
00:45:54,209 --> 00:45:55,627
I checked former athletes...

599
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:58,464
that are around Tae-ik's age in Korea,

600
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:00,716
but I didn't find a match.

601
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:08,640
LEE JUN-HYEON

602
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:10,017
Lighten up.

603
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:12,227
I said I didn't find a match in Korea,

604
00:46:13,228 --> 00:46:15,022
not in the entire world.

605
00:46:21,528 --> 00:46:22,654
HOSHINO KEI

606
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:25,282
Hoshino Kei. He's a Japanese
mixed martial arts fighter.

607
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:30,287
Hoshino Kei? Is he Japanese?

608
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:37,085
It makes sense if he's a foreigner.

609
00:46:37,711 --> 00:46:40,506
That's why he didn't show up on the system

610
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:42,174
of the police or NIS.

611
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:45,636
He was naturalized
as a Japanese citizen in 2017.

612
00:46:46,178 --> 00:46:49,097
He was a Korean citizen before that.

613
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:55,020
His name is Lee Gyeong-pyo, born in 1982.

614
00:46:55,854 --> 00:46:57,898
He was a gold medalist
on the national judo team.

615
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:00,984
HOSHINO KEI

616
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:03,111
LEE GYEONG-PYO

617
00:47:03,195 --> 00:47:04,404
Are you sure it's the same guy?

618
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:07,407
Because they look different?

619
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:10,953
He had reconstructive surgery
for face injuries in Japan.

620
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:15,040
He's a medalist with the national team.

621
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:18,377
It doesn't make sense
that he would be naturalized in Japan.

622
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:21,088
Is there anything else
that stands out in Tae-ik's background?

623
00:47:26,552 --> 00:47:27,678
Do you remember this?

624
00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:30,097
The Woori World fire in 2016.

625
00:47:30,847 --> 00:47:33,225
Among the children that died
in the fire were Tae-ik's...

626
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:38,230
I mean, Lee Gyeong-pyo's twin sons
were among them.

627
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:54,621
Is that why he became a Japanese citizen?

628
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:56,206
Because he hated Korea.

629
00:47:59,876 --> 00:48:01,128
It's starting to make sense now.

630
00:48:02,087 --> 00:48:05,549
Because of a personal incident,
Tae-ik, who had been merciless,

631
00:48:05,841 --> 00:48:07,301
let Jae-min go.

632
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:08,844
His name isn't Tae-ik.

633
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:12,306
It's Lee Gyeong-pyo.

634
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:14,725
We know his name now.

635
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:22,107
Then who in the world is Tae-ik?

636
00:48:22,482 --> 00:48:24,151
The dying message Myung Hae-joon left...

637
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:27,112
TAE-IK

638
00:48:27,195 --> 00:48:28,405
It's one or the other.

639
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:31,992
We either read it wrong,

640
00:48:32,451 --> 00:48:35,662
or Tae-ik was never a person's name
to begin with.

641
00:48:41,043 --> 00:48:42,628
Check the handwriting again.

642
00:48:42,711 --> 00:48:44,630
Compare it to Myung Hae-joon's
written confession.

643
00:48:45,714 --> 00:48:47,007
Okay, depending on what you do.

644
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:52,721
We learned Lee Gyeong-pyo's name,

645
00:48:54,389 --> 00:48:56,975
and Jae-min is safely with his family now.

646
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:01,480
You should get a good night's sleep

647
00:49:01,688 --> 00:49:04,566
so that you can tell me what to do
or give me orders tomorrow.

648
00:49:18,372 --> 00:49:19,206
Good night.

649
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:31,051
YEOMINGWAN 1, 2, 3

650
00:49:41,561 --> 00:49:44,272
Secretary Lee isn't here.

651
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:49,403
I wondered if he had the results
for the poll.

652
00:49:58,370 --> 00:50:00,997
It's the first one since President Park's
announcement for candidacy,

653
00:50:02,207 --> 00:50:04,251
so I couldn't just sit around and wait.

654
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:12,008
The first poll results
are the most important, right?

655
00:50:12,092 --> 00:50:13,051
Yes.

656
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:17,764
since it will have a huge influence
over the swing votes.

657
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:28,984
-See you.
-Bye.

658
00:50:34,156 --> 00:50:35,574
Secretary Jeong.

659
00:50:40,954 --> 00:50:41,830
I...

660
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:50,589
thought...

661
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:54,342
about us.

662
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:01,850
Are the poll results out?

663
00:51:01,933 --> 00:51:03,935
The Discrimination Act yesterday...

664
00:51:05,604 --> 00:51:06,813
Did it impact...

665
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:09,733
Do you two have something serious
to discuss?

666
00:51:10,358 --> 00:51:11,818
Go ahead. I'll give you some privacy.

667
00:51:12,778 --> 00:51:14,780
Have we received the results of the polls?

668
00:51:14,863 --> 00:51:16,698
-The President is asking.
-Leave.

669
00:51:22,829 --> 00:51:24,623
We have the results of the polls.

670
00:51:32,964 --> 00:51:35,300
It's obvious.

671
00:51:37,886 --> 00:51:40,972
I heard the first poll results after
announcing one's candidacy is important.

672
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:43,934
I mean,

673
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:46,895
when you take the mock college exam
during sophomore year,

674
00:51:46,978 --> 00:51:49,231
you can tell who will go
to which university.

675
00:51:50,857 --> 00:51:51,900
Let's see.

676
00:51:54,903 --> 00:51:56,822
But who cares about mock exams?

677
00:51:56,905 --> 00:51:58,073
The real exam is what matters.

678
00:51:58,198 --> 00:52:00,867
The polls aren't important
whether it's the first or tenth.

679
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:03,578
You have to come in first
in the actual election.

680
00:52:18,593 --> 00:52:21,179
GENERAL ELECTION POLLS

681
00:52:25,851 --> 00:52:28,019
OH YEONG-SEOK, PARK MU-JIN,
YUN CHAN-GYEONG, KANG SANG-GU

682
00:52:28,103 --> 00:52:31,982
Is that why you came running
as soon as the poll results were out?

683
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:34,025
You want to team up for the election?

684
00:52:36,027 --> 00:52:39,573
It's about time
for the presidential elections to change.

685
00:52:39,781 --> 00:52:43,034
How long are we going to continue
using malicious propaganda

686
00:52:43,118 --> 00:52:45,745
and make our people hate politics?

687
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:48,123
There aren't any reporters,

688
00:52:48,206 --> 00:52:51,543
but you're talking like
a school principal again.

689
00:52:56,548 --> 00:52:58,717
Let's turn the tables on this election.

690
00:53:01,511 --> 00:53:03,930
Let's get rid of one of the knights
from the chess board.

691
00:53:07,475 --> 00:53:08,602
I'm going to stop...

692
00:53:10,145 --> 00:53:11,938
President Park from running for president.

693
00:53:25,285 --> 00:53:27,746
I'm here about the Discrimination Act.

694
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:32,250
Are you opposed to it too?

695
00:53:32,334 --> 00:53:34,252
I'm for it.

696
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:39,132
If you propose the bill and take it
to the National Assembly,

697
00:53:39,215 --> 00:53:40,675
I'll make sure

698
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:42,594
it passes the vote.

699
00:53:49,309 --> 00:53:51,811
Why? Can't you trust me?

700
00:53:54,147 --> 00:53:55,523
I reviewed it.

701
00:53:56,024 --> 00:53:57,108
To enact a new legislation,

702
00:53:57,692 --> 00:53:59,986
we must draw up a bill, give notice,

703
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:03,198
have the Legislative Office evaluate it,
and the Cabinet review it.

704
00:54:03,281 --> 00:54:06,743
Each step of the process
takes 20 to 60 days.

705
00:54:07,577 --> 00:54:09,329
That's impossible during my term.

706
00:54:09,871 --> 00:54:10,747
I'll give you a tip.

707
00:54:12,374 --> 00:54:15,377
You aren't the first to propose this act.

708
00:54:17,128 --> 00:54:18,755
There was an attempt to enact it

709
00:54:18,838 --> 00:54:21,925
through the government in 2007,
and the National Assembly in 2012.

710
00:54:22,008 --> 00:54:23,385
Although they both fell through.

711
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:27,639
President Yang Jin-man
made an attempt as well.

712
00:54:28,181 --> 00:54:30,892
I believe it had been evaluated
by the Legislative Office,

713
00:54:31,851 --> 00:54:33,895
but when President Yang's
approval ratings dropped,

714
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:36,314
it wasn't taken to the Cabinet.

715
00:54:36,898 --> 00:54:37,816
Is that true?

716
00:54:38,733 --> 00:54:40,902
I don't lie about things like this.

717
00:54:43,822 --> 00:54:48,034
Have the Cabinet evaluate
and send it to the National Assembly.

718
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:50,745
You can easily do that during your term.

719
00:54:52,038 --> 00:54:53,540
It'll be a burden to you as well

720
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:56,584
with the election coming up.

721
00:54:58,044 --> 00:55:01,172
That's why I'm asking you
to share the burden

722
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:03,383
evenly between us.

723
00:55:06,177 --> 00:55:07,721
If we miss this chance,

724
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:11,850
the Discrimination Act might
never be enacted in Korea.

725
00:55:12,434 --> 00:55:13,268
Why not?

726
00:55:14,936 --> 00:55:17,689
It'll be hard for someone
as politically uncalculating as you

727
00:55:17,856 --> 00:55:20,191
to become President again, that's why.

728
00:55:27,782 --> 00:55:28,783
Assemblywoman Yun,

729
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:32,162
you never mentioned
to our party members...

730
00:55:33,079 --> 00:55:35,457
that you agree
with the Discrimination Act.

731
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:38,209
Then why...

732
00:55:39,878 --> 00:55:40,879
Assemblywoman Yun?

733
00:55:41,921 --> 00:55:44,424
Assemblywoman Yun is being
transparent and reasonable.

734
00:55:45,258 --> 00:55:47,635
It'll be hard for her or the party

735
00:55:47,719 --> 00:55:49,721
to motion the bill.

736
00:55:49,804 --> 00:55:52,265
It's different from what they've
been going for until now.

737
00:55:52,348 --> 00:55:53,975
That's why she reached out to you.

738
00:55:54,851 --> 00:55:56,019
If it is legislated,

739
00:55:56,102 --> 00:55:58,646
she'll make sure the National Assembly
passes the bill.

740
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:01,107
She's a master of politics,
just like I thought.

741
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:05,111
The reason she's a master of politics

742
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:06,613
is because she never

743
00:56:06,696 --> 00:56:09,157
got her hands dirty
in eliminating an opponent.

744
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:10,784
Her goal

745
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:13,161
is for you to get torn apart by the people

746
00:56:13,244 --> 00:56:16,122
and become a wreck
when you propose the bill.

747
00:56:16,581 --> 00:56:19,626
Your head isn't an ornament
to look pretty.

748
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:20,794
Think about it.

749
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:23,838
It's not possible for Assemblywoman Yun
to move the entire National Assembly.

750
00:56:24,297 --> 00:56:26,758
Are you naive or stupid?

751
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:30,470
If you keep being so calculating,

752
00:56:30,553 --> 00:56:34,182
when will the government be able
to move the people?

753
00:56:34,265 --> 00:56:36,059
What's the point
in recreating the government

754
00:56:36,142 --> 00:56:37,811
if we don't propose any bills
for five years

755
00:56:37,894 --> 00:56:39,395
and just worry about approval ratings?

756
00:56:39,479 --> 00:56:40,814
You, Secretary Cha, are

757
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:43,775
no better than Assemblywoman Yun,
whom you criticize. You know that, right?

758
00:56:43,858 --> 00:56:46,736
Why are we here in the first place?

759
00:56:47,403 --> 00:56:48,613
Stop it.

760
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:52,200
That's enough.

761
00:56:53,243 --> 00:56:54,494
Thanks to you two,

762
00:56:54,953 --> 00:56:56,538
I've realized something.

763
00:56:57,122 --> 00:57:00,792
That was more than enough
for me to realize

764
00:57:01,459 --> 00:57:04,045
how hard it is for the act
to gain a national consensus.

765
00:57:05,296 --> 00:57:06,965
From this moment on,

766
00:57:07,048 --> 00:57:10,301
neither of you say anything
for or against it.

767
00:57:10,385 --> 00:57:11,636
I'll decide.

768
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:13,179
-Sir.
-Sir.

769
00:57:17,642 --> 00:57:18,726
You are dismissed.

770
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:40,498
Hey, Cha.

771
00:57:46,004 --> 00:57:47,005
Let's talk.

772
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:49,257
"Hey, Cha"?

773
00:57:51,342 --> 00:57:52,886
We can't settle this with words.

774
00:57:53,219 --> 00:57:54,220
Not today.

775
00:57:55,263 --> 00:57:56,264
Right?

776
00:57:58,933 --> 00:58:00,226
Let's take this outside.

777
00:59:16,761 --> 00:59:17,804
All right.

778
00:59:25,186 --> 00:59:26,271
I'm on a roll today.

779
00:59:29,857 --> 00:59:30,858
That's right.

780
01:00:01,389 --> 01:00:03,600
The competitive Secretary Cha

781
01:00:03,683 --> 01:00:06,269
won't be getting any sleep tonight.

782
01:00:09,397 --> 01:00:11,816
To bless all without alienating,

783
01:00:11,899 --> 01:00:15,153
excluding,
or discriminating against anyone.

784
01:00:17,488 --> 01:00:18,740
I'm not talking about the act.

785
01:00:18,823 --> 01:00:21,117
It's what Dangun said
about humanitarianism.

786
01:00:21,409 --> 01:00:24,078
He had quite some foresight, didn't he?

787
01:00:24,412 --> 01:00:25,830
Keep the victory speech short.

788
01:00:25,913 --> 01:00:26,998
Okay.

789
01:00:27,081 --> 01:00:27,915
Good.

790
01:00:28,416 --> 01:00:29,417
I...

791
01:00:30,251 --> 01:00:34,172
wake up at 4:30 am and come to work
while the stars are still out.

792
01:00:34,756 --> 01:00:36,924
I get pestered by reporters all day long.

793
01:00:37,508 --> 01:00:38,760
At night,

794
01:00:40,303 --> 01:00:43,348
I can't even meet friends for a drink,
because I'm scared I may oversleep.

795
01:00:43,431 --> 01:00:45,475
You're not the only one doing that.

796
01:00:45,558 --> 01:00:46,726
Exactly.

797
01:00:55,234 --> 01:00:56,402
For the past two years,

798
01:00:58,571 --> 01:01:00,365
I thought we were
fighting for a Blue House

799
01:01:00,448 --> 01:01:03,368
that can propose something
like the Discrimination Act,

800
01:01:06,746 --> 01:01:07,997
Did you think differently?

801
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:57,714
This is hardly the right place
for the Army Chief of Staff

802
01:01:59,674 --> 01:02:01,467
to report
to the Minister of National Defense.

803
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:04,554
It's because I'm not reporting
to the Minister of National Defense.

804
01:02:09,517 --> 01:02:11,352
Minister Oh.

805
01:02:12,812 --> 01:02:14,731
You're the miraculous survivor

806
01:02:14,814 --> 01:02:16,441
designed by the VIP,

807
01:02:17,191 --> 01:02:18,359
right?

808
01:02:23,531 --> 01:02:25,867
I assumed so
when I saw you in the Blue House.

809
01:02:26,659 --> 01:02:29,412
You were so cocky in front of me.

810
01:02:32,206 --> 01:02:34,167
That means someone has got your back.

811
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:37,336
Someone who is

812
01:02:38,045 --> 01:02:39,547
incredibly powerful.

813
01:02:40,339 --> 01:02:41,299
The VIP.

814
01:02:43,217 --> 01:02:44,218
You know what?

815
01:02:44,302 --> 01:02:46,637
You think the NIS agent's documents

816
01:02:46,721 --> 01:02:48,347
that prove you were
the bomber's accomplice

817
01:02:48,890 --> 01:02:50,641
were destroyed, don't you?

818
01:02:53,227 --> 01:02:54,145
They were not.

819
01:02:55,605 --> 01:02:57,023
The VIP has them.

820
01:03:01,861 --> 01:03:03,279
At this rate,

821
01:03:04,155 --> 01:03:06,199
even if you become President,

822
01:03:06,282 --> 01:03:07,617
nothing will change.

823
01:03:08,951 --> 01:03:09,911
You will

824
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:12,997
continue to be the VIP's player, a puppet,

825
01:03:13,956 --> 01:03:16,042
and nothing more
for the rest of your life.

826
01:03:19,086 --> 01:03:21,255
Do you really want to live
as the VIP's puppet

827
01:03:22,673 --> 01:03:23,841
for the rest of your life?

828
01:03:25,676 --> 01:03:27,011
What is it that you want to say?

829
01:03:37,897 --> 01:03:39,273
Let's design

830
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:41,859
the whole thing again.

831
01:03:43,528 --> 01:03:45,988
You and I have a power

832
01:03:46,614 --> 01:03:49,158
that no one can look down on.

833
01:03:57,959 --> 01:03:59,043
I am currently...

834
01:04:00,628 --> 01:04:02,797
the leading Presidential candidate.

835
01:04:04,257 --> 01:04:05,758
If nothing special happens,

836
01:04:06,425 --> 01:04:08,427
I will be the President
of this country in one month.

837
01:04:10,596 --> 01:04:12,139
What are you talking about?

838
01:04:13,558 --> 01:04:14,517
I assure you.

839
01:04:15,518 --> 01:04:18,896
You will need my help before long,

840
01:04:19,689 --> 01:04:20,940
Minister Oh Yeong-seok.

841
01:04:27,864 --> 01:04:29,156
It's just as you expected.

842
01:04:30,074 --> 01:04:32,994
General Eun started to meet
with the bombers.

843
01:04:33,744 --> 01:04:36,664
Because he thinks we're onto him,

844
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:42,044
he'll keep searching for an accomplice

845
01:04:42,128 --> 01:04:44,422
who will be able to protect him.

846
01:04:46,632 --> 01:04:48,217
Who is that VIP?

847
01:04:48,926 --> 01:04:51,387
He said that VIP has the evidence
on Minister Oh

848
01:04:52,013 --> 01:04:53,931
that we have been looking for.

849
01:04:58,603 --> 01:05:00,605
We need to find the VIP.

850
01:05:00,688 --> 01:05:03,232
EUN HUI-JEONG

851
01:05:06,986 --> 01:05:08,905
I need to meet the VIP, Mr. Kim.

852
01:05:13,034 --> 01:05:14,785
I'm pretty sure I told you.

853
01:05:15,953 --> 01:05:20,249
The VIP hates it
when people cross the line.

854
01:05:22,376 --> 01:05:25,129
If there's anything you'd like
to say to the VIP, tell me.

855
01:05:26,172 --> 01:05:27,256
I will pass it on.

856
01:05:27,882 --> 01:05:29,050
Tell the VIP this.

857
01:05:29,508 --> 01:05:32,553
The presidential election
is going as planned,

858
01:05:33,804 --> 01:05:36,599
but if the VIP keeps refusing to meet me,

859
01:05:36,724 --> 01:05:37,558
then...

860
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:42,897
I will go forth with my plan
and announce my withdrawal from the race.

861
01:05:46,067 --> 01:05:47,735
Because I love

862
01:05:48,361 --> 01:05:50,488
crossing the line.

863
01:05:56,661 --> 01:05:57,787
I will pass it on

864
01:05:58,913 --> 01:06:00,873
to the VIP, word for word.

865
01:06:06,420 --> 01:06:09,674
GENERAL ELECTION POLLS

866
01:06:09,757 --> 01:06:12,385
OH YEONG-SEOK, PARK MU-JIN,
YUN-CHAN GYEONG

867
01:06:15,638 --> 01:06:16,847
Just because

868
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:20,351
the Discrimination Act
stipulates that no one

869
01:06:20,768 --> 01:06:24,188
may be discriminated against due to
their sexuality or sexual orientation,

870
01:06:25,564 --> 01:06:28,776
the people believe
that the law supports...

871
01:06:28,859 --> 01:06:32,530
No, that it promotes and encourages
same-sex relationships.

872
01:06:33,322 --> 01:06:34,532
That is the society we live in.

873
01:06:37,284 --> 01:06:39,578
Now do you realize

874
01:06:40,287 --> 01:06:42,957
why the act was never legislated

875
01:06:44,417 --> 01:06:47,211
even though UN urged us to for ten years?

876
01:06:50,006 --> 01:06:51,507
If we miss this chance,

877
01:06:51,590 --> 01:06:55,720
the Discrimination Act might
never be enacted in Korea.

878
01:06:56,303 --> 01:06:57,680
Why not?

879
01:06:58,806 --> 01:07:01,350
It'll be hard for someone
as politically uncalculating as you

880
01:07:01,767 --> 01:07:04,103
to become President again, that's why.

881
01:07:06,689 --> 01:07:09,775
Her goal is for you to get torn apart
by the people

882
01:07:09,859 --> 01:07:12,486
and become a wreck
when you propose the bill.

883
01:07:14,780 --> 01:07:16,907
This could severely damage your standing

884
01:07:17,158 --> 01:07:18,659
in the first poll

885
01:07:18,743 --> 01:07:20,619
since your candidacy announcement.

886
01:07:21,620 --> 01:07:22,788
-But Mr. Cha--
-Sir.

887
01:07:22,872 --> 01:07:24,665
You are now a presidential candidate.

888
01:07:26,709 --> 01:07:28,252
The polls are everything.

889
01:07:35,926 --> 01:07:38,888
Mr. President. You have a guest.

890
01:07:54,528 --> 01:07:57,364
I want to join your presidential campaign.

891
01:08:00,326 --> 01:08:03,079
I heard things have gotten tough
since you announced

892
01:08:03,662 --> 01:08:05,623
you'd propose the Discrimination Act.

893
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,627
I came from a rich family,

894
01:08:10,169 --> 01:08:12,755
so I can't turn a blind eye
to those in need.

895
01:08:19,178 --> 01:08:20,930
I'm here to ask you

896
01:08:21,013 --> 01:08:22,973
to use me as you please for your campaign.

897
01:08:25,768 --> 01:08:27,978
After coming out that day,

898
01:08:28,562 --> 01:08:30,022
I realized I made a mistake.

899
01:08:32,108 --> 01:08:36,570
But reading about the Discrimination Act
gave me courage.

900
01:08:37,863 --> 01:08:39,990
I thought this country was hopeless,

901
01:08:41,158 --> 01:08:45,287
but I realized it's actually
getting a little better.

902
01:08:55,214 --> 01:08:56,549
I suppose

903
01:08:57,299 --> 01:08:59,635
I can't be of much help now though.

904
01:09:02,138 --> 01:09:04,098
I may end up hurting you instead.

905
01:09:06,308 --> 01:09:08,686
I know you might not want my help.

906
01:09:09,103 --> 01:09:10,980
But I couldn't sit back and do nothing.

907
01:09:11,605 --> 01:09:12,690
It's just...

908
01:09:15,609 --> 01:09:17,361
too big a present for me.

909
01:09:21,073 --> 01:09:23,033
As the head of the administration,

910
01:09:23,868 --> 01:09:26,579
I was just proposing a law
this country needs.

911
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:30,875
It is my completely normal
and ordinary duty.

912
01:09:32,334 --> 01:09:35,713
I don't think I deserve your kindness...

913
01:09:35,796 --> 01:09:36,881
I can...

914
01:09:38,340 --> 01:09:40,509
be true to my life now.

915
01:09:41,677 --> 01:09:42,970
Thanks to you.

916
01:09:44,972 --> 01:09:46,265
I thought

917
01:09:47,141 --> 01:09:49,059
politicians were just shallow people

918
01:09:49,143 --> 01:09:51,353
who beg and sell their souls for votes.

919
01:09:52,605 --> 01:09:56,400
But now,
I finally have a favorite politician.

920
01:10:02,448 --> 01:10:05,910
I plan to vote
for the first time in my life.

921
01:10:08,495 --> 01:10:09,872
Thank you.

922
01:10:28,307 --> 01:10:30,267
GENERAL ELECTION POLLS

923
01:10:42,863 --> 01:10:44,782
Where is Secretary Cha?

924
01:10:48,452 --> 01:10:49,453
Mr. President.

925
01:10:50,287 --> 01:10:51,330
I know.

926
01:10:52,164 --> 01:10:53,207
Soon, I'll be

927
01:10:54,375 --> 01:10:56,919
a presidential candidate
to whom the polls are everything.

928
01:10:57,419 --> 01:10:58,963
So why are you doing this?

929
01:10:59,338 --> 01:11:03,425
However, I'm still the Acting President
of this country.

930
01:11:05,761 --> 01:11:08,138
I'll take responsibility
and fulfill my duties to the fullest.

931
01:11:15,229 --> 01:11:16,563
Call a Cabinet meeting.

932
01:11:17,564 --> 01:11:18,649
The agenda will be...

933
01:11:20,109 --> 01:11:21,443
the Discrimination Act.

934
01:11:49,555 --> 01:11:52,141
Are you so reckless that you don't realize

935
01:11:52,224 --> 01:11:56,854
how crucial the polls are at this time
for the election or are you just arrogant?

936
01:11:57,062 --> 01:11:59,106
Oh Yeong-seok is declaring
his candidacy tomorrow.

937
01:11:59,356 --> 01:12:01,108
We must prove his involvement
with the bombing

938
01:12:01,191 --> 01:12:02,818
before he becomes
a presidential candidate.

939
01:12:04,028 --> 01:12:06,739
There's a sign of a coup.

940
01:12:06,822 --> 01:12:08,198
For the first time,

941
01:12:08,782 --> 01:12:11,118
I desperately have the urge
to win the election.

942
01:12:12,953 --> 01:12:16,040
Mr. President, you can never defeat me.
