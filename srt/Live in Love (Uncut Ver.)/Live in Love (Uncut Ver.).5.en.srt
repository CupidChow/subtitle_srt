00:00:06,966 --> 00:00:08,366
Hello

2
00:00:08,366 --> 00:00:12,000
Hello everyone, welcome to...

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,100
the open house of 2021.

4
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,839
Where does Kla go?

5
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:19,366
He probably...

6
00:00:19,366 --> 00:00:21,733
is taking photos around here.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,422
Where is my naughty brother?

8
00:00:46,244 --> 00:00:47,680
Hey / Kla
P'Cake

9
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,766
Where have you been? We were looking for you forever.

10
00:00:51,766 --> 00:00:53,000
What are you doing here?

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,833
Let’s check that out.

12
00:00:53,833 --> 00:00:54,566
Let’s go.

13
00:00:54,872 --> 00:00:55,966
Yeah, let’s go.

14
00:00:57,033 --> 00:00:58,300
Hold on a second.

15
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,000
I just saw a SOF kid.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,966
I’ll be right back.

17
00:01:00,966 --> 00:01:02,300
Hey, wait.

18
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,400
We have to go now.

19
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,333
Boss is in a hurry.

20
00:01:05,466 --> 00:01:06,433
Yeah, I have to go.

21
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:07,933
Just do it later. Let’s go.

22
00:01:07,933 --> 00:01:08,433
Okay.

23
00:01:10,366 --> 00:01:15,352
Love On Fire

24
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,418
[song: If I tell you,]

25
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:28,500
[song: will you realize that there’s]

26
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,443
[song: someone waiting for?]

27
00:01:31,443 --> 00:01:34,966
[song: Looking thru your eyes,]

28
00:01:34,966 --> 00:01:36,610
[song: my heart missed a beat.]

29
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:41,233
[song: Might be the one I’m waiting for.]

30
00:01:41,233 --> 00:01:44,733
[song: If somehow I hit Love On Live,]

31
00:01:44,733 --> 00:01:47,200
[song: would you ever understand me?]

32
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,500
[song: In Love through Live,]

33
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,900
[song: could you share your thought with me?]

34
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,466
[song: Let’s chat everyday]
[song: Calling everyday]

35
00:01:53,466 --> 00:01:55,833
[song: No more no less that used to be]

36
00:01:55,833 --> 00:01:58,200
[song: what we both understand.]

37
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,733
[song: Then we could Love in Life, so do you?]

38
00:02:03,733 --> 00:02:08,500
[song: Can I have you now?]

39
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:14,066
[song: And please let me know.]

40
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:24,966
Af,

41
00:02:24,966 --> 00:02:26,400
How’s it going over there?

42
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,760
Is anyone bullying you?

43
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,266
No one is bullying me,

44
00:02:29,266 --> 00:02:30,333
don’t worry.

45
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:33,000
I believe in you.
Hmm

46
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,100
Smile a lot, okay?

47
00:02:36,066 --> 00:02:37,766
Choose your friends wisely.

48
00:02:37,766 --> 00:02:38,866
Talk to others sometimes.

49
00:02:38,866 --> 00:02:40,466
So you also have friends.

50
00:02:40,466 --> 00:02:42,333
Don’t just be alone.

51
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:43,733
When you get bullied,

52
00:02:43,733 --> 00:02:45,233
you’ll have someone to help you.

53
00:02:45,233 --> 00:02:47,266
Don’t worry, Grandma.

54
00:02:47,266 --> 00:02:49,533
No one is bullying me.

55
00:02:49,533 --> 00:02:50,800
Hmm, but Grandma,

56
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,300
don’t forget to eat and take your medicine, okay?

57
00:02:54,766 --> 00:02:56,700
I have to go now.

58
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,600
That’s it for now, Grandma.

59
00:02:59,466 --> 00:03:00,566
Okay, bye.

60
00:03:27,933 --> 00:03:29,100
Hello.

61
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,800
My name is Cake.

62
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,433
You are...

63
00:03:32,433 --> 00:03:33,966
Af, right?

64
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:39,000
I’ve seen you alone all the time.

65
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,866
Do you want to join my group?

66
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,966
Come on, let’s go to our friends.

67
00:03:56,633 --> 00:03:58,200
Cake, do you know that

68
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,566
I like you?

69
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,433
Cake

70
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,440
Be my boyfriend, okay?

71
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,766
Cake, please.

72
00:04:06,766 --> 00:04:07,833
What are you doing?

73
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:10,410
Cake, please.
Hey!

74
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,033
Af, stop!

75
00:04:19,466 --> 00:04:21,437
I’m really disappointed in you.

76
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,566
That friend of mine, Af.

77
00:04:23,566 --> 00:04:24,704
Where has he gone?

78
00:04:34,066 --> 00:04:35,133
Everyone,

79
00:04:35,133 --> 00:04:35,900
This is Af.

80
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,066
Our new friend.

81
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:42,499
I made sandwiches for you.

82
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,533
Give it a try.

83
00:04:46,766 --> 00:04:48,170
For me, really?

84
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,500
All this time,

85
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,666
You were always in my sight.

86
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,128
It’s only you, Af

87
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:58,920
You only care about yourself

88
00:04:58,933 --> 00:05:03,635
[Where did you get the picture?]
[If you want Cake, then join me.]

89
00:05:06,566 --> 00:05:08,440
[What do you want?]

90
00:05:13,633 --> 00:05:20,256
[You don’t have to know; just know that I can
help you become Cake's partner.]

91
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:37,508
[Thank you, but no need.
I will make Cake like me on my own.]

92
00:05:37,508 --> 00:05:45,213
[Such a kid, one day you’ll need me.
When that day comes, just text me.]

93
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:54,466
Whoa!

94
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:56,900
Cake.

95
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,566
I will protect you.

96
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,704
It’s really delicious.

97
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:03,733
I’m glad you like it, Af.

98
00:06:03,733 --> 00:06:04,466
Hmm.

99
00:06:08,233 --> 00:06:09,109
Cake.

100
00:06:09,866 --> 00:06:11,560
How can you be so sure that he’s a good guy?

101
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,485
You've only met him once.

102
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,520
He might be tricking you into trusting him.

103
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,200
And I have Conan manga in my room too, Cake.

104
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,500
You can come to read it in my room.

105
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,533
You don’t need to go read it in P'Kla's room.

106
00:06:25,066 --> 00:06:26,566
Do you like One Piece, Cake?

107
00:06:26,566 --> 00:06:27,633
Or Doraemon?

108
00:06:27,633 --> 00:06:28,833
I have those in my room too.

109
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,362
I have them too.

110
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:32,700
Wait a minute, Af.

111
00:06:33,966 --> 00:06:35,814
Why would P'Kla trick me?

112
00:06:38,066 --> 00:06:39,666
Because I'm worried about you, Cake.

113
00:06:41,266 --> 00:06:42,633
You don’t have to worry about me.

114
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:46,400
I think I can read people well.

115
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,266
Hello, Cake.

116
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:49,600
The message that you sent?

117
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:52,000
Did you send it by mistake?

118
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,399
Get down already.

119
00:07:00,066 --> 00:07:00,966
Af.

120
00:07:03,266 --> 00:07:04,640
P'Kla and I,

121
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:06,633
we’re officially dating now.

122
00:07:08,533 --> 00:07:10,256
P'Kla and I,

123
00:07:10,766 --> 00:07:12,100
are now a couple.

124
00:07:17,033 --> 00:07:18,785
I really think of you as a friend.

125
00:07:20,766 --> 00:07:21,928
I’m sorry.

126
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,694
Dating.

127
00:07:32,943 --> 00:07:34,252
Couple.

128
00:07:45,566 --> 00:07:50,600
[Such a kid, one day you’ll need me.
When that day comes, just text me.]

129
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,900
[I want to talk to you about Cake.]

130
00:08:05,043 --> 00:08:06,600
Hey...

131
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,066
You said you wanted to talk to me about Cake, right?

132
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:13,566
You like Cake, right?

133
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:15,866
So,

134
00:08:15,866 --> 00:08:17,604
What does this have to do with you?

135
00:08:17,604 --> 00:08:19,400
I just want you to succeed.

136
00:08:20,243 --> 00:08:22,276
If you succeed with your person,

137
00:08:23,366 --> 00:08:25,448
I’ll get what I want too.

138
00:08:33,066 --> 00:08:34,366
You mean..

139
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:41,133
Let’s just say I have a way to help you get what you want.

140
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:43,385
What should I do then?

141
00:08:45,533 --> 00:08:47,133
We both need to cooperate.

142
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,218
We.. cooperate?

143
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,600
What do I need to do? I don’t even know yet.

144
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,300
What do you really want?

145
00:08:58,366 --> 00:08:59,600
Because I understand

146
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,533
the feeling of someone who has their love taken away.

147
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,600
Okay.

148
00:09:21,148 --> 00:09:22,647
I will do it.

149
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:28,166
(From what you told me)

150
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,910
(You currently have a problem with Cake.)

151
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:33,486
(That will only push you further away from him.)

152
00:09:34,366 --> 00:09:35,976
(What you need to do)

153
00:09:35,976 --> 00:09:39,000
(is to act like you’ve moved on)

154
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,533
(and become a good friend to Cake like before.)

155
00:09:41,533 --> 00:09:44,766
Hey, this is stalking, secretly taking photos like this.

156
00:09:44,766 --> 00:09:46,266
This isn’t normal.

157
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:49,148
Hey, could it be

158
00:09:49,148 --> 00:09:50,700
Af?

159
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,000
I think it’s possible.

160
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,433
He just disappeared.

161
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:03,400
What are you guys talking about?

162
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:06,566
Af.

163
00:10:06,566 --> 00:10:08,033
Where have you been?

164
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,766
Well,

165
00:10:10,766 --> 00:10:12,466
I was just taking some time to reflect.

166
00:10:13,433 --> 00:10:15,633
But now I feel much better.

167
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,233
Really?

168
00:10:21,366 --> 00:10:22,200
Of course.

169
00:10:24,048 --> 00:10:26,000
I don't want to lose a friend.

170
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,933
Cake said so too, he said that

171
00:10:27,933 --> 00:10:29,866
we can still be friends, right?

172
00:10:30,433 --> 00:10:31,347
Hmm.

173
00:10:32,033 --> 00:10:33,333
I’m glad

174
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:35,133
that you feel that way.

175
00:10:35,133 --> 00:10:36,133
Thank you.

176
00:10:37,966 --> 00:10:39,466
(After that)

177
00:10:39,466 --> 00:10:43,066
(you try to take care of Cake as a close friend.)

178
00:10:43,066 --> 00:10:45,166
The situation is very dangerous, Cake.

179
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:47,300
From now on, don’t go anywhere alone.

180
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,366
How about this,

181
00:10:48,366 --> 00:10:49,966
today..

182
00:10:49,966 --> 00:10:51,433
you go back with me.

183
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,381
Sure.

184
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,466
Anyways, we’re in the same dorm.

185
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,733
(Whatever is happening to Cake)

186
00:11:02,733 --> 00:11:04,966
(has to look increasingly scary.)

187
00:11:04,966 --> 00:11:06,600
(I will keep you informed)

188
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,200
(about the situation that occurs)

189
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,866
(and what you need to do.)

190
00:11:09,866 --> 00:11:11,266
(In the simplest way,)

191
00:11:11,266 --> 00:11:13,233
(once Cake trusts you.)

192
00:11:13,233 --> 00:11:14,733
(You should be taking care of him,)

193
00:11:14,733 --> 00:11:16,633
(picking him up and dropping him off.)

194
00:11:16,633 --> 00:11:19,266
(Then something dangerous must happen to him.)

195
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,200
Is anyone outside?

196
00:11:59,633 --> 00:12:01,000
Is anyone out there?

197
00:12:03,633 --> 00:12:04,533
Help me!

198
00:12:07,133 --> 00:12:08,033
Help me, please!

199
00:12:08,033 --> 00:12:10,266
(And then you have to be like)

200
00:12:10,266 --> 00:12:11,033
(Ta-da!)

201
00:12:11,033 --> 00:12:12,066
Cake.

202
00:12:12,066 --> 00:12:13,400
(Become a hero)

203
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,200
(And save the endangered princess.)
Cake / Af / Is that you, Cake?

204
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,500
Af?

205
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,400
Is that you, Af?

206
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,500
Yes Cake, it’s me, Af.

207
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,233
I'm stuck inside. I can’t open the door, Af.

208
00:12:23,233 --> 00:12:24,700
Can you help me open it?

209
00:12:26,433 --> 00:12:27,733
Cake, just wait, I’ll help.

210
00:12:34,214 --> 00:12:35,166
Cake.

211
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,852
Are you okay, Cake?

212
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,509
I’m fine.

213
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:45,233
Are you sure you're okay?

214
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,866
Yeah, I’m okay.

215
00:12:48,866 --> 00:12:50,466
I’ll take you home, Alright.

216
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,566
(The situation has to be even more intense.)

217
00:12:55,133 --> 00:12:57,266
(Making it seem like a psycho is stalking.)

218
00:12:57,266 --> 00:12:58,466
I'll go park the car.
(Making it seem like a psycho is stalking.)

219
00:12:58,466 --> 00:12:59,300
I'll go park the car.
(And make Cake feel that danger is approaching.)

220
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:02,266
(And make Cake feel that danger is approaching.)

221
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,433
[Out of service]

222
00:13:48,233 --> 00:13:49,900
Even if we can't be friends, Af

223
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,800
I cannot be anything else for you.

224
00:13:56,533 --> 00:13:57,533
Cake.

225
00:14:00,348 --> 00:14:01,900
I don’t want to hurt you, Cake.

226
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,052
Not at all.

227
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:15,100
(You have to do it.)

228
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,133
(Otherwise, Cake won't feel scared.)

229
00:14:17,133 --> 00:14:19,400
(And your chances of being close to Cake)

230
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,666
(and looking after him will lessen.)

231
00:14:31,466 --> 00:14:32,733
(Hurry up.)

232
00:14:32,733 --> 00:14:34,200
(Before that bastard Cake walks over.)

233
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,733
(Don’t you want to be his boyfriend anymore?)

234
00:14:35,733 --> 00:14:37,366
Don’t you dare call him bastard.

235
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,266
(Hurry up.)

236
00:14:39,266 --> 00:14:41,333
(You don’t have that much time.)

237
00:15:21,733 --> 00:15:22,833
Of course.

238
00:15:24,066 --> 00:15:26,133
I don't want to lose a friend.

239
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:27,933
Cake said so too, he said that

240
00:15:27,933 --> 00:15:30,033
we can still be friends, right?

241
00:15:30,566 --> 00:15:31,440
Hmm.

242
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,500
I’m glad

243
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,166
that you feel that way.

244
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:36,266
Thank you.

245
00:15:44,366 --> 00:15:45,470
I hope that

246
00:15:46,566 --> 00:15:48,161
Af will understand.

247
00:15:51,432 --> 00:15:53,000
Well...

248
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,766
give him some time.

249
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,000
Cake.

250
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,090
I’m sorry.

251
00:16:08,466 --> 00:16:09,566
I’m sorry, Cake.

252
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:11,914
I’m so sorry.

253
00:16:11,914 --> 00:16:13,467
I don’t want to do this to you.

254
00:16:24,766 --> 00:16:25,566
Cake.

255
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,760
I really don’t want to do this.

256
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,266
Cake, I’m sorry.

257
00:16:34,033 --> 00:16:35,233
Cake, I’m sorry.

258
00:16:35,233 --> 00:16:37,200
I don’t want to do this at all.

259
00:17:17,266 --> 00:17:19,066
[Watch out / Bitch]
[Dog face / Bulls**t]

260
00:17:19,066 --> 00:17:20,566
[Rotten Cake / Asshole]
[Slut / Stop flirting around]

261
00:17:53,233 --> 00:17:54,500
I don't want to do this anymore.

262
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,400
Don't you love Cake anymore?

263
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,266
Is love really like this?

264
00:18:04,866 --> 00:18:07,766
Seeing the person we love feeling this bad?

265
00:18:07,766 --> 00:18:08,466
Fine.

266
00:18:09,066 --> 00:18:10,433
You don't have to do this.

267
00:18:11,066 --> 00:18:12,400
But tell me then,

268
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,200
How to make those two break up?

269
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,500
There are so many ways, right?

270
00:18:19,676 --> 00:18:21,566
But you want me to get Cake drunk?

271
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,776
and take him to a motel?

272
00:18:24,776 --> 00:18:26,147
Are you crazy?

273
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:28,138
Are you out of your mind?

274
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,600
I’m just going to set the scene up.

275
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,542
Make it a little bit confusing for for Kla about Cake.

276
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,900
Also,

277
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:38,100
I will take this issue to blackmail Cake

278
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,633
to leave Kla's life.

279
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,528
If Cake quits messing with Kla,

280
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:44,585
who will he go to?

281
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:45,881
Think about it.

282
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,133
But,

283
00:18:58,066 --> 00:19:00,566
We both just do what we want

284
00:19:00,566 --> 00:19:02,400
for the person we love, right?

285
00:19:04,233 --> 00:19:05,733
We both?

286
00:19:06,733 --> 00:19:08,542
I think we’re not the same.

287
00:19:10,133 --> 00:19:13,147
It's true that we’re willing to do anything for the one we love,

288
00:19:14,266 --> 00:19:17,128
but we wouldn’t do anything that will make them disappointed in us.

289
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:20,180
Even if one day they learn the whole truth.

290
00:19:23,966 --> 00:19:25,700
Even if you're not doing it,

291
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,723
I will still follow the plan.

292
00:19:31,066 --> 00:19:32,603
But I can’t promise

293
00:19:33,176 --> 00:19:35,500
that it will only be a setup.

294
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,933
You...

295
00:19:47,433 --> 00:19:48,233
Fine.

296
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,566
I’ll do it.

297
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:54,500
Good.

298
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,400
Then stop arguing

299
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,800
and continue with the plan.

300
00:19:58,566 --> 00:19:59,366
Get in.

301
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,266
Hello, Cake.

302
00:20:16,466 --> 00:20:17,400
Oh, Cake.

303
00:20:18,466 --> 00:20:20,033
Are you going to P'Roong's birthday party?

304
00:20:20,733 --> 00:20:22,000
I’m not sure yet.

305
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,433
There will be a lot of people, Af.

306
00:20:23,943 --> 00:20:25,066
But...

307
00:20:25,066 --> 00:20:28,200
That day, P'Roong personally invited you.

308
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,333
And also,

309
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:31,700
she hasn’t seen you in a long time, right?

310
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:34,333
She really misses you.

311
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,300
Just a moment.

312
00:20:40,433 --> 00:20:41,309
P'Kla,

313
00:20:42,966 --> 00:20:45,333
The senior invited me to her birthday party.

314
00:20:45,933 --> 00:20:47,542
Do you think I should go?

315
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:50,942
Sure.

316
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,200
Cause you already promised her.

317
00:20:59,866 --> 00:21:01,318
I'll go then.

318
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,800
Okay, Cake. So you're going.

319
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,566
See you there, alright?

320
00:21:08,043 --> 00:21:09,033
Bye bye.

321
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,100
(The final plan)

322
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,400
(I'll wait for you at the motel)

323
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,233
(With all setup prepared)

324
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:30,256
Here, I made this for you.

325
00:21:30,256 --> 00:21:32,633
I guarantee it's easy to drink.

326
00:21:32,633 --> 00:21:35,033
(And then bring him to me at the motel)

327
00:21:35,033 --> 00:21:36,300
(That's all, done.)

328
00:21:43,076 --> 00:21:44,347
Just follow the map.

329
00:22:00,767 --> 00:22:01,690
(Even if you're not doing it,)

330
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,608
(I will still follow the plan.)

331
00:22:05,476 --> 00:22:07,080
(But I can't promise)

332
00:22:07,876 --> 00:22:10,170
(that it will only be a setup.)

333
00:22:33,734 --> 00:22:35,066
Don't you love Cake anymore?

334
00:22:41,833 --> 00:22:43,733
Okay, Cake. So you're going.

335
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,433
[I want to talk to you about Cake.]

336
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:52,666
[Come out and meet me,
then I’ll tell you the whole plan]

337
00:22:52,666 --> 00:22:56,433
Seeing AFKung tagged Cake on Instagram makes me feel a bit annoying.

338
00:23:07,466 --> 00:23:09,733
P, P'Khing, I...

339
00:23:11,333 --> 00:23:12,033
I don’t want to do this anymore.

340
00:23:12,033 --> 00:23:14,366
I don’t want to, P'Khing, I...

341
00:23:14,366 --> 00:23:15,666
I’ve had enough, P'Khing.

342
00:23:15,666 --> 00:23:17,166
Cancel it, please. I...

343
00:23:17,166 --> 00:23:18,733
I really can’t take it, please, P'Khing.

344
00:23:18,733 --> 00:23:19,566
Please.

345
00:23:19,566 --> 00:23:20,900
I only ask for this.

346
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,533
Please, Please, P'Khing. Please, Please.

347
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:26,800
I won’t let you ruin my plan.

348
00:23:28,566 --> 00:23:31,000
I came up with all this plan for you to have Cake as your boyfriend.

349
00:23:32,966 --> 00:23:34,585
If you can’t do something this simple,

350
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,766
Just get lost.

351
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:38,933
P'Khing.

352
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,509
I really can’t.

353
00:23:48,721 --> 00:23:49,788
P'Khing

354
00:23:49,788 --> 00:23:50,434
What

355
00:23:50,434 --> 00:23:52,066
What are those two doing here, P'Khing?

356
00:23:56,366 --> 00:23:57,633
P'Khing, what’s this about?

357
00:23:57,633 --> 00:23:59,100
Why are these two here, P'Khing?

358
00:24:01,028 --> 00:24:03,466
They’re here to gangbang on him.

359
00:24:09,566 --> 00:24:10,266
P'Khing.

360
00:24:10,266 --> 00:24:12,342
Does it have to come this far?

361
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,466
I’m begging you, stop it.

362
00:24:18,466 --> 00:24:21,100
I’ve had enough, P'Khing.

363
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,100
P'Khing.

364
00:24:23,643 --> 00:24:25,780
Let me see your face one more time.

365
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:38,900
Kla.

366
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,880
Looks like the plan is off, huh? Khing.

367
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,733
I’m sorry, P'Kla.

368
00:25:01,033 --> 00:25:03,400
I know what I did was wrong.

369
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:06,366
I shouldn’t have accepted P'Khing’s help at all.

370
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,533
I feel really guilty towards Cake.

371
00:25:10,533 --> 00:25:11,800
So if you feel guilty,

372
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:15,033
then why do you keep going on?

373
00:25:16,666 --> 00:25:17,914
It’s because of P'Khing.

374
00:25:18,633 --> 00:25:19,933
If I stop,

375
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,333
She will tell her everything.

376
00:25:28,338 --> 00:25:29,633
Khing is so..

377
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,200
She shouldn’t be like this.

378
00:25:33,133 --> 00:25:35,880
I also didn’t think that she would plan this far.

379
00:25:36,466 --> 00:25:38,200
Neither do you.

380
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,700
If it weren’t for the fact that you're confessing your guilt now,

381
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,333
I’d stomp you right here.

382
00:25:43,133 --> 00:25:45,033
What are you both playing?

383
00:25:46,066 --> 00:25:46,866
P'Kla,

384
00:25:47,833 --> 00:25:49,018
It’s not just the two of us.

385
00:25:50,166 --> 00:25:51,033
There’s...

386
00:25:51,033 --> 00:25:52,200
P'Gina too.

387
00:25:53,233 --> 00:25:54,500
Not surprised.

388
00:25:55,433 --> 00:25:56,600
Things like this,

389
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,100
Khing wouldn't do alone.

390
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,266
So...

391
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:01,466
What should I do next, P'Kla?

392
00:26:01,466 --> 00:26:02,866
Just go with the flow for now.

393
00:26:03,866 --> 00:26:05,666
Someone like Khing and Gina,

394
00:26:05,666 --> 00:26:07,166
if they’re not caught red-handed,

395
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:09,633
they would never admit their wrongs.

396
00:26:13,166 --> 00:26:13,966
Okay.

397
00:26:15,633 --> 00:26:16,633
Cake is coming.

398
00:26:17,233 --> 00:26:18,799
Go now, we'll talk later.

399
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:19,433
Okay.

400
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,100
P'Kla!
Oh, Cake!

401
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,033
Have you been waiting long?

402
00:26:27,833 --> 00:26:29,966
Why does everyone look so tense?

403
00:26:29,966 --> 00:26:31,266
What are y'all doing?

404
00:26:32,333 --> 00:26:34,233
Cake just got messages berating him.

405
00:26:34,233 --> 00:26:35,633
And he’s being stalked too.

406
00:26:35,633 --> 00:26:37,366
We’re figuring out who the culprit is.

407
00:26:38,633 --> 00:26:40,480
Kla, I sent it to you already.
Hmm

408
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:46,000
Khing, please go to the restroom with me.

409
00:26:52,533 --> 00:26:54,266
Watch over this, okay? I’ll be back.

410
00:26:54,266 --> 00:26:55,366
Where are you going? Hey.

411
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,033
Hey, Kla, where are you going?

412
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:00,900
Khing,

413
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,233
I think you should stop.

414
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:05,066
We’re about to get caught.

415
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:06,933
They won’t find out.

416
00:27:06,933 --> 00:27:08,333
I think my plan is good enough.

417
00:27:10,133 --> 00:27:12,533
Don’t underestimate Kla and his friends.

418
00:27:12,533 --> 00:27:14,266
You know them well.

419
00:27:16,566 --> 00:27:17,966
I’m tired, Khing.

420
00:27:19,233 --> 00:27:20,933
You’ve done this much,

421
00:27:20,933 --> 00:27:22,500
and Kla still doesn’t look at you.

422
00:27:25,166 --> 00:27:26,366
Just this,

423
00:27:26,366 --> 00:27:27,833
why would you be so worn out?

424
00:27:28,733 --> 00:27:30,166
Just this?

425
00:27:31,743 --> 00:27:34,800
I’ve been stepping up for you in everything.

426
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,414
Creating buzz about you and Kla.

427
00:27:38,066 --> 00:27:40,766
See how much you’ve invested in this?

428
00:27:40,766 --> 00:27:43,100
Kla hasn’t even looked at you.

429
00:27:44,066 --> 00:27:45,666
He’ll notice me soon.

430
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:47,966
You..

431
00:27:48,366 --> 00:27:49,866
don’t complain too much, Gina.

432
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,333
You love acting fierce, don’t you?

433
00:27:54,443 --> 00:27:56,166
I gave you that role already.

434
00:27:58,433 --> 00:27:59,833
Back when you were spending money,

435
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,400
you didn’t complain at all.

436
00:28:07,366 --> 00:28:08,533
Stop complaining.

437
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,680
And just do your part.

438
00:28:13,638 --> 00:28:15,233
Unless you want everyone to know

439
00:28:16,633 --> 00:28:18,500
the fact that

440
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,466
you’re just a fake high-society girl.

441
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:22,633
Khing.

442
00:28:25,605 --> 00:28:27,566
The money you spent on stuff

443
00:28:29,233 --> 00:28:31,023
are all mine.

444
00:28:33,143 --> 00:28:35,975
You better know your place.

445
00:28:36,666 --> 00:28:37,600
Girls.

446
00:28:47,666 --> 00:28:48,466
Kla

447
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,633
When did you arrive?

448
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:55,466
Just in time to hear everything you two were discussing, Gina.

449
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:56,933
The plan

450
00:28:57,733 --> 00:28:59,294
and buzz-creating.

451
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:01,633
Calm down, Kla.

452
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,700
I can explain.

453
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:05,700
Well...

454
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:09,366
I was just practicing my acting.

455
00:29:09,366 --> 00:29:11,233
I went to acting classes

456
00:29:11,233 --> 00:29:12,833
and got the role of antagonist.

457
00:29:12,833 --> 00:29:14,433
Am I acting well?

458
00:29:14,433 --> 00:29:15,233
Gina

459
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:18,266
I'm neither deaf nor blind.

460
00:29:20,266 --> 00:29:22,732
Or do you see me that way, Gina?

461
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:26,028
No, Kla.

462
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:30,275
Then just tell the whole truth.

463
00:29:30,866 --> 00:29:33,066
Otherwise...

464
00:29:33,066 --> 00:29:35,200
I’ll report you both.

465
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,633
No, Kla. Please.

466
00:29:36,633 --> 00:29:38,933
I'm giving you a chance, Gina.

467
00:29:38,933 --> 00:29:40,366
Just speak the truth.

468
00:29:41,666 --> 00:29:43,100
Otherwise, I’ll take action.

469
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,400
Okay.

470
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,533
I’ll tell the truth.

471
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:57,933
The truth is...

472
00:29:59,266 --> 00:30:00,852
just like what you heard.

473
00:30:01,876 --> 00:30:03,937
There’s nothing more.

474
00:30:06,166 --> 00:30:07,100
I mean...

475
00:30:08,266 --> 00:30:10,633
Khing just

476
00:30:10,633 --> 00:30:12,000
asked me

477
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,366
to help her get your attention.

478
00:30:15,633 --> 00:30:18,200
You can get mad at us.

479
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,700
But please don’t go after us, Kla.

480
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,500
Please, Kla.

481
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,900
Then tell me what you've done?

482
00:30:28,866 --> 00:30:31,210
I didn’t do much, really.

483
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:32,633
I just

484
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:37,266
kept taking pictures of Khing and you together

485
00:30:37,266 --> 00:30:40,000
to post on social media and create buzz.

486
00:30:40,666 --> 00:30:41,633
And also...

487
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,700
stirring up trouble for you and Cake.

488
00:30:45,266 --> 00:30:46,738
Shipping and cheering.

489
00:30:46,738 --> 00:30:48,466
So, about Cake falling into the cage,

490
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,266
That was you two's doing, right?

491
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:00,700
Gam, Cake!

492
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,233
Let's go take some pictures together.

493
00:31:02,233 --> 00:31:03,360
Let’s go / Let’s go.

494
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,400
Khing,

495
00:31:14,066 --> 00:31:15,500
Can I not do it?

496
00:31:16,066 --> 00:31:17,366
Pushing someone into the cage,

497
00:31:17,366 --> 00:31:18,800
I think that’s too harsh.

498
00:31:20,966 --> 00:31:22,433
If you don't do it,

499
00:31:22,433 --> 00:31:23,566
I’ll do it myself.

500
00:31:23,566 --> 00:31:24,766
It’s just a simple task.

501
00:31:25,266 --> 00:31:26,366
Khing,

502
00:31:26,366 --> 00:31:28,200
I think you should let go.

503
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,166
It won’t do you any good.

504
00:31:30,166 --> 00:31:31,433
Trust me.

505
00:31:32,866 --> 00:31:34,337
Can you shut up, Gina?

506
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,700
I want Cake to know

507
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,866
that dating Kla isn’t as fun as he thinks.

508
00:31:41,433 --> 00:31:43,152
And if Kla truly loves Cake,

509
00:31:43,966 --> 00:31:45,723
he’ll find out it’s not easy.

510
00:31:58,766 --> 00:31:59,766
Ouch!

511
00:31:59,766 --> 00:32:01,166
Hey, Cake!

512
00:32:01,166 --> 00:32:02,866
Help! Someone fell in the water!

513
00:32:02,866 --> 00:32:04,886
Help! Cake fell in the water!

514
00:32:04,886 --> 00:32:06,770
Cake fell in the water!
Help!

515
00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:08,770
Help!

516
00:32:09,433 --> 00:32:11,100
What happened?

517
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,700
How did you fall in?

518
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:13,666
Did you slip, Cake?

519
00:32:13,666 --> 00:32:16,033
I didn’t want to do that, Kla.

520
00:32:17,033 --> 00:32:17,833
Just that

521
00:32:18,533 --> 00:32:20,933
my close friend is having problem.

522
00:32:20,933 --> 00:32:23,033
So I had to help her.

523
00:32:24,043 --> 00:32:25,933
Friend needs to help friend, right, Kla?

524
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:28,300
For friend

525
00:32:29,438 --> 00:32:31,561
or for personal gain, Gina?

526
00:32:33,276 --> 00:32:34,700
Khing gave you money,

527
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,285
gave you her expensive things,

528
00:32:38,043 --> 00:32:40,033
gave you a fake high-society status

529
00:32:40,933 --> 00:32:42,494
to deceive others everyday.

530
00:32:44,496 --> 00:32:48,180
Are those things valuable enough to buy you, Gina?

531
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,733
But poverty is scary, Kla.

532
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,900
I used to have money.

533
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:58,500
Had everything.

534
00:32:59,133 --> 00:33:00,333
And then one day,

535
00:33:00,333 --> 00:33:02,000
my family went bankrupt.

536
00:33:02,467 --> 00:33:04,333
I'm ashamed, Kla.

537
00:33:04,333 --> 00:33:06,566
I don't want anyone to know about this.

538
00:33:08,033 --> 00:33:09,466
But when Khing found out,

539
00:33:10,766 --> 00:33:13,600
she offered me helps.

540
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,866
Lend me money,

541
00:33:14,866 --> 00:33:16,533
lend me her brandnames.

542
00:33:17,266 --> 00:33:19,033
In exchange, I just have to

543
00:33:19,033 --> 00:33:21,466
help her win over you, Kla.

544
00:33:23,566 --> 00:33:24,566
Gina,

545
00:33:24,566 --> 00:33:27,100
you're scared of looking bad in other's eyes.

546
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,066
But not scared of hurting others, huh?

547
00:33:31,466 --> 00:33:34,966
I didn’t think it would get this far.

548
00:33:34,966 --> 00:33:36,366
At first,

549
00:33:36,366 --> 00:33:38,633
I just have to ship and cheer you both up.

550
00:33:38,633 --> 00:33:41,566
Just creating situations.

551
00:33:41,566 --> 00:33:43,200
But lately,

552
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:47,067
Khing started to have more wicked ideas.

553
00:33:47,067 --> 00:33:49,033
I'm scared.

554
00:33:49,033 --> 00:33:51,666
I didn't want to continue anymore.

555
00:33:51,666 --> 00:33:53,833
But when I didn't want to do it,

556
00:33:53,833 --> 00:33:56,000
Khing threatened to expose me.

557
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,266
She’d tell everyone about my family's bankruptcy.

558
00:33:59,266 --> 00:34:01,800
That’s the price you have to pay, Gina.

559
00:34:05,066 --> 00:34:06,818
What are you both playing at?

560
00:34:09,062 --> 00:34:12,400
Do you think you can easily destroy someone's love?

561
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,900
This isn’t a series, Gina.

562
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:21,633
And do you really think

563
00:34:21,633 --> 00:34:23,100
I'll believe

564
00:34:24,033 --> 00:34:26,200
and break up with Cake?

565
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,100
That’s impossible.

566
00:34:31,643 --> 00:34:32,743
I know that.

567
00:34:33,972 --> 00:34:36,766
That’s why I told Khing to stop.

568
00:34:37,643 --> 00:34:39,900
But she wouldn’t listen to me.

569
00:34:41,333 --> 00:34:43,700
At least it’s good to warn a friend.

570
00:34:44,333 --> 00:34:45,466
Friend helps friend,

571
00:34:45,466 --> 00:34:47,166
protects friend.

572
00:34:47,166 --> 00:34:48,966
That’s a good thing, Gina.

573
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:51,766
But not by going down the wrong path.

574
00:34:53,666 --> 00:34:56,318
What if something happens to Cake for real?

575
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,833
Nothing serious happened.

576
00:34:58,833 --> 00:35:01,810
But Cake got hurt from falling into the cage, Gina.

577
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:03,233
I’m sorry.

578
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:05,833
I promise

579
00:35:05,833 --> 00:35:07,866
I won’t do this again.

580
00:35:08,533 --> 00:35:10,366
Kla, please forgive me.

581
00:35:10,366 --> 00:35:12,869
I don't want to feel guilty anymore.

582
00:35:13,476 --> 00:35:14,276
Fine.

583
00:35:15,657 --> 00:35:16,557
In that case,

584
00:35:17,133 --> 00:35:18,633
don’t let Khing know about this.

585
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,400
And if from now on,

586
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,933
she asks you for something again...

587
00:35:24,772 --> 00:35:26,681
you need to tell me immediately, okay?

588
00:35:29,243 --> 00:35:30,433
And I promise

589
00:35:31,233 --> 00:35:32,366
that once this is over,

590
00:35:33,443 --> 00:35:35,533
you won’t be oppressed by Khing anymore.

591
00:35:36,933 --> 00:35:37,733
Okay,

592
00:35:38,666 --> 00:35:40,633
I will help to the fullest

593
00:35:40,633 --> 00:35:42,866
as an apology from me.

594
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,666
If you need my help with anything, just let me know.

595
00:35:46,666 --> 00:35:48,533
I'm happy to help with everything.

596
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:50,800
Then...

597
00:35:53,033 --> 00:35:54,266
Are you free tonight?

598
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,500
Come to my condo.

599
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:01,266
There’s someone I want you to meet.

600
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:13,300
Hey, you guys!

601
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:14,433
How’s it going?

602
00:36:14,433 --> 00:36:15,566
Still looking around.

603
00:36:17,533 --> 00:36:19,133
Oh, come in!

604
00:36:34,143 --> 00:36:35,133
Af?

605
00:36:36,133 --> 00:36:37,300
So you’re also..

606
00:36:39,472 --> 00:36:41,500
Did you confess by yourself or

607
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,066
got caught, P'Gina?

608
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:47,033
I’m a bit sad about what happened.

609
00:36:47,033 --> 00:36:52,333
But Kla said you've turned over a new person.

610
00:36:52,333 --> 00:36:54,000
I’m relieved.

611
00:36:54,733 --> 00:36:56,800
Bee, everyone is serious about this.

612
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,200
I’m serious too.

613
00:36:59,033 --> 00:37:02,686
I’m just glad to see my idol has changed for the better.

614
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,200
You just keep looking.

615
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,233
What should we do about Khing?

616
00:37:08,233 --> 00:37:10,500
Should we gather evidences and report?

617
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:11,966
I think not yet.

618
00:37:11,966 --> 00:37:14,000
If she can do this much,

619
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,117
she probably won’t confess easily.

620
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,433
I agree with you.

621
00:37:18,433 --> 00:37:21,233
Khing's family has money; everyone knows that.

622
00:37:21,233 --> 00:37:22,833
If she gets caught,

623
00:37:22,833 --> 00:37:27,200
her parents will definitely find a way to help her escape.

624
00:37:29,333 --> 00:37:30,066
So...

625
00:37:30,066 --> 00:37:32,300
you want to make Khing confess by herself, right Kla?

626
00:37:32,933 --> 00:37:34,133
Yes, Gam.

627
00:37:34,133 --> 00:37:36,966
I think if we want someone like Khing to learn a lesson,

628
00:37:36,966 --> 00:37:39,066
we need to catch her red-handed.

629
00:37:39,066 --> 00:37:42,366
That way, we can stop this nonsense that's happening to me and Cake.

630
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,800
And it would be best for Khing too.

631
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,100
I think that’s a good idea.

632
00:37:47,466 --> 00:37:49,000
If we catch her in the act,

633
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,766
she probably can’t escape.

634
00:37:50,766 --> 00:37:52,300
With witnesses and evidence.

635
00:37:53,266 --> 00:37:55,133
So, are we going to report her?

636
00:37:55,133 --> 00:37:56,280
I think not yet.

637
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:59,300
But I’ll ask you two to inform her parents.

638
00:37:59,833 --> 00:38:02,105
I think if they find a solution for us,

639
00:38:02,105 --> 00:38:02,976
that would be best.

640
00:38:02,976 --> 00:38:04,300
Hmm, okay.

641
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,866
Let me ask you seriously.

642
00:38:07,866 --> 00:38:10,185
Does Cake have to be a part of this plan within a plan?

643
00:38:10,733 --> 00:38:11,533
Hmm...

644
00:38:12,333 --> 00:38:14,166
I’m confident that I can help him in time.

645
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:17,300
Besides...

646
00:38:19,366 --> 00:38:21,837
The whole plan is already under our control.

647
00:38:22,661 --> 00:38:24,333
That day, I’ll ask Af

648
00:38:24,333 --> 00:38:26,233
to bring Cake to me.

649
00:38:27,933 --> 00:38:30,000
And I’ll ask Gam and Tim to look after him.

650
00:38:31,033 --> 00:38:32,033
Everything will be safe.

651
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,276
This Af,

652
00:38:35,276 --> 00:38:37,066
can we really trust him?

653
00:38:38,133 --> 00:38:39,840
Come on.

654
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:42,533
You should know your place before talking, P'Gina.

655
00:38:42,533 --> 00:38:43,533
So what?

656
00:38:44,766 --> 00:38:46,166
Come on.

657
00:38:46,166 --> 00:38:47,666
Let’s not fight, okay?

658
00:38:47,666 --> 00:38:50,066
You’ve turned over a new person; let’s not fight.

659
00:38:51,676 --> 00:38:52,966
I agree with you, Kla.

660
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,543
I’ll have my dad’s men standby,

661
00:38:56,543 --> 00:38:58,433
just in case something crazy happens.

662
00:38:59,443 --> 00:39:00,900
So we can fix it in time.

663
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,666
It's Gina, Kla.

664
00:39:13,638 --> 00:39:16,133
She is framing me, Kla?

665
00:39:17,076 --> 00:39:19,566
Everyone is accusing me!

666
00:39:20,833 --> 00:39:22,566
Even Af! You

667
00:39:22,566 --> 00:39:24,076
You betrayed me.
Enough, Khing.

668
00:39:24,076 --> 00:39:25,066
Khing,

669
00:39:27,876 --> 00:39:29,566
stop blaming others already.

670
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,956
I know all the truth now.

671
00:39:34,566 --> 00:39:37,366
I traced it back through your social media usage.

672
00:39:38,533 --> 00:39:40,766
From the accounts that insult Cake everyday

673
00:39:41,966 --> 00:39:44,400
to the pictures sent to his dad's company page.

674
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:48,166
All of it came from your phone and computer.

675
00:39:48,166 --> 00:39:50,366
And everyone involved in the plan

676
00:39:50,366 --> 00:39:52,133
has already confessed to us.

677
00:39:54,633 --> 00:39:56,866
I don’t understand why you would do all this.

678
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,666
Why did you do this, Khing?

679
00:40:02,033 --> 00:40:04,700
Answer me, Khing.
Because I love you, Kla.

680
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,433
You don’t really love me, Khing.

681
00:40:18,972 --> 00:40:20,904
You only did all these for your own happiness.

682
00:40:22,543 --> 00:40:24,333
And for your own desires.

683
00:40:26,210 --> 00:40:27,542
If you really loved me,

684
00:40:28,433 --> 00:40:30,461
you would want me to be happier.

685
00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:34,800
So why?

686
00:40:35,805 --> 00:40:38,300
Why, Kla? Why?

687
00:40:39,276 --> 00:40:41,562
I love you this much.

688
00:40:41,562 --> 00:40:45,033
I love you so much that I’m willing to do anything for you.

689
00:40:45,033 --> 00:40:49,966
Just look at me once; what would happen? how hard could it be, Kla?

690
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:55,448
Can’t you look at me, Kla? Look at me!

691
00:40:57,734 --> 00:41:00,900
I’ve done everything for you, Kla.

692
00:41:04,533 --> 00:41:06,900
Can’t you at least look at me?

693
00:41:09,466 --> 00:41:12,333
I made this just for you.

694
00:41:12,333 --> 00:41:13,900
I don’t eat desserts.

695
00:41:17,533 --> 00:41:19,600
I made this low-calorie, especially for you.

696
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,600
Just give it to Bee and Dol; I’m in a hurry.

697
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,709
Hey, Poon, let's go.

698
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:35,919
I love you, Kla.

699
00:41:44,766 --> 00:41:46,733
Love doesn’t have a reason, Khing.

700
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:50,066
Don't love,

701
00:41:50,933 --> 00:41:51,966
means don't love.

702
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:55,552
And no matter how hard you try to be good to me,

703
00:41:56,066 --> 00:41:58,300
or even if you're much more perfect,

704
00:42:00,533 --> 00:42:01,633
if you're not the right one,

705
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,733
then you're not, Khing.

706
00:42:12,533 --> 00:42:13,400
Kla.

707
00:42:14,233 --> 00:42:15,433
Let go of me, Khing.
No.

708
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:28,233
Just let me go, Khing.

709
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:35,533
Let me and Cake go, okay?

710
00:42:53,333 --> 00:42:55,000
Can we leave now?

711
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,700
Whatever it is just clear it up here.

712
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:58,310
We’re not involved.

713
00:42:58,310 --> 00:43:00,500
And pay us too.

714
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:04,600
Let’s go.

715
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:05,700
Hey, Poon.

716
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:06,800
Hey!

717
00:43:08,366 --> 00:43:10,900
About the money, you can take it,

718
00:43:11,633 --> 00:43:13,533
but being in jail, you won't be able to use it.

719
00:43:15,166 --> 00:43:16,333
You can go now.

720
00:43:27,033 --> 00:43:30,866
[15 minutes earlier]

721
00:43:30,866 --> 00:43:34,033
Damn, this is Khing’s house.

722
00:43:34,033 --> 00:43:35,333
Yeah.

723
00:43:35,333 --> 00:43:38,466
I want you two to tell her parents,

724
00:43:38,466 --> 00:43:40,500
tell them what’s going on in brief,

725
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:42,280
and I’ll talk to them about the detail myself later.

726
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:44,033
I’m counting on you.

727
00:43:44,033 --> 00:43:45,466
Okay, bye.

728
00:43:49,310 --> 00:43:50,466
Cake is coming soon.

729
00:43:51,076 --> 00:43:52,300
Let’s wait in the room.

730
00:44:10,710 --> 00:44:12,866
He has passed out, P'Kla.

731
00:44:15,133 --> 00:44:16,633
Khing still doesn’t know, right?

732
00:44:16,633 --> 00:44:17,700
Nope.

733
00:44:18,233 --> 00:44:19,600
You really are bastard.

734
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:20,966
How can you do this to my brother?

735
00:44:20,966 --> 00:44:23,466
Should I punch you once?
Tim, don’t! Tim!

736
00:44:24,733 --> 00:44:25,938
Enough.

737
00:44:25,938 --> 00:44:27,400
If Af really did that,

738
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:28,785
we wouldn’t be here.

739
00:44:29,566 --> 00:44:30,666
Alright, everyone.

740
00:44:30,666 --> 00:44:32,318
I think Khing is almost here.

741
00:44:32,318 --> 00:44:34,333
Hey, let’s go standby.
