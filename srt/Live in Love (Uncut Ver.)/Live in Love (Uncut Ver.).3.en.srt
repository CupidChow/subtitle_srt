00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,401
Hey Poon
Hmm

2
00:00:01,401 --> 00:00:03,079
Can you grab the blue shirt from the back of the car for me?

3
00:00:03,807 --> 00:00:05,310
Isn’t two shirts enough already?

4
00:00:05,917 --> 00:00:07,305
Why are you so nervous?
Just take it

5
00:00:07,305 --> 00:00:08,710
Can you stop talking?

6
00:00:10,409 --> 00:00:12,784
I just want our first meeting to be as perfect as possible.

7
00:00:12,784 --> 00:00:14,315
I want it to be the best that it can be.

8
00:00:16,598 --> 00:00:18,077
Gam
Hmm

9
00:00:18,603 --> 00:00:19,947
How is P.Kla be like?

10
00:00:19,947 --> 00:00:21,930
He’s friendly and relaxed.

11
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:23,428
Just like as you know him.

12
00:00:23,428 --> 00:00:24,590
Hmm

13
00:00:25,642 --> 00:00:29,071
But until now, we’ve only talked through video calls.

14
00:00:29,638 --> 00:00:33,122
I’m worried he might think I’m not as expected.

15
00:00:33,122 --> 00:00:35,162
No, he won’t.

16
00:00:35,162 --> 00:00:36,764
Just wait a second.

17
00:00:37,209 --> 00:00:37,996
Who is it?

18
00:00:39,529 --> 00:00:40,498
Poon is calling.

19
00:00:40,498 --> 00:00:41,961
Poon?

20
00:00:41,961 --> 00:00:44,884
Hello Poon, have you arrived?

21
00:00:45,248 --> 00:00:48,478
Yeah, I’m in the shop. You can come in now.

22
00:00:49,004 --> 00:00:50,331
Okay.

23
00:00:50,331 --> 00:00:53,079
Gam, do I look good?

24
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,738
That question you need to ask Kla.

25
00:00:59,021 --> 00:01:01,312

So cute.

Of course.

Yes, really.

62
00:04:34,253 --> 00:04:36,967
You look really cute today.

I just feel something is unusual.

Is this clear enough?

Huh?

95
00:06:43,007 --> 00:06:48,112
Nothing. I just meant that I really like this situation.

Of course, I like that too.

103
00:08:04,766 --> 00:08:06,211
You’re so tall.

104

Next time, I’ll treat you back.

108
00:08:36,565 --> 00:08:37,566
Nevermind.

109
00:08:37,566 --> 00:08:40,967

110

111
00:08:42,634 --> 00:08:44,292
You just let Kla treat you all the time.

112

113
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:48,066
Poon, stop teasing Kla and Cake.

114
00:08:48,066 --> 00:08:50,842
Then why don’t you help me tease them, dear?

115
00:08:51,692 --> 00:08:55,674
Dear? Who’s dating?

116
00:08:55,674 --> 00:08:57,712
Oh, I didn't tell you yet?

117
00:08:59,412 --> 00:09:01,951
Are you going to tell or should I?

118
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:03,276
Poon tell him.

119
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:04,993
So, here’s the thing.

120
00:09:04,993 --> 00:09:08,592
I’m dating Gam already.

121
00:09:08,835 --> 00:09:10,570
But we haven’t announced it to anyone yet.

122
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:12,000

124
00:09:14,285 --> 00:09:19,297
But being Poon’s boyfriend is quite exhausting, Gam.

125
00:09:19,297 --> 00:09:21,888
Yeah.
Hey, don’t say that, hey Poon.

126
00:09:21,888 --> 00:09:23,661
I used to play more than this when I was young.

127
00:09:23,661 --> 00:09:26,560
Can I play like this with Gam too?

128
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:39,037
Oh, Kla, So coincidence!

129
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:41,409
Khing and Gina, what are you doing here?

130
00:09:41,409 --> 00:09:43,282
Oh, we’re here to shopping.

131
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:45,419
Who’s this?

132
00:09:45,943 --> 00:09:49,351
Oh, is this the boy's who were shipping with Kla?

133
00:09:50,565 --> 00:09:55,693
Yeah, Cake, this is Khing and Gina.

134
00:09:56,057 --> 00:09:57,629
Hello!
They’re my friends from university.

135
00:09:57,872 --> 00:09:59,475
Hello!
Hello.

136
00:10:00,244 --> 00:10:03,186
Cake is just as cute as in the live stream.

137
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:06,182
P.Khing, you ever saw me live streaming?

138
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:09,322
I like to watching when you play the piano. It’s great.

139
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,131
Thank you.

140
00:10:12,131 --> 00:10:14,545
So, what are you doing here, Kla?

141
00:10:14,545 --> 00:10:16,167
We should be asking more, right?

142
00:10:16,167 --> 00:10:19,043
Why did Khing and Gina come here?

143
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,993
You said you had a group project near the university.

144
00:10:23,964 --> 00:10:27,612
Well, many friends couldn’t make it today.

145
00:10:27,612 --> 00:10:29,565
So we cancelled today’s meeting.

146
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,257
So come this far?, huh?

147
00:10:31,257 --> 00:10:32,908
Poon, it’s quite a distance for you too.

148
00:10:32,908 --> 00:10:36,622
I come to meet Gam, so Kla tagged along to meet Cake too.

149
00:10:37,593 --> 00:10:39,978
So, we won’t disturb you two.

150
00:10:39,978 --> 00:10:41,854
We need to buy some more stuff anyway.

151
00:10:42,542 --> 00:10:43,452
Bye, everyone.

152
00:10:43,452 --> 00:10:45,080
Goodbye.

153
00:10:49,309 --> 00:10:51,016
What kind of person is she?

154
00:10:51,016 --> 00:10:53,909
Hey, Kla, send Cake home, okay?

155
00:10:54,354 --> 00:10:56,075
I’ll go another where with Gam first.

156
00:10:56,075 --> 00:10:58,005
Okay.
Hey, what about me, Poon?

157
00:10:58,410 --> 00:10:59,704
You stay with Kla.

158
00:10:59,704 --> 00:11:01,601
I made an effort to let you be in private.

159
00:11:01,601 --> 00:11:03,564
I’m going to date with my Dear.

160
00:11:03,564 --> 00:11:04,591
Go on, get out of here.

161
00:11:04,591 --> 00:11:05,673
So mean.

162
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,745
Bye, Cake.
Bye.

163
00:11:07,745 --> 00:11:12,437
Kla, take care of Cake.
Okay.

164
00:11:17,932 --> 00:11:22,186
So, Cake, where would you like to go next?

165
00:11:23,602 --> 00:11:25,611
Anywhere you want, P.Kla.

166
00:11:25,611 --> 00:11:31,318
Hmm, how about we go for a drive?

167
00:11:33,827 --> 00:11:34,901
Let’s go.

168
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:40,301
Are you really comfortable going with me?

169
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,193
But I promise, I won’t take you to sold.

170
00:11:47,783 --> 00:11:51,637
Even if you did, I wouldn’t be worth much anyway.

171
00:11:53,172 --> 00:11:55,114
Open your hand.

172
00:11:56,814 --> 00:11:58,068
Thank you.

173
00:11:59,444 --> 00:12:01,404
My hands are all chapped from washing.

174
00:12:01,404 --> 00:12:06,284
Let me see if they’re really chapped.

175
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,396
They’re still soft.

176
00:12:16,732 --> 00:12:21,124
Aren’t you going to fasten your seatbelt?

177
00:12:21,124 --> 00:12:22,662
Do you want me to fasten it for you?

178
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:28,872
No, it’s okay. I’ll fasten it myself.

179
00:12:38,882 --> 00:12:41,726
What kind of music does P.Kla usually like?

180
00:12:42,374 --> 00:12:43,795
It depends on my mood.

181
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,225
But,

182
00:12:46,318 --> 00:12:49,473
right now, I’d like to hear you play the piano.

183
00:12:50,323 --> 00:12:53,125
I’d like to hear you play the guitar too.

184
00:12:54,703 --> 00:12:58,974
In that case, I think we should go to my room.

185
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:00,663
Sure.

186
00:13:05,196 --> 00:13:08,540
Actually, Cake doesn’t go to anyone’s room easily.

187
00:13:08,783 --> 00:13:11,327
But if it’s P.Kla,

188
00:13:12,622 --> 00:13:14,370
I trust you.

189
00:13:15,746 --> 00:13:17,902
What makes you so trust me?

190
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,103
If P.Kla was a bad person,

191
00:13:21,103 --> 00:13:24,818
Poon and Gam wouldn’t let me be with you alone, right?

192
00:13:25,182 --> 00:13:26,384
Also,

193
00:13:27,922 --> 00:13:30,003
I trust my instincts.

194
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:33,679
Thank you.

195
00:13:34,893 --> 00:13:39,176
But I think it’s better if I take you to your dorm today.

196
00:13:40,309 --> 00:13:42,522
I don’t want others to judge you badly.

197
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,000
So let's go now.
Okay.

198
00:13:55,136 --> 00:13:57,458
Come here, Kiddo.

199
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,039
How was yesterday? Tell me.

200
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:06,420
What should I tell you?

201
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:10,151
So, how about P.Kla in real life? Is he as good as people say?

202
00:14:10,151 --> 00:14:11,341
Of course he is.

203
00:14:11,705 --> 00:14:13,568
He’s a friend’s lover in the future.

204
00:14:14,337 --> 00:14:15,438
What Lover? Jim.

205
00:14:15,883 --> 00:14:18,371
So, tell me how was it.

206
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,387
P.Kla is really kind.

207
00:14:21,387 --> 00:14:23,877
He’s even taller than me.

208
00:14:25,374 --> 00:14:28,403
Was he as handsome as in the live?

209
00:14:30,225 --> 00:14:31,724
He is handsome.

210
00:14:32,088 --> 00:14:35,293
He’s definitely handsome, but in a different style from Poon.

211
00:14:35,698 --> 00:14:39,512
But he’s still handsome.

212
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,505
You just met him and you’re already lovesick, huh?

213
00:14:43,505 --> 00:14:45,902
Don’t tease my friend.

214
00:14:45,902 --> 00:14:48,095
So where did you two go yesterday?

215
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:52,992
We had a meal, went for a walk, and ate ice cream.

216
00:14:53,356 --> 00:14:55,192
Just only two of you?

217
00:14:55,556 --> 00:14:57,813
At first, Poon and Gam were with us.

218
00:14:57,813 --> 00:15:01,070
But P.Kla invited me to go for a drive and then send me home.

219
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:05,010
Aren’t you afraid he might take you somewhere bad, Cake?

220
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:07,236
Why you went with him one by one.

221
00:15:07,236 --> 00:15:09,607
Bad? What's bad thing?

222
00:15:09,607 --> 00:15:11,126
P.Kla is very kind.

223
00:15:11,126 --> 00:15:14,784
P.Kla even let me read Conan at his condo.

224
00:15:15,108 --> 00:15:16,701
He has every collection.

225
00:15:17,025 --> 00:15:20,716
Cake, he invited you to his condo.

226
00:15:20,716 --> 00:15:23,237
Yeah, Is he trying to trick our friend?

227
00:15:23,237 --> 00:15:25,385
Yeah, that’s what I’m thinking.

228
00:15:27,287 --> 00:15:30,224
Did I just hear something about someone tricking someone?

229
00:15:30,224 --> 00:15:34,601
Cake said P.Kla has Conan at his condo.

230
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:38,391
So Cake wants to read Conan at P.Kla’s condo.

231
00:15:44,705 --> 00:15:48,820
Cake, how are you sure that he’s a good person?

232
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:51,043
You’ve met him once.

233
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,804
He might be deceiving you to gain your trust.

234
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,485
I also have Conan comics in my room.

235
00:15:57,485 --> 00:16:01,453
You can read them in my room. no need to go to P.Kla’s condo.

236
00:16:01,453 --> 00:16:03,025
You like One Piece, right?

237
00:16:03,025 --> 00:16:05,546
Or Doraemon? I have those too.

238
00:16:05,546 --> 00:16:07,019
I have them in my room.

239
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,967
Hold on, AF.

240
00:16:10,626 --> 00:16:12,254
Why would P.Kla try to deceive me?

241
00:16:14,763 --> 00:16:16,220
I just worried about you, Cake.

242
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:18,898
Don’t worry about me.

243
00:16:21,448 --> 00:16:22,808
I think I can judge people correctly.

244
00:16:23,982 --> 00:16:25,869
Even though I look clueless,

245
00:16:26,395 --> 00:16:28,881
But I’m not stupid, AF.

246
00:16:30,743 --> 00:16:33,079
And everyone else too.

247
00:16:34,906 --> 00:16:36,288
Cake.

248
00:16:38,312 --> 00:16:41,098
Look at you guys, all gloomy.

249
00:16:41,098 --> 00:16:42,950
I’ll check on Cake first.

250
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:45,120
Me too.

251
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,631
You’re culprit.

252
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:02,999
Excuse me, P.Kla.

253
00:17:02,999 --> 00:17:07,135
I made some sweets for you.

254
00:17:08,592 --> 00:17:10,712
I'm not able to accept that.

255
00:17:12,493 --> 00:17:14,106
Why not?

256
00:17:14,106 --> 00:17:17,017
But You ate Cake’s, didn’t you?

257
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:20,994
I accepted and ate it

258
00:17:20,994 --> 00:17:22,720
because it was from Cake.

259
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:24,680
I’m sorry.

260
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,285
Sorry.

261
00:17:33,142 --> 00:17:34,530
So, I’ll take it.

262
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,277
You’re so cruel.

263
00:17:38,277 --> 00:17:39,819
She made the effort to do it for you.

264
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,896
I already said I don’t want to give anyone false hope.

265
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:45,627
Hey, it’s not about giving false hope.

266
00:17:45,627 --> 00:17:47,550
It’s called preserving someone’s feelings.

267
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:49,645
If you keep rejecting like this,

268
00:17:49,645 --> 00:17:51,875
people will think you’re arrogant.

269
00:17:52,523 --> 00:17:54,833
I don’t care how people see me.

270
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:58,455
I only want to preserve the feelings of those I care about.

271
00:17:58,455 --> 00:18:01,444
For those who approach me with motives I know I can’t fulfill,

272
00:18:01,444 --> 00:18:03,045
I think it’s better to reject them.

273
00:18:03,247 --> 00:18:04,698
So there won’t be any problems later on.

274
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,164
And what do you think the girl wanted from you?

275
00:18:08,164 --> 00:18:10,252
Seriously.
Did you just imagine it?

276
00:18:10,252 --> 00:18:12,540
She might just be a fan.

277
00:18:12,742 --> 00:18:16,093
Trust me, I know who approaches me for what reason.

278
00:18:18,157 --> 00:18:19,639
And for Cake,

279
00:18:19,639 --> 00:18:23,619
if he brought sweets with the motive of “dating”,

280
00:18:23,619 --> 00:18:25,169
would you accept him?

281
00:18:25,169 --> 00:18:26,032
Yes.

282
00:18:26,032 --> 00:18:28,038
Wow, double standards.

283
00:18:28,564 --> 00:18:32,514
I already said that I’ll reject anyone who approaches me with motives I can’t fulfill.

284
00:18:32,514 --> 00:18:35,039
I'll reject.

285
00:18:37,454 --> 00:18:41,825
Damn, I’m amazed that I know what your type is.

286
00:18:42,392 --> 00:18:43,883
Who’s dying, Bee?

287
00:18:43,883 --> 00:18:45,145
Me, I’m dying.

288
00:18:45,145 --> 00:18:48,673
Kla admitted that he likes Cake.

289
00:18:50,975 --> 00:18:52,093
Not just likes, but likes enough

290
00:18:52,093 --> 00:18:55,522
to want to be called him boyfriend.

291
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,221
Really? You’re so confident.

292
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:02,396
You met him just once , Are you sure?

293
00:19:02,396 --> 00:19:05,581
Yes, that sure.

294
00:19:05,743 --> 00:19:08,110
Great, then you’ll have to work hard.

295
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:11,163
Because Cake is both clueless and naive.

296
00:19:11,163 --> 00:19:13,557
And he has never been in love.

297
00:19:14,448 --> 00:19:20,137
How can you be so sure that Cake is clueless and naive?

298
00:19:21,756 --> 00:19:23,619
So you can perceive him already?

299
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:27,398
Hey, what are you two talking about?

300
00:19:27,398 --> 00:19:28,524
Explain it to me too.

301
00:19:30,264 --> 00:19:31,773
You’re really good, huh.

302
00:19:31,773 --> 00:19:33,864
You can see through everything clearly.

303
00:19:34,592 --> 00:19:35,833
What are you talking about?

304
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:45,200
Hello everyone
Hello!

305
00:19:51,019 --> 00:19:55,048
Hey, why are there so many people taking pictures of you today, Kla?

306
00:19:56,343 --> 00:19:57,769
They’re taking pictures of Kla.

307
00:19:57,769 --> 00:19:58,694
Why are they taking pictures of me?

308
00:19:58,694 --> 00:20:01,969
Well, it's because of that day when you went with Cake.

309
00:20:01,969 --> 00:20:03,975
When you met Poon and took a photo together for IG.

310
00:20:03,975 --> 00:20:05,466
It went trending.

311
00:20:05,466 --> 00:20:13,053
People are really into it, and they even said, “Finally, Kla meets Cake.”

312
00:20:13,053 --> 00:20:15,324
Okay, I’ve reposted it for my friend.

313
00:20:16,093 --> 00:20:18,209
Helping my friend boost the tag.

314
00:20:18,209 --> 00:20:22,336
Good job, friend.
Great!

315
00:20:22,336 --> 00:20:23,753
Kla, you’re not uncomfortable, right?

316
00:20:23,753 --> 00:20:24,901
No, I’m not, Khing.

317
00:20:24,901 --> 00:20:28,261
Kla isn’t uncomfortable. He actually likes it.

318
00:20:28,261 --> 00:20:29,402
that's right?

319
00:20:29,402 --> 00:20:30,596
Why do you like it?

320
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:35,170
Because I get to be a part of the trend with someone I like.

321
00:20:36,101 --> 00:20:37,440
Everyone likes that.

322
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:42,840
You’re right, being a couple with someone you like is the best.

323
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:43,710
So Annoying.

324
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:44,722
I like Cake!

325
00:20:44,722 --> 00:20:45,288
What?

326
00:20:45,288 --> 00:20:48,111
Oh, wait. Let me record this.

327
00:20:48,111 --> 00:20:48,637
Really?

328
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:52,171
Nosy.

329
00:20:53,102 --> 00:20:54,142
Oh, Kla.

330
00:20:54,709 --> 00:20:55,494
Wow, getting scolded.

331
00:20:55,494 --> 00:20:59,130
Cake, Cake, Cake, did you see the tags on social media?

332
00:20:59,778 --> 00:21:00,706
Tags? What tags?

333
00:21:00,706 --> 00:21:02,343
The tags with you and P.Kla.

334
00:21:02,748 --> 00:21:04,132
It’s been around for a while, hasn’t it?

335
00:21:05,144 --> 00:21:09,313
Not really. Oh, actually, yes.

336
00:21:09,313 --> 00:21:14,979
But the latest one says that P.Kla said he likes you during lunch at the faculty canteen.

337
00:21:14,979 --> 00:21:17,632
Oh, really? Let me see that.

338
00:21:18,482 --> 00:21:22,799
I heard with my own ears that Kla told his friends that he likes Cake.

339
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:26,515
My friend and I bit our lips til it bled.

340
00:21:26,515 --> 00:21:30,000
Wow, P.Kla isn’t ordinary.

341
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,964
He might just like as a junior or something.

342
00:21:34,964 --> 00:21:36,526
It might not be anything serious.

343
00:21:37,295 --> 00:21:41,577
But I’m sure that P.Kla’s “like” doesn’t just mean being a junior.

344
00:21:41,577 --> 00:21:43,280
Right?

345
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:47,699
Jim, let’s not talk about things that can’t be proven true or false.

346
00:21:48,913 --> 00:21:52,870
How do you know if it's true or not?

347
00:22:10,296 --> 00:22:11,789
Hello, P.Kla.

348
00:22:13,853 --> 00:22:16,114
I’m arrived.

349
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,040
I’ve eaten already.

350
00:22:20,607 --> 00:22:22,880
See you later. Bye.

351
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:26,141
See? I told you.

352
00:22:26,141 --> 00:22:29,107
I think my friend

353
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:31,569
won’t escape from P.Kla’s hands soon.

354
00:22:31,569 --> 00:22:35,200
Jim, don’t talk like that to Cake.

355
00:22:38,409 --> 00:22:39,522
What?

356
00:22:39,522 --> 00:22:41,984
Oh, changing the Topic.

357
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,345
Smile all the time.

358
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,654
Thank you for agreeing to have dinner with me.

359
00:23:19,232 --> 00:23:23,192
Cake should be the one thanking you, P.Kla.

360
00:23:25,656 --> 00:23:27,620
Hmm.
Cake/P.Kla.

361
00:23:31,477 --> 00:23:34,723
I have something to talk to you, Cake.

362
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,516
I also have something to talk with you, P.Kla.

363
00:23:39,013 --> 00:23:40,997
Is it about the hashtag today?

364
00:23:42,778 --> 00:23:47,527
What did you see in the posts?

365
00:23:48,175 --> 00:23:50,163
I saw that.

366
00:23:51,215 --> 00:23:56,527
P.Kla said you likes Cake.

367
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:02,216
And how do you interpret my “like”?

368
00:24:04,442 --> 00:24:09,134
P.Kla, I have no experience with this kind of thing.

369
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:16,196
But I know about how people feel about me.

370
00:24:19,092 --> 00:24:22,385
But it’s strange because we just met recently.

371
00:24:23,356 --> 00:24:27,501
Why are you so sure you like me as in...

372
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,133
...as in wanting me to be your boyfriend?

373
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:39,241
Cake,

374
00:24:39,241 --> 00:24:45,024
I’m not the type that express feelings easily.

375
00:24:45,591 --> 00:24:47,133
If I didn’t truly mean it.

376
00:24:48,792 --> 00:24:53,008
For example, my parents used to flirt each other through letters.

377
00:24:53,008 --> 00:24:55,247
They used letters to build they relationship.

378
00:24:55,247 --> 00:24:59,094
And when they met, they felt familiar with each other.

379
00:24:59,094 --> 00:25:02,852
Then they married

380
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:10,760
and loved each other till now.

381
00:25:14,493 --> 00:25:16,090
It’s really romantic.

382
00:25:16,899 --> 00:25:21,370
It might seem like our relationship are moving too fast for us.

383
00:25:21,775 --> 00:25:28,596
But please give us a chance

384
00:25:28,596 --> 00:25:30,674
to know each other.

385
00:25:30,674 --> 00:25:34,388
At least as people who are studying each other.

386
00:25:34,388 --> 00:25:36,880
Okay?

387
00:25:39,416 --> 00:25:42,099
I thought...

388
00:25:42,099 --> 00:25:44,225
that you would ask me to be your boyfriend.

389
00:25:45,034 --> 00:25:48,923
Honestly, I would like to ask you to be my boyfriend.

390
00:25:49,247 --> 00:25:54,080
But I’m afraid you might not be ready yet.

391
00:25:57,255 --> 00:26:00,029
Thank you for giving me time.

392
00:26:01,324 --> 00:26:03,695
So I can be sure

393
00:26:04,747 --> 00:26:07,717
about my feelings for you.

394
00:26:07,717 --> 00:26:09,393
What they really are.

395
00:26:11,214 --> 00:26:14,223
If that’s the case,

396
00:26:14,223 --> 00:26:16,578
for now,

397
00:26:16,578 --> 00:26:19,600
let’s be talking partners.

398
00:26:28,178 --> 00:26:30,000
I’ll...

399
00:26:40,459 --> 00:26:44,649
reserve you as a talking partner for now.

400
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:51,240
If we become a lover later, we can talk about it again.

401
00:27:01,031 --> 00:27:05,960
Ahem, Making a sandwich have to be this happy, P.Cake?

402
00:27:09,698 --> 00:27:11,405
Tim, I have something to tell you.

403
00:27:11,405 --> 00:27:12,842
What’s up?

404
00:27:13,773 --> 00:27:14,843
Did P.Kla come to ask you to be his boyfriend?

405
00:27:14,843 --> 00:27:16,607
Not yet, but almost.

406
00:27:18,792 --> 00:27:20,396
Well, tell me , P.Cake.

407
00:27:20,396 --> 00:27:23,117
So, the story is...

408
00:27:24,533 --> 00:27:26,703
So cute.

409
00:27:26,703 --> 00:27:29,434
I want to see your face clearly.

410
00:27:30,527 --> 00:27:31,602
Is this clear enough?

411
00:27:31,602 --> 00:27:33,442
How about we go for a drive?

412
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:37,625
Aren’t you going to fasten your seatbelt? Do you want me to fasten it for you?

413
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:42,798
No, it’s okay. I’ll fasten it myself.

414
00:27:42,798 --> 00:27:46,644
My friend probably won’t escape from P.Kla’s hands soon.

415
00:27:47,737 --> 00:27:51,039
I ask for...

416
00:28:00,447 --> 00:28:04,497
A deposit for now, as a talking partner.

417
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:07,354
Will it work, Tim?

418
00:28:13,216 --> 00:28:14,909
I don’t really know, P.Cake.

419
00:28:15,476 --> 00:28:18,215
Things like this depend on two people.

420
00:28:19,105 --> 00:28:21,622
I respect your decision, P.Cake.

421
00:28:22,836 --> 00:28:26,398
As for P.Kla, it’s not hard to find out more.

422
00:28:26,398 --> 00:28:32,070
But from the outside, he seems straightforward and open.

423
00:28:32,596 --> 00:28:34,758
Anyway, you should keep an eye on him for now.

424
00:28:35,325 --> 00:28:36,450
Don’t you think?

425
00:28:37,644 --> 00:28:39,241
Hmm.

426
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,907
Can I have a piece?

427
00:28:41,907 --> 00:28:43,029
Tim.

428
00:28:43,029 --> 00:28:43,855
One piece.

429
00:28:43,855 --> 00:28:46,740
This's For P.Kla.
Nah, for me.

430
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:10,720
Excuse me, is your name Cake?

431
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,324
Yes.

432
00:29:13,903 --> 00:29:18,721
What’s your relationship with Kla?

433
00:29:18,721 --> 00:29:20,463
Do you know P.Kla?

434
00:29:20,463 --> 00:29:21,935
Of course, I do.

435
00:29:21,935 --> 00:29:24,004
How could I ask if I didn’t know?

436
00:29:25,016 --> 00:29:29,295
Oh, what did you ask just now?

437
00:29:29,497 --> 00:29:34,793
I asked what's your relationship with Kla.

438
00:29:34,793 --> 00:29:36,544
I saw you having a meal together yesterday.

439
00:29:37,232 --> 00:29:39,028
By the way, about the meal...

440
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,683
Have you all eaten yet?

441
00:29:42,533 --> 00:29:44,592
Not yet. Why do you ask?

442
00:29:46,616 --> 00:29:49,152
Could you taste this for me?

443
00:29:51,175 --> 00:29:54,060
I tried making a new sandwich recipe.

444
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:57,160
And I’d like some feedback.

445
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,083
Hmm, it’s delicious.

446
00:30:14,256 --> 00:30:16,280
Did you come up with the recipe yourself?

447
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,720
Yes.

448
00:30:18,411 --> 00:30:20,849
Kaew, why are you eating it?

449
00:30:20,849 --> 00:30:22,367
Well, it’s really delicious.

450
00:30:22,367 --> 00:30:25,787
If you don’t believe me, try some yourself.

451
00:30:26,192 --> 00:30:29,474
Quick, try it now!

452
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:47,092
Hmm, it’s delicious.

453
00:30:47,092 --> 00:30:48,277
Thank you so much.

454
00:30:48,277 --> 00:30:49,967
I’m actually practicing making this.

455
00:30:49,967 --> 00:30:52,504
I was thinking of making it for P.Kla too.

456
00:30:52,504 --> 00:30:55,963
But this dressing is low-calorie.

457
00:30:55,963 --> 00:30:57,469
It’s my first time trying it.

458
00:30:57,469 --> 00:31:00,796
Do you think Kla will like it?

459
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:03,731
I think he will like it.

460
00:31:04,419 --> 00:31:08,899
It’s also suitable for women who are worried about gaining weight like us.

461
00:31:09,101 --> 00:31:11,142
Yes, yes, yes!

462
00:31:11,142 --> 00:31:12,519
The bread is whole wheat.

463
00:31:12,924 --> 00:31:14,893
And the dressing is low-calorie too.

464
00:31:15,986 --> 00:31:18,264
Your name is Kaew, right?

465
00:31:18,264 --> 00:31:19,154
Yes.

466
00:31:19,154 --> 00:31:20,434
You’re Brilliant!.

467
00:31:20,798 --> 00:31:24,539
Just a bit. I like to eat.

468
00:31:24,539 --> 00:31:28,133
But I’m afraid of gaining weight.

469
00:31:28,861 --> 00:31:31,917
If I make more healthy snack,

470
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:34,037
I’ll bring them for you all to taste.

471
00:31:34,523 --> 00:31:37,026
By the way, which faculty are you in?

472
00:31:37,026 --> 00:31:38,576
Business.

473
00:31:38,576 --> 00:31:40,728
Same as my friend.

474
00:31:41,173 --> 00:31:44,251
Then I’ll make some and bring it for you to taste.

475
00:31:44,737 --> 00:31:46,342
But today I’ll go now.

476
00:31:46,342 --> 00:31:48,240
Goodbye!

477
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,826
Bye-bye.

478
00:31:49,826 --> 00:31:51,513
See you!

479
00:31:51,513 --> 00:31:56,363
Good luck! Don’t forget to bring the sandwiches!

480
00:31:58,639 --> 00:32:02,132
See, I told you, he is cute.

481
00:32:03,346 --> 00:32:06,319
Then why did your friend ask you to look for trouble with him?

482
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:12,212
Well, at first, I thought the kid would be arrogant.

483
00:32:12,819 --> 00:32:14,151
Who would have known?

484
00:32:14,879 --> 00:32:18,348
I think you should ignore what your friend asked.

485
00:32:18,348 --> 00:32:20,216
You might get into trouble for no reason.

486
00:32:20,216 --> 00:32:24,524
I think Cake seems like a perfect match for Kla.

487
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:28,808
From what I see in the tags fans.

488
00:32:29,617 --> 00:32:30,856
It’s true.

489
00:32:30,856 --> 00:32:34,455
Yes, it’s true. Do you want to eat?

490
00:32:34,455 --> 00:32:35,061
Yes.

491
00:32:35,061 --> 00:32:39,720
No, no.
I’ll eat it.

492
00:32:43,097 --> 00:32:46,407
That’s enough for today, everyone. See you next week.

493
00:32:46,407 --> 00:32:49,545
Yes, thank you.

494
00:32:49,545 --> 00:32:50,962
Oh.

495
00:32:50,962 --> 00:32:53,349
Hey, friends, I’ll quickly reserve a seats.

496
00:32:53,349 --> 00:32:54,596
Otherwise, there won’t be any seats for us.

497
00:32:55,244 --> 00:32:56,642
Pao, come with me.

498
00:32:56,642 --> 00:32:58,614
Okay, let’s go.

499
00:32:58,938 --> 00:33:02,477
But I need to go toilet, Fah. Come with me.

500
00:33:02,477 --> 00:33:03,434
Sure.

501
00:33:04,567 --> 00:33:07,549
Cake, I'll take Pat to the restroom first.

502
00:33:07,549 --> 00:33:09,628
You Come along.

503
00:33:22,093 --> 00:33:25,437
Here AF, I made sandwiches for you.
[Music]

504
00:33:30,366 --> 00:33:31,596
For me?

505
00:33:31,596 --> 00:33:32,725
Yes.

506
00:33:32,725 --> 00:33:37,293
But I tried a new recipe, so I’m not sure if it’s good. Please taste it.

507
00:33:39,153 --> 00:33:41,354
Really for me?

508
00:33:45,055 --> 00:33:48,154
Thank you, Cake.

509
00:34:02,684 --> 00:34:05,276
AF, I must go now.

510
00:34:08,899 --> 00:34:12,148
Oh, Cake, I’ll just tag...

511
00:34:14,868 --> 00:34:16,061
Huh?

512
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:37,908
Cake!

513
00:34:49,492 --> 00:34:52,040
Jim, move.

514
00:34:54,492 --> 00:34:58,219
Cake, did you make sandwiches for everyone?

515
00:34:58,219 --> 00:35:00,313
Yes, Are you tasted it yet?

516
00:35:02,377 --> 00:35:07,354
I was about to taste it. It looks really delicious.

517
00:35:09,619 --> 00:35:11,310
Yes, Cake.

518
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:16,087
I tagged a photo on Instagram already.

519
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:26,534
I’ve accepted it.

520
00:35:27,909 --> 00:35:29,079
Hmm.

521
00:35:31,616 --> 00:35:33,560
How is it? Delicious?

522
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,768
Delicious!

523
00:35:40,766 --> 00:35:42,228
Really good, Cake.

524
00:35:44,373 --> 00:35:48,079
Uh, it hasn’t been unwrapped yet.

525
00:35:51,294 --> 00:35:53,920
It needs to be unwrapped first.

526
00:35:55,857 --> 00:35:59,277
But with Cake’s skill, it’s already delicious.

527
00:36:00,329 --> 00:36:03,828
It’s really good. Cake,you’re the best.

528
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:05,205
Yes, really good.

529
00:36:08,564 --> 00:36:10,114
I’m glad everyone likes it.

530
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,155
I usually like eating sweets.

531
00:36:14,155 --> 00:36:16,086
But this is exceptional.

532
00:36:16,086 --> 00:36:16,586
Amazing.

533
00:36:16,586 --> 00:36:19,811
Jim, you like everything.

534
00:36:19,811 --> 00:36:23,154
And have you tried making it for P.Kla?

535
00:36:23,154 --> 00:36:26,450
Stop teasing Cake, Pao.

536
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:33,872
Cake, it’s really delicious.

537
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:40,119
I’m glad you like it.

538
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:48,368
The medium is the message. See?

539
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:51,210
This is a famous line from the book

540
00:36:52,141 --> 00:36:54,319

541
00:36:54,967 --> 00:36:58,384
Oh, you’re really well-prepared for the lesson.

542
00:36:58,384 --> 00:36:59,923
Oh.

543
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:04,133
It’s a famous line from the book

544
00:37:04,133 --> 00:37:06,577
“Understanding Media”

545
00:37:07,791 --> 00:37:12,009
The Extension of Man. This line means

546
00:37:12,009 --> 00:37:16,632
that media is the important factor

547
00:37:16,996 --> 00:37:21,229
that shapes the communication form of humanity.

548
00:37:23,455 --> 00:37:27,041
If the communication form is technology communication,

549
00:37:27,041 --> 00:37:27,946
How was yesterday?

550
00:37:27,946 --> 00:37:29,572
The meal Sweet or not?

551
00:37:30,988 --> 00:37:32,143
What’s up?

552
00:37:32,143 --> 00:37:33,582
Just having a meal.

553
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:37,271
Stop sticking your nose into everything.

554
00:37:41,621 --> 00:37:44,356
Looks delicious, huh?

555
00:38:04,872 --> 00:38:09,603
Hey, Kla, your phone.

556
00:38:09,603 --> 00:38:11,132
Hey, Kla.

557
00:38:12,184 --> 00:38:13,718
Your phone.

558
00:38:14,892 --> 00:38:17,175
Kla, your phone.

559
00:38:18,187 --> 00:38:19,477
My phone?

560
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:20,956
Pacharadol

561
00:38:22,851 --> 00:38:24,416
Answer it.

562
00:38:24,416 --> 00:38:25,041
Yes Professor.

563
00:38:25,041 --> 00:38:29,128
Answer it. Put it on speaker.

564
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:34,605
Uh, I’m calling from Somchai.

565
00:38:34,888 --> 00:38:36,106
I'm Bank officer.

566
00:38:36,106 --> 00:38:39,527
Your information seems to be missing from the system.

567
00:38:39,527 --> 00:38:42,095
Could you provide your personal details again?

568
00:38:42,095 --> 00:38:43,883
What’s your name?

569
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:45,961
Uh, ahem.

570
00:38:47,822 --> 00:38:49,443
Who are you calling?

571
00:38:49,767 --> 00:38:53,036
Uh, I need your account name. What’s your name?

572
00:38:53,967 --> 00:38:55,225
Yuwadee.

573
00:38:56,318 --> 00:39:00,364
Ah, I didn’t catch that. What’s your name?

574
00:39:00,364 --> 00:39:02,072
You’re Yuwadee, right?

575
00:39:04,986 --> 00:39:08,480
I’m not Yuwadee.

576
00:39:09,611 --> 00:39:11,667
Who is this? Who?

577
00:39:12,153 --> 00:39:15,400
And who are you?

578
00:39:23,642 --> 00:39:25,325
Continue.

579
00:39:25,325 --> 00:39:29,265
What you just heard is an example

580
00:39:29,265 --> 00:39:34,560
of communication through technology.

581
00:39:35,774 --> 00:39:39,920
Wow, 10 out of 10, Professor Yuwadee.

582
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,960
Do you understand now?

583
00:39:52,015 --> 00:39:55,805
And did you notice how Ef-kung tagged Cake on Instagram? It’s a bit annoying.

584
00:39:56,493 --> 00:39:59,212
Did you see Kla’s look in Professor Yuwadee’s class that day?

585
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,784
He looked like a heartbroken person.

586
00:40:02,877 --> 00:40:07,550
What’s so special about Cake that makes two guys interested in him?

587
00:40:07,874 --> 00:40:09,929
Don’t be harsh on him.

588
00:40:10,455 --> 00:40:13,058
Well, I'm confusing.

589
00:40:13,058 --> 00:40:16,879
Why doesn’t anyone crush on my friend?

590
00:40:19,186 --> 00:40:21,463
I should comment on it.

591
00:40:35,319 --> 00:40:36,899
Hello, P.Kla.

592
00:40:37,547 --> 00:40:40,819
Cake apologizes for calling so late.

593
00:40:40,819 --> 00:40:43,006
Uh, P.Kla, are you available?

594
00:40:43,006 --> 00:40:44,426
Is Cake bothering you?

595
00:40:44,426 --> 00:40:47,003
Hmm, I’m still awake.

596
00:40:47,003 --> 00:40:50,570
Cake, is AF a close friend of yours?

597
00:40:50,934 --> 00:40:53,239
How do you know each other?

598
00:40:53,806 --> 00:40:55,234
Can you tell me?

599
00:40:55,234 --> 00:40:58,846
Oh, it was during orientation.

600
00:40:58,846 --> 00:41:02,218
I saw AF alone, he seemed quiet,

601
00:41:02,623 --> 00:41:06,377
so I invited him to join the group, and we’ve been friends since then.

602
00:41:06,701 --> 00:41:08,080
Ah.

603
00:41:09,213 --> 00:41:13,656
By the way, why are you asking about AF?

604
00:41:14,870 --> 00:41:16,573
I have to confess.

605
00:41:17,706 --> 00:41:19,428
I’m very jealous.

606
00:41:20,278 --> 00:41:25,118
From how AF interacts with Cake, I think AF likes Cake

607
00:41:25,118 --> 00:41:27,005
and is trying to flirt you.

608
00:41:27,795 --> 00:41:30,000
AF likes Cake?

609
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,320
Hmm, Cake and AF are really just friends.

610
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,867
Friend that crush on friend I think.

611
00:41:37,867 --> 00:41:39,760
Have you heard that before?

612
00:41:41,733 --> 00:41:44,599
What should Cake do?

613
00:41:44,599 --> 00:41:45,491
Hmm.

614
00:41:45,491 --> 00:41:48,228
Cake, why don’t you talk directly with your friend

615
00:41:49,037 --> 00:41:50,166
about how you feel?

616
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,821
I’ll try that.

617
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,581
P.Kla.

618
00:41:55,026 --> 00:41:57,879
If Cake tells AF and the other group members

619
00:41:58,324 --> 00:42:03,223
that Cake and P.Kla are studying each other right now, would it be okay?

620
00:42:04,235 --> 00:42:08,016
I think it would make me more comfortable.

621
00:42:08,704 --> 00:42:10,004
Thank you.

622
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:11,896
See you later.

623
00:42:11,896 --> 00:42:15,314
Yes, thank you, P.Kla.

624
00:42:16,204 --> 00:42:17,854
For being so straightforward.

625
00:42:17,854 --> 00:42:18,968
You’re welcome.

626
00:42:19,737 --> 00:42:22,440
See you later.

627
00:42:25,056 --> 00:42:28,657
Cake, thank you too, for being so honest.

628
00:42:30,681 --> 00:42:32,290
See you later.

629
00:42:40,506 --> 00:42:42,211
Take care of yourself.

630
00:42:42,211 --> 00:42:45,067
From your loving younger brother.

631
00:42:46,767 --> 00:42:47,575
Tim.

632
00:42:47,575 --> 00:42:49,549
Don’t be shy.

633
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,353
I’m not giving it to you.

634
00:42:52,324 --> 00:42:53,744
Just pass it to P.Kla.

635
00:42:54,351 --> 00:42:55,498
You silly kid.

636
00:42:55,498 --> 00:42:59,109
Hey, take it. Go on.

637
00:43:03,859 --> 00:43:06,238
Bye-bye.

638
00:43:06,238 --> 00:43:08,132
Take care, okay?

639
00:43:08,132 --> 00:43:10,200
Take care of Cake, okay?
Don’t worry.

640
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,300
Just Take care of Cake.

641
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:12,587
Don't do curious thing.

642
00:43:12,587 --> 00:43:14,154
Go on.

643
00:43:15,894 --> 00:43:18,503
Don’t forget to text me.

644
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,260
Cake.

645
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,359
I’ll send you home.

646
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:33,855
Nevermind, AF. P.Kla will send me home.

647
00:43:35,589 --> 00:43:41,148
But our dorms are on the same way, so it’s fine to go together.

648
00:43:44,659 --> 00:43:48,000
But tonight, I need to stay at P.Kla’s condo.

649
00:43:55,495 --> 00:43:56,527
Cake.

650
00:43:57,458 --> 00:44:00,480
Why is it always P.Kla?

651
00:44:01,733 --> 00:44:03,993
Why doesn’t Cake never give me a chance?

652
00:44:05,733 --> 00:44:07,621
Cake knows that I like you.

653
00:44:09,442 --> 00:44:11,374
Why does it have to be P.Kla?

654
00:44:11,374 --> 00:44:14,106
Why, Cake? I don’t understand.

655
00:44:14,713 --> 00:44:16,151
Why not me, Cake?

656
00:44:18,174 --> 00:44:21,491
I know that I like Cake, and Cake likes me too.

657
00:44:22,497 --> 00:44:23,310
Cake.

658
00:44:26,303 --> 00:44:27,800
Be my boyfriend, Please?

659
00:44:28,007 --> 00:44:29,920
What are you doing? , AF.

660
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:30,734
Cake.

661
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:34,800
Hey!

662
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,120
AF, stop it.

663
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:58,573
I’m really disappointed , AF.

664
00:45:00,758 --> 00:45:04,760
The AF who was my friend has disappeared. Where is he?

665
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:08,093
In the past,

666
00:45:08,579 --> 00:45:10,507
AF was always in my sight.

667
00:45:11,479 --> 00:45:15,389
But AF only cares about yourselves.

668
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:20,472
Person who love each other don’t act like this, AF.

669
00:45:22,333 --> 00:45:24,190
No matter in the status of friend,

670
00:45:26,335 --> 00:45:29,560
or any relationship.

671
00:46:08,045 --> 00:46:10,000
Come in.

672
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,000
Aren’t you going to turn on the lights?

673
00:46:49,053 --> 00:46:53,261
Well, tonight Cake can sleep in the bedroom.

674
00:46:53,909 --> 00:46:55,250
I’ll sleep on the Sofa.

675
00:46:55,817 --> 00:46:59,345
Feel free to take whatever you need.

676
00:46:59,669 --> 00:47:01,315
Think of it as your room.

677
00:47:03,055 --> 00:47:04,674
Thank you, P.Kla.

678
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:10,065
And you’re not uncomfortable staying with me, right?

679
00:47:11,603 --> 00:47:12,717
No.

680
00:47:13,445 --> 00:47:14,463
Just,

681
00:47:17,135 --> 00:47:18,936
a little embarrassed.

682
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,401
Well, just stay in my room for now.

683
00:47:24,401 --> 00:47:27,833
I don’t want you to go back to your dorm tonight.

684
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:31,558
I worry about you after today’s chaos.

685
00:47:32,265 --> 00:47:33,333
Also,

686
00:47:34,749 --> 00:47:38,938
I don’t really trust Cake’s friend.

687
00:47:41,447 --> 00:47:43,333
Thank you so much, P.Kla.

688
00:47:44,142 --> 00:47:48,815
And thank you for being with Cake during that time.

689
00:47:51,405 --> 00:47:52,427
You’re welcome.

690
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:59,045
But what about AF, Cake’s friend?

691
00:47:59,045 --> 00:48:00,925
What will Cake do?

692
00:48:02,908 --> 00:48:04,006
I don’t know yet.

693
00:48:05,058 --> 00:48:09,201
I’ll talk to AF again.

694
00:48:10,577 --> 00:48:13,949
Okay, I’ll get you a towel.

695
00:48:17,207 --> 00:48:18,995
P.Kla.

696
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,752
I think I know already.

697
00:48:26,004 --> 00:48:27,603
What did you figure out?

698
00:48:27,603 --> 00:48:29,090
Cake figured out

699
00:48:30,183 --> 00:48:32,322
How to tell AF.

700
00:48:36,084 --> 00:48:37,340
How?

701
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:39,447
Cake will tell AF that

702
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:44,156
Cake has a boyfriend.

703
00:48:46,013 --> 00:48:51,111
Who’s Cake’s boyfriend?

704
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:54,695
Who else?

705
00:48:57,683 --> 00:48:59,464
It’s you, P.Kla.

706
00:49:01,123 --> 00:49:04,739
Okay, that’s a good excuse.

707
00:49:05,629 --> 00:49:06,543
Alright.

708
00:49:06,543 --> 00:49:08,553
If it keeps him from bothering Cake.

709
00:49:08,553 --> 00:49:10,078
I’m fine with that.

710
00:49:17,324 --> 00:49:19,550
But what if it’s not just an excuse?

711
00:49:24,573 --> 00:49:26,702
What do you mean?

712
00:49:32,848 --> 00:49:34,412
Cake wants to be P.Kla’s boyfriend.

713
00:49:36,436 --> 00:49:38,425
Cake really wants to be P.Kla’s boyfriend.

714
00:49:43,086 --> 00:49:46,012
Are you sure, Cake?

715
00:49:52,495 --> 00:49:55,381
Then,

716
00:49:55,381 --> 00:49:59,670
we’re officially in relationship now.
