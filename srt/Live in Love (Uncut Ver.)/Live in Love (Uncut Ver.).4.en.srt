00:00:02,996 --> 00:00:05,240
Hello

2
00:00:07,426 --> 00:00:08,332
Okay, sure

3
00:00:08,332 --> 00:00:10,021
I’ll put down the queue, alright?

4
00:00:12,532 --> 00:00:13,911
Thank you

5
00:00:13,911 --> 00:00:15,443
See you then

6
00:00:16,788 --> 00:00:19,160
Goodbye

7
00:00:21,741 --> 00:00:22,762
Hey, Bee

8
00:00:23,079 --> 00:00:24,517
Don't say a word

9
00:00:24,517 --> 00:00:25,857
I heard everything

10
00:00:26,134 --> 00:00:28,316
Are you ditching Kla's Phuket trip?

11
00:00:28,316 --> 00:00:29,636
Yeah, of course

12
00:00:29,636 --> 00:00:31,956
This customer has deep pockets

13
00:00:31,956 --> 00:00:33,752
also it's international

14
00:00:34,662 --> 00:00:37,038
You, really?

15
00:00:38,067 --> 00:00:39,443
Fine then

16
00:00:39,443 --> 00:00:41,569
Very well, I wanna stay home too

17
00:00:42,095 --> 00:00:44,013
so I can work from home

18
00:00:44,567 --> 00:00:47,247
The business is thriving these days

19
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:49,040
Many people are selling things online

20
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,278
Lately, I'm getting orders for making logo stickers

21
00:00:52,278 --> 00:00:54,581
You know, just chili paste

22
00:00:54,581 --> 00:00:57,118
already got 6 orders
Really?

23
00:00:57,118 --> 00:00:58,324
Yeah

24
00:00:58,324 --> 00:01:00,425
So what are you going to tell Kla?

25
00:01:00,425 --> 00:01:01,752
Don't worry about that

26
00:01:01,752 --> 00:01:03,311
What do you mean?

27
00:01:03,311 --> 00:01:05,690
Here
Hey, Bee, did you catch COVID?

28
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:09,287
It's fake, It's fake

29
00:01:09,287 --> 00:01:10,238
Isn’t it looks real?

30
00:01:10,238 --> 00:01:11,164
How is it real?

31
00:01:11,164 --> 00:01:14,171
Here it is!
Deal, deal, deal!

32
00:01:16,586 --> 00:01:18,893
Who is Kla going to Phuket with?

33
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:20,344
Khing, Gina.

34
00:01:20,344 --> 00:01:21,488
Bee

35
00:01:22,952 --> 00:01:23,995
You talked too loud

36
00:01:23,995 --> 00:01:25,785
You just say something

37
00:01:25,785 --> 00:01:26,870
It’s not COVID.

38
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:32,605
So are you telling who Kla is going to Phuket with?

39
00:01:35,141 --> 00:01:37,350
He’s just going home as usual.
Nothing’s up.

40
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:38,702
Yeah, right

41
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,691
Do you know how can we get these two talking?

42
00:01:45,948 --> 00:01:47,472
No matter how hard you try, we won’t tell.

43
00:01:47,472 --> 00:01:49,832
Yeah, we won’t tell.

44
00:01:50,386 --> 00:01:51,981
You’re really not going to tell?

45
00:01:51,981 --> 00:01:52,783
Hm

46
00:01:52,783 --> 00:01:55,640
I’m ready to transfer, you know.

47
00:01:58,936 --> 00:02:01,861
I’m not sure about this, really.

48
00:02:01,861 --> 00:02:04,046
3,000

49
00:02:08,707 --> 00:02:10,663
Still not sure, though.

50
00:02:10,663 --> 00:02:11,984
5,000

51
00:02:11,984 --> 00:02:13,640
What?!

52
00:02:18,059 --> 00:02:20,225
Kla is going with Poon, Gam, and Cake.

53
00:02:21,491 --> 00:02:24,078
Next Friday, the earliest flight with Nok Air.

54
00:02:24,078 --> 00:02:25,354
That’s it.

55
00:02:26,739 --> 00:02:28,090
Can I see the slip?

56
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:33,697
You see?
I haven’t seen the slip at all.

57
00:02:33,697 --> 00:02:35,733
You check it.
Let me check first.

58
00:02:35,733 --> 00:02:36,767
Shit, the money hasn’t transferred

59
00:02:36,767 --> 00:02:38,688
Bee, can’t you check it properly?

60
00:02:38,688 --> 00:02:40,016
Damn it, and we’ve already told them

61
00:02:40,016 --> 00:02:41,026
I’m really short on cash right now.

62
00:02:41,026 --> 00:02:44,599
I’m short too, I mean short of air, it’s freaking hot here.
You better go get it

63
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:47,932
Damn it!
Damn, I already told them!

64
00:02:47,932 --> 00:02:52,660

00:04:12,328 --> 00:04:13,996
Are there a lot of people coming? Is the check-in busy?

90
00:04:13,996 --> 00:04:15,357
Okay, everything is good.

91
00:04:15,357 --> 00:04:18,909
Everything has to be in order, whether it’s the flowers or anything else.
Kade, Don’t worry.

92
00:04:18,909 --> 00:04:20,320
Our team is professional.

93
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:25,880
Here they are! Hey Brother!
Hello, Kade, Kong.

94
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,288
Welcome home, Bro.

95
00:04:40,288 --> 00:04:43,750
Haven’t seen you in so long. I miss you so much.

96
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,800
Does it has to be that extravagant, Kade?

97
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,052
Hey, you guys.

98
00:04:51,052 --> 00:04:53,036
This is Kade and Kong, my twin siblings.

99
00:04:53,036 --> 00:04:55,627
Hello
Hi

100
00:04:55,627 --> 00:04:59,882
This is P'Gam, P'Poon, and P'Cake.
P'Cake!

101
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:02,263
Hashtag PoonGam.

102
00:05:02,263 --> 00:05:04,348
Hashtag KlaCake.

103
00:05:04,348 --> 00:05:07,337
How wouldn’t I know y'all?

104
00:05:08,801 --> 00:05:10,439
I guess that’s true.

105
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:11,760
We are famous.

106
00:05:13,026 --> 00:05:14,416
By the way...

107
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:17,557
Is the room I asked you to prepare ready?

108
00:05:17,557 --> 00:05:20,341
Hey, it's my brother's honeymoon.

109
00:05:20,341 --> 00:05:23,280
How would I miss that?

110
00:05:24,344 --> 00:05:25,601
Here you go.

111
00:05:26,274 --> 00:05:28,074
Thank you. Gam

112
00:05:28,074 --> 00:05:31,111
So, shall we go to the room?
Wait a second.

113
00:05:31,111 --> 00:05:33,611
Welcome drink, please?

114
00:05:33,611 --> 00:05:36,077
Everyone, this is cashew nut drink

115
00:05:36,077 --> 00:05:39,174
From Metadee Concept Hotel.

116
00:05:39,174 --> 00:05:43,765
One Hotel, Two Concepts. Metadee, stay in style.

117
00:05:43,765 --> 00:05:46,435
May everyone enjoy your stay here

118
00:05:46,435 --> 00:05:47,861
Please come this way.

119
00:05:47,861 --> 00:05:49,556
Thank you.

120
00:06:16,968 --> 00:06:18,413
The room is really beautiful.

121
00:06:19,783 --> 00:06:21,320
Because Kade and Kong

122
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,449
are the ones who thought of the concept

123
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,389
It’s an abstract from the sea to the sky.

124
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:32,789
What is it like?

125
00:06:32,789 --> 00:06:35,649
For example with these lines.

126
00:06:35,649 --> 00:06:37,668
They flow like the waves of the sea.

127
00:06:37,668 --> 00:06:41,431
And the stars from above the sky.

128
00:06:41,431 --> 00:06:44,147
And the colors of the clouds.

129
00:06:44,147 --> 00:06:47,940
The paintings in this room also...

130
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,691
flow with the pearls.

131
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,979
So usually...

132
00:06:53,979 --> 00:06:55,732
When you come back to Phuket,

133
00:06:55,732 --> 00:06:57,462
you always stay in this room, right?

134
00:06:58,333 --> 00:06:59,504
No.

135
00:06:59,504 --> 00:07:01,644
Usually, I stay at my house in town.

136
00:07:02,594 --> 00:07:04,462
Actually,

137
00:07:04,462 --> 00:07:06,910
we could stay at your house.

138
00:07:07,266 --> 00:07:08,530
No way.

139
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:10,733
This time isn't normal

140
00:07:10,733 --> 00:07:12,397
Staying here is best

141
00:07:14,257 --> 00:07:16,314
What’s not normal about it?

142
00:07:16,314 --> 00:07:19,515
Because it’s special this time as..

143
00:07:19,515 --> 00:07:22,319
I came with my boyfriend.

144
00:07:27,164 --> 00:07:28,672
Or...

145
00:07:28,672 --> 00:07:30,295
Did I say something wrong?

146
00:07:34,264 --> 00:07:36,016
Well...

147
00:07:36,016 --> 00:07:37,720
You’re not wrong.

148
00:07:38,907 --> 00:07:40,238
And...

149
00:07:40,238 --> 00:07:42,515
Right now, Do you want to swim

150
00:07:42,515 --> 00:07:44,166
Or should we take a rest?

151
00:07:44,975 --> 00:07:46,494
Actually,

152
00:07:46,494 --> 00:07:48,414
I want to swim.

153
00:07:49,245 --> 00:07:50,863
But right now,

154
00:07:50,863 --> 00:07:52,591
the bed is too comfy.

155
00:07:54,174 --> 00:07:55,375
Then...

156
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:58,022
Let’s rest in the room.

157
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:04,041
Wow, Kla's hotel is pretty big, isn't it, Gam?

158
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:06,131
Yeah, their business is really big.

159
00:08:06,131 --> 00:08:08,488
Yeah, the room is really nice.

160
00:08:10,269 --> 00:08:12,732
Wow, amazing!

161
00:08:12,732 --> 00:08:14,016
I'll take your picture

162
00:08:14,016 --> 00:08:14,960
This phone is fine

163
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,695
Hey, Gam.
Huh?

164
00:08:17,695 --> 00:08:20,252
The pool looks so fun. Look!

165
00:08:20,252 --> 00:08:21,869
Let’s go play in the water!

166
00:08:21,869 --> 00:08:23,000
Okay, but I wanna rest first

167
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:24,954
Then we won’t play.

168
00:08:24,954 --> 00:08:26,200
Let’s take some content then

169
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,190
I’ll teach you the dance first. It goes like this

170
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:30,437
Thud thud thuh, thuh thuh thud thuh thud thuh thuh.

171
00:08:30,437 --> 00:08:32,041
Now try it.
How is it again?

172
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:34,999
Thud thud thud thuh.

173
00:08:34,999 --> 00:08:36,153
And then sway.

174
00:08:36,153 --> 00:08:37,798
Thuh thuh thud thuh thuh thuh.

175
00:08:37,798 --> 00:08:39,394
And then to this side.

176
00:08:48,822 --> 00:08:50,370
Are we arrived yet?

177
00:08:54,026 --> 00:08:55,181
Let’s go.

178
00:08:55,181 --> 00:08:57,414
Why is no one here to pick up the bags?

179
00:08:59,076 --> 00:09:02,050
Ugh, why did I bring so much stuff?

180
00:09:09,826 --> 00:09:13,335
Kla’s hotel is really huge, right, Khing?

181
00:09:13,335 --> 00:09:15,569
My friend really knows how to choose.

182
00:09:15,569 --> 00:09:19,269
This one suits you perfectly, Khing.

183
00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:21,677
It's like a well-matched couple

184
00:09:21,677 --> 00:09:23,354
Speak softly, Gina.

185
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:24,941
You’ll embarrass us in front of others.

186
00:09:24,941 --> 00:09:27,469
Why would you humble yourselves?

187
00:09:27,469 --> 00:09:29,043
If you wanna shine on this stage,

188
00:09:29,043 --> 00:09:30,774
you have to make a grand entrance.

189
00:09:30,774 --> 00:09:33,538
Just watch, I'll show you how.

190
00:09:35,881 --> 00:09:37,355
Hello

191
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:39,794
Hello?

192
00:09:40,229 --> 00:09:41,960
I'm talking to you

193
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,431
We’ve been standing here waiting for a long time.

194
00:09:44,431 --> 00:09:46,043
Why haven’t you come to pick up the bags yet?

195
00:09:46,755 --> 00:09:48,896
How can you keep guests waiting like this?

196
00:09:50,914 --> 00:09:52,332
It’s hot as hell here

197
00:09:54,947 --> 00:09:56,595
We’re checking in.

198
00:09:57,624 --> 00:10:00,923
We’re checking in, you jellyfish-headed girl

199
00:10:05,667 --> 00:10:06,906
Good Morning

200
00:10:07,539 --> 00:10:08,864
Hi

201
00:10:08,864 --> 00:10:10,201
Isn't there welcome drink

202
00:10:10,201 --> 00:10:12,100
to be served for the guests?

203
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,417
Do you know who I’m here with?

204
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,852
I think you don’t need to be this over act, Gina.

205
00:10:18,852 --> 00:10:22,266
No way! Today my friend must shine.

206
00:10:22,266 --> 00:10:23,543
Trust me.

207
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,781
Everyone,

208
00:10:26,781 --> 00:10:30,776
I would like to introduce everyone to Kla’s partner.

209
00:10:30,776 --> 00:10:33,141
She is the daughter-in-law of this place.

210
00:10:33,576 --> 00:10:36,736
I apologize for our shortcomings,

211
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:38,627
Ladies.

212
00:10:45,707 --> 00:10:46,660
You see?

213
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:49,333
Kla came down to welcome his partner himself.

214
00:10:50,797 --> 00:10:53,189
Kla, you don’t have to come this far.

215
00:10:53,189 --> 00:10:56,506
We’re just here to relax, right?

216
00:10:57,772 --> 00:10:59,235
You’re not nervous, are you?

217
00:11:00,658 --> 00:11:03,167
Sorry for not letting you know beforehand, Kla.

218
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,520
Gina just over acting as usual

219
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,649
Don't take it for granted.

220
00:11:07,005 --> 00:11:08,298
It’s fine, Khing.

221
00:11:09,366 --> 00:11:13,091
All our staff are very kind and accommodating.

222
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,235
No one takes Gina by heart.

223
00:11:18,426 --> 00:11:19,517
If that’s the case,

224
00:11:19,517 --> 00:11:21,789
could you please help, Bellboy?

225
00:11:21,789 --> 00:11:24,697
Please take both of their luggage to the room.

226
00:11:25,647 --> 00:11:28,062
And you, receptionist

227
00:11:28,915 --> 00:11:30,703
please invite both of them

228
00:11:30,703 --> 00:11:33,393
to have dinner with me at Moon Terrace

229
00:11:33,807 --> 00:11:35,240
tonight.

230
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,060
Sure. This way please

231
00:11:38,303 --> 00:11:40,317
Then hold my bags too.

232
00:11:42,436 --> 00:11:45,325
Be careful, don’t let her get scratched.

233
00:11:49,418 --> 00:11:51,701
Hey, don’t take too long to catch up!
Let’s go!

234
00:11:51,701 --> 00:11:52,944
You, jellyfish-headed girl.

235
00:11:53,854 --> 00:11:55,139
You’re so slow.

236
00:11:56,781 --> 00:11:57,907
It’s hot as hell

237
00:11:57,907 --> 00:11:59,636
This heat is driving me crazy.

238
00:12:00,981 --> 00:12:02,859
Sure, you are

239
00:12:02,859 --> 00:12:05,200
Khing, I can hear you.

240
00:12:16,599 --> 00:12:18,067
Come over here.

241
00:12:18,067 --> 00:12:19,187
Cheese...

242
00:12:19,187 --> 00:12:20,631
Place it right here.

243
00:12:21,027 --> 00:12:22,824
And put the bread over here.

244
00:12:26,504 --> 00:12:27,926
The kids will be here soon.

245
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:30,217
Go check the kitchen

246
00:12:30,217 --> 00:12:32,309
and see if everything is ready.

247
00:12:32,309 --> 00:12:34,429
I miss you so much, Mom.

248
00:12:34,429 --> 00:12:38,977
Oh, Kla, my dear!

249
00:12:38,977 --> 00:12:40,654
I missed you a lot too

250
00:12:40,654 --> 00:12:42,649
Really, really missed you, you know.

251
00:12:43,181 --> 00:12:44,070
She really missed you so much.

252
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:46,762
As soon as she found out you were coming back, she called a chef meeting

253
00:12:46,762 --> 00:12:48,378
to brainstorm a new menu.

254
00:12:49,251 --> 00:12:51,414
You’re exaggerating.

255
00:12:51,414 --> 00:12:55,744
Our hotel usually holds meetings to develop new recipes

256
00:12:57,525 --> 00:12:59,188
Please have a seat, kids. Make yourselves comfortable.

257
00:13:02,987 --> 00:13:04,183
Oh, Dad, Mom,

258
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:05,645
these are my friends.

259
00:13:06,397 --> 00:13:08,494
Good evening, Good evening

260
00:13:08,494 --> 00:13:11,457
Poon, Gam, you might already know them

261
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:14,557
And this is...

262
00:13:14,557 --> 00:13:15,876
Cake, right?

263
00:13:15,876 --> 00:13:16,555
Yes.

264
00:13:16,555 --> 00:13:18,374
You look much cuter than in the pictures.

265
00:13:18,374 --> 00:13:19,595
Right, Dad?

266
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,714
Not that much, Auntie.

267
00:13:21,714 --> 00:13:23,396
What do you mean "Auntie"?

268
00:13:23,396 --> 00:13:24,814
You can call me Mom.

269
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:29,577
cause you're Kla’s boyfriend.

270
00:13:31,637 --> 00:13:32,717
Yes, Mom.

271
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,542
By the way,

272
00:13:34,542 --> 00:13:36,237
How do you know Cake, Mom?

273
00:13:36,237 --> 00:13:37,942
This means that

274
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:39,579
Kade and Kong

275
00:13:39,579 --> 00:13:42,502
must have updated you on all the news, right?

276
00:13:43,175 --> 00:13:45,038
Don’t blame them.

277
00:13:45,038 --> 00:13:46,943
I just missed you too much.

278
00:13:46,943 --> 00:13:50,219
Why, can’t I follow my son’s life?

279
00:13:50,219 --> 00:13:51,400
Of course you can.

280
00:13:52,824 --> 00:13:57,071
Hey Brother, let's party!

281
00:13:57,071 --> 00:13:59,516
Wow, you’re really hard to kill; speaking of you and here you are!

282
00:14:00,347 --> 00:14:01,488
Wow.

283
00:14:01,488 --> 00:14:04,301
You brought a lot of wine, are you planning to pry secrets from me?

284
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:05,936
No, Brother.

285
00:14:05,936 --> 00:14:07,595
It's not for you.

286
00:14:07,595 --> 00:14:09,598
It's for...

287
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:16,217
Alright, alright.

288
00:14:16,217 --> 00:14:19,139
Since we have wine and cheese ready,

289
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:20,840
let’s start!

290
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,934
Go for it, kids.

291
00:14:21,934 --> 00:14:24,093
So, Mom, you're starting with the wine right?

292
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:27,656
Come on, don’t bring reality into this, dear.

293
00:14:36,341 --> 00:14:37,762
What’s the menu, Mom?

294
00:14:37,762 --> 00:14:39,801
Don’t ask me; I just finished a meeting.

295
00:14:41,224 --> 00:14:44,249
Well, since y'all are here, hold on.
When Dad said...
296

296
00:14:44,249 --> 00:14:45,853
It’s the truth.

297
00:14:45,853 --> 00:14:47,803
Let’s toast a little.

298
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:49,320
Welcome!

299
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,409
Mom,

300
00:15:25,409 --> 00:15:27,791
actually, Cake brought a gift for you today.

301
00:15:28,542 --> 00:15:30,069
I'll ask P'Fon to bring it for you.

302
00:15:30,742 --> 00:15:31,854
P'Fon!

303
00:15:35,025 --> 00:15:37,998
This is the rice brand that my family regularly eat.

304
00:15:39,264 --> 00:15:40,372
Thank you so much, dear.

305
00:15:42,311 --> 00:15:44,333
I often eat at Cake's house.

306
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:45,800
It’s jasmine rice, Sukhonsawan.

307
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,537
It’s really delicious, Mom.

308
00:15:47,537 --> 00:15:49,473
Premium Hom Mali rice from Ubon Ratchathani

309
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:50,589
Great!

310
00:15:51,341 --> 00:15:54,398
I just thought of the menu for tomorrow.

311
00:15:54,398 --> 00:15:55,475
I’ll give it to the chef.

312
00:15:55,475 --> 00:15:57,875
I’ll list the menu for the chef.

313
00:15:58,271 --> 00:15:59,105
How’s that, dear?

314
00:15:59,105 --> 00:16:01,916
That’s great!
Okay, P'Fon
315

315
00:16:02,391 --> 00:16:04,199
please take it to the kitchen.

316
00:16:08,908 --> 00:16:10,176
Hello!

317
00:16:10,176 --> 00:16:12,044
Good evening, everyone!

318
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,822
Wow.

319
00:16:15,822 --> 00:16:18,203
This hotel is really beautiful and luxurious!

320
00:16:18,797 --> 00:16:21,680
Oh my gosh, I love this chandelier so much!

321
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,990
So wonderful and fabulous, Khing. Nice!

322
00:16:26,573 --> 00:16:28,059
Hi there

323
00:16:30,196 --> 00:16:33,283
Good evening, sorry for being late.

324
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:36,045
Khing and I got a bit lost

325
00:16:38,538 --> 00:16:40,670
What do we have here?

326
00:16:45,067 --> 00:16:46,401
What to eat?

327
00:16:48,005 --> 00:16:49,040
Hey!

328
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,600
Little Jellyfish-headed girl

329
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,373
You're also here for dinner?

330
00:16:53,283 --> 00:16:56,367
This hotel really lives up to its name

331
00:16:56,367 --> 00:17:00,630
They even let bellboy and front staff joining the table with the CEO

332
00:17:01,659 --> 00:17:05,647
Brother, can you finally tell her who we are?

333
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:08,838
Gina, Khing,

334
00:17:08,838 --> 00:17:11,363
they are Kade and Kong,

335
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:13,020
my twin siblings

336
00:17:14,801 --> 00:17:17,527
You dropped your spoon, P'Gina.

337
00:17:17,527 --> 00:17:19,324
Don’t be nervous.

338
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,244
Oh wait, did we forget something?

339
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:25,570
Energy Boost Boost! Don’t drop your energy

340
00:17:25,570 --> 00:17:28,512
We still have the welcome drink. Welcome drink, please!

341
00:17:29,501 --> 00:17:33,240
I apologize for today...

342
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,028
I was busy working,

343
00:17:35,028 --> 00:17:37,257
signing checks for millions today.

344
00:17:37,257 --> 00:17:38,521
That's why today,

345
00:17:38,521 --> 00:17:41,062
I didn’t get a chance to properly welcome you.

346
00:17:41,062 --> 00:17:44,061
So I’d like to take this opportunity to apologize.

347
00:17:44,061 --> 00:17:46,891
And here’s our welcome drink
Khing, help me

348
00:17:46,891 --> 00:17:49,235
cashew nut drink

349
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:52,210
That’s our hotel’s concept.

350
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:53,882
Enjoy!

351
00:17:53,882 --> 00:17:56,091
Thanks

352
00:17:56,962 --> 00:17:59,098
Khing, help me, please?

353
00:17:59,098 --> 00:18:00,894
Kla

354
00:18:00,894 --> 00:18:04,836
What are your plans for tomorrow with Cake and friends?

355
00:18:05,311 --> 00:18:06,296
Oh,

356
00:18:06,296 --> 00:18:07,811
I’m thinking of taking them to the cage

357
00:18:07,811 --> 00:18:10,204
Sounds good!

358
00:18:10,204 --> 00:18:11,440
Cage?

359
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,315
Do you mean the fish cage?

360
00:18:13,315 --> 00:18:15,040
I've been there before.

361
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:18,006
It's a fishy one
No  No  No

362
00:18:18,006 --> 00:18:18,869
Not the fish cage

363
00:18:18,869 --> 00:18:20,639
pearl cage

364
00:18:20,639 --> 00:18:21,622
Peals?

365
00:18:22,147 --> 00:18:23,503
Pearl

366
00:18:23,503 --> 00:18:24,306
Pearl?

367
00:18:24,811 --> 00:18:25,621
Yes

368
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,453
Okay

369
00:18:31,453 --> 00:18:33,368
anyways

370
00:18:33,368 --> 00:18:35,615
It's really delicious today.

371
00:18:41,903 --> 00:18:46,549
The cheese is really tasty!

372
00:18:46,549 --> 00:18:48,138
Gina.

373
00:18:48,138 --> 00:18:49,174
Aren’t you going to eat?

374
00:18:50,242 --> 00:18:52,338
It’s okay, P'Gina is just feeling tense.

375
00:18:52,338 --> 00:18:55,000
Oh, Kade, serve some to Gina.

376
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,614
Uh, Poon.

377
00:19:04,614 --> 00:19:05,866
What time is the appointment tomorrow?

378
00:19:05,866 --> 00:19:07,453
call and check with Kla

379
00:19:07,453 --> 00:19:08,600
I don’t know either.

380
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,000
But I don’t think we need to call.

381
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,094
Let him rest with Cake for now.

382
00:19:15,899 --> 00:19:17,183
Cake is lucky, huh?

383
00:19:17,183 --> 00:19:18,642
To have Kla as a boyfriend.

384
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,573
How so?

385
00:19:23,219 --> 00:19:24,257
Well...

386
00:19:24,257 --> 00:19:27,365
Kla is clearly dedicated.

387
00:19:27,365 --> 00:19:30,182
He has taken great care of Cake since day one.

388
00:19:34,922 --> 00:19:35,496
Hmm.

389
00:19:47,065 --> 00:19:48,268
Let’s change the channel.

390
00:21:00,237 --> 00:21:01,364
Khing, look over there!

391
00:21:04,055 --> 00:21:06,799
Wow, this place is huge and magnificent
So beautiful!

392
00:21:08,522 --> 00:21:09,982
Hello, Mr. Kla.

393
00:21:09,982 --> 00:21:12,704
Hey uncle, this is my friends from Bangkok.

394
00:21:12,704 --> 00:21:14,563
Hello! Nice to meet you.

395
00:21:14,563 --> 00:21:15,840
You guys, this is Uncle Sak.

396
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,679
He helps my family with the cage

397
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:19,846
So, how’s it going, Mr. Kla?

398
00:21:19,846 --> 00:21:21,325
How’s life in Bangkok?

399
00:21:21,325 --> 00:21:23,072
Okay, okay

400
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:25,034
Just like how I keep updating you, Uncle.

401
00:21:25,034 --> 00:21:26,048
By the way...

402
00:21:26,048 --> 00:21:27,599
How's our Amorn pearl doing, Uncle?

403
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:29,111
Oh, it's currently developing well!

404
00:21:29,111 --> 00:21:30,599
Would you like to see it for yourself?

405
00:21:30,599 --> 00:21:31,720
Yes.

406
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,669
Cake.

407
00:21:32,669 --> 00:21:34,286
I’ll go check on the work with Uncle first.

408
00:21:34,286 --> 00:21:35,336
You can go to work

409
00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:36,837
I can go for a walk.

410
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:38,379
Hey, you guys.

411
00:21:38,379 --> 00:21:39,801
Feel free here

412
00:21:39,801 --> 00:21:41,007
Come on, Uncle.

413
00:21:41,007 --> 00:21:42,367
Make yourselves comfortable, everyone.

414
00:21:43,515 --> 00:21:44,666
Gam, Cake

415
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:46,517
Let's go take some pictures.

416
00:21:55,145 --> 00:21:56,672
How many did you put in here?

417
00:21:56,672 --> 00:21:59,749
Oh, we put 20 in each cage.

418
00:21:59,749 --> 00:22:01,639
And this new technique we developed,

419
00:22:01,639 --> 00:22:03,553
It seems to be working quite well, Mr. Kla.

420
00:22:03,553 --> 00:22:04,613
I think...

421
00:22:04,613 --> 00:22:07,096
By the end of next year, we should see results

422
00:22:07,096 --> 00:22:08,938
and how it turns out.

423
00:22:08,938 --> 00:22:11,702
But right now, all of them are surviving well.

424
00:22:12,612 --> 00:22:13,707
Is the lighting good?

425
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:15,157
Very good.

426
00:22:15,157 --> 00:22:16,279
Is it good?

427
00:22:16,279 --> 00:22:18,090
Is it straight, Poon?

428
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:19,499
I think it is straight.

429
00:22:19,499 --> 00:22:21,204
It’s not straight.
Let’s do it again then.

430
00:22:21,204 --> 00:22:22,920
Is it good now?

431
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,871
Is it? Is it?

432
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:28,067
Okay, beautiful, Gam

433
00:22:28,067 --> 00:22:29,536
So cute

434
00:22:30,963 --> 00:22:31,652
Got it.

435
00:22:31,652 --> 00:22:33,256
Hey, I think I’ll go live.

436
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:37,025
Hello everyone!

437
00:22:37,025 --> 00:22:40,428
Right now, I’m at the pearl cage in...

438
00:22:40,428 --> 00:22:41,186
Phuket.

439
00:22:41,186 --> 00:22:42,779
Correct!

440
00:22:42,779 --> 00:22:45,307
Hey, Cake is gone. Aren’t you going live together?

441
00:22:45,307 --> 00:22:46,734
Just go live!

442
00:22:47,441 --> 00:22:48,742
Gam, come say hi to everyone

443
00:22:49,564 --> 00:22:50,872
Hello

444
00:22:50,872 --> 00:22:52,721
It's beautiful here

445
00:23:16,835 --> 00:23:18,088
Hey, Cake!

446
00:23:18,088 --> 00:23:20,037
Help! Someone fell into the water!

447
00:23:20,037 --> 00:23:22,063
Help! Cake fell into the water!

448
00:23:22,063 --> 00:23:23,534
Cake!

449
00:23:31,719 --> 00:23:33,939
Help! Cake fell into the water!

450
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:37,606
Cake fell into the water!

451
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,125
Be careful.

452
00:24:03,993 --> 00:24:06,113
Let’s sit here for now.

453
00:24:14,429 --> 00:24:15,411
Ouch!

454
00:24:20,467 --> 00:24:21,494
What happened?

455
00:24:21,494 --> 00:24:23,251
How did you fall in?

456
00:24:23,251 --> 00:24:24,447
Did you slip, Cake?

457
00:24:25,634 --> 00:24:28,223
How could you fell into the water, Cake?

458
00:24:28,223 --> 00:24:30,911
Everyone, stop! Cake is shocked.

459
00:24:31,782 --> 00:24:32,850
Let me see.

460
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,138
Does it hurt a lot?

461
00:24:36,365 --> 00:24:39,786
Mr. Kla, the boat is ready. I think we should head to shore.

462
00:24:39,786 --> 00:24:42,630
Okay, then I’ll check on the boat

463
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:46,600
Let’s go. This way, please.

464
00:25:33,309 --> 00:25:35,983
Kla is such a gentleman.

465
00:25:36,722 --> 00:25:38,873
If so, then it’s good.

466
00:25:41,402 --> 00:25:43,000
But it might be difficult.

467
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,656
Last night, I saw them kissing under the bridge.

468
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,595
OMG!

469
00:25:47,595 --> 00:25:49,031
Are you okay?

470
00:25:52,046 --> 00:25:53,940
Don’t be sad, Khing.

471
00:25:58,679 --> 00:25:59,798
Come on.

472
00:25:59,798 --> 00:26:02,936
Today, I will do the mermaid pose for you

473
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:04,170
So you can feel better.

474
00:26:05,753 --> 00:26:08,986
Look! Mermaid Gina is here!

475
00:26:12,344 --> 00:26:13,944
How do I look? What do you think, Khing?

476
00:26:14,894 --> 00:26:16,332
How is it?

477
00:26:17,226 --> 00:26:21,301
Part of Your World.

478
00:26:21,301 --> 00:26:23,608
Haha, you already laughed

479
00:26:36,051 --> 00:26:37,690
Do I look pretty?

480
00:26:40,301 --> 00:26:41,402
I’m exhausted now

481
00:26:41,402 --> 00:26:42,950
Let me drink some water first.

482
00:26:57,621 --> 00:26:58,669
Khing

483
00:26:59,777 --> 00:27:01,605
Poon took off his shirt!

484
00:27:01,605 --> 00:27:03,581
His abs are so tight

485
00:27:04,729 --> 00:27:07,095
I think I can’t take it anymore.

486
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,616
So frustrating.

487
00:27:33,199 --> 00:27:34,794
I think if you fell into the water,

488
00:27:34,794 --> 00:27:37,643
Kla would definitely help you.

489
00:27:57,464 --> 00:27:58,959
I’m really sorry.

490
00:27:58,959 --> 00:28:00,972
For making you get hurt like this.

491
00:28:03,109 --> 00:28:04,624
You don’t have to apologize, P'Kla.

492
00:28:05,732 --> 00:28:07,849
You didn’t do anything wrong.

493
00:28:10,602 --> 00:28:11,672
Does it hurt a lot?

494
00:28:12,604 --> 00:28:15,047
I’ll be more gentle, okay?

495
00:28:23,307 --> 00:28:27,165
Wow...

496
00:28:27,165 --> 00:28:31,676
Now I see why the cold-hearted brother of mine

497
00:28:31,676 --> 00:28:35,368
chose P'Cake as my brother-in-law.

498
00:28:42,182 --> 00:28:43,443
P'Kla

499
00:28:43,997 --> 00:28:45,217
I'm worried about one thing.

500
00:28:46,325 --> 00:28:47,880
What is it?

501
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:51,264
I guess I can’t walk to Laem Phromthep with you anymore.

502
00:28:53,322 --> 00:28:57,575
No, if my brother-in-law can’t walk,

503
00:28:57,575 --> 00:28:59,668
then no need to walk.

504
00:29:00,657 --> 00:29:03,117
Metadee can manage.

505
00:29:03,874 --> 00:29:05,749
We’ll go to Laem Phromthep like...

506
00:29:05,749 --> 00:29:07,488
Metadee people.

507
00:29:26,859 --> 00:29:29,122
[song: Leave your thoughts]

508
00:29:29,122 --> 00:29:31,767
[song: Just la la let it go]

509
00:29:31,767 --> 00:29:34,898

[song: And stay here by the sea]

515
00:29:49,804 --> 00:29:50,594
Damn, Kla!

516
00:29:50,594 --> 00:29:52,747
You really take things seriously.

517
00:29:54,279 --> 00:29:55,297
That’s true.

518
00:29:55,297 --> 00:29:58,167
Just because your boyfriend hurt his leg, we don’t have to walk to Laem Phromthep.

519
00:29:58,167 --> 00:29:59,820
What can I do?

520
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:01,201
He’s my boyfriend.

521
00:30:01,201 --> 00:30:02,761
I have to take care of him as always

522
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:08,229
P'Kla, you don’t have to go that far.

523
00:30:08,229 --> 00:30:09,640
I'm cosiderated

524
00:30:10,576 --> 00:30:12,688
Don’t be so

525
00:30:12,688 --> 00:30:14,553
Anything I can do for you,

526
00:30:14,553 --> 00:30:16,257
I want to do.

527
00:30:19,525 --> 00:30:20,600
Khing

528
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:23,320
Are you seasick?

529
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:26,268
I’m not sure, Kla.

530
00:30:26,268 --> 00:30:28,108
But I feel really dizzy.

531
00:30:28,108 --> 00:30:29,588
You might be seasick.

532
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:31,840
Grace, Noona, come here.

533
00:30:34,034 --> 00:30:35,713
My friend might be seasick.

534
00:30:35,713 --> 00:30:38,907
Please open the room downstairs and get medicine for her.

535
00:30:39,801 --> 00:30:41,206
Gina.

536
00:30:41,206 --> 00:30:43,193
Please take Khing to rest downstairs.

537
00:30:52,277 --> 00:30:53,802
Not seasick, are you sure?

538
00:31:01,185 --> 00:31:02,016
Khing

539
00:31:02,016 --> 00:31:03,602
I think you should rest.

540
00:31:04,496 --> 00:31:06,249
But...

541
00:31:06,249 --> 00:31:07,916
I won’t be able to watch over you.

542
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:12,113
Because I’m going to take content on Kla’s yacht

543
00:31:12,113 --> 00:31:14,504
Kla’s yacht is really beautiful and luxurious.

544
00:31:14,504 --> 00:31:17,467
If I go up, I can create content for the whole month.

545
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:19,509
See you then, Khing

546
00:31:19,509 --> 00:31:21,252
Don’t be upset.

547
00:31:21,252 --> 00:31:22,352
Bye-bye!

548
00:32:19,345 --> 00:32:20,281
What are you doing?

549
00:32:21,005 --> 00:32:22,312
Nothing.

550
00:32:22,609 --> 00:32:23,997
Are you seasick?

551
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:25,476
No

552
00:32:26,117 --> 00:32:27,955
Are you thirsty?

553
00:32:27,955 --> 00:32:29,150
Have you apply sunscreen?

554
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:30,735
Do you know that sunlight like this,

555
00:32:30,735 --> 00:32:32,831
you should apply sunscreen every 2-3 hours

556
00:32:34,746 --> 00:32:35,733
What’s wrong?

557
00:32:35,733 --> 00:32:37,969
Suddenly, you're strangely taking care of me

558
00:32:37,969 --> 00:32:40,288
Did you do something wrong?

559
00:32:48,001 --> 00:32:50,004
I just wanna take care of you.

560
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:54,613
So you can be as lucky as Cake.

561
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,082
It's okay

562
00:32:59,082 --> 00:33:00,679
I’m already lucky.

563
00:33:01,403 --> 00:33:03,048
Luckier than Cake.

564
00:33:03,048 --> 00:33:04,635
Because Poon and I

565
00:33:04,635 --> 00:33:06,505
have been together since we were kids.

566
00:33:10,529 --> 00:33:12,352
I love you.

567
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,649
I love you.

568
00:33:34,373 --> 00:33:36,183
I love you too.

569
00:34:02,444 --> 00:34:04,188
It's unbelievable

570
00:34:04,188 --> 00:34:05,588
that this is reality.

571
00:34:07,376 --> 00:34:08,572
What is it?

572
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,803
Everything that’s happening right now.

573
00:34:15,347 --> 00:34:16,639
I feel the same too.

574
00:34:18,086 --> 00:34:20,457
It’s like I just realized that

575
00:34:20,457 --> 00:34:23,758
reality is as beautiful as a dream.

576
00:34:23,758 --> 00:34:25,207
right now.

577
00:34:32,843 --> 00:34:35,262
But I think

578
00:34:36,369 --> 00:34:39,320
this moment is even more beautiful.

579
00:34:51,911 --> 00:34:53,680
That’s true.

580
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,574
Morning kiss.

581
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:27,360
Are you awake, P'Kla?

582
00:36:28,296 --> 00:36:29,364
You should be awake.

583
00:36:29,705 --> 00:36:31,359
So we can shower and eat.

584
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:33,609
Because today we have to pack up and go home.

585
00:36:34,843 --> 00:36:36,959
But I don’t want to go back yet.

586
00:36:39,172 --> 00:36:41,585
I want to stay here forever.

587
00:36:42,947 --> 00:36:44,150
You promise?

588
00:36:44,788 --> 00:36:46,240
Yes

589
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,190
A son-in-law of Phuket.

590
00:37:08,821 --> 00:37:10,885
[Bitch]
[Asshole]

591
00:37:10,885 --> 00:37:14,474
[You’re too seduce, aren’t you?]

592
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:20,519
[Just wait, you’re not living happily, rotten Cake.]

593
00:37:25,621 --> 00:37:28,243
Why do you look so stressed?

594
00:37:54,706 --> 00:37:56,562
P'Kla

595
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:03,878
I think that

596
00:38:05,067 --> 00:38:06,869
when I fell into the cage,

597
00:38:09,551 --> 00:38:11,820
I didn’t slip.

598
00:38:13,139 --> 00:38:15,725
But I felt that

599
00:38:16,879 --> 00:38:19,960
someone pushed me into it.

600
00:38:24,536 --> 00:38:25,643
I think

601
00:38:25,643 --> 00:38:27,989
I need to do something about this.

602
00:38:50,973 --> 00:38:53,403
Hello, everyone!

603
00:38:55,531 --> 00:38:57,719
Where are you, P'Kla? It looks beautiful!

604
00:38:58,443 --> 00:39:00,894
Oh, I just returned to my resort in Phuket.

605
00:39:01,447 --> 00:39:03,388
And I brought my friends along.

606
00:39:03,388 --> 00:39:06,300
You all must have seen Poon posting pictures, right?

607
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:12,114
[Yes, P'Poon posted a lot of pictures]

608
00:39:12,114 --> 00:39:15,319
[KlaCake is real.]

609
00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:17,985
[Don’t get carried away; they’re just a shipped couple]

610
00:39:19,246 --> 00:39:20,893
Well, everyone is right.

611
00:39:21,829 --> 00:39:23,455
KlaCake is real.

612
00:39:23,455 --> 00:39:27,385
And Cake has been next to me the entire trip.
[Ignore the haters, Kla.]

613
00:39:27,385 --> 00:39:29,385
[Wow, Cake is really here!]

614
00:39:29,385 --> 00:39:31,509
[P'Kla, we’re all so excited]

615
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,393
Thank you, everyone.

616
00:39:36,393 --> 00:39:38,711
Actually, today we’re here, live streaming

617
00:39:38,711 --> 00:39:42,480
because I have something important to share with everyone.
[What is it? I want to know!]

618
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:46,147
It’s something very important for both of us.

619
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,247
So, the thing is

620
00:39:52,247 --> 00:39:53,602
lately,

621
00:39:53,602 --> 00:39:55,855
since we became a shipped couple,

622
00:39:55,855 --> 00:39:57,550
Someone has been trying to DM

623
00:39:57,550 --> 00:39:59,193
and insult Cake all the time.

624
00:40:00,252 --> 00:40:02,567
I don’t know why that person is doing this

625
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:04,251
or what their intention is.

626
00:40:05,655 --> 00:40:08,226
But it’s really not nice at all.

627
00:40:08,226 --> 00:40:10,226
[Who is it, P'Kla?]

628
00:40:11,907 --> 00:40:13,023
[That’s so harsh!]

629
00:40:13,023 --> 00:40:14,927
[Why they did this? Give me their account; I’ll rally against them!]

630
00:40:17,914 --> 00:40:19,321
Honestly, I could share it,

631
00:40:19,321 --> 00:40:20,366
but..

632
00:40:20,366 --> 00:40:22,021
I don’t want to target anyone specifically.

633
00:40:22,404 --> 00:40:23,590
And also,

634
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:26,067
we don’t need to give air time to these attention-seekers.

635
00:40:26,961 --> 00:40:28,284
I’m sorry

636
00:40:28,284 --> 00:40:29,763
if our pairing

637
00:40:29,763 --> 00:40:31,148
is bothering anyone.

638
00:40:31,914 --> 00:40:33,557
But it can’t be helped.

639
00:40:35,345 --> 00:40:36,863
However,

640
00:40:36,863 --> 00:40:38,234
I won’t accept it anymore

641
00:40:38,234 --> 00:40:40,000
if anyone continues to mess with the person I love.

642
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,744
[The person I love]
[Just punch them on their face, P'Kla]

643
00:40:41,744 --> 00:40:43,242
And

644
00:40:43,242 --> 00:40:45,741
this will be the last warning from me.

645
00:40:47,103 --> 00:40:48,501
For now,

646
00:40:48,501 --> 00:40:51,062
Today,

647
00:40:51,062 --> 00:40:52,995
there’s nothing more to say.

648
00:40:52,995 --> 00:40:54,101
I just

649
00:40:54,101 --> 00:40:56,080
wanted to share this with everyone.
