[song: would you understand me a bit]

[song: and understanding each other]

00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:39,960
[song: Can we have love in live, Can't we?]

8
00:00:46,572 --> 00:00:47,892
Hello.

9
00:00:47,892 --> 00:00:49,464
Hello everyone.

10
00:00:49,464 --> 00:00:52,906
Now, We're at Open House 2017

11
00:00:52,906 --> 00:00:54,905
I must definitely study
in the film faculty here.

12
00:00:54,905 --> 00:00:56,514
What are you doing?

13
00:00:56,514 --> 00:00:59,745
Practicing livestreaming. The modeling
senior advised me to practice it regularly.

14
00:00:59,745 --> 00:01:02,425
Guys, He's my friend.

15
00:01:02,425 --> 00:01:05,697
But he's extremely academic boy.
May not want to study here.

16
00:01:05,697 --> 00:01:09,267
But where did my two neighbors disappear to?

17
00:01:09,267 --> 00:01:10,325
Let's go look this way.

18
00:01:10,325 --> 00:01:14,685
This is our Faculty of Communication Arts.
I'm your professor.

19
00:01:14,685 --> 00:01:17,719
My name is Yuwadee.

20
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:20,013
As a representative of the
Faculty of Communication Arts,

21
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:23,455
where many people come to study,

22
00:01:23,455 --> 00:01:27,344
the most popular in our university.

23
00:01:29,916 --> 00:01:36,571
Bestie, I thinks that you should be more
interested in men than documents.

24
00:01:40,681 --> 00:01:42,516
Sorry.

25
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:48,439
A man in the age of
searching for his style.

26
00:01:50,063 --> 00:01:51,666
Well, it's true. He looks really outdated.

27
00:01:54,238 --> 00:01:57,669
Girl, I think I found my soulmate.

28
00:01:58,362 --> 00:02:01,732
Oh, I'm melting.

29
00:02:08,404 --> 00:02:10,331
Handsome prince.

30
00:02:24,315 --> 00:02:26,255
Gina, He didn't snap us.

31
00:02:26,255 --> 00:02:28,796
Why not? We're really look gorgeous.

32
00:02:33,674 --> 00:02:35,136
Where's Kla going now?

33
00:02:35,161 --> 00:02:42,950
Umm, May be he just taking
pictures around here somewhere.

34
00:02:45,314 --> 00:02:48,200
Did he get lost?

35
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,555
Really?

36
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:56,400
Let's go over there, Amp. Hmm.

37
00:02:56,445 --> 00:02:59,975
Great job! This is
exactly the kind of person.

38
00:02:59,975 --> 00:03:03,792
who should be studying at the
Faculty of Communication Arts.

39
00:03:03,792 --> 00:03:05,722
Say hello to the senior
again quickly. The senior

40
00:03:05,746 --> 00:03:07,675
made an effort to come
and take photos of you all.

41
00:03:12,452 --> 00:03:15,492
Where did that naughty older brother go?

42
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:22,136
Are you apologizing yet?

43
00:03:22,136 --> 00:03:23,938
I'm sorry.

44
00:03:36,598 --> 00:03:38,500
Kla, P.Cake.

45
00:03:47,361 --> 00:03:49,224
"If I tell you,"

46
00:03:49,224 --> 00:03:55,281
"will you ever know? There's someone waiting."

47
00:03:55,281 --> 00:03:58,386
People looking into each other's eyes.

48
00:03:58,386 --> 00:04:00,470
"It makes me shake."

49
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:05,425
"Maybe that's the person I've been waiting for."

50
00:04:05,425 --> 00:04:08,653
"If I accidentally press Love On Live."

51
00:04:08,653 --> 00:04:11,207
"Will you understand me?"

52
00:04:11,207 --> 00:04:13,490
"Secretly love through live."

53
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:15,910
"Please tell me what you think.

54
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:17,464
"I want to invite you to talk every day."

55
00:04:17,464 --> 00:04:22,055
"Not lacking, not too sweet. Let's
do it the way we understand it."

56
00:04:22,055 --> 00:04:27,310
"Can we have Love In Live?"

57
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:31,932
"Can I ask for it?"

58
00:04:31,932 --> 00:04:36,840
"Can you tell me?"

59
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:47,800
"Live in Love"
(Episode 1)

60
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,782
Are you going to play the piano or
your phone? Just choose one, Cake.

61
00:05:34,628 --> 00:05:37,864
My university friend texted me.

62
00:05:38,518 --> 00:05:40,495
So I had to reply back to them.

63
00:05:41,995 --> 00:05:44,560
Even though you're not yet a
full-fledged first-year student.

64
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,265
You're close with friends already.

65
00:05:46,265 --> 00:05:48,560
My brother is so extremely hot.

66
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,417
From now on, we might need to hire an admin

67
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:52,316
to reply to your Official Line.

68
00:05:53,128 --> 00:05:56,667
Tim, you're exaggerating.
I'll go to bed now.

69
00:05:56,692 --> 00:06:02,087
I don't want to be late since
it's the first day of university.

70
00:06:04,706 --> 00:06:07,802
Poon invited us to dinner tomorrow.
Do you want to join us?

71
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:11,452
- At your university?
- Yes.

72
00:06:12,557 --> 00:06:15,547
Poon is actually willing to come
all the way here to have dinner?

73
00:06:15,547 --> 00:06:18,276
Yes, why?

74
00:06:18,301 --> 00:06:25,194
Poon studies in the city,
So driving here is nearly 40 kilometers.

75
00:06:25,194 --> 00:06:31,017
Oh, I think he's definitely coming to visit
P'Gam. This couple has a strange vibe,

76
00:06:31,017 --> 00:06:32,565
It's definitely 100%.

77
00:06:32,565 --> 00:06:34,009
Tim, don't be silly.

78
00:06:34,009 --> 00:06:36,188
They've been friends since childhood.

79
00:06:36,188 --> 00:06:37,884
It's not that weird for them
to visit each other, is it?

80
00:06:38,733 --> 00:06:41,059
What would single person like you know?

81
00:06:42,873 --> 00:06:44,990
How about you? Are you in relationship?

82
00:06:45,248 --> 00:06:47,896
Yeah, I'm not in relationship.

83
00:06:47,896 --> 00:06:50,769
But I'm not single at all.

84
00:06:50,769 --> 00:06:54,669
Isn't it normal for teenagers to
seek experiences like this, P'Cake.

85
00:06:57,186 --> 00:06:59,812
So are you going or not?

86
00:06:59,812 --> 00:07:03,900
I'm not sure. Let me think about it first.

87
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,351
I'll going to bed now.

88
00:07:08,475 --> 00:07:11,173
If Tim wants to go, just leave a message.

89
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:12,248
OK

90
00:07:13,038 --> 00:07:18,759
Go go, I'll sleep now. Go.

91
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:21,214
Good Night, P.Cake.

92
00:07:21,214 --> 00:07:23,677
Good Night, Tim.

93
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:46,657
Hello, what's up?

94
00:07:46,657 --> 00:07:48,003
You're still not asleep?

95
00:07:48,678 --> 00:07:49,852
Yeah, I'm still not finished editing.

96
00:07:49,852 --> 00:07:50,926
Tomorrow is the first day of the semester.

97
00:07:50,926 --> 00:07:52,123
I know.

98
00:07:52,123 --> 00:07:53,568
So, are you going to be finished soon?

99
00:07:53,568 --> 00:07:55,708
With my skill, it'll be done it momentarily.

100
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:56,890
Yeah, I'm going to bed now.

101
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:59,292
You go to sleep first. See you tomorrow.

102
00:07:59,292 --> 00:07:59,994
See you.

103
00:07:59,994 --> 00:08:02,800
Bye bye bye.

104
00:08:14,967 --> 00:08:16,575
P'Gam.

105
00:08:17,045 --> 00:08:18,811
Where's Cake, Tim.

106
00:08:19,271 --> 00:08:23,084
P'Cake's coming
now. Let me call him.

107
00:08:24,217 --> 00:08:27,916
P'Cake, P'Gam is here now.

108
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:32,520
- I'm going down now, Tim. I'm on my way.
- Quickly, P'Cake.

109
00:08:36,926 --> 00:08:38,852
Have you been waiting long, P'Gam?

110
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:41,966
Why are you calling me 'P' (senior)?
I'm not accustomed to.

111
00:08:41,966 --> 00:08:46,644
Because from now on, P'Gam will be my senior..

112
00:08:46,644 --> 00:08:49,404
I should get accustomed to
calling you that, okay P'Gam?

113
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:52,842
Cake always exaggerates. And why
are you rubbing your face?

114
00:08:52,842 --> 00:08:54,789
Well, it's because I'm excited.

115
00:08:54,789 --> 00:08:57,506
It's the first day of university.
I don't know what it's going to be like.

116
00:08:58,482 --> 00:09:02,876
It should be fun. I think Cake will enjoy it
and meet a lot of new people.

117
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:05,089
Shall we go now?

118
00:09:05,089 --> 00:09:06,447
Yeah.

119
00:09:06,447 --> 00:09:08,914
Tim, I have to go.

120
00:09:08,914 --> 00:09:10,909
Oh, P'Cake, What about breakfast?

121
00:09:10,909 --> 00:09:11,622
Just eat it.

122
00:09:11,622 --> 00:09:12,966
So, Can Tim eat it all?

123
00:09:12,966 --> 00:09:13,804
Go on, Tim.

124
00:09:14,168 --> 00:09:16,219
Awesome, bro!

125
00:09:22,071 --> 00:09:25,521
Good morning, everyone.
Are you all wake up yet?

126
00:09:25,521 --> 00:09:28,601
Am I the only one who is active
and productive in the morning?

127
00:09:29,183 --> 00:09:32,017
Don't you guys feel excited at all?
It's the first day of the semester.

128
00:09:32,017 --> 00:09:33,863
You can't be late on the first day.

129
00:09:36,316 --> 00:09:42,120
Poon, why are you text so much? You woke me up!

130
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:46,165
Yeah, damn it, my phone
is vibrating like crazy.

131
00:09:46,165 --> 00:09:49,254
Dol, are you just waking up? I'm already out.

132
00:09:49,808 --> 00:09:53,269
The traffic is really bad. If you guys
don't leave soon, you'll definitely be late.

133
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:18,079
Ugh, Why are you guys chatting so much?

134
00:10:26,915 --> 00:10:30,305
Khing, which bag do you would
be appropriate for going to class?

135
00:10:30,305 --> 00:10:34,145
Any bag will do, Gina. You've borrowed
almost all the bags from my closet already.

136
00:10:34,145 --> 00:10:35,440
It's better to hurry up or we'll be late.

137
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,515
No way, Gina's every day
outfit has to be beautiful and high class.

138
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:43,400
To match the status of being
a close friend of Miss Khing.

139
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:47,536
Let me see.

140
00:10:49,207 --> 00:10:53,268
Do you look stunning today,
as befits of P'Kla future girlfriend?

141
00:10:54,324 --> 00:10:57,956
I'm not that great, really. Let's hurry up.

142
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,047
Follow me down later.

143
00:11:00,072 --> 00:11:02,280
Oh, Khing you already left?

144
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:05,744
You still haven't helped me choose
a bag. Which one should I carry?

145
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:30,203
Hello everyone. I'd like
to welcome all of you.

146
00:12:30,203 --> 00:12:33,524
Welcome to the first day of our
Faculty of Communication Arts.

147
00:12:33,524 --> 00:12:37,802
Your name tags have colors on
them. Please flip them over and look at.

148
00:12:40,227 --> 00:12:43,622
Find and team up with others who
have the same color on their name tags.

149
00:12:44,283 --> 00:12:45,555
Please gather into groups.

150
00:12:45,555 --> 00:12:48,916
Hurry up.

151
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:51,366
Pink here everyone.

152
00:12:51,366 --> 00:12:54,404
Whoever has the blue color,
please follow Gina. Blue color, please.

153
00:12:54,404 --> 00:12:57,156
Oh, Khing, you got blue?

154
00:12:57,156 --> 00:13:00,019
What color do you get?

155
00:13:00,019 --> 00:13:02,921
Are you pink? Anyone got pink?

156
00:13:02,921 --> 00:13:04,109
Anyone got pink?

157
00:13:04,109 --> 00:13:09,249
Who has the blue color, please
follow Gina. Blue Color here.

158
00:13:09,249 --> 00:13:11,236
What's your color?

159
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:14,223
Ok, I'm Poon.

160
00:13:15,683 --> 00:13:17,004
I'm Dol, I get pink too.

161
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:18,572
I'm Bee, also pink.

162
00:13:19,635 --> 00:13:21,025
I'm Kla.

163
00:13:21,603 --> 00:13:25,153
Earlier, the seniors were teaching
us to dance. Can we dance?

164
00:13:25,153 --> 00:13:27,331
I think we can manage. What about you guys?

165
00:13:27,331 --> 00:13:28,655
Just a little bit.

166
00:13:28,655 --> 00:13:30,000
How about you, Kla?

167
00:13:31,462 --> 00:13:35,493
Hmm, I'm not really good at dancing.

168
00:13:47,889 --> 00:13:49,836
Didn't you say you're not good at dancing?

169
00:13:49,836 --> 00:13:52,985
I'm not that good, but I'm trying.

170
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,143
How's it going?

171
00:13:57,143 --> 00:14:00,415
I can't keep up at all.

172
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,616
Time flies so fast. In a blink,
we'll be in our second year.

173
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:13,820
Everyone, this is Bee and Dol.

174
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,327
Hello.

175
00:14:15,327 --> 00:14:17,025
So, you're the latest one today.

176
00:14:17,485 --> 00:14:18,781
Sorry, Please don't record me.

177
00:14:18,781 --> 00:14:20,925
What's that about?

178
00:14:20,925 --> 00:14:23,571
See you all later. Bye!

179
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:26,646
Hey Bee, I told you I
wouldn't be the last one.

180
00:14:26,646 --> 00:14:29,560
Well, Poon seemed so confident about it.

181
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,638
I had to trust my friend, right?

182
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:35,399
You trusted the wrong person. Now buy me lunch.

183
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:39,024
If you guys keep arguing, we'll all be late.

184
00:14:39,024 --> 00:14:40,116
Right.

185
00:14:40,116 --> 00:14:41,959
For real, let's go to class.

186
00:14:41,959 --> 00:14:43,597
For real, let's go to class.

187
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,160
Let's go.

188
00:14:59,112 --> 00:15:02,312
Hey Cake, over here, over here! Come here!

189
00:15:07,412 --> 00:15:10,688
Everyone, this is P.Gam, my senior.

190
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:15,332
And these are Fah, Pao,
Pat, Jim, Cake's friends.

191
00:15:15,332 --> 00:15:17,385
Why call me 'P' (senior)?
I'm not accustomed to it.

192
00:15:17,385 --> 00:15:21,620
Well, you have to get accustomed
to it. You're our senior now.

193
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:25,149
It's the first day of the
semester. Good luck everyone!

194
00:15:25,149 --> 00:15:27,560
OK.

195
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:44,908
Jim, you're overdoing
it. Tone it down a bit.

196
00:15:44,908 --> 00:15:47,714
P.Poon, P.Gam's boyfriend
might come and shoot you.

197
00:15:47,714 --> 00:15:49,613
Poon is not my boyfriend, just a friend.

198
00:15:50,195 --> 00:15:51,580
They're just a 'shipped'
couple, that's all.

199
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:55,348
Poon is such a playboy. I
won't let Gam go to him. Right?

200
00:15:56,883 --> 00:16:00,000
See you this evening, Gam. Is Poon coming too?

201
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,776
Mmm.

202
00:16:00,776 --> 00:16:03,477
Okay, I'll pick you up in the evening.
Your class finish at 4 PM, right?

203
00:16:03,477 --> 00:16:07,349
Alright, I'll call you later. Bye bye.

204
00:16:07,349 --> 00:16:07,849
Bye bye.

205
00:16:07,849 --> 00:16:09,552
Goodbye.

206
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:11,709
Bye bye, Gam.

207
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:20,548
You're already vacant, really crush on him.

208
00:16:20,548 --> 00:16:22,915
Come on everyone, let's
go find our classroom.

209
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:26,160
Don't go to the wrong building.
Being late on the first day isn't cool.

210
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,594
Finishing class is authentic heaven.

211
00:16:35,594 --> 00:16:37,749
Authentic, authentic heaven.

212
00:16:37,749 --> 00:16:38,901
Hey, wait, where are you rushing to?

213
00:16:38,901 --> 00:16:40,610
Bee, walk carefully.
Do you have a photo shoot or something?

214
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,267
Did you make plans with Gam?

215
00:16:43,267 --> 00:16:46,196
Yeah, I'm taking him to
eat near the university.

216
00:16:47,118 --> 00:16:51,639
Hey, Gam are you a 'shipped'
couple or a real couple?

217
00:16:52,569 --> 00:16:58,024
Poon, don't talk about Gam too
much. Gina might get jealous, you know?

218
00:16:58,805 --> 00:17:02,086
Hey, stop teasing. I told
you we're just friends.

219
00:17:02,086 --> 00:17:04,598
Close friends, very close since childhood.

220
00:17:04,598 --> 00:17:05,862
Hmm, okay okay.

221
00:17:05,862 --> 00:17:09,832
I'm not talking to you guys
anymore. I'm leaving. See you.

222
00:17:09,832 --> 00:17:10,979
Where are you rushing to?

223
00:17:10,979 --> 00:17:11,749
I told you I'm going to see...

224
00:17:11,749 --> 00:17:14,226
Mom, Professor.

225
00:17:14,226 --> 00:17:16,414
Hello, hello.

226
00:17:16,414 --> 00:17:19,637
Wow, Krerkkai, you're amazing.

227
00:17:19,637 --> 00:17:22,866
Your communication skills
in performance are just...

228
00:17:22,866 --> 00:17:27,073
Smooth as flowing water.
Good. I like it. Keep improving.

229
00:17:27,073 --> 00:17:28,835
Thank you, Professor.

230
00:17:28,835 --> 00:17:31,211
Everything I've done is
because of your teaching.

231
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:35,886
Bullshit.

232
00:17:36,253 --> 00:17:39,473
The content I teach hasn't
even reached that level yet.

233
00:17:39,473 --> 00:17:41,269
Well, but if I were to teach you...

234
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:45,489
I guarantee you'd improve even more, you know?

235
00:17:45,489 --> 00:17:48,006
Oh, weren't you going to eat with your mom?
Yes.

236
00:17:48,006 --> 00:17:50,359
Then hurry up, your mom might be hungry.

237
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:55,423
Wait, wait, wait! I know what
you're up to. I'm following you.

238
00:17:55,423 --> 00:17:57,483
Thank you so much, Professor.

239
00:17:57,483 --> 00:18:00,745
Good Bye Professor.

240
00:18:00,745 --> 00:18:03,735
Hey Kla, want to grab some food with me?

241
00:18:04,698 --> 00:18:05,919
Yeah, you.

242
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:08,084
Today, my neighbor is here too.

243
00:18:08,084 --> 00:18:09,642
The one I told you about
before, they're coming along.

244
00:18:09,642 --> 00:18:10,996
I want you to get to know each other.

245
00:18:12,534 --> 00:18:16,071
Hmm, well... Oh, just a second.

246
00:18:17,159 --> 00:18:18,075
Hello, Mom.

247
00:18:18,075 --> 00:18:22,029
Kla, can you help make a
promotional image for the resort?

248
00:18:22,029 --> 00:18:23,851
I'm not at my computer right now.

249
00:18:23,851 --> 00:18:26,207
But can I do it for you later this evening?

250
00:18:26,971 --> 00:18:30,365
You're still not done with
classes? When do you finish, Kla?

251
00:18:30,365 --> 00:18:33,802
Actually, Mom wants it
sooner. Our resort right now.

252
00:18:33,802 --> 00:18:36,160
Get attention from a YouTube
channel that's filming here.

253
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,401
Yes, Mom. Okay, I'll hurry
go back and do it right now.

254
00:18:38,401 --> 00:18:40,689
Kla, you went without saying anything.

255
00:18:42,651 --> 00:18:44,947
It's okay, Gina. I guess Kla must be in a hurry.

256
00:18:44,947 --> 00:18:47,376
Let's head out then. I want to go back.

257
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:48,790
I don't want to go back yet.

258
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:53,590
Then we go shopping.
Let's go. Awesome!

259
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,912
Huh.

260
00:18:58,154 --> 00:18:59,292
And what about you and me?

261
00:18:59,292 --> 00:19:01,780
Well, we got abandoned.
What are we waiting for?

262
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:02,619
Let's go back.

263
00:19:02,619 --> 00:19:04,570
Seriously? Just go back.

264
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:05,891
What's going on?
Can you give me a piggyback ride?

265
00:19:05,891 --> 00:19:07,891
Hey, Bee.

266
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:17,159
Very hungry.

267
00:19:19,621 --> 00:19:22,833
Everyone, shall we go for hot pot?

268
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:25,382
Do you want it?
Let's go. Jim is ready, everyone.

269
00:19:25,382 --> 00:19:27,619
Oh, they say this
restaurant it's really great.

270
00:19:27,619 --> 00:19:31,938
Wow, Jim and Phao, you guys are more serious
about food than about studying earlier.

271
00:19:31,938 --> 00:19:32,708
Blah blah blah.

272
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:35,307
Pat, you don't want to go? You
can just hang out if you want.

273
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:37,884
I really want to go,
Fah. Really want to go.

274
00:19:37,884 --> 00:19:42,383
I read the reviews. They
say this place is really great.

275
00:19:42,383 --> 00:19:43,913
Then let's go.

276
00:19:43,913 --> 00:19:45,551
Is Cake coming along too?

277
00:19:47,909 --> 00:19:48,715
Cake.

278
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,611
Just a moment, Fah.

279
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,592
Hello, my name is Cake.

280
00:20:10,364 --> 00:20:13,448
Are you... AF?

281
00:20:19,696 --> 00:20:20,740
Are you talking to me?

282
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:23,278
Well, since you're the only one
here, of course, I to talk to you.

283
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,648
That's true.

284
00:20:26,648 --> 00:20:29,415
Mm, I'm AF.

285
00:20:30,825 --> 00:20:35,098
I've been seeing you alone the
whole time. Do you have a group yet?

286
00:20:37,122 --> 00:20:41,149
Oh, I see..

287
00:20:41,149 --> 00:20:42,593
I don't have any group yet.

288
00:20:43,848 --> 00:20:46,235
And I don't know anyone either.

289
00:20:46,731 --> 00:20:47,729
Then that's great.

290
00:20:48,254 --> 00:20:49,244
So...

291
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:51,926
Would you like to join our group?

292
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,840
Who's he?

293
00:21:10,288 --> 00:21:12,520
AF

294
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:15,520
AF

295
00:21:18,077 --> 00:21:19,725
Would you like to join our group?

296
00:21:21,356 --> 00:21:22,628
Me?

297
00:21:22,628 --> 00:21:23,773
Well, it's you.

298
00:21:25,364 --> 00:21:26,858
I can really stay with you all?

299
00:21:26,858 --> 00:21:28,520
Sure.

300
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:36,031
Let's go find our friends.

301
00:21:37,015 --> 00:21:37,801
OK.

302
00:21:42,177 --> 00:21:43,008
Let's go.

303
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:47,549
- Let me just pack up my things first.
- Ok.

304
00:21:47,549 --> 00:21:51,444
Watch your head.

305
00:21:51,444 --> 00:21:53,444
- Thank you.
- Let's go.

306
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:59,503
Hurry up and catch up, AF.
Here their are! They're here now!

307
00:21:59,503 --> 00:22:01,586
How did that guy in the
red plaid shirt get here?

308
00:22:01,586 --> 00:22:07,419
Everyone, this is AF, our new friend.

309
00:22:10,396 --> 00:22:12,829
This one?
Umm.

310
00:22:13,475 --> 00:22:15,892
AF might not know other
people, but we've noticed that...

311
00:22:15,892 --> 00:22:19,328
Our group is lively. Adding another
friend should make it more fun.

312
00:22:19,328 --> 00:22:22,476
Hi. AF. Hello.

313
00:22:22,476 --> 00:22:26,330
Pat, Fa, Jim, and Pao are our gang.

314
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:28,858
And from now on, they
will also be AF's friends.

315
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:35,033
He hasn't even consulted me yet. Oops.
Don't blame Cake.

316
00:22:36,123 --> 00:22:39,309
Uh, we're planning to go for hot pot.

317
00:22:39,309 --> 00:22:40,625
Come along too, AF.

318
00:22:41,397 --> 00:22:45,286
Yeah, having more friends
would be great. We can order more.

319
00:22:45,286 --> 00:22:47,076
You're just thinking about eating,

320
00:22:47,076 --> 00:22:48,436
Aren't you? Oh, or
do you not want to?

321
00:22:48,461 --> 00:22:49,069
I do.

322
00:22:49,199 --> 00:22:50,557
Let's go.

323
00:22:51,373 --> 00:22:52,194
Everyone

324
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:56,875
I think I can't go now.
Oh, why?

325
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:59,142
I had an appointment with
Gam that I forgot about.

326
00:22:59,142 --> 00:23:01,888
Oh, so you're not coming to eat
with us anymore? Next time then.

327
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:04,161
Anyway, please take care of AF, everyone.

328
00:23:04,161 --> 00:23:05,509
- Hello, Gam.
- Oh.

329
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:11,378
I'm on the way.
What should we do next?

330
00:23:11,378 --> 00:23:18,320
If you're going, then go. Are you
coming or not? If you are, then come along.

331
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,026
Gam, eat this. Here's another one.

332
00:23:39,295 --> 00:23:43,685
Poon, that's enough. Stop serving
others and start eating for yourself.

333
00:23:44,686 --> 00:23:48,062
Other people? This is a
legendary couple, you know.

334
00:23:48,062 --> 00:23:52,960
Doing this makes others think
that Gam already has a partner.

335
00:23:53,803 --> 00:23:56,108
How was your first day at university, Cake?

336
00:23:56,108 --> 00:23:57,704
So, how was it?

337
00:23:58,506 --> 00:23:59,944
Wow, I was so excited, Gam.

338
00:23:59,944 --> 00:24:03,299
It's so different from high
school. Friends are really nice too.

339
00:24:03,299 --> 00:24:08,644
The professors are nice, and
overall, everything is really great.

340
00:24:08,644 --> 00:24:13,664
You're just a freshy with wide-eyed
enthusiasm. Just keep going with your studies.

341
00:24:13,664 --> 00:24:16,889
Especially during your project
periods, everything will come pouring in.

342
00:24:16,889 --> 00:24:19,213
That teacher assigns this task,
and this teacher assigns that task.

343
00:24:19,213 --> 00:24:20,045
Boom!!

344
00:24:20,045 --> 00:24:21,846
Your head will be overwhelmed.

345
00:24:21,846 --> 00:24:25,141
Poon, you're overreacting.
Why are you scaring Cake?

346
00:24:25,141 --> 00:24:27,716
I'm serious. One of my friends,

347
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:29,035
At first, I invited him to
come for a meal with us.

348
00:24:29,035 --> 00:24:32,315
But as soon as the phone rang, he
ran off to finish his work immediately.

349
00:24:32,315 --> 00:24:36,086
There's so much work, he spending
all day cooped up in the room.

350
00:24:36,086 --> 00:24:38,788
These days, I should get a
sponsor for an eye cream for him to use.

351
00:24:38,788 --> 00:24:41,390
The dark circles under the
eyes are so noticeable. Hmm.

352
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:43,161
But a lot of girls still like him.

353
00:24:43,161 --> 00:24:47,932
But he doesn't really pay attention
to anyone, he just focuses on work.

354
00:24:47,932 --> 00:24:50,393
And you? How are
your friends at university?

355
00:24:50,393 --> 00:24:54,647
They're nice, but I wonder
that I'll be able to handle it or not.

356
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:04,334
You'll be fine. It's just the first year.

357
00:25:04,334 --> 00:25:06,558
Just try and keep studying.

358
00:25:26,827 --> 00:25:27,814
Are you done yet?

359
00:25:27,814 --> 00:25:31,200
Almost done.

360
00:25:33,016 --> 00:25:36,400
Are you done yet?
Almost done.

361
00:25:39,685 --> 00:25:43,865
It's taking so long, Kla.
Render now.

362
00:25:45,546 --> 00:25:47,275
Are you done yet? I'm sleepy.

363
00:25:49,149 --> 00:25:50,684
Currently exporting.

364
00:25:53,675 --> 00:25:54,745
Is it done yet?

365
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:58,137
Currently exporting.

366
00:25:58,137 --> 00:26:01,881
40 percent.
So long.

367
00:26:01,881 --> 00:26:05,607
50 percent.
There's a lot more.

368
00:26:05,607 --> 00:26:07,793
60 percent.

369
00:26:07,793 --> 00:26:11,399
98 percent.

370
00:26:13,567 --> 00:26:16,037
99 percent.

371
00:26:18,572 --> 00:26:21,049
100 percent. Done.

372
00:26:24,209 --> 00:26:26,214
I'm going to bed now, see
you later, friend. See you.

373
00:26:26,214 --> 00:26:29,449
See you.

374
00:26:29,449 --> 00:26:32,559
I was thinking of going for a
relaxing massage. Want to join, Khing?

375
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:34,164
I'll go with you.

376
00:26:34,164 --> 00:26:35,318
See you, friend.

377
00:26:35,318 --> 00:26:37,872
Let's go, hurry up!

378
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,360
I'm not going to drop you off, okay?

379
00:26:49,382 --> 00:26:51,335
("This new disease is so scary")

380
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,632
("I hope they dont come to Thailand , I'm scared")

381
00:26:53,787 --> 00:26:56,592
I like eating things crispy.

382
00:26:56,592 --> 00:26:58,234
Hey, don't forget to eat vegetables.

383
00:26:58,234 --> 00:26:59,555
Hey Jim, take some vegetables too.

384
00:26:59,555 --> 00:27:00,718
Whatever, I'm only going to eat pork.

385
00:27:00,718 --> 00:27:04,343
I'll eat the pork for you.

386
00:27:04,343 --> 00:27:09,804
Everyone, let's celebrate
that we've finished our exams.

387
00:27:09,804 --> 00:27:10,584
Ok.

388
00:27:10,584 --> 00:27:12,310
Come on 1 2 3

389
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:14,252
yeah!!!

390
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:21,197
Hey, finally the finals
are over. I almost died.

391
00:27:21,197 --> 00:27:23,240
Yeah, it took forever to finish the exams.

392
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:27,159
I don't know where my soul
went. Come back please.

393
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:29,545
Don't be stressed out yet, everyone.

394
00:27:29,545 --> 00:27:31,591
Let's wait for the exam results to
come out before we start stressing.

395
00:27:31,591 --> 00:27:34,786
Oh, it was almost good already.

396
00:27:37,395 --> 00:27:40,758
Cake, I'll grill this piece for you.

397
00:27:40,758 --> 00:27:44,928
Nevermind, AF. I
think I'll grill it myself.

398
00:27:47,871 --> 00:27:49,796
Actually, I read the news.

399
00:27:49,796 --> 00:27:51,809
They say that during
this period, we should eat

400
00:27:51,833 --> 00:27:54,111
hot food, use serving
utensils, and wash our hands.

401
00:27:56,475 --> 00:27:57,443
That's true.

402
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:03,501
By the way, I haven't seen
P'Gam stick close to Cake at all.

403
00:28:03,501 --> 00:28:05,020
P'Gam not done with exams yet?

404
00:28:06,678 --> 00:28:08,366
Lately I've seen Gam looking busy.

405
00:28:09,483 --> 00:28:12,685
Because he has a lot of photo shoots with Poon.

406
00:28:16,746 --> 00:28:20,869
We're close to New Year's, Cake.
Do you have plans to travel anywhere?

407
00:28:21,834 --> 00:28:24,228
Our family is planning to go to Phuket.

408
00:28:24,228 --> 00:28:28,474
But from what I see of the situation,
I'm not sure if we'll be able to go.

409
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,559
Let's just eat hot pot instead.

410
00:28:36,163 --> 00:28:40,644
Hey, is this Cake's water?

411
00:28:40,644 --> 00:28:42,743
Here Cake, it's water.

412
00:28:53,176 --> 00:28:55,940
What do you think, is this
collection pretty?

413
00:28:55,965 --> 00:28:57,880
Just came out of the shop.
What's wrong with you?

414
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,080
I really hope you're addicted.

415
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:02,520
Someone is coughing. Hey, isn't that right?

416
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:08,809
Are you sure Bee?
I'm not addicted.

417
00:29:08,809 --> 00:29:11,865
Hey guys, where are you going for New Year's?

418
00:29:11,865 --> 00:29:13,629
I'm going to Chiang Mai with my babe.

419
00:29:13,629 --> 00:29:15,737
I'm going to Krabi with my high school friends.

420
00:29:15,737 --> 00:29:19,313
What about you?
I'll probably stay in the room with Gam.

421
00:29:19,313 --> 00:29:22,198
Probably won't go back home
where there are a lot of elderly people.

422
00:29:22,828 --> 00:29:26,662
As for Gina, I have a shopping
trip to Hong Kong with Khing.

423
00:29:26,662 --> 00:29:30,500
But it looks like there's
news of an epidemic now.

424
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:34,043
So the trip was cancelled. We can't go anymore.

425
00:29:36,641 --> 00:29:39,155
What about Kla, what are you doing?

426
00:29:40,148 --> 00:29:44,570
I'll probably go back home in Phuket.
I have to help out at the family's resort.

427
00:29:45,469 --> 00:29:48,427
Oh, Kla's home is in Phuket?

428
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:52,160
I'd like to visit Kla's home.

429
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,966
I've never been to Phuket.
Are there a lot of tourists there?

430
00:29:55,914 --> 00:29:58,484
Okay then, let's go visit Kla's house someday.

431
00:29:58,484 --> 00:30:00,766
My house doesn't welcome you.

432
00:30:01,594 --> 00:30:04,081
Why? Then you don't have
to come to my room anymore.

433
00:30:04,081 --> 00:30:06,735
Why are you fighting each other?

434
00:30:08,023 --> 00:30:10,909
But if I don't go to your room, that's good.
You won't have to invite me to livestream.

435
00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:12,482
I won't have to waste my
time live streaming with you.

436
00:30:14,242 --> 00:30:17,288
Gam, look at Kla. He's being annoying.

437
00:30:18,586 --> 00:30:21,252
You guys always like to fight each other.
It's funny.

438
00:30:21,252 --> 00:30:23,086
Stop fighting now.

439
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,252
Whose cake is this, Gina?

440
00:30:38,516 --> 00:30:41,034
I bought a butter cake.

441
00:30:41,034 --> 00:30:42,784
But I've already changed it to a new box for you.

442
00:30:44,633 --> 00:30:47,070
Why did you buy a lot?

443
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:51,918
Oh Khing, you're always innocent like this.
When are you going to successfully get with Kla?

444
00:30:54,039 --> 00:30:55,987
You should give this cake to Kla.

445
00:30:55,987 --> 00:30:58,256
And tell him you made it yourself.

446
00:30:58,256 --> 00:31:02,331
Water dripping on stone will
eventually make an impression.

447
00:31:07,352 --> 00:31:09,328
I'm afraid the stone might scold back.

448
00:31:10,977 --> 00:31:14,960
I think it's too intentional.
Let's not do that.

449
00:31:20,786 --> 00:31:23,614
Khing, don't be afraid.

450
00:31:23,614 --> 00:31:28,016
You take this cake to your friends
and say you made it yourself.

451
00:31:28,016 --> 00:31:34,320
But this piece, you have
to give it to Kla yourself.

452
00:31:39,685 --> 00:31:41,943
I don't dare.

453
00:31:45,977 --> 00:31:48,960
Khing, listen to me.

454
00:31:50,772 --> 00:31:54,639
If you keep being afraid like this,
you'll never successfully get with Kla.

455
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:57,936
Come on,

456
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,542
Take this cake to Kla.

457
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:03,353
So, Kla will finally know
that you have crush on him.

458
00:32:03,378 --> 00:32:06,025
Trust me, just try.

459
00:32:09,173 --> 00:32:12,766
I'll take the bottom box. And
you take the top box to Kla.

460
00:32:12,766 --> 00:32:15,256
Follow me.

461
00:32:15,256 --> 00:32:17,123
Hey Dol, my phone.

462
00:32:19,328 --> 00:32:21,072
May I borrow?

463
00:32:22,279 --> 00:32:26,739
Everyone, Khing made a cake for us.

464
00:32:26,739 --> 00:32:33,050
Cake cake cake cake!

465
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:36,903
The cake looks so delicious,
Khing. Can we eat it now?

466
00:32:38,768 --> 00:32:41,645
Hey, thank your friend first.

467
00:32:41,645 --> 00:32:44,010
Thank you Khing.
Thank you Khing.

468
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:46,410
It looks so delicious.
Share some with me.

469
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:50,004
That's cool, Khing. You can make
cakes too. Gam, come eat with us.

470
00:32:50,004 --> 00:32:51,323
Go ahead, I'm full already.

471
00:32:51,323 --> 00:32:53,841
It's very delicious. Khing
is both talented and kind.

472
00:32:53,841 --> 00:32:55,534
Yes, so yummy.

473
00:32:55,534 --> 00:32:56,813
As for Kla,

474
00:32:57,870 --> 00:32:59,233
He's probably not eating.

475
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:16,060
It's delicious, Gina guarantees.

476
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:24,600
Well, I made this one specially for Kla.

477
00:33:27,936 --> 00:33:30,279
Thank you, Khing.

478
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:37,760
But I don't eat dessert.

479
00:33:46,948 --> 00:33:50,799
Khing, can we taste it then?

480
00:33:55,286 --> 00:33:57,391
Didn't you just say you don't eat dessert?

481
00:33:57,391 --> 00:34:00,200
Well, it looks so delicious.

482
00:34:07,339 --> 00:34:09,489
It's very delicious, Khing.

483
00:34:25,631 --> 00:34:27,370
Today's epidemic situation.

484
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:29,322
The number of daily infected
cases is continuously rising.

485
00:34:29,322 --> 00:34:31,804
Due to the severity of the
virus and its rapid spread,

486
00:34:33,248 --> 00:34:35,270
the government asks for
cooperation during this new year.

487
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:37,645
For people to refrain from
traveling to entertainment venues.

488
00:34:37,645 --> 00:34:39,011
Or leaving the city.

489
00:34:39,011 --> 00:34:42,002
Wear a mask at all times
while in public places.

490
00:34:42,002 --> 00:34:45,264
For educational institutions
like universities or schools,

491
00:34:45,264 --> 00:34:48,467
It is expected that these places may be
closed to reduce the spread of the virus.

492
00:34:48,467 --> 00:34:50,601
Stay tuned for the
situation with me,

493
00:34:50,601 --> 00:34:53,904
Benchakorn Toongsooksai.
And today I'll say goodbye for now.

494
00:34:53,904 --> 00:34:57,728
See you again with Fire
News, hot news for every event.

495
00:35:04,505 --> 00:35:05,291
Hello mom.

496
00:35:05,291 --> 00:35:06,888
Have you seen the news yet?

497
00:35:07,513 --> 00:35:08,850
Will you come back to Phuket?

498
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:11,342
If Poon and Gam don't go back,
I probably won't go back either.

499
00:35:11,342 --> 00:35:14,002
What did the university say?

500
00:35:14,002 --> 00:35:16,514
The university hasn't ordered a closure yet.

501
00:35:17,623 --> 00:35:20,434
And another thing, if
the situation gets worse,

502
00:35:20,434 --> 00:35:22,679
I don't want to risk bringing
the disease to people at home.

503
00:35:23,771 --> 00:35:27,458
During this time, the
resort is unusually quiet, Kla.

504
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:31,292
Yes Mom. Don't worry.

505
00:35:31,292 --> 00:35:34,599
I'll help out too. I'll try
to create a promotion

506
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:37,496
to attract more people
to stay at our resort.

507
00:35:38,721 --> 00:35:42,000
Take care of yourself, Kla.

508
00:35:42,858 --> 00:35:47,219
Yes, Dad and Mom take care too.

509
00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:06,907
If the university closes, I won't be
able to go to class anymore, right?

510
00:36:06,907 --> 00:36:10,273
I thinks we should wait for the
official announcement first, son.

511
00:36:10,273 --> 00:36:14,746
What about our trip to Phuket?

512
00:36:16,114 --> 00:36:19,294
Dad thinks we should
celebrate at home this year.

513
00:36:19,294 --> 00:36:22,972
Let's wait and see the
situation. Don't take any risks.

514
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:22,999
Okay, everything's ready.
Gam, let's do half body shot.

515
00:37:23,024 --> 00:37:24,090
Alright.
I'm not wearing pants.

516
00:37:26,568 --> 00:37:27,152
Ok, can you see?

517
00:37:27,152 --> 00:37:27,652
Okay,

518
00:37:28,852 --> 00:37:30,579
1 2 3

519
00:37:31,241 --> 00:37:32,999
1 2 3

520
00:37:33,439 --> 00:37:34,791
Try to hide your smile.

521
00:37:35,075 --> 00:37:37,954
(STAY HOME
#STOPTHESPREADFORTHENATION.)

522
00:37:38,458 --> 00:37:39,239
Move to the right a little.

523
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:40,600
Center, hold it in the center.

524
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,239
Okay.

525
00:37:41,522 --> 00:37:42,022
Is it good?

526
00:37:42,022 --> 00:37:42,846
1 2 Okay.

527
00:37:42,846 --> 00:37:43,695
Hey, do a horizontal shot too.

528
00:37:43,695 --> 00:37:44,584
Hmm

529
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:50,830
1 2 3.

530
00:37:52,358 --> 00:37:54,358
Okay, is that good enough?

531
00:38:02,606 --> 00:38:03,987
OK, go ahead.

532
00:38:03,987 --> 00:38:05,799
I'll touch it up a bit and then I'll post it.

533
00:38:07,067 --> 00:38:09,067
You look so handsome, do you need to touch it up?

534
00:38:10,286 --> 00:38:12,029
It's rare for me to receive compliments.

535
00:38:13,232 --> 00:38:17,599
I'll post it now. Use this photo, okay?

536
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:18,370
Okay?

537
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:20,262
Go ahead with this photo.

538
00:38:21,364 --> 00:38:22,105
Is it okay?

539
00:38:22,105 --> 00:38:24,119
This one is the most handsome.

540
00:38:25,001 --> 00:38:27,001
Go for it.

541
00:38:35,407 --> 00:38:39,044
Hashtag stop the spread for the nation.

542
00:39:11,286 --> 00:39:15,059
(Stay home ##STOPTHESPREADFORTHENATION If
you are lonely you can watch my livestream )

543
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,190
Are you coming down already, P'Cake?

544
00:39:27,906 --> 00:39:29,870
Usually I see you lying in your room all day.

545
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,842
I just came down to find something to eat, Tim.

546
00:39:33,346 --> 00:39:34,527
I'll go back to my room soon.

547
00:39:35,377 --> 00:39:36,582
Be careful.

548
00:39:36,802 --> 00:39:39,770
One day you'll get a big lecture
from Dad for sure, P'Cake.

549
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:49,097
Speaking of Dad, here he comes right away.

550
00:39:49,097 --> 00:39:50,948
He must miss P'Cake.

551
00:39:53,592 --> 00:39:56,091
Hello Mom. Hello Dad.
Hello Mom. Hello Dad.

552
00:40:01,691 --> 00:40:03,315
Hmm,

553
00:40:04,417 --> 00:40:06,540
what food is this? It smells so good, Mom.

554
00:40:07,193 --> 00:40:10,016
Instead of asking if Dad and Mom are tired,

555
00:40:10,244 --> 00:40:12,024
You only ask about food.

556
00:40:13,567 --> 00:40:16,259
Cake is hugging Mom to
make her feel less tired, right?

557
00:40:16,542 --> 00:40:17,999
Yes.

558
00:40:19,353 --> 00:40:21,337
Oh, by the way, are you
having online classes?

559
00:40:21,526 --> 00:40:22,439
Yes, we are.
Yes, we are.

560
00:40:23,352 --> 00:40:24,414
Great

561
00:40:24,414 --> 00:40:26,987
then let's go prepare to eat.

562
00:40:27,302 --> 00:40:28,457
Tim, go set the table.

563
00:40:28,457 --> 00:40:29,245
Sure, Dad.

564
00:40:29,245 --> 00:40:30,626
I'm hungry, Mom.

565
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:36,409
Have you eaten yet, P.Poon?

566
00:40:36,913 --> 00:40:39,070
I've already eaten. I'm very full. What is everyone eating?

567
00:40:41,589 --> 00:40:43,384
Whose arm is next to you?

568
00:40:43,793 --> 00:40:44,570
Ahh.

569
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:45,816
Who is it?

570
00:40:45,816 --> 00:40:48,224
Gam, say hi to my fans.

571
00:40:48,539 --> 00:40:50,141
Hello everyone.,

572
00:40:50,166 --> 00:40:51,291
This is Gam.

573
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,537
Aren't you going home, Poon?

574
00:40:56,332 --> 00:40:59,009
Hey Cake. Yeah, I'm not going back.

575
00:40:59,292 --> 00:41:01,985
But why don't you call me 'P', Cake?

576
00:41:05,103 --> 00:41:06,574
I'm used to calling you like this.

577
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:10,273
Besides, Poon doesn't look
like an older brother at all.

578
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:14,698
Wow Cake, remember this. You're gonna get it.

579
00:41:15,642 --> 00:41:17,258
You're saying I look young, right? I know.

580
00:41:17,384 --> 00:41:19,998
Everyone, these two have
been fighting since they were kids,

581
00:41:19,998 --> 00:41:21,256
but they actually love each other a lot.

582
00:41:21,256 --> 00:41:24,546
Yes, Cake has been my
close friend since we were kids.

583
00:41:24,546 --> 00:41:27,195
Or you could call him
the tiny kid next door.

584
00:41:30,692 --> 00:41:32,550
Gam, see you in the game later.

585
00:41:32,889 --> 00:41:33,578
We're going now.

586
00:41:34,036 --> 00:41:35,575
Oh, See you, see you.

587
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:37,580
Everyone.

588
00:41:38,178 --> 00:41:39,968
Gam is going to leave me to play games again.

589
00:41:39,968 --> 00:41:41,968
He never wants to pay attention to me.

590
00:41:43,156 --> 00:41:44,534
Don't complain.

591
00:41:54,253 --> 00:41:54,753
So annoying.

592
00:41:55,257 --> 00:41:58,836
Hey Kla, if you want to eat
longan, go buy it yourself.

593
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,024
What kind of person is P.Gam?

594
00:42:01,653 --> 00:42:03,275
P.Gam?

595
00:42:03,527 --> 00:42:05,363
What kind of me? Come on, tell the viewers.

596
00:42:05,363 --> 00:42:05,863
I'm a good person.

597
00:42:07,752 --> 00:42:09,620
Gam is a lovely person.

598
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:11,296
He always takes care of me.

599
00:42:11,296 --> 00:42:13,989
And after this, we'll invite
her to live stream with us often.

600
00:42:14,461 --> 00:42:15,328
If anyone likes it,

601
00:42:15,328 --> 00:42:16,965
press +1.

602
00:42:22,999 --> 00:42:24,595
P'Kla, dear friend.

603
00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:26,768
What do you want? What do you want?
Huh? Why are you here?

604
00:42:26,768 --> 00:42:31,161
We have something we'd like P'Kla to help with.

605
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:35,127
I thought so.

606
00:42:37,897 --> 00:42:39,510
You tell him.
You tell him.

607
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:41,483
You tell him. You tell him. You're
the one who found the job, you tell him.

608
00:42:41,483 --> 00:42:44,148
You tell him.
You tell him.

609
00:42:45,458 --> 00:42:48,199
You tell him.
You tell him.

610
00:42:48,199 --> 00:42:49,655
You're the one who
accepted the job. Go tell him.

611
00:42:49,655 --> 00:42:50,742
You tell him.

612
00:42:50,931 --> 00:42:52,999
What's up with you two?

613
00:42:53,244 --> 00:42:55,622
Well, Bee has something to tell P'Kla.

614
00:42:57,259 --> 00:42:58,598
What is it?

615
00:42:58,944 --> 00:43:00,944
Okay, P.Kla.

616
00:43:01,259 --> 00:43:02,674
We...

617
00:43:02,999 --> 00:43:05,188
accepted a video editing job.

618
00:43:05,629 --> 00:43:07,283
So we were wondering if P'Kla

619
00:43:07,566 --> 00:43:09,409
could help with the editing.

620
00:43:09,409 --> 00:43:12,039
The two of us are overwhelmed.

621
00:43:12,039 --> 00:43:12,999
Yes.

622
00:43:12,999 --> 00:43:14,999
Honestly, the two of us

623
00:43:15,199 --> 00:43:17,892
don't want P'Kla to be tired
even a little bit. Even a little bit.

624
00:43:18,427 --> 00:43:19,749
For sure.
Yes.

625
00:43:19,749 --> 00:43:22,788
And we would like to share small amount
of money for snacks to P'Kla.

626
00:43:22,788 --> 00:43:25,008
In case P'Kla wants to use
the money to buy some snacks.

627
00:43:26,016 --> 00:43:28,016
Assignments at
university are already a lot..

628
00:43:28,835 --> 00:43:31,213
What if you fail a subject?
What should you do?

629
00:43:38,222 --> 00:43:41,078
And what do you want me to do about it?

630
00:43:41,301 --> 00:43:44,665
Yeah! Thank you so much P'Kla
Yeah! Thank you so much.

631
00:43:44,917 --> 00:43:46,270
Don't drag things out.

632
00:43:46,270 --> 00:43:48,130
I might just change my mind.

633
00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:48,951
So.

634
00:43:49,266 --> 00:43:51,233
It's just an easy
editing job, really simple.

635
00:43:51,233 --> 00:43:53,233
As easy as pie.

636
00:43:53,233 --> 00:43:55,233
Everything is easy for you.

637
00:43:56,519 --> 00:43:58,110
So, what exactly do I need to do?

638
00:43:58,110 --> 00:44:01,463
You need to go talk to the
client first at the usual café.

639
00:44:01,463 --> 00:44:02,999
I've scheduled the client there.

640
00:44:03,314 --> 00:44:04,181
Yes.

641
00:44:04,811 --> 00:44:05,741
Yes.

642
00:44:08,071 --> 00:44:09,315
Ok Tomorrow.

643
00:44:12,022 --> 00:44:13,581
And you guys better to not be late.

644
00:44:13,581 --> 00:44:15,079
Sure.

645
00:44:15,079 --> 00:44:15,883
We won't stay up late tonight, right?

646
00:44:15,883 --> 00:44:16,477
Yes.

647
00:44:16,477 --> 00:44:17,973
Wait.

648
00:44:18,445 --> 00:44:19,941
What do you mean 'not staying up late'?
Where are you going?

649
00:44:20,161 --> 00:44:22,161
Well, Bee invited me to hang out.

650
00:44:23,767 --> 00:44:25,452
He's the one who invited me.

651
00:44:25,452 --> 00:44:26,854
It's you.
It's you.

652
00:44:26,854 --> 00:44:29,074
You two are supposed to stay at home.

653
00:44:30,554 --> 00:44:31,767
Once in a while.

654
00:44:33,876 --> 00:44:35,152
Where?

655
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:50,959
I'm with Dol Game Over.
Please take care of this for us.

656
00:44:51,652 --> 00:44:54,030
What the hell is this shit?

657
00:45:16,096 --> 00:45:18,363
Hello, is this Mr.Bee's Team?

658
00:45:19,182 --> 00:45:20,836
Yes, Hello.

659
00:45:23,001 --> 00:45:23,710
Boss?

660
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:24,721
Hey,

661
00:45:25,327 --> 00:45:25,827
Kla.

662
00:45:27,173 --> 00:45:28,142
Is that Kla?

663
00:45:29,181 --> 00:45:31,811
Are you Bee's client?

664
00:45:32,347 --> 00:45:34,819
Yeah, that's right. What a small world!

665
00:45:36,770 --> 00:45:37,778
Hey,

666
00:45:38,313 --> 00:45:39,809
How are you doing?

667
00:45:41,225 --> 00:45:42,129
Well.

668
00:45:43,385 --> 00:45:44,627
Fine. I'm doing well.

669
00:45:44,627 --> 00:45:45,869
How about you?

670
00:45:46,152 --> 00:45:47,208
I'm fine.

671
00:45:50,947 --> 00:45:52,008
And Where's Mr.Bee and Mr. Dol?

672
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:58,057
Damn,

673
00:45:58,782 --> 00:46:00,282
they're caught up with urgent business.

674
00:46:03,997 --> 00:46:06,469
But you can just brief me,
and I'll handle the briefing myself.

675
00:46:08,987 --> 00:46:09,978
Okay.

676
00:46:10,261 --> 00:46:13,694
So my job will be editing a short film clip.

677
00:46:13,719 --> 00:46:14,995
To be annouce to an online platform.

678
00:46:15,348 --> 00:46:19,145
I usually do it myself, but I'm
really swamped with work right now.

679
00:46:19,145 --> 00:46:21,208
So I want to find someone
professional at editing to help out.

680
00:46:22,173 --> 00:46:24,016
I've previously been in touch
with Mr. Bee and Mr. Dol about work.

681
00:46:24,268 --> 00:46:25,996
So those two pulled you in to help.

682
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:27,392
Wait a minute,

683
00:46:27,417 --> 00:46:28,607
First of all.

684
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:30,335
Stop calling those two 'Mr.'

685
00:46:30,414 --> 00:46:31,668
I'm getting goosebumps.

686
00:46:32,267 --> 00:46:34,267
Yeah, I get it now.

687
00:46:35,337 --> 00:46:36,581
But when it's you doing the editing.

688
00:46:37,274 --> 00:46:38,455
I think I'll be more at ease.

689
00:46:40,942 --> 00:46:41,442
Alright,

690
00:46:42,324 --> 00:46:43,824
just let me know the details then.

691
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:45,619
Well.

692
00:46:45,619 --> 00:46:46,911
It's pretty simple,

693
00:46:46,911 --> 00:46:48,189
Just try editing it in
your own style first.

694
00:46:48,909 --> 00:46:50,121
But I want it to have something like,

695
00:46:50,192 --> 00:46:51,381
new and fresh.

696
00:46:55,820 --> 00:46:56,917
I'll think about it and get back to you.

697
00:46:57,772 --> 00:46:58,420
So.

698
00:46:59,499 --> 00:47:01,006
I'll need the details to get started.

699
00:47:03,069 --> 00:47:03,999
Here it is.

700
00:47:04,086 --> 00:47:05,215
This is the work that...

701
00:47:05,923 --> 00:47:07,171
Mr.Bee and Mr.Dol have done.

702
00:47:07,809 --> 00:47:08,720
Do you want to

703
00:47:08,995 --> 00:47:10,322
add more edits or

704
00:47:10,747 --> 00:47:11,872
just try adjusting it.

705
00:47:11,897 --> 00:47:12,906
Go with your own style.

706
00:47:14,264 --> 00:47:15,792
"Is this the work of Bee?

707
00:47:15,981 --> 00:47:16,588
Yes.

708
00:47:17,059 --> 00:47:18,942
Can I redo it? I don't want to make changes.

709
00:47:19,131 --> 00:47:19,879
No.

710
00:47:19,879 --> 00:47:21,713
The original is good. Try it out first.

711
00:47:21,713 --> 00:47:23,335
It's just a few changes.

712
00:47:23,335 --> 00:47:25,200
Is that good? How did
they even send it to you?

713
00:47:26,957 --> 00:47:29,357
It should have something like.

714
00:47:29,357 --> 00:47:31,892
Two characters, two different
personalities, something like that.

715
00:47:41,998 --> 00:47:44,231
But I think adding a few tweaks
here and there would be good.

716
00:47:44,231 --> 00:47:46,955
Just do it in your own
style, something simple.

717
00:48:03,232 --> 00:48:04,158
Hey, Kla,

718
00:48:04,599 --> 00:48:06,855
last night I watched a movie.

719
00:48:07,422 --> 00:48:08,360
Seriously, it was so much fun,

720
00:48:08,958 --> 00:48:10,335
I really like it.

721
00:48:10,335 --> 00:48:11,148
I got so into it,

722
00:48:11,959 --> 00:48:14,027
and when I watched the ending, I was like.

723
00:48:14,027 --> 00:48:16,216
Hey, no spoilers!

724
00:48:16,216 --> 00:48:17,439
Let me watch it myself.

725
00:48:18,258 --> 00:48:19,035
Where is it?

726
00:48:21,954 --> 00:48:25,474
Different worlds altogether.
Between lonely and alone

727
00:48:29,212 --> 00:48:29,712
Well.

728
00:48:30,562 --> 00:48:34,234
Hey, do you think there will be a movie
where the heroine doesn't like the hero?

729
00:48:35,273 --> 00:48:36,217
There aren't any.

730
00:48:36,563 --> 00:48:37,619
It's a romance movie.

731
00:48:38,122 --> 00:48:39,292
True love,

732
00:48:39,317 --> 00:48:40,999
no matter what, must lose to proximity anyway, right?

733
00:48:41,431 --> 00:48:42,770
Being this close.

734
00:48:43,445 --> 00:48:45,445
Anyway, there has to be some
kind of emotional stir, right?

735
00:48:49,491 --> 00:48:50,547
Are you really feeling emotional?

736
00:48:51,663 --> 00:48:52,478
Yeah,

737
00:48:52,999 --> 00:48:54,184
if it were me, I'd be emotional too.

738
00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:01,312
Hey, have you watched it already?

739
00:49:01,564 --> 00:49:02,431
Not yet.

740
00:49:03,817 --> 00:49:04,501
Oh.

741
00:49:04,847 --> 00:49:06,282
By the way, I downloaded
the editing program too.

742
00:49:06,881 --> 00:49:08,105
This is the latest version, you know.

743
00:49:08,985 --> 00:49:09,730
Check it out.

744
00:49:10,848 --> 00:49:11,423
Hey,

745
00:49:12,068 --> 00:49:13,261
this version is really good.

746
00:49:13,261 --> 00:49:14,462
Yeah, it can do this too.

747
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:15,486
See.

748
00:49:22,999 --> 00:49:24,842
Hey, I think it's pretty good.

749
00:49:25,881 --> 00:49:27,031
But..

750
00:49:27,692 --> 00:49:29,188
What if you try adding dissolve here?

751
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:32,290
Yeah, I think I'll just
add a bit here and then...

752
00:49:32,542 --> 00:49:33,283
That's it.

753
00:49:33,308 --> 00:49:35,654
Yeah, I think we should just cut
out the ending and let it collide.

754
00:49:36,046 --> 00:49:36,924
Yeah,

755
00:49:36,949 --> 00:49:38,236
it should be a bit more concise.

756
00:49:38,650 --> 00:49:40,023
But this part needs to be emphasized.

757
00:49:41,804 --> 00:49:42,576
Got it.

758
00:49:42,850 --> 00:49:44,850
You must try.

759
00:49:45,534 --> 00:49:46,841
Alright, I'll give it a try.

760
00:49:47,313 --> 00:49:48,778
Okay, I'll go use the toilet first.

761
00:49:48,778 --> 00:49:49,582
I'll come and check it out.

762
00:49:49,582 --> 00:49:50,197
All right.

763
00:50:07,910 --> 00:50:08,608
Boss.

764
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:10,302
Hmm?

765
00:50:10,995 --> 00:50:12,297
I have something to tell you.

766
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:16,434
What is it, Amp?

767
00:50:19,065 --> 00:50:20,412
But Boss, please don't tell Kla.

768
00:50:25,670 --> 00:50:26,359
Umm.

769
00:50:26,863 --> 00:50:27,583
I

770
00:50:28,370 --> 00:50:29,457
I think.

771
00:50:32,779 --> 00:50:33,749
I like...

772
00:50:43,887 --> 00:50:45,137
I like Kla.

773
00:51:03,580 --> 00:51:04,541
P'Kla.

774
00:51:07,131 --> 00:51:07,883
Sorry.

775
00:51:08,804 --> 00:51:09,989
I don't eat dessert.

776
00:51:13,648 --> 00:51:14,613
Thank you.

777
00:51:15,794 --> 00:51:16,873
That's Kla's favorite.

778
00:51:17,250 --> 00:51:18,299
But lately, he's watching his weight.

779
00:51:18,803 --> 00:51:19,754
I'll eat it for him.

780
00:51:26,302 --> 00:51:27,284
When people give you something,

781
00:51:27,914 --> 00:51:29,011
you should learn to accept it too.

782
00:51:29,704 --> 00:51:31,022
Think about others feelings.

783
00:51:31,229 --> 00:51:32,114
Damm.

784
00:51:32,319 --> 00:51:33,793
When will you stop
accepting things on my behalf?

785
00:51:37,722 --> 00:51:38,568
The reason I don't accept things is

786
00:51:38,999 --> 00:51:40,153
because I have my own reasons.

787
00:51:40,531 --> 00:51:41,838
What's the reason?

788
00:51:47,788 --> 00:51:48,707
Kla.

789
00:51:52,044 --> 00:51:52,999
Amp.

790
00:51:54,048 --> 00:51:54,938
I know

791
00:51:55,565 --> 00:51:57,733
that we've been friends for a long time.

792
00:51:58,408 --> 00:51:59,428
So.

793
00:51:59,847 --> 00:52:00,977
And that

794
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:03,766
you've always taken good care of me.

795
00:52:05,253 --> 00:52:05,910
But.

796
00:52:07,254 --> 00:52:08,163
I think

797
00:52:10,169 --> 00:52:12,019
maybe we

798
00:52:12,672 --> 00:52:14,420
should consider taking our
relationship to the next level.

799
00:52:24,689 --> 00:52:26,279
I'm sorry, Amp.

800
00:52:26,908 --> 00:52:28,562
I can't accept that.

801
00:52:32,036 --> 00:52:34,036
We're already great as a group of three.

802
00:52:39,482 --> 00:52:41,639
I just don't want to lose my friend, Amp.

803
00:52:47,117 --> 00:52:48,199
Hey, Kla,

804
00:52:48,199 --> 00:52:49,549
maybe you should think
about it more carefully.

805
00:52:50,162 --> 00:52:51,967
Amp has liked you for a long time.

806
00:52:52,282 --> 00:52:54,282
Is it really fair to reject her like this?

807
00:52:54,628 --> 00:52:56,030
I don't like Amp.

808
00:52:57,543 --> 00:52:59,319
And I've never thought of
her as more than a friend.

809
00:53:00,413 --> 00:53:02,161
Why do you have to make others feel hurt?

810
00:53:03,156 --> 00:53:04,065
Why?

811
00:53:04,475 --> 00:53:06,479
Why? And why are you so worked up about it?

812
00:53:07,266 --> 00:53:08,510
Because I like Amp.

813
00:53:09,171 --> 00:53:10,541
I've liked her for years.

814
00:53:10,541 --> 00:53:11,880
But she happens to like you.

815
00:53:14,199 --> 00:53:16,667
I don't care how much you hurt others.

816
00:53:16,824 --> 00:53:18,257
But it shouldn't be Amp.

817
00:53:22,719 --> 00:53:23,733
Do you really like Amp?

818
00:53:24,258 --> 00:53:28,714
Yeah. And it's not that
hard to just accept a gift.

819
00:53:29,373 --> 00:53:30,672
You wouldn't understand.

820
00:53:31,042 --> 00:53:32,215
I don't accept these things

821
00:53:34,108 --> 00:53:36,108
because I don't want to give anyone false hope.

822
00:53:37,133 --> 00:53:39,605
Why are you going to hurt other
people's feelings, huh? Hey, Kla.

823
00:53:40,052 --> 00:53:41,170
Kla.

824
00:53:41,886 --> 00:53:42,961
Boss.

825
00:53:58,080 --> 00:53:59,450
You like me?

826
00:54:12,162 --> 00:54:13,259
Yes,

827
00:54:14,370 --> 00:54:15,621
I like you.

828
00:54:18,013 --> 00:54:19,549
I didn't want to tell Amp.

829
00:54:21,668 --> 00:54:23,479
I know that Amp doesn't...

830
00:54:34,606 --> 00:54:36,135
Damn Bee, Damn Dol.

831
00:54:36,135 --> 00:54:38,387
You two are a burden to everyone.

832
00:54:39,316 --> 00:54:40,151
Damm.

833
00:54:59,335 --> 00:55:01,335
How hard is it to get tested?

834
00:55:23,162 --> 00:55:24,285
I'm not infected.

835
00:55:25,104 --> 00:55:26,664
Look at me, I'm strong.

836
00:55:47,827 --> 00:55:48,941
Hello, my dear friend. Hey,

837
00:55:49,540 --> 00:55:51,861
what's this about?

838
00:55:53,229 --> 00:55:55,237
Hey, that's enough. I'm not going anywhere.

839
00:55:56,688 --> 00:55:59,064
Yesterday I met Bee and Dol.

840
00:55:59,983 --> 00:56:01,701
And damn, they were both two lines.

841
00:56:03,507 --> 00:56:04,070
Hey.

842
00:56:04,753 --> 00:56:06,536
But I tested and it's just one line.

843
00:56:07,975 --> 00:56:09,237
Oh, Ok.

844
00:56:09,734 --> 00:56:12,030
It's okay. If you had two lines,
I would have been infected a long time ago.

845
00:56:12,725 --> 00:56:13,311
Just wait a moment.

846
00:56:16,597 --> 00:56:17,510
Look, my friend,

847
00:56:17,535 --> 00:56:19,818
I bought some spring rolls.

848
00:56:20,715 --> 00:56:21,865
I want you to try it.

849
00:56:23,933 --> 00:56:24,826
Here.

850
00:56:25,319 --> 00:56:27,055
I bought a bunch of snacks.

851
00:56:27,299 --> 00:56:28,338
Do you want anything else?

852
00:56:30,873 --> 00:56:34,575
'll wash my hands first. Do
you want to wash yours, friend?

853
00:56:37,413 --> 00:56:38,040
What do you want?

854
00:56:38,822 --> 00:56:40,204
I just want to take care
of you, my dear friend.

855
00:56:41,429 --> 00:56:41,994
Not fake,

856
00:56:42,418 --> 00:56:42,999
No.

857
00:56:43,644 --> 00:56:45,703
Hey, Gam, what does Poon want?

858
00:56:46,614 --> 00:56:50,267
By the way, last night Poon live streaming,
and a lot of people were asking about you.

859
00:56:51,306 --> 00:56:52,188
You're famous now, friend.

860
00:56:52,786 --> 00:56:55,510
Today, I want to invite
you to join my live stream.

861
00:56:56,549 --> 00:56:57,605
No, I don't want to go.

862
00:56:57,961 --> 00:57:00,454
Come on, it's just a chill session.
The fans are asking about you.

863
00:57:00,944 --> 00:57:01,678
I need your help.

864
00:57:04,073 --> 00:57:04,856
What are you doing?

865
00:57:05,454 --> 00:57:07,180
I promised the fans,

866
00:57:07,747 --> 00:57:08,927
that I'd sing for them.

867
00:57:09,179 --> 00:57:09,981
So.

868
00:57:10,611 --> 00:57:11,381
I was hoping you,

869
00:57:11,916 --> 00:57:13,053
could play the guitar for me.

870
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:14,340
They've already picked out the songs.

871
00:57:15,505 --> 00:57:16,005
Come on, friend.

872
00:57:16,949 --> 00:57:17,449
No.

873
00:57:20,223 --> 00:57:22,871
Please, friend. Please, my dear friend.

874
00:57:22,871 --> 00:57:25,481
If you don't help me, I'll
hold onto your legs like this.

875
00:57:26,834 --> 00:57:28,598
Just play 2 songs,

876
00:57:29,039 --> 00:57:30,448
with your little fingers.

877
00:57:30,731 --> 00:57:32,468
It will make the world look brighter.

878
00:57:32,999 --> 00:57:35,094
And I've already promised them,

879
00:57:35,283 --> 00:57:36,479
Please my friend.

880
00:57:36,479 --> 00:57:37,007
Damn it, Poon.

881
00:57:37,999 --> 00:57:39,380
I've told you before.

882
00:57:39,695 --> 00:57:42,179
That you shouldn't make
promises about things you can't do.

883
00:57:43,753 --> 00:57:44,921
Think about other
people's feelings, will you?

884
00:57:46,149 --> 00:57:48,637
Yeah, I'll think about it next time.

885
00:57:48,794 --> 00:57:50,367
But this time, please help me first.

886
00:57:50,619 --> 00:57:52,740
Please, please, please.

887
00:57:55,519 --> 00:57:56,176
Please, please, please.

888
00:57:56,599 --> 00:57:59,240
Okay, okay, I'll do it.

889
00:57:59,599 --> 00:58:00,423
Yay.

890
00:58:00,423 --> 00:58:03,231
Thanks a lot, friend! If I make it big.

891
00:58:03,231 --> 00:58:04,994
I won't let you eat boxed meals again.

892
00:58:05,309 --> 00:58:07,315
I'll take you out for shabu-shabu, sushi,

893
00:58:07,315 --> 00:58:09,459
and an extravagant omakase.

894
00:58:10,970 --> 00:58:11,823
Just this once, okay?

895
00:58:12,862 --> 00:58:13,654
You know my work is overwhelming.

896
00:58:14,441 --> 00:58:15,212
Besides,

897
00:58:15,716 --> 00:58:17,148
if I go live with you too often,

898
00:58:17,148 --> 00:58:18,703
I might end up being more
famous than you. What then?

899
00:58:19,459 --> 00:58:20,470
Sorry, my dear friend.

900
00:58:20,973 --> 00:58:22,193
Someone who doesn't like the spotlight like you

901
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:24,291
will never be more famous than me.

902
00:58:24,576 --> 00:58:26,270
Just be confident about it.

903
00:58:27,496 --> 00:58:29,134
Here, take this and eat it.

904
00:58:32,471 --> 00:58:34,265
No, I don't want it.

905
00:58:35,241 --> 00:58:36,432
My neighbor made this for me.

906
00:58:39,905 --> 00:58:41,073
My sweet-tooth disease is acting up.

907
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:47,321
I know you don't want to accept it

908
00:58:47,642 --> 00:58:48,843
because you don't want
to give anyone false hope.

909
00:58:49,371 --> 00:58:50,225
But

910
00:58:50,390 --> 00:58:52,170
he doesn't know you, and
you don't know him either.

911
00:58:52,170 --> 00:58:53,238
He's not thinking anything of it.

912
00:58:53,569 --> 00:58:54,390
Just eat it.

913
00:58:54,599 --> 00:58:55,490
I'm not eating it.

914
00:58:56,695 --> 00:58:58,998
You two go ahead. I'll
follow after I finish my meal.

915
00:58:59,914 --> 00:59:00,981
Let me finish my meal first.

916
00:59:03,751 --> 00:59:04,334
I'm asking for 2 plates.

917
00:59:07,287 --> 00:59:07,836
Hey,

918
00:59:08,804 --> 00:59:09,789
don't ditch me.

919
00:59:09,859 --> 00:59:10,549
Hey, take this with you.

920
00:59:12,788 --> 00:59:13,448
Don't ditch me.

921
00:59:13,659 --> 00:59:14,202
Alright.

922
00:59:35,354 --> 00:59:35,854
Tim.

923
00:59:35,854 --> 00:59:36,525
Hah

924
00:59:37,249 --> 00:59:38,776
come and watch Poon and Gam's live.

925
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:41,260
Oh.

926
00:59:42,331 --> 00:59:42,831
Yeah, join in.

927
00:59:47,302 --> 00:59:48,543
Hello everyone,

928
00:59:49,079 --> 00:59:49,837
we'll wait a bit longer

929
00:59:50,278 --> 00:59:51,083
for people to join.

930
00:59:52,664 --> 00:59:53,353
Hello

931
00:59:56,910 --> 00:59:57,908
everyone.

932
00:59:58,571 --> 01:00:00,625
Today, I have a special guest

933
01:00:00,846 --> 01:00:02,051
as promised.

934
01:00:02,555 --> 01:00:04,059
Our special guest is...

935
01:00:04,682 --> 01:00:06,441
It's P'Kla.

936
01:00:16,853 --> 01:00:17,353
Hey,

937
01:00:18,029 --> 01:00:19,517
someone said they want to hear you sing.

938
01:00:19,517 --> 01:00:21,474
I'm not singing.

939
01:00:21,474 --> 01:00:25,088
As you all know, you might be disappointed.

940
01:00:25,088 --> 01:00:27,008
Because he's not going to sing.

941
01:00:30,886 --> 01:00:32,649
Gam, Cake is joining us too.

942
01:00:32,649 --> 01:00:34,417
Um, I see.

943
01:00:37,292 --> 01:00:39,408
Cake, how's it going?

944
01:00:40,812 --> 01:00:41,989
How's the dessert?

945
01:00:42,491 --> 01:00:43,286
Did Poon eat it yet?

946
01:00:43,687 --> 01:00:44,688
We just finished it today.

947
01:00:46,262 --> 01:00:47,335
Snack?

948
01:00:47,569 --> 01:00:48,251
Here it is

949
01:00:48,452 --> 01:00:50,172
half of it is gone already.

950
01:00:50,172 --> 01:00:51,869
It's incredibly delicious, how did you make it?

951
01:00:53,741 --> 01:00:54,935
It's really delicious.

952
01:00:55,102 --> 01:00:56,404
I've eaten some too.

953
01:00:56,404 --> 01:00:57,947
I'd want you to open a shop.

954
01:00:57,947 --> 01:00:59,324
Um, Gam is cute.

955
01:01:01,898 --> 01:01:02,398
Hey,

956
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:03,700
are you ready?

957
01:01:06,821 --> 01:01:07,576
Everyone,

958
01:01:07,959 --> 01:01:09,279
our musician is ready.

959
01:01:09,580 --> 01:01:11,261
The first song we're going to play is

960
01:01:11,261 --> 01:01:12,604
a sweet love song,

961
01:01:13,552 --> 01:01:15,974
perfect for anyone wanting to express their love.

962
01:01:16,475 --> 01:01:17,176
Let's listen.

963
01:01:17,845 --> 01:01:18,425
3

964
01:01:18,626 --> 01:01:19,205
4

965
01:01:28,844 --> 01:01:32,993
Is it possible that people just
look into each other's eyes?

966
01:01:33,679 --> 01:01:37,963
There's no need to, you know
how to just look past it and see.

967
01:01:38,439 --> 01:01:45,954
I don't know what's going on. There's a
little voice in my heart calling out to her.

968
01:01:47,826 --> 01:01:52,445
Is it her that looks at me the same way?

969
01:01:52,779 --> 01:01:57,257
Or is it just me dreaming and imagining it?

970
01:01:57,725 --> 01:01:59,638
I don't know why.

971
01:02:00,073 --> 01:02:05,593
Who came to inspire me
to say hello to you first?

972
01:02:06,796 --> 01:02:09,001
If I tell you,

973
01:02:09,235 --> 01:02:14,892
will you even know that
there's someone waiting?

974
01:02:15,279 --> 01:02:17,899
People looking into each other's eyes.

975
01:02:18,601 --> 01:02:20,134
It makes me tremble.

976
01:02:20,479 --> 01:02:24,753
Maybe that's the person
I've been waiting for.

977
01:02:25,054 --> 01:02:28,486
If I accidentally press Love on Live,

978
01:02:28,486 --> 01:02:30,914
will you be able to understand me?

979
01:02:30,914 --> 01:02:33,367
Secret love through live.

980
01:02:33,367 --> 01:02:35,491
Please tell me what you think.

981
01:02:35,491 --> 01:02:37,696
I want to invite you to
talk every day without fail.

982
01:02:37,696 --> 01:02:41,806
Not to the point of being too sweet.
Can it be done in a way that we understand

983
01:02:41,806 --> 01:02:46,908
so that we can get Love in Life? It's over.

984
01:02:54,658 --> 01:02:55,646
The show is over, everyone.

985
01:02:56,014 --> 01:02:56,773
How was it?

986
01:02:56,773 --> 01:03:00,270
Give a round of applause for our guitarist.
Plus one, plus one!

987
01:03:04,199 --> 01:03:06,504
Poon and Gam, you both were amazing!
Poon and Gam, you both were amazing!

988
01:03:06,504 --> 01:03:07,591
Of course,

989
01:03:07,591 --> 01:03:09,456
because my heart is just this big.

990
01:03:12,399 --> 01:03:14,561
I'm completely melted by you, Poon.

991
01:03:14,828 --> 01:03:15,773
Definitely must.

992
01:03:15,773 --> 01:03:17,247
Because I'm a microwave.

993
01:03:18,985 --> 01:03:21,706
Oh, Poon is so cute!

994
01:03:24,347 --> 01:03:26,139
Gina said Poon is cute. Thank you, Gina.

995
01:03:26,874 --> 01:03:27,726
Thank you, Gina.

996
01:03:27,726 --> 01:03:28,259
Kla is so cool.

997
01:03:28,259 --> 01:03:29,914
Kla is so cool.

998
01:03:29,914 --> 01:03:30,601
Hey,

999
01:03:31,036 --> 01:03:31,828
Khing said you're cool.

1000
01:03:33,633 --> 01:03:34,921
Gam sang so beautifully!

1001
01:03:34,921 --> 01:03:36,351
Hey, Cake is still here, Gam.

1002
01:03:37,589 --> 01:03:39,085
Saying that Gam sang beautifully too.

1003
01:03:39,110 --> 01:03:39,898
I agree with that.

1004
01:03:43,083 --> 01:03:43,583
Cake.

1005
01:03:43,779 --> 01:03:44,776
Do you want to join the live?

1006
01:03:45,344 --> 01:03:46,097
I'll send an invite.

1007
01:03:46,097 --> 01:03:47,725
Because I saw you play the piano.

1008
01:03:48,227 --> 01:03:48,820
That's right,

1009
01:03:48,820 --> 01:03:50,258
Cake. Join the live with me,

1010
01:03:50,258 --> 01:03:51,318
and you can play the piano.

1011
01:03:51,853 --> 01:03:54,278
Next time, come play guitar again, something like that.

1012
01:03:55,202 --> 01:03:56,476
Hey, just invite him.

1013
01:03:56,501 --> 01:03:57,147
Alright.

1014
01:03:57,201 --> 01:03:58,632
So, I'll send an invite now.

1015
01:04:02,209 --> 01:04:02,841
Tim.

1016
01:04:02,841 --> 01:04:03,687
Can you Click accept?

1017
01:04:04,824 --> 01:04:05,598
What should we do?

1018
01:04:06,467 --> 01:04:08,105
Just click live,

1019
01:04:08,563 --> 01:04:09,988
it's fine,

1020
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:11,000
just try it.

1021
01:04:11,602 --> 01:04:12,553
Look at me now.

1022
01:04:12,999 --> 01:04:14,655
Oh, so cute,

1023
01:04:14,655 --> 01:04:15,155
Go ahead.

1024
01:04:16,225 --> 01:04:17,293
Are you serious?

1025
01:04:18,195 --> 01:04:19,948
Hmm.

1026
01:04:21,390 --> 01:04:22,067
Hello everyone.

1027
01:04:22,999 --> 01:04:23,670
Hey, Cake.

1028
01:04:23,838 --> 01:04:24,483
Everyone,

1029
01:04:24,483 --> 01:04:25,461
this is Cake.

1030
01:04:25,788 --> 01:04:28,323
He's my neighbor, we've been
playing together since we were kids.

1031
01:04:28,557 --> 01:04:29,995
Wow.

1032
01:04:31,232 --> 01:04:31,936
Cake.

1033
01:04:32,504 --> 01:04:34,077
So cute.

1034
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:37,013
So cute. How is Cake this cute?

1035
01:04:37,415 --> 01:04:37,915
Don't you think so?

1036
01:04:38,249 --> 01:04:38,929
Ichigo Look.

1037
01:04:39,119 --> 01:04:40,001
Mr. Keiki.

1038
01:04:40,603 --> 01:04:41,304
Look.

1039
01:04:42,499 --> 01:04:45,270
Kla, this is my friend Cake I mentioned.

1040
01:04:45,270 --> 01:04:45,978
Do you remember?

1041
01:04:46,585 --> 01:04:48,022
Cake, he is my friend,

1042
01:04:48,022 --> 01:04:49,656
a close friend, named Kla.

1043
01:04:50,759 --> 01:04:51,259
Oh.

1044
01:04:52,343 --> 01:04:53,118
Hello.

1045
01:04:54,890 --> 01:04:56,296
So cool, Cake.

1046
01:04:56,831 --> 01:04:58,400
Cake is so cute.

1047
01:04:59,971 --> 01:05:02,095
It's like watching a live show with all good-looking people.

1048
01:05:02,530 --> 01:05:04,148
Especially you, Gam, wow.

1049
01:05:07,324 --> 01:05:08,211
Go for it, Cake.

1050
01:05:08,478 --> 01:05:09,528
Our friend is the cutest.

1051
01:05:10,601 --> 01:05:13,316
Actually, the two of you were
supposed to meet several times already.

1052
01:05:13,483 --> 01:05:14,929
But never did.

1053
01:05:15,332 --> 01:05:16,028
Today,

1054
01:05:16,294 --> 01:05:18,020
I made the two of you meet each other.

1055
01:05:23,344 --> 01:05:24,272
Is the name Cake?

1056
01:05:25,919 --> 01:05:26,419
Yes.

1057
01:05:28,959 --> 01:05:29,612
Umm.

1058
01:05:30,279 --> 01:05:30,779
Kla

1059
01:05:31,439 --> 01:05:32,375
here, eat this.

1060
01:05:32,810 --> 01:05:33,317
This one,

1061
01:05:33,559 --> 01:05:35,352
