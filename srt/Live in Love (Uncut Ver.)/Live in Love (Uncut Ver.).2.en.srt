1
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:22,982
- Kla, wanna eat cake?
- Cake is really yummy.

2
00:00:22,982 --> 00:00:24,799
No.

3
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,331
- I heard you said the cake looked delicious.
- So, I baked it for you, Kla.

4
00:00:34,331 --> 00:00:36,240
Kla, Do you want to eat cake?

5
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,960
I don't wanna eat!

6
00:00:46,197 --> 00:00:48,663
- Kla, Do you want to eat cake?
- you dare to eat cake?

7
00:00:48,663 --> 00:00:50,456
- you dare to eat cake, Kla?
- Kla, Do you want to eat cake?

8
00:00:50,456 --> 00:00:51,499
Kla, Do you want to eat cake?

9
00:00:51,499 --> 00:00:54,040
I don't wanna eat!!

10
00:01:02,343 --> 00:01:04,480
I said I wouldn't eat it...

11
00:01:06,752 --> 00:01:09,569
Kla, Do you want to eat cake?

12
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:11,310
Do you want to eat cake?

13
00:01:17,605 --> 00:01:22,854
Do you want to eat cake?

14
00:01:22,854 --> 00:01:24,836
you dare to eat cake?

15
00:01:24,836 --> 00:01:37,400
Kla, you dare to eat cake?

16
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:50,616
No!!!
Kla, do you want to eat cake?

17
00:01:58,728 --> 00:02:05,617
"Dare Kla Eats Cake?"

18
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:20,227
[If I tell you, will you realize ,
that there’s someone waiting for]

19
00:02:20,227 --> 00:02:25,148
[Looking thru your eyes,
my heart missed a beat.]

20
00:02:25,148 --> 00:02:29,771
[Might be the one I’m waiting for]

21
00:02:29,771 --> 00:02:33,377
[If somehow I hit Love On Live]

22
00:02:33,377 --> 00:02:35,779
[Would you ever understand me]

23
00:02:35,779 --> 00:02:40,520
[In Love through Live
Could you share your though with me]

24
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:44,496
[Let’s chat everyday (Calling everyday)
No more no less that used to be]

25
00:02:44,496 --> 00:02:46,920
[What we both understand]

26
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:52,095
[Then we could Love in life so do you?]

27
00:02:52,095 --> 00:02:56,699
[Can I ask from you]

28
00:02:56,699 --> 00:03:02,879
[Can you please tell me]

29
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,493
What the heck are you doing here?

30
00:03:45,493 --> 00:03:47,804
- I told you. He hasn't yet woken up.
- I need sleep.

31
00:03:47,804 --> 00:03:49,040
You right.

32
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,846
Easy bro. Are you going back to sleep?

33
00:03:52,846 --> 00:03:55,742
- This is really important.
- True.

34
00:03:55,742 --> 00:03:58,163
Why do you guys have to be so noisy?

35
00:03:58,163 --> 00:04:00,091
Go back to be loud at your room then.

36
00:04:00,091 --> 00:04:02,050
I'm going to sleep.

37
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:05,172
Wake up. This is really matter.

38
00:04:05,172 --> 00:04:07,222
What?

39
00:04:07,222 --> 00:04:10,162
If it's not important, I will kick both of you out.

40
00:04:10,162 --> 00:04:13,837
Straight to the point then.
Have you seen your hashtag on social media yet?

41
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:15,123
Have you seen?

42
00:04:15,123 --> 00:04:16,623
What's the hashtag?

43
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:18,118
Your hashtag with Cake.

44
00:04:18,118 --> 00:04:19,817
They're so crazy about it over social media.

45
00:04:19,817 --> 00:04:22,563
Because you followed Cake and he followed you back.

46
00:04:22,563 --> 00:04:23,372
Yes.

47
00:04:23,372 --> 00:04:26,036
Will check later.

48
00:04:26,036 --> 00:04:29,054
Be honest, Do you like Cake?

49
00:04:29,054 --> 00:04:31,084
Normally, you won't do this.

50
00:04:31,084 --> 00:04:33,422
- You don't follow anyone randomly.
- True.

51
00:04:33,422 --> 00:04:35,935
You don't even follow some friends in college.

52
00:04:35,935 --> 00:04:39,640
- You don't even follow me too.
- Really?

53
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:43,566
Cake's also your friend of friends.
How's it weird to follow him?

54
00:04:43,566 --> 00:04:46,971
But you teased him on Live too.

55
00:04:49,538 --> 00:04:52,238
He's kinda adorable.

56
00:04:52,238 --> 00:04:55,299
Your friend's face is so blank.

57
00:04:55,299 --> 00:04:56,656
Why do you guys have to ship?

58
00:04:56,656 --> 00:05:00,327
I can introduce you to him
even though he looks a bit foggy and silly sometimes.

59
00:05:00,327 --> 00:05:02,394
But he's cute.

60
00:05:02,394 --> 00:05:03,579
Do you want?

61
00:05:03,579 --> 00:05:07,819
Keep your nose out of me and go take care Gam.

62
00:05:07,819 --> 00:05:09,405
I need sleep.

63
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,149
Okay fine.

64
00:05:14,344 --> 00:05:16,998
Don't sleep yet.

65
00:05:16,998 --> 00:05:20,933
It's almost due to submit Khun Job's work.

66
00:05:20,933 --> 00:05:23,148
I know.

67
00:05:23,148 --> 00:05:26,027
Okay, please take care of it Khun Kla.

68
00:05:26,027 --> 00:05:27,516
Okay

69
00:05:27,516 --> 00:05:30,438
- Go
- Let's go.

70
00:05:30,438 --> 00:05:34,884
So, do you like Cake?

71
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:42,965
- I go then and you just sleep here.
- Don't forget to finish the job.

72
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,680
Will continue to do later.

73
00:06:09,783 --> 00:06:12,640
I think a cutting is okay now.

74
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,880
Don't have to fix anything and I really like it.

75
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,929
Appreciate that.

76
00:06:27,395 --> 00:06:30,848
Do you want to work with me in the long-term?

77
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:33,853
You want to work in a production house already.

78
00:06:33,853 --> 00:06:36,308
Comeback to help me like before.

79
00:06:40,792 --> 00:06:42,827
you..

80
00:06:42,827 --> 00:06:45,305
still not sure yet because of what happened back then, right?

81
00:06:46,728 --> 00:06:48,319
Yes.

82
00:06:49,786 --> 00:06:53,726
I'm so sorry Kla.

83
00:06:53,726 --> 00:06:56,756
We were very young at that time.

84
00:06:56,756 --> 00:07:00,870
I didn't know what to do so I blamed you.

85
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:03,775
Actually, it was me to be mean.

86
00:07:03,775 --> 00:07:05,720
cut you out and disappeared.

87
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,272
I understand.

88
00:07:08,272 --> 00:07:10,822
You really cared about Amp's feelings.

89
00:07:13,514 --> 00:07:15,382
Yes but...

90
00:07:15,382 --> 00:07:17,357
I should listen to you more.

91
00:07:19,725 --> 00:07:22,299
but it was good at that time.

92
00:07:22,299 --> 00:07:25,386
It allowed me to express my feelings.

93
00:07:27,792 --> 00:07:30,000
Said that I liked a friend.

94
00:07:31,648 --> 00:07:33,797
but also lost a good friend.

95
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:38,508
It's fine.

96
00:07:38,508 --> 00:07:41,315
It already passed a long time ago.

97
00:07:41,315 --> 00:07:43,560
Just forget it.

98
00:07:45,432 --> 00:07:48,840
So, now you've accepted any sweets from anyone yet?

99
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,975
Really? so strong-willed.

100
00:07:53,975 --> 00:07:55,233
Don't eat sweets anymore?

101
00:07:55,896 --> 00:07:59,054
So..

102
00:07:59,054 --> 00:08:02,489
I think I will back to try.

103
00:08:02,489 --> 00:08:05,622
I've had a glucose drop lately.

104
00:08:05,622 --> 00:08:08,473
Nice. I'll recommend my girlfriend's shop to you.

105
00:08:08,473 --> 00:08:13,120
Clean-eating people will love it. Every menu is less sweet.

106
00:08:16,292 --> 00:08:19,063
Here's my girlfriend's shop.

107
00:08:19,063 --> 00:08:22,242
What!?

108
00:08:22,242 --> 00:08:24,405
It's Amp.

109
00:08:26,887 --> 00:08:30,694
That's mean now you and Amp...

110
00:08:33,026 --> 00:08:35,480
What!? Really?

111
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,142
I'm so happy for you.

112
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:40,000
Thank you so much.

113
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,097
So can you accept a job offer from me?
- I'm expensive one.

114
00:08:44,097 --> 00:08:45,440
I give you a one year credit.

115
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,054
I only accept cash.

116
00:08:48,054 --> 00:08:52,182
Come on. We're friend.

117
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,629
What should I eat today?

118
00:09:09,629 --> 00:09:11,554
Stir fry mixed holy basil chicken or

119
00:09:11,554 --> 00:09:14,320
Spaghetti Pad Kee Mao

120
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:20,656
Do you like a frozen food?

121
00:09:20,656 --> 00:09:23,726
It's easy because I'm working.

122
00:09:23,726 --> 00:09:27,769
Stir fry mixed holy basil chicken sounds nice.
It'll be good to eat with boiled eggs.

123
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,060
Can't be fried eggs?

124
00:09:33,999 --> 00:09:35,885
It's okay but I just like boiled eggs.

125
00:09:35,885 --> 00:09:38,947
I confirm. It's yummy.

126
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:49,068
Today, I'm not going to play a piano.

127
00:09:49,068 --> 00:09:50,932
I just want to try to Live.

128
00:09:50,932 --> 00:09:52,703
[Kla joined with you]

129
00:09:52,703 --> 00:09:56,536
[Oh my god! Kla is here]
[Ask Kla to Live together! Cake]

130
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,263
Hi

131
00:10:07,263 --> 00:10:10,196
Why you invited me to Live?

132
00:10:10,196 --> 00:10:13,460
I randomly just clicked to see how it's going.

133
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:17,240
That means you actually don't want to talk with me.

134
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:20,485
[Kla uses his second voice to talk with Cake]
[Normally his voice is stronger but this so softly]

135
00:10:20,485 --> 00:10:23,483
[Yes! a gentle voice. I wanna scream!!]
What's a second voice everyone?

136
00:10:23,483 --> 00:10:26,396
But have you eaten yet, today?

137
00:10:26,396 --> 00:10:28,052
I've already.

138
00:10:28,052 --> 00:10:29,590
What are you doing?

139
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:32,289
Me? I'm eating.

140
00:10:32,289 --> 00:10:34,519
I've just finished my work.

141
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:38,345
I've edited the video all day since I backed to my room.

142
00:10:38,345 --> 00:10:42,897
[Make him to a tiny ball and swallow If you look at him like that!]
What did you eat then? So, I will copy you for next time.

143
00:10:42,897 --> 00:10:45,507
(Pun: Kla, do you wanna eat cake?)
Kla, Do you want to eat cake?

144
00:10:45,507 --> 00:10:47,046
What's wrong with you Pun!?

145
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:49,285
What the heck you just said?
(I just bought a cake.)

146
00:10:49,285 --> 00:10:52,340
(So I ask you wanna eat? If you want, I'll bring up there.)

147
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:55,839
What's going on here?

148
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,721
Nothing. Pun's just fooling around here.

149
00:10:59,721 --> 00:11:02,651
You don't have to care any but...

150
00:11:02,651 --> 00:11:04,651
You haven't answered me yet, what did you eat today?

151
00:11:04,651 --> 00:11:07,866
I had Panang Curry with boiled egg.
[He switched his mode so quickly.]

152
00:11:07,866 --> 00:11:13,224
I eat Stir fry mixed holy basil chicken but without boiled eggs.

153
00:11:13,224 --> 00:11:15,657
Is it good?

154
00:11:15,657 --> 00:11:19,173
It's good but I will try to have Panang Curry next time.

155
00:11:19,173 --> 00:11:22,091
(I voted for Spaghetti but why did it lose to Stir fry holy basil?)

156
00:11:22,091 --> 00:11:24,291
What're you doing then?

157
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:27,711
My job sometimes includes Vlog editing.

158
00:11:27,711 --> 00:11:30,000
and video editing in general.

159
00:11:30,002 --> 00:11:32,155
I'm just doing it.

160
00:11:32,155 --> 00:11:34,848
You're really good.

161
00:11:34,848 --> 00:11:38,277
No, I'm not that good. I just do it.

162
00:11:38,277 --> 00:11:39,792
So

163
00:11:39,792 --> 00:11:43,687
I won't bother your time with fans here then.

164
00:11:43,687 --> 00:11:47,903
I better go offline and talk later.

165
00:11:47,903 --> 00:11:50,547
Okay, see you.

166
00:11:50,547 --> 00:11:54,409
Thank you

167
00:11:54,409 --> 00:11:58,320
Thank you too.

168
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,455
Will see you guys soon. I have to go now.

169
00:12:04,455 --> 00:12:06,455
Bye

170
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:17,858
Who did you just talk with on Live? I saw it.

171
00:12:18,965 --> 00:12:22,519
It's Kla. Pun's friend.

172
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:29,433
How did you know him and talked on Live?

173
00:12:29,433 --> 00:12:31,149
Are you guys close to each other?

174
00:12:31,149 --> 00:12:34,003
From Pun's Live on that day.

175
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:35,774
Someone asked me to Live with him.

176
00:12:35,774 --> 00:12:38,289
Then I just tried to Live.

177
00:12:38,289 --> 00:12:41,286
This means whoever asks you, you will do for them?

178
00:12:41,286 --> 00:12:45,767
You don't like to talk to people you don't know.

179
00:12:46,271 --> 00:12:50,000
Kla isn't that one I don't know Tim.

180
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,248
I quite enjoyed talking with him.

181
00:12:53,248 --> 00:12:56,548
He looks like... a good guy

182
00:12:56,548 --> 00:12:59,318
But you looked nervous when you were on Live.

183
00:12:59,318 --> 00:13:02,177
When you're getting famous

184
00:13:02,177 --> 00:13:06,072
everyone asks you to do this to do that

185
00:13:06,072 --> 00:13:09,088
you don't have to do to lose true yourself.

186
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:12,516
Famous what Tim? Don't talk nonsense.

187
00:13:13,524 --> 00:13:15,325
When I talked with him you know?

188
00:13:15,325 --> 00:13:17,360
I didn't lose myself at all.

189
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,707
Wait..

190
00:13:19,707 --> 00:13:21,333
You don't know yet?

191
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:23,942
Your name is on trending.

192
00:13:23,942 --> 00:13:28,428
Hashtag Cake will eat Kla No... Kla will eat Cake this.

193
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:36,431
I'm happy to have a popular brother.

194
00:13:36,431 --> 00:13:38,680
But I afraid that you will be fooled by someone.

195
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:42,970
What are you talking? I think he's trustworthy.

196
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:49,289
What is this? One, Kla's trustworthy.
Another one, Kla is a good guy.

197
00:13:49,289 --> 00:13:50,981
Seriously

198
00:13:50,981 --> 00:13:54,097
Do you like Kla?

199
00:13:54,097 --> 00:13:58,120
You crazy? No!

200
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:02,731
Fine. I will tricky ask Pun and Gam then.

201
00:14:02,731 --> 00:14:06,620
And send my word to him

202
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:09,674
"I'm watching you."

203
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:14,735
I gotta go. I sleep first today.

204
00:14:14,735 --> 00:14:15,739
Relax Cake.

205
00:14:15,739 --> 00:14:17,827
Okay

206
00:14:17,827 --> 00:14:20,655
Tim, you forgot your milk.

207
00:14:23,271 --> 00:14:25,972
I'm watching you.

208
00:14:27,484 --> 00:14:31,065
- Good night Tim.\- Good night Cake.

209
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,223
Why are you sticking your nose in here?

210
00:14:47,223 --> 00:14:49,887
See? I know that you definitely know both of them.

211
00:14:49,887 --> 00:14:53,014
I can see through them in 4K.

212
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,504
Just say what you want.

213
00:14:58,504 --> 00:15:00,413
What did you eat yesterday?

214
00:15:01,076 --> 00:15:02,853
Panang Curry. Why did you ask?

215
00:15:02,853 --> 00:15:05,259
You copied Cake.

216
00:15:06,816 --> 00:15:10,328
Is this a reason that got you all up in my business
and came to see me here?

217
00:15:10,328 --> 00:15:14,991
Have you seen hashtag on Twitter? Not that #KlaCake?

218
00:15:14,991 --> 00:15:16,943
also have more hashtags you know?

219
00:15:16,943 --> 00:15:20,771
What's that hashtag? Can you tell me my friend Pun?

220
00:15:20,771 --> 00:15:22,962
#KlaWillEatCake

221
00:15:22,962 --> 00:15:24,445
What do you think?

222
00:15:24,445 --> 00:15:28,255
I don't think that much. I'm familiar with this kinda thing
and you know that.

223
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:31,132
I'm just worried about your friend.
He may be overthinking about it.

224
00:15:31,132 --> 00:15:35,079
I don't think so. I wonder if he even knows that he's trending.

225
00:15:36,239 --> 00:15:38,448
Well, how did you go on Live with Cake?

226
00:15:39,649 --> 00:15:42,775
He invited me to join Live.

227
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:49,350
He has two standards.
He never accepted my invitation you know?

228
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:53,344
This is so easy Pun. You're not Cake.

229
00:15:53,344 --> 00:15:54,575
That's right.

230
00:15:54,575 --> 00:15:59,507
Yes, why did I have to Live with you?
You've just had Live downstairs.

231
00:15:59,507 --> 00:16:03,277
Well, Cake also has two standards same as Kla.

232
00:16:03,277 --> 00:16:08,074
When Kla talks to me, he barks like a moody dog.
But he's so babying when he speaks with Cake.

233
00:16:08,488 --> 00:16:12,899
And Cake calls me like a friend but calls him very respectfully.

234
00:16:13,852 --> 00:16:15,809
Pun probably isn’t as respectable as Cake says anymore.

235
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:19,311
Gam! He doesn't call you in that way too.

236
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,555
Because Cake's close with him.
But for you, it's probably just like he said.

237
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,760
Then, what about you and Cake?

238
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,385
Nothing. I've told you I just adore him.

239
00:16:35,385 --> 00:16:36,629
Really?

240
00:16:36,836 --> 00:16:37,609
Yes.

241
00:16:38,976 --> 00:16:41,909
Whatever. Where's my chair that you took to make a content?

242
00:16:42,324 --> 00:16:43,256
When you'll bring it back to me?

243
00:16:43,256 --> 00:16:44,610
It's here. Stop complaining.

244
00:16:46,308 --> 00:16:47,659
Take it back then.

245
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:49,517
That's it.

246
00:16:51,878 --> 00:16:58,218
Finally, I got my chair back.

247
00:16:59,046 --> 00:17:00,978
So, can you tell me what's the story?

248
00:17:01,765 --> 00:17:03,209
I've finished my work.

249
00:17:03,209 --> 00:17:05,419
and I'm going to sleep so you should leave.

250
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:08,172
Don't sleep yet. Tell me first.

251
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,923
Let's go. Let him have a rest.

252
00:17:12,923 --> 00:17:14,721
Okay fine.

253
00:17:14,721 --> 00:17:15,809
I'm going then.

254
00:17:15,809 --> 00:17:16,309
Bye.

255
00:17:16,309 --> 00:17:17,357
Just go Pun.

256
00:17:20,733 --> 00:17:22,475
Oh shit!

257
00:17:23,428 --> 00:17:26,179
Get out and take that chair with you.

258
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:49,760
Cake, can I ask you something?

259
00:17:54,284 --> 00:17:55,492
What're you going to ask?

260
00:17:55,492 --> 00:17:59,515
Did you see our hashtags on social media, right?

261
00:18:06,369 --> 00:18:07,401
I saw it.

262
00:18:08,726 --> 00:18:13,159
Do you know why they did us the hashtags?

263
00:18:15,481 --> 00:18:17,037
I know a little.

264
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:21,519
Do you feel bad or don't like it?

265
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:27,366
If you feel bad, I’m sorry for making you go through this.

266
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:34,663
I’m not thinking anything. I don’t feel bad at all.

267
00:18:34,663 --> 00:18:36,625
You sure?

268
00:18:39,681 --> 00:18:40,944
Yes.

269
00:18:42,517 --> 00:18:47,331
Whenever you feel uncomfortable to be shipped with me, let me know.

270
00:18:47,331 --> 00:18:48,811
I'll handle it for you.

271
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,694
Sure.

272
00:18:52,943 --> 00:18:57,795
Thank you. Then I won’t bother your time. Talk later.

273
00:18:59,617 --> 00:19:01,753
Okay.

274
00:19:17,172 --> 00:19:21,440
You guys moved on to texting each other now?

275
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:26,760
He asked me did I worried about the shipping tag.

276
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,348
So what did you say?

277
00:19:29,804 --> 00:19:32,886
Just told him that I didn't worry anything.

278
00:19:34,253 --> 00:19:36,963
But there’s one thing, I’m really stressed about it.

279
00:19:36,963 --> 00:19:38,897
What?

280
00:19:39,601 --> 00:19:42,185
Do you think...

281
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,539
Did I reply him too short? Is it rude?

282
00:19:47,657 --> 00:19:51,846
What you just replied to him is not rude at all.

283
00:19:52,053 --> 00:19:58,239
But now, I’m getting frustrated with you. Why you're so naive?

284
00:19:58,736 --> 00:20:02,779
I think I need to enroll you in a Love 101 course.

285
00:20:02,779 --> 00:20:04,883
I’m going then. What kind of person are you?

286
00:20:04,883 --> 00:20:07,482
Tim, your milk.

287
00:20:08,683 --> 00:20:10,292
I'm leaving.

288
00:20:10,748 --> 00:20:12,570
Good night.

289
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,027
You name Cake?

290
00:20:32,027 --> 00:20:34,075
Yes.

291
00:20:34,986 --> 00:20:37,452
Your friend's name sounds pretty yummy.

292
00:20:37,452 --> 00:20:43,547
[Glimpse, as you beam over here]

293
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:47,839
[as cute as cupcake to me.]

294
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:59,905
[I'm scared that you know as I'm secretly missing you again.]

295
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:06,117
[But it’s too late to realise.]

296
00:21:08,454 --> 00:21:16,400
[You made me love you. The closer we are, the more the love blooms.]

297
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:21,940
[as I look through your eyes, What do you feel inside?]

298
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:26,945
[Have you ever love me?]

299
00:21:26,945 --> 00:21:33,439
[Because of you my Love Alive.]

300
00:21:41,474 --> 00:21:46,288
That’s the song "Love Alive!", everyone.
[Awwwwww><] / [Kla! I'm enjoying it.]

301
00:21:46,288 --> 00:21:50,627
I'll come back to do a full cover for everyone next time.

302
00:21:50,627 --> 00:21:52,975
Actually, I'm still not very comfortable with it at the moment.

303
00:21:54,093 --> 00:21:57,744
Did Kla sing it to avoid copyright issues?

304
00:21:58,572 --> 00:22:01,234
Maybe.

305
00:22:05,873 --> 00:22:10,237
Take care of yourself. Thank you.
Everyone, please take care of yourselves too.

306
00:22:10,237 --> 00:22:12,976
Cake is also here.

307
00:22:12,976 --> 00:22:14,655
Really?

308
00:22:15,898 --> 00:22:19,326
Can you invite him to join Live?

309
00:22:20,983 --> 00:22:23,525
I don't know he wants to join Live with me.

310
00:22:23,525 --> 00:22:25,623
But I will try to send him invite.

311
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,476
Hello

312
00:22:32,056 --> 00:22:34,999
Hello, everyone. Cake is here.

313
00:22:35,786 --> 00:22:40,681
I forget that I'm having a face mask on.

314
00:22:42,172 --> 00:22:44,975
It's okay. That's cute.

315
00:22:45,638 --> 00:22:47,768
I don't look ugly right, Kla?

316
00:22:48,099 --> 00:22:53,451
Not at all. How long have you been here?

317
00:22:53,451 --> 00:22:56,285
Have you been here since I started playing the song?

318
00:22:56,285 --> 00:22:59,620
About 2 songs already.

319
00:23:00,366 --> 00:23:03,477
I’ heard that you can play both piano and guitar.

320
00:23:03,477 --> 00:23:05,633
How about coming to play together sometime?

321
00:23:05,633 --> 00:23:08,500
I'm not that good enough with the guitar though.

322
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:12,818
But for the piano, I always want to play with your guitar.

323
00:23:13,937 --> 00:23:18,729
Sure, we can play together sometime.

324
00:23:18,729 --> 00:23:23,175
Are you a friend of Pun?

325
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:28,143
I study at the same university as Pun, and Bee and Dol too.

326
00:23:28,143 --> 00:23:31,270
I'm in a second year and majoring in Film Studies.

327
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:34,020
But don't ask about those people, it's too much trouble.

328
00:23:36,008 --> 00:23:38,354
So where do you study?

329
00:23:38,354 --> 00:23:42,270
I'm in my first year at the same university as Gam.

330
00:23:43,729 --> 00:23:45,717
Are you home?

331
00:23:45,717 --> 00:23:48,231
Home of course.

332
00:23:48,811 --> 00:23:55,178
There's a pandemic going on, so my university is closed.
Then my dad wants me to stay home.

333
00:23:55,178 --> 00:23:57,552
I'm study online recently.

334
00:23:58,422 --> 00:24:00,796
How about you? Are you study online?

335
00:24:00,796 --> 00:24:03,285
I'm study online. I also can't go back home.

336
00:24:03,285 --> 00:24:04,719
I'm stuck in my condo.

337
00:24:04,719 --> 00:24:06,488
This ship often goes Live together!

338
00:24:06,488 --> 00:24:09,878
What’s wrong with you, Pun?
Showing up all of a sudden like this?

339
00:24:11,327 --> 00:24:13,044
Don't cause any trouble.

340
00:24:13,044 --> 00:24:15,395
I want to eat brownies baked by Cake.

341
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:20,678
I heard from Gam that Cake makes really tasty brownies.

342
00:24:21,548 --> 00:24:24,822
Didn’t you send some last time? I didn’t eat them.

343
00:24:25,443 --> 00:24:28,509
Could you send some brownies to me next time, Cake?

344
00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:33,089
Sure, If I makes, I’ll send some for you.

345
00:24:33,089 --> 00:24:34,045
Nice.

346
00:24:34,583 --> 00:24:37,490
You don't eat sweets Kla.

347
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:41,745
What's wrong with you? Can you stop being nosy?
I can eat if he makes it.

348
00:24:41,745 --> 00:24:42,592
Why?

349
00:24:42,592 --> 00:24:44,353
You don't like sweets?

350
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:50,941
Just a bit, but I think I’ll give it a try.

351
00:24:53,095 --> 00:24:58,946
He's totally flirting. It’s obvious he wants to try your sweets.

352
00:24:58,946 --> 00:25:02,030
What's going on, everyone? I'm not flirting with him at all.

353
00:25:02,568 --> 00:25:06,555
I just think he's cute and want to support them in baking.

354
00:25:07,011 --> 00:25:08,353
So I want to taste it for him.

355
00:25:08,353 --> 00:25:09,501
Can you hurry up?

356
00:25:09,501 --> 00:25:11,956
I know it. I'm going down.

357
00:25:11,956 --> 00:25:13,355
Such a hassle.

358
00:25:13,852 --> 00:25:17,538
Cake, I have to go to see Pun.

359
00:25:17,745 --> 00:25:19,078
He's following me to work on the report.

360
00:25:19,078 --> 00:25:22,074
I'll have to go for now. Let's talk again soon.

361
00:25:22,074 --> 00:25:25,190
Okay. See you then.

362
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:28,236
See you. I'm leaving now everyone.

363
00:25:28,236 --> 00:25:31,498
I’ll bring Cake to play along my guitar next time.

364
00:25:31,498 --> 00:25:33,967
Play the piano and sing some beautiful songs for everyone.

365
00:25:34,505 --> 00:25:37,366
Take care of your health and have a sweet dreams, everyone.

366
00:25:37,366 --> 00:25:38,629
Bye.

367
00:25:40,621 --> 00:25:42,740
What's going on with him and Cake?

368
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:45,268
Why is everyone shipping them so much?

369
00:25:46,552 --> 00:25:50,582
Don't worry about them. Just be like Pun and Gam shipping.

370
00:25:51,245 --> 00:25:53,148
True.

371
00:25:55,534 --> 00:25:57,941
What is a shipping couple.

372
00:25:58,438 --> 00:26:01,705
Pun still sends a love sign through his eyes to me every day.

373
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,468
We haven’t seen Pun and Kla in a while, have we?

374
00:26:09,799 --> 00:26:13,880
Yeah, we haven't seen them for a while.

375
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:18,213
Oh well, do you miss him?

376
00:26:18,462 --> 00:26:21,849
Kla is Lady Khing's.

377
00:26:23,174 --> 00:26:26,638
Let me think.

378
00:26:29,205 --> 00:26:34,381
I’ve figured out how to get you to meet him.

379
00:26:36,314 --> 00:26:38,385
How?

380
00:26:57,815 --> 00:26:59,517
It should be Kla.

381
00:26:59,517 --> 00:27:00,732
Can you open the door for him?

382
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:03,223
He came to get his stuffs.

383
00:27:16,044 --> 00:27:18,884
You're so lucky to have Gam doing everything for you.

384
00:27:18,884 --> 00:27:20,612
Don’t even open the door for me.

385
00:27:20,612 --> 00:27:22,343
Stop talking.

386
00:27:22,757 --> 00:27:25,301
How was the brownie? Was it good?

387
00:27:25,964 --> 00:27:28,212
Yeah but why?

388
00:27:28,212 --> 00:27:33,401
Look! He normally doesn't eat any sweets.

389
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:37,225
But now he eats. Oh my god!

390
00:27:37,225 --> 00:27:40,284
True, normally you don't even try to eat any of them.

391
00:27:40,657 --> 00:27:43,623
Because you said that whatever he makes is delicious.

392
00:27:43,623 --> 00:27:44,683
So I just tried.

393
00:27:44,683 --> 00:27:45,635
You don’t need to make excuses.

394
00:27:45,635 --> 00:27:46,389
What excuses?

395
00:27:46,389 --> 00:27:48,192
You've totally fallen for my friend, haven’t you?

396
00:27:48,192 --> 00:27:49,691
Yes or no?

397
00:27:49,691 --> 00:27:53,208
You're really good at my business.
Why do you have to be so nosy?

398
00:27:53,705 --> 00:27:55,817
Where is my SSD?

399
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:57,960
Here.

400
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,690
Give it to me. I gotta go now.

401
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,026
Tell me, do you have feelings for my friend?

402
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,306
Give that to me first and I'll tell you.

403
00:28:08,513 --> 00:28:10,240
I don’t believe you.

404
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,279
Hey, just try believing me.

405
00:28:15,129 --> 00:28:15,942
Butt out!

406
00:28:16,398 --> 00:28:17,479
I'm going.

407
00:28:17,479 --> 00:28:20,799
- Bye.
- See you.

408
00:28:24,397 --> 00:28:28,467
He definitely has a feeling for him. Do you think?

409
00:28:28,467 --> 00:28:32,127
He never asks for sweets from anyone.

410
00:28:33,535 --> 00:28:38,014
Let see then.

411
00:28:46,215 --> 00:28:50,243
I forgot to take pictures of the review outfit.

412
00:28:50,864 --> 00:28:54,550
It's a couple outfit. Take the photos with me please.

413
00:28:56,268 --> 00:28:58,931
Can we do tomorrow? I'm tired today.

414
00:28:58,931 --> 00:29:03,590
But it's already late. There're so many tasks waiting.
Pretty please?

415
00:29:04,336 --> 00:29:07,402
Can you do the review with me? I really need you.

416
00:29:07,402 --> 00:29:12,634
It's a couple outfit and they asked me to review since last week
but I still haven’t done it.

417
00:29:15,285 --> 00:29:17,292
Please.

418
00:29:17,623 --> 00:29:20,935
Do you get tired of everyone constantly shipping us together like this?

419
00:29:22,633 --> 00:29:28,495
Why are you saying that?
Aren’t you happy that people are shipping us together?

420
00:29:29,158 --> 00:29:31,796
But it's not that real.

421
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:38,559
Why are you overthinking now?

422
00:29:41,729 --> 00:29:43,034
Okay, do it tomorrow then.

423
00:29:43,034 --> 00:29:50,178
How about we do a face mask tonight?
Your skin will look fresh, and it’ll boost your mood too.

424
00:29:51,545 --> 00:29:54,054
Do you think?

425
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,046
Don’t worry. I will take care of you perfectly.

426
00:30:01,874 --> 00:30:10,484
Everything that you need.

427
00:30:10,484 --> 00:30:11,638
Don’t make that monkey face.

428
00:30:11,638 --> 00:30:17,648
This monkey will take care of you.

429
00:30:17,648 --> 00:30:24,130
- But tomorrow, We'll review for two outfits, okay?
- Okay.

430
00:30:28,656 --> 00:30:31,660
Can I cut it all out?

431
00:30:32,198 --> 00:30:35,235
Everyone, I bought a ton of snacks!

432
00:30:35,981 --> 00:30:40,406
And here’s an Americano no sugar. I remember you like it.

433
00:30:41,027 --> 00:30:47,919
Thank you but I think we should get back to work because curfew’s coming.

434
00:30:49,308 --> 00:30:52,012
This one too.

435
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:01,949
The food's here. I’ll go downstairs to get it.

436
00:31:04,517 --> 00:31:06,076
I go to help him then.

437
00:31:06,076 --> 00:31:08,438
Will be back.

438
00:31:08,438 --> 00:31:09,560
Hurry up, I'm starving.

439
00:31:09,767 --> 00:31:11,518
I'm hungry.

440
00:31:11,518 --> 00:31:13,900
Get back to work on it.

441
00:31:18,493 --> 00:31:22,327
Kla

442
00:31:22,907 --> 00:31:27,221
Do you know about the shipping of Pun and Gam?

443
00:31:27,221 --> 00:31:30,830
I want to know if it’s a real couple or just a shipping thing.

444
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:34,917
You should ask Pun, I think.

445
00:31:36,988 --> 00:31:40,972
But You're a close friend. Why you don't know?

446
00:31:41,635 --> 00:31:44,532
I don't usually keep my nose on my friend's personal.

447
00:31:44,822 --> 00:31:48,893
I think if he wants to share, he’ll tell us.

448
00:31:51,626 --> 00:31:59,840
I just want to know, I don’t mean to pry into his personal life.

449
00:32:07,217 --> 00:32:09,795
Why you don't jump into the screen?

450
00:32:09,795 --> 00:32:11,783
Just send anything you want to send.

451
00:32:12,529 --> 00:32:14,769
I'm just checking it out.

452
00:32:14,769 --> 00:32:17,855
There's no such thing like 'Just'.

453
00:32:18,932 --> 00:32:23,310
When the pandemic will end?

454
00:32:24,801 --> 00:32:30,686
I’m not sure, but if everyone helps
by protecting themselves and others, it'll be helpful.

455
00:32:31,597 --> 00:32:37,767
It'll be okay. It's already gotten a lot better now.

456
00:32:39,672 --> 00:32:44,751
Does this mean we’ll get to go back to study on campus soon?

457
00:32:44,751 --> 00:32:47,033
I think so.

458
00:32:47,033 --> 00:32:52,208
Hypothetically, if the situation really better
and you could go back to university

459
00:32:52,954 --> 00:32:55,957
Will you go to see Kla?

460
00:32:55,957 --> 00:32:57,277
I don't know yet.

461
00:32:58,603 --> 00:33:01,311
Our universities are very far from each other.

462
00:33:02,139 --> 00:33:05,683
If someone wants to see each other, no matter how far from them,

463
00:33:05,683 --> 00:33:11,273
they can find the way to see each other.
Distance doesn’t matter if you really want to be together, you know?

464
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:20,729
Don't think too much. Just ask him like
if the COVID situation gets better, will you want to meet up?

465
00:33:20,729 --> 00:33:23,069
Would you like to meet?

466
00:33:24,353 --> 00:33:26,386
Go ask him.

467
00:33:29,451 --> 00:33:33,791
But I'm not sure yet. I don't know if he's available.

468
00:33:33,791 --> 00:33:38,475
Just message him directly.
Why you afraid of me finding out?

469
00:33:38,475 --> 00:33:44,390
It's your right. And if you want to know if he's free,

470
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:48,511
you just text him like "Hi, Khun Kla"

471
00:33:48,511 --> 00:33:52,651
Are you available to talk with me, Cake Kawinkan?

472
00:33:52,651 --> 00:33:53,927
That's it.

473
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:01,390
You can do it. I'll rooting for you here.

474
00:34:01,804 --> 00:34:03,070
Thank you so much Tim.

475
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:07,965
Fighting! I'm watching with concern from far away.

476
00:34:10,728 --> 00:34:16,560
- Food is here. Let's eat.
- Hungry!

477
00:34:18,051 --> 00:34:20,000
Where

478
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,723
Here you Gina.

479
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,391
You don't want to eat?

480
00:34:30,391 --> 00:34:34,659
You guys eat first. I have brownies and I'll be back soon.

481
00:34:35,405 --> 00:34:36,800
Where're you going?

482
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,237
He has brownies.

483
00:34:43,309 --> 00:34:47,590
What?

484
00:34:52,021 --> 00:34:55,399
Are you available to talk?

485
00:34:56,844 --> 00:35:02,440
I'm working on a report with friends and not finished yet
but you can leave any messages here.

486
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:05,640
Have you had anything yet?

487
00:35:07,966 --> 00:35:10,766
Is that all the reason you texted me to ask?
I've already eaten.

488
00:35:10,766 --> 00:35:12,610
I'm eating your brownies.

489
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:16,205
I'll send over some different treats for you to try next time.

490
00:35:16,205 --> 00:35:18,529
I promise it won’t be too sweet.

491
00:35:18,529 --> 00:35:23,710
Can I have your number?
I think it’d be better to talk on the phone.

492
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:29,320
Sorry, my hands are covered with brownie so it’s hard to type.

493
00:35:41,191 --> 00:35:41,790
Kla

494
00:35:46,263 --> 00:35:52,436
- Do you have any paracetamol?
- I'm sorry I don't know you're on the phone.

495
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:56,560
It's okay, but I don't have any paracetamol.

496
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:02,100
Okay. I'm sorry for disturbing you.

497
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:04,739
But I think you don't like sweets?

498
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:09,035
If it's this one, I can eat it.

499
00:36:11,574 --> 00:36:12,952
Okay.

500
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,660
You can go back to work with them while you wait for me.

501
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:19,130
I'll come after soon.

502
00:36:20,414 --> 00:36:24,240
It'll be curfew soon.

503
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,197
Hello

504
00:36:44,197 --> 00:36:45,552
Hi, Cake.

505
00:36:45,552 --> 00:36:49,228
Just a moment, I’ll get on the bed first.

506
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,521
Are you okay?

507
00:36:52,521 --> 00:36:57,126
I fell off the bed. I was just too hurry to pick up your call.
I didn’t want to keep you waiting too long.

508
00:36:58,576 --> 00:37:01,134
You hurt anywhere?

509
00:37:01,134 --> 00:37:02,818
Did you get hurt badly?

510
00:37:02,818 --> 00:37:05,171
Just a little bump on the elbow.

511
00:37:06,207 --> 00:37:10,400
If it hurts, don’t forget to apply some medication
and take some painkillers okay?

512
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,239
I got you.

513
00:37:11,239 --> 00:37:16,127
Once curfew is over, I’ll call you back when I get back to my room.

514
00:37:16,127 --> 00:37:22,040
Sure, Goodnight in advance!

515
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:35,531
[F: Everything you made for us was delicious.]

516
00:37:35,531 --> 00:37:38,795
Thank you. They say the same thing.

517
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,328
(How’s your elbow?)

518
00:37:43,866 --> 00:37:49,344
My elbow's better now.
[Kla! You're up early,] / [Daddy is here.]

519
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,082
[What happened to Cake?]
[Kla, are you teasing him?]

520
00:37:54,082 --> 00:37:55,680
[Cake, What happened?]

521
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,507
I'm fine. It's okay now.

522
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:01,468
Don't tell anyone okay, Kla?

523
00:38:02,545 --> 00:38:06,065
(You're telling me not to tell anyone
that you fell off the bed because trying to pick up my call?)

524
00:38:06,065 --> 00:38:07,052
You!
[What's fell down from the bed!?] / [So intense!!]

525
00:38:07,052 --> 00:38:07,953
Kla
[Did it really make him fall off the bed?] / [Don't be too rough with him!]

526
00:38:07,953 --> 00:38:09,678
[F: I got some Pinched Cookies for you.]

527
00:38:09,678 --> 00:38:11,953
[F: Will give to you soon.]

528
00:38:14,555 --> 00:38:19,163
(Kla: Don't forget to apply the medicine and take care of yourself, okay?)

529
00:38:19,163 --> 00:38:20,800
Okay. You woke up already?

530
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,703
Okay
[F: Where do you want me to drop the cookies?]

531
00:38:22,703 --> 00:38:24,240
You woke up already?

532
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:28,390
(Yes, I’ve been working too hard
so I didn’t get a chance to on Live with you.)

533
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:33,784
Get rest a lot okay?. Next time, don’t forget to join Live with me.

534
00:38:34,857 --> 00:38:36,814
[F: My internet connection bad or what?]
[F: Cake, do you see my messages here?]

535
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:38,614
[F: Cake!!!!]
I’m hungry now.

536
00:38:38,614 --> 00:38:42,497
Everyone, I have to end the Live now. See you next time!

537
00:38:42,497 --> 00:38:44,080
[F: Wait, Cake!!!]

538
00:38:46,188 --> 00:38:47,548
Bee, Look!

539
00:38:47,548 --> 00:38:53,359
- Here’s the reference.
- I made it.

540
00:38:55,859 --> 00:39:00,354
Kla's such a player. He just casually showed up on someone else’s Live
to ship himself and acted like nothing.

541
00:39:00,354 --> 00:39:03,880
Yeah, I saw it.

542
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:11,880
Do you know you're acting just like me right now?

543
00:39:12,667 --> 00:39:15,336
Remember when you said I was using Gam to create a ship hype?

544
00:39:17,987 --> 00:39:21,992
And also reminded me about Gam’s feelings.

545
00:39:21,992 --> 00:39:23,872
But you ended up doing it yourself.

546
00:39:26,191 --> 00:39:31,760
I’m doing the same as you, but the difference is
that I know exactly why I’m doing it.

547
00:39:32,291 --> 00:39:35,760
And I also accept my own feelings.

548
00:39:38,396 --> 00:39:42,440
Are you not picking up Gam today?

549
00:39:44,097 --> 00:39:47,370
I'm not going. I heard he said that his friend will drop him off at home.

550
00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:48,842
Just leave it.

551
00:39:49,298 --> 00:39:54,098
Why are you upset just because his friend dropped him off?

552
00:39:54,098 --> 00:39:56,572
So funny.

553
00:40:00,974 --> 00:40:03,945
I'm just laughing at people who don’t know their own feelings.

554
00:40:03,945 --> 00:40:07,558
You laughing? You know your own feelings really well?

555
00:40:08,096 --> 00:40:13,240
If I didn't, why I did it then?

556
00:40:14,931 --> 00:40:18,909
Do you like Cake?

557
00:40:18,909 --> 00:40:21,207
When did you like him?

558
00:40:22,574 --> 00:40:25,943
How do you know your own feelings?

559
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:31,498
What?

560
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,075
It's my business.

561
00:40:34,897 --> 00:40:38,697
- Don’t expect anything.
- Done.

562
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,889
The hype of the ship just keeps growing.

563
00:40:48,262 --> 00:40:51,115
Tim said the same thing like it's trending every day.

564
00:40:52,565 --> 00:40:55,644
Doesn’t Cake’s boyfriend mind this?

565
00:40:56,638 --> 00:41:02,283
I don’t have a boyfriend. What about you?
Doesn’t your boyfriend mind?

566
00:41:03,691 --> 00:41:05,046
If I had one,

567
00:41:05,046 --> 00:41:10,192
I wouldn’t be able to sit and chat with you every day like this, right?

568
00:41:13,547 --> 00:41:15,023
I don't have a boyfriend.

569
00:41:16,555 --> 00:41:20,925
What do you think I should bake?

570
00:41:20,925 --> 00:41:27,777
How about try making some Thai desserts
that aren't too sweet, like Pinched Cookies?

571
00:41:27,777 --> 00:41:30,185
Not sweet, too.

572
00:41:30,889 --> 00:41:35,901
Sounds interesting. But I haven't tried making before.
I’ll have to find some recipes first.

573
00:41:37,475 --> 00:41:41,949
Cake, there’s dragon fruit in the fridge. Feel free to grab some and eat it.

574
00:41:43,067 --> 00:41:48,868
Mom, I don’t eat dragon fruit. It’s all mushy and the seeds are too many.

575
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,187
Then there's only grapes. I’ve peeled them
and put them in the fridge. You can have them.

576
00:41:54,601 --> 00:41:56,752
Okay, Mom. I’ll get it later.

577
00:41:58,409 --> 00:42:00,000
What are you laughing at?

578
00:42:00,497 --> 00:42:07,294
Nothing. I just like how you use your name "Cake"
when you take with your mom. It sounds really cute.

579
00:42:08,992 --> 00:42:15,005
I need to go water my plants now.

580
00:42:17,572 --> 00:42:22,642
Okay, let's talk later then.

581
00:42:23,222 --> 00:42:24,646
See you later.

582
00:42:24,646 --> 00:42:26,400
Okay.

583
00:42:30,889 --> 00:42:32,780
Great. Let's go.

584
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:34,345
Come on Cake.

585
00:42:34,345 --> 00:42:36,880
Just a moment.

586
00:42:42,137 --> 00:42:44,377
Are you ready, Mom?

587
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:50,430
Hi everyone! Welcome back on Live.
Today, we're going to make some Pinched Cookies together!

588
00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:54,794
But today, I got a special guest joining us, and that is..

589
00:42:55,291 --> 00:43:02,690
Here's my Mom and Tim, our usual guest!

590
00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:04,946
Hi

591
00:43:05,609 --> 00:43:09,722
Hello everyone. I’m not really good at talking in front of the camera.

592
00:43:10,799 --> 00:43:14,156
It’s okay, Mom. Tim and I will support you.

593
00:43:15,316 --> 00:43:17,226
Go for it! Are you ready?

594
00:43:17,226 --> 00:43:17,882
Okay

595
00:43:17,882 --> 00:43:20,906
So, what's this?

596
00:43:20,906 --> 00:43:27,573
Flour. In the recipe, we’ll be using three types of flour.

597
00:43:27,863 --> 00:43:30,539
We’ve got tapioca flour.

598
00:43:30,539 --> 00:43:32,818
- Rice flour.
- Okay, rice flour.

599
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:35,716
And all-purpose wheat flour.

600
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,430
We also have salt and sugar.

601
00:43:40,430 --> 00:43:42,298
Here, we’ve already mixed it.

602
00:43:42,671 --> 00:43:46,713
We also have oil and...

603
00:43:47,417 --> 00:43:48,477
Calm down, Mom.

604
00:43:48,477 --> 00:43:49,481
Take a deep breath, Mom. Breathe.

605
00:43:49,481 --> 00:43:51,811
- Coconut milk.
- Yes! Coconut milk.

606
00:43:51,811 --> 00:44:00,175
And for the filling, you can choose between pork or fish.

607
00:44:00,175 --> 00:44:03,450
And today, we're making with pork floss with chili jam.

608
00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:07,119
Okay

609
00:44:34,106 --> 00:44:35,762
Here you're.

610
00:44:35,762 --> 00:44:38,477
Smell good?

611
00:44:38,477 --> 00:44:40,357
When it’s done, it’ll look like this.

612
00:44:41,558 --> 00:44:44,920
All done, everyone! Here are our Pinched Cookies.

613
00:44:45,956 --> 00:44:47,354
How does it look? Is it tasty?

614
00:44:47,354 --> 00:44:48,543
It looks really good!

615
00:44:48,543 --> 00:44:51,807
Cake, if you want to eat Pinched Cookies, just let me know.
I can buy some for you.

616
00:44:51,807 --> 00:44:55,882
It’s a bit hard, but you can try.
It’s not that hard actually.

617
00:44:55,882 --> 00:44:58,226
Alright, I have to end Live for today.

618
00:44:58,226 --> 00:45:01,312
And next time, we’ll be doing something new, stay tuned!

619
00:45:01,850 --> 00:45:04,477
Bye.

620
00:45:07,038 --> 00:45:08,031
How was it, Mom?

621
00:45:08,031 --> 00:45:09,099
Excited.

622
00:45:09,099 --> 00:45:11,480
Did you have fun?

623
00:45:13,947 --> 00:45:15,414
Let’s do Live again next time.

624
00:45:15,414 --> 00:45:16,431
What are we doing?

625
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:20,998
They were Live making Pinched Cookies.
Do you want to try some?

626
00:45:21,992 --> 00:45:25,760
Why do we need to go Live?
We're neither celebrities nor selling anything?

627
00:45:26,009 --> 00:45:30,551
It’s because of the pandemic.
They're just looking for some fun to do.

628
00:45:30,551 --> 00:45:32,438
You have too much free time then.

629
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,020
What's that box?

630
00:45:35,310 --> 00:45:39,821
From my senior.

631
00:45:39,821 --> 00:45:41,758
from Pun and Gam?

632
00:45:41,758 --> 00:45:43,506
Nope.

633
00:45:43,506 --> 00:45:46,570
If it’s not from those two, then who is it?

634
00:45:48,558 --> 00:45:55,342
This from a senior, I quite close to.
He asked me to make it, so I made it for him.

635
00:45:55,342 --> 00:46:01,280
Darling, why don’t we go try it in the kitchen?
I’ll fresh fry them more crispy for you.

636
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:12,962
Yes?

637
00:46:12,962 --> 00:46:16,497
Ay Yo! What's up Bro!? What're you doing?

638
00:46:16,497 --> 00:46:18,061
Working, so what?

639
00:46:18,558 --> 00:46:22,450
Damn! Our brother's still fierce and doesn’t care about anyone.
Still just as wild as ever.

640
00:46:23,568 --> 00:46:27,860
You don’t hang up your sister just yet. I’ve got a question.

641
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:34,415
Kong and I are super curious about
how our cool big brother became a social star.

642
00:46:34,415 --> 00:46:37,825
and how about Cake? Who is this?

643
00:46:37,825 --> 00:46:45,772
Mom, if you wanna know something, just ask me directly.
I know you’re listening on speakerphone.

644
00:46:47,429 --> 00:46:51,160
Oh my dear, you always keep up with me, my smart kid.

645
00:46:51,836 --> 00:46:56,412
Well, Mom, you always ask them to call me
whenever you wanna know something.

646
00:46:56,412 --> 00:47:03,299
I just want to know about Cake, who they're keep talking about.

647
00:47:03,299 --> 00:47:06,480
So what's it my son?

648
00:47:08,257 --> 00:47:12,145
Cake is just a friend of Pun and Gam.

649
00:47:12,145 --> 00:47:17,077
But, I have to say, Cake does seem pretty cute.

650
00:47:19,024 --> 00:47:23,257
What’s the story with you and Cake?
You usually don’t do social media stuff.

651
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:27,041
You don't do Live and if it's not for singing.

652
00:47:27,786 --> 00:47:32,197
So, what do you think, Mom?

653
00:47:32,570 --> 00:47:36,683
I think you're into him. Do you like him?

654
00:47:39,044 --> 00:47:43,331
Yes, I do like him.

655
00:47:43,331 --> 00:47:48,515
Bro you so Awesome! Kong, my brother likes Cake.

656
00:47:48,515 --> 00:47:51,840
That's all. Bye.

657
00:47:59,214 --> 00:48:00,814
Still eating microwave meals?

658
00:48:00,814 --> 00:48:06,992
I have to hurry finish my work.
Editing takes a lot of time, so I just grab whatever’s easy.

659
00:48:06,992 --> 00:48:10,120
Frozen food is pretty convenient. It’s not too hard.

660
00:48:11,694 --> 00:48:15,275
You're so cool. Balancing work and studying like that.

661
00:48:15,275 --> 00:48:20,403
I’m just studying and baking.
Nothing else I really want to do right now.

662
00:48:22,143 --> 00:48:27,805
I’m not that cool, really. Just doing what I enjoy for now.

663
00:48:28,136 --> 00:48:31,314
I dream of opening my own production house someday.

664
00:48:31,977 --> 00:48:34,748
So I’m taking on editing work to build my skills.

665
00:48:35,742 --> 00:48:40,633
But actually, I might not end up doing exactly what I want.

666
00:48:40,633 --> 00:48:41,883
Why?

667
00:48:41,883 --> 00:48:46,034
My family runs a resort and a pearl farm.

668
00:48:46,034 --> 00:48:48,875
So after graduation, I'll probably have to help out family business.

669
00:48:48,875 --> 00:48:52,555
For now, I’m just doing what I love.

670
00:48:53,466 --> 00:48:54,989
Same here.

671
00:48:54,989 --> 00:49:00,711
My family has a business too.
After I graduate, I’ll likely have to take it over.

672
00:49:00,711 --> 00:49:08,757
But I still don’t know if I’ll even like it or what I really want to do.

673
00:49:11,035 --> 00:49:14,964
Sometimes, it seems like being you would be nice.

674
00:49:16,082 --> 00:49:17,641
How?

675
00:49:18,676 --> 00:49:23,576
To have a clear dream and seriously chase it.

676
00:49:25,149 --> 00:49:28,409
I think it’s very cool when I see someone totally into what they love.

677
00:49:28,906 --> 00:49:33,190
And they go all in on it. That’s really impressive.

678
00:49:33,853 --> 00:49:38,254
But honestly, sometimes I envy people who don’t have a dream.

679
00:49:38,875 --> 00:49:44,603
They seem so happy with the present.
Chasing dreams can be exhausting.

680
00:49:45,059 --> 00:49:48,686
It’d be nice to take a break somehow.

681
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:54,014
I think I’ve got a dream .

682
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:57,425
What’s that?

683
00:49:57,425 --> 00:50:02,010
I want to be a cat. Just live a happy life.

684
00:50:02,963 --> 00:50:06,621
And enjoy everything around me.

685
00:50:07,408 --> 00:50:12,906
Then I guess I need to be a super successful cat slave.

686
00:50:12,906 --> 00:50:16,886
To make a lot of money to take care of and make my cat happy.

687
00:50:16,886 --> 00:50:20,040
And be really happy.

688
00:50:23,924 --> 00:50:25,550
I want to support you.

689
00:50:26,461 --> 00:50:30,175
I want to see you live out your dreams.

690
00:50:30,175 --> 00:50:34,010
Thank you. You’re really lovely, you know?

691
00:50:35,087 --> 00:50:41,896
You got even more cute when you
started calling yourself with your name "Cake".

692
00:50:47,048 --> 00:50:50,200
Because we’re getting pretty close.

693
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:55,079
Why are you so cute?

694
00:50:56,468 --> 00:50:58,451
Have you eaten yet?

695
00:50:58,451 --> 00:51:02,945
I had Panang curry.

696
00:51:02,945 --> 00:51:07,115
Alright, I have to grab some food and get back to work.

697
00:51:07,819 --> 00:51:11,256
Goodnight in advance then.

698
00:51:12,084 --> 00:51:19,079
Sweet dreams! If you’re sleepy, just go to bed.
Byeee.

699
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:38,569
Hey guys, the COVID situation is getting better now.

700
00:51:38,569 --> 00:51:41,260
The university says we can back to study onsite next week.

701
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:44,317
See you at the university then. Bye.

702
00:51:44,690 --> 00:51:46,241
Bye, Professor.

703
00:51:47,567 --> 00:51:50,829
Bye, everyone.

704
00:52:08,020 --> 00:52:10,318
Hello, F.

705
00:52:13,961 --> 00:52:18,627
So excited! Let’s go having BBQ at our favorite place.

706
00:52:23,276 --> 00:52:25,106
That's all for now.

707
00:52:26,555 --> 00:52:28,110
Hi, Kla.

708
00:52:28,566 --> 00:52:31,856
Hi, Cake. What're you doing?

709
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:34,285
I've just finished class.

710
00:52:35,031 --> 00:52:39,480
I have something to tell you.

711
00:52:39,729 --> 00:52:43,932
- What is it?
I’m about to be back on campus. I’m so excited!

712
00:52:43,932 --> 00:52:45,543
That I'm going back to study there.

713
00:52:46,744 --> 00:52:50,286
I’m going back to study at the university too.

714
00:52:50,286 --> 00:52:56,557
But if we’re back to study on campus, will we actually get to meet?

715
00:52:56,557 --> 00:52:58,999
Our universities are so far actually.

716
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:04,656
So what? Even though we’re far, we still chat online.

717
00:53:05,112 --> 00:53:11,480
If we're back to study onsite, It won’t be hard to meet up.

718
00:53:15,003 --> 00:53:17,777
Distance doesn’t matter. I’ll come to see you no matter how far.

719
00:53:19,309 --> 00:53:21,545
I got you.
