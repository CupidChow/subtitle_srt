00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:23,170
How is Mr. Yoneda?

4
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:28,100
He lost a dangerous amount of blood from his abdomen.
Thankfully, we were able to stop it in time.

5
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:31,660
The rest will depend on Mr. Yoneda himself.

6
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:41,140
He'll be fine.

7
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:43,480
The guy's got guts.

8

Mr. Yoneda will be fine, I'm certain.

Were you able to make the delivery?

Yes.

during the time Mr. Shimano and Mr. Yoneda got stabbed.

16
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:40,950
His alibi is almost too perfect.

That helmet covers his face.

18
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:47,430
He most likely hired a double to cover for him.

00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:54,020

Why choose such an out-of-the-way location?

Mr. Yoneda, too. Though I guess he technically isn't dead.

I honestly expected more of a reaction. What gives?

186
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:58,840
- Wait, here?
- Yes, here.

187
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,720
For you.

188
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,850
How adorable.

189
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,080
May I try it on?

190
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,660
Of course.

191
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,330
Looks good on you.

192
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:48,300
Thank you.

193
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:09,620
Well then.

194
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,200
Yeah.

195
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:20,630
Good night.

196
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:31,870
Night.

197
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:19,200
Dad!

198
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,600
Promise you'll stay by my side, forever.

199
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,810
Haruto's been acting off.

200
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:57,940
You were shouldering that burden on your own?

201
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:59,610
- Please break up with me.
- No.

202
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:03,390
I cannot stand to see Mr. Tateishi like this.

203
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:05,020
Mr. Tateishi!
