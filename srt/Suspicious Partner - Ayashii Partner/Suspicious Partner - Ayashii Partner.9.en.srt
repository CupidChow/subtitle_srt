1
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:05,240
I've experienced a painful end, numerous times now.

2
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,790
That was why I was terrified to start anything with you.

3
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:18,040
So the moment I realized my feelings for you...

4
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,720
I chose to run from them.

5
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:27,230
Don't... Don't fall in love with me.

6
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:31,520
But I was only making a futile effort.

7
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,630
Because I had already been drawn to you,
long before I was even aware.

8
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,770
Let me hire you.

9
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:57,460
The one thing I know now...

10
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:02,200
is that the inevitable has finally begun.

11
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:06,470
I was about to knock.

12
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:10,220
And I was on my way to the living room.

13
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:13,710
I see.

14
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,890
Yum.

15
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:36,000
I want to talk about what happened earlier.

16
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,510
I know it was an accident.

17
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,680
Don't worry, it doesn't bother me.

18
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:46,430
But... it bothers me.

19
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:51,570
I've already decided to move on from you, Mr. Tateishi.

20
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:54,910
So I won't get my hopes up this time either.

21
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:57,130
It'd only hurt more if I did.

22
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:06,410
I enjoy our current set up, sir.

23
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:08,960
I'd rather not let this ruin it.

24
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:20,000
Night.

25
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,870
Could I have a minute?

26
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:39,120
You had your time to monologue last night.

27
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,050
Now it's my turn.

28
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,160
Your turn?

29
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:50,250
I was far too late in realizing how I feel.

30
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:54,650
During that time, I had convinced you to move on.

31
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:57,030
And I'll respect your decision.

32
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:07,000
Just, one more thing.

33
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:12,720
I won't ask you to give me another chance.

34
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,630
But I want you to respect how I feel, if you can.

35
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:23,730
At the very least...

36
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:25,850
let me long for you as I wish.

37
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:32,670
We can continue our life here together.

38
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:40,650
And if you ever have a change of heart,
please give me that second chance.

39
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,700
Did you forget to breathe again?

40
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:08,260
I'll be waiting, so take all the time you need.

41
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:15,800
Then you'll be waiting your whole life.

42
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,370
I've already endured so much suffering.

43
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:21,620
You've lost your chance.

44
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,710
I'm sorry.

45
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:29,120
Just continue to wait.

46
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,600
And don't be surprised if it's until the day you die.

47
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,850
I won't.

48
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:52,620
Haruto, can you turn on the news now?

49
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:04,880
Earlier this morning, Yuma Momoi was found dead in Fujikita City.

50
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:12,430
He was found with a weapon
police believe was used to murder Mr. Ryujiro Haneda.

51
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:14,270
But that's not all.

52
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:18,420
Momoi had a piece of paper with an address on him.

53
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:28,610
It was for the building next to Ms. Miyashita's old apartment.

54
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:32,240
Police found a body in the water tank there.

55
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,870
A body?

56
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,660
After some investigating,

57
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:39,360
the body is believed to be from March of 2023.

58
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,250
Which happens to be around the time Sota Aoki was killed.

59
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:45,210
I'll call again if anything new crops up.

60
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:49,190
This is all too calculated.

61
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:51,830
Almost as if someone planned this all along.

62
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:53,470
But who?

63
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:12,650
Sakura.

64
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,080
"Sakura"?

65
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:24,220
Could you stay within my sight, for all 24 hours of the day?

66
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,990
What?

67
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:31,670
I meant nothing weird by it.

68
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,860
So bitter.

69
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,340
You're the one who bought it.

70
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:47,730
Oh, that tea.

71
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:49,850
It truly is bitter.

72
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:53,180
But I drink it every day.

73
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:03,040
How long have you suffered from insomnia?

74
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:10,040
Since I was a child.

75
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:17,380
It began when I lost my parents in a house fire.

76
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:23,830
I haven't had a good night of rest since.

77
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:33,060
I also lost my father when I was young.

78
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:35,920
You did?

79
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:41,260
But I'll save my story for another day.

80
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,250
Sure.

81
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,620
That is so bitter.

82
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,130
Ms. Sakura!

83
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,930
Sorry for rushing in like that...

84
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:31,750
- Are you alright?
- Yes, thank you.

85
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:35,000
What brings you to this area, Mr. Inaba?

86
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,310
Did anything break?

87
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:54,260
No, it's working just fine.

88
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:58,600
Nice seeing you.

89
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:23,640
Breathe, and think carefully.

90
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:31,950
You're the only one who can save me now.

91
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:36,630
He bought my empathy, and strategically got close to me.

92
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:39,720
He wanted to see if I would catch on.

93
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:47,190
If my hypothesis is the truth...

94
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:52,140
I declare the accused, not guilty.

95
00:11:56,830 --> 00:12:01,470
Then I've helped the culprit himself.

96
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:09,590
I made Mr. Tateishi stand up for a murderer.

97
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:25,220
I told you not to leave the house without me.

98
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,040
Are you alright?

99
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:37,270
Yes.

100
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,830
Sakura.

101
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:16,800
Could you fall in love with me?

102
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:23,370
I know I promised to wait.

103
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,920
I'm sorry.

104
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:33,650
But I want you to fall for me, now.

105
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:53,830
Did something happen?

106
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,010
I'm just tired.

107
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,210
Is this about Inaba?

108
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:20,420
I heard that song playing from Mr. Inaba's phone.

109
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:24,700
Maybe, Mr. Inaba is...

110
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:27,550
The true culprit.

111
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:29,350
You already noticed?

112
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:31,120
Yeah.

113
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,260
Why didn't you tell me?

114
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:36,000
Because I wasn't absolutely sure at that point.

115
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:41,210
I've caused you trouble again...

116
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:44,140
You don't need to worry about that.

117
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:49,860
- Still...
- I'll overcome this hardship together with you, Sakura.

118
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:52,870
Even if you choose to shove me aside.

119
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:57,260
I won't let that bastard get away with this.

120
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:04,160
In any case, the choice is yours, Sakura.

121
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:09,900
Do you want to overcome this together, or on our own?

122
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:15,430
I want to overcome this hardship together, with you.

123
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,190
The choice is yours, Sakura.

124
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:15,970
Do you want to overcome this together, or on our own?

125
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,430
Mr. Tateishi.

126
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:37,720
I have something very important to tell you.

127
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,420
What is it?

128
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:49,130
From now on, I've decided to be true to myself, and live as I wish.

129
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:56,030
So, let's call this day one.

130
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,760
That's all.

131
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:03,050
Day one? Of what?

132
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:06,200
Of our relationship. We're dating now.

133
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,790
So that's what she meant.

134
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:16,580
Day one...

135
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:18,720
My girlfriend...

136
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:23,670
- Oranges?
- Yes, please.

137
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:55,760
That's all for day one.

138
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:04,800
She's a worthy opponent.

139
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,920
Did something good happen?

140
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,580
No.

141
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,370
- Something definitely happened.
- Nope.

142
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:24,910
- I'm right, aren't I?
- Nuh-uh.

143
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:29,590
Oh, right. We found a picture of Momoi from high school, sir.

144
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:40,940
Momoi was Ryujiro Haneda's classmate, and good friend.

145
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:42,410
Who are the other two?

146
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:45,560
Masashi Tabata, and Daisuke Shimano.

147
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:49,020
Tabata has apparently been radio silent for a while now.

148
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,800
- Hello?
- We've identified the body found in the water tank.

149
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,160
- The victim was Masashi -
- Tabata.

150
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,380
You knew?

151
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,670
I do now.

152
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:07,080
So, when did he go missing?

153
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:11,620
Momoi went missing after he contacted us to share information.

154
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:17,440
And his upperclassman from high school, Masashi Tabata,
turned up as a dead body.

155
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,220
When did Tabata go radio silent?

156
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:24,420
The day Sota Aoki was found dead in Miyashita's apartment.

157
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:28,330
Are these two incidents tied to one another?

158
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:32,060
I'll look into this "Shimano".

159
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:35,300
Please do. I'll investigate more on Inaba's acquaintances.

160
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,250
I'll join you.

161
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:41,860
No, you won't. Messing with Inaba any further is too dangerous.

162
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:44,020
You stay here, Sakura.

163
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:47,060
Yes, sir.

164
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,430
"Sakura"?

165
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,540
Hello?

166
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:20,060
Yes.

167
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:22,900
I see.

168
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,010
I'll try heading there right away.

169
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:29,570
[Haruto Tateishi]

170
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:34,360
The individual you have called is currently unavailable.

171
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:37,020
Please leave a message after the beep.

172
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,910
We've tracked down Shimano's location.

173
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:42,540
He returned from the United States earlier today.

174
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:46,300
We have to take action before Inaba finds him.

175
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:49,180
I'll send Shimano's address your way.

176
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:52,100
Thank you again.

177
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:30,000
Long time no see, Shimano.

178
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:59,650
Can you hear me, Mr. Yoneda?

179
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,510
Mr. Yoneda?

180
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:06,020
Mr. Yoneda?

181
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:09,050
Mr. Yoneda, are you there?

182
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:26,020
Mr. Yoneda!

183
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:27,920
Mr. Yoneda! Mr. Yoneda!

184
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,930
Mr. Yoneda!

185
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:34,350
Mr. Yoneda!

186
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,790
For now, we prepare.

187
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:42,380
I'm about to say something crucial, so listen well. I killed him.

188
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:44,280
Why are you doing this?

189
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,440
Could you please leave me alone already?

190
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,700
Haruto bought time for us.

191
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:49,990
Who's this?

192
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:52,440
I need to ask you for a favor.

193
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,780
You'll owe me.

194
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:56,090
Why did you do something so rash?

195
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:58,090
Want to go on a date tomorrow?

196
00:23:58,090 --> 00:23:59,570
A date?

197
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:02,370
It'll be our first date.
