1
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:10,420
You alone believed in my side of things, Ms. Miyashita.

2
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:13,530
I would like to thank you somehow.

3
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:17,470
You give me too much credit. I was only doing my job.

4
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:25,690
No, not at all.

5
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:28,170
You flatter me.

6
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:31,100
Yes? Oh, go ahead.

7
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:34,950
Would you like to grab a meal with me sometime?

8
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:37,010
Yes, I'd love to.

9
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:39,980
Really?

10
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:41,800
Of course.

11
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:50,670
Then how does lunch next Wednesday sound?

12
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,950
Great.

13
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:58,830
I'll call again to hash out the specifics.

14
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:09,450
Who was that?

15
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:12,320
Mr. Inaba. He invited me to lunch as a show of gratitude.

16
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,180
I have every right to be thanked as well. I'm joining.

17
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,480
Schedule that meal on your own time.

18
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,010
You plan on going alone?

19
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:21,070
- Yes?
- You can't.

20
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:22,830
Why?

21
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:25,570
I was also his lawyer.

22
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:26,810
Let's dine as a group.

23
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:30,060
I was the only one invited. Lunch will be the two of us.

24
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,380
Look...

25
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,680
You're not my boyfriend. Please don't meddle in my affairs.

26
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,150
Nice weather we're having today.

27
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,950
I suppose.

28
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,900
Do you need to be so stoic?

29
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,100
We're only coworkers, sir.

30
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:59,830
Don't smile in my presence ever again.

31
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:18,700
Sir, could I have a minute? I'd like to discuss something with you.

32
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:41,100
Sir. Please stay away from her.

33
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,290
What?

34
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:48,050
I understand you feel the need
to project your anger towards someone.

35
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:52,330
Even so, I ask that you show some restraint.

36
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:57,400
Unlike you I've vowed to protect and uphold the law.

37
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:02,660
But if you choose to harass her regardless,

38
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:05,340
I may have to step off that path myself.

39
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:10,050
Is that a threat?

40
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,790
Yes.

41
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,730
Why did you cover me?

42
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:24,790
Your strife with the Chief Prosecutor
is partially my business as well.

43
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:30,250
Mr. Tateishi, it was my fault you had to step down
as a prosecutor.

44
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:37,700
You were right. We truly are tied by fate in a bad way.

45
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:44,790
- That was -
- Please just leave me be.

46
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:56,700
Can I really move on from him?

47
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,510
Maybe I'm asking the impossible.

48
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:13,260
Hey.

49
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:20,330
Why did they find a "button" I never dropped?

50
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:22,650
I don't know.

51
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:25,540
Sorry, I must've slipped up.

52
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:29,200
Slipped up.

53
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,220
I suppose everyone makes a mistake at least once.

54
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:49,290
But only once.

55
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:54,590
It wasn't on purpose, I swear.

56
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:59,010
If you keep making these "slip-ups",

57
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:02,050
they're no longer simple "mistakes".

58
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:06,830
You want to turn your back on me.

59
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,550
Help me see this through to the end, alright?

60
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:20,950
Don't forget, you've got sins to atone.

61
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,290
Just one more.

62
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,790
I'll keep in touch.

63
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,370
Right.

64
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,400
What is it?

65
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:21,570
I have to stop worrying about him.

66
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:23,470
Nothing.

67
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,210
I looked into Inaba's connections and background.

68
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:43,700
He no longer has any family, nor does he have close friends.

69
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:51,570
Then could you check to see if any deceased family
or old friend fell victim to some crime?

70
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:53,010
Yes sir.

71
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:01,650
Holding up alright?

72
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:03,660
With Haruto and all that.

73
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:08,830
I've come up with a solution.

74
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:10,930
Mr. Tateishi is now my idol.

75
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:14,070
What does that entail?

76
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:20,010
I will simply gaze from afar, and be satisfied with that.

77
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,060
I'm managing to detach all romantic feelings for him as well.

78
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:32,870
I believe I'm about 93% of the way there.

79
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:36,040
But really?

80
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:42,000
I'm only at 30%.

81
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:56,430
Here, I'll throw you a bone.

82
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:58,220
What do you mean?

83
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,960
Come here.

84
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:03,520
Now laugh.

85
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,390
Trust me, laugh.

86
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:08,540
More.

87
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,420
Nice smile.

88
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:26,130
Please don't act so immature.

89
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:34,610
I'll have to get going.

90
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:36,350
Where are you headed?

91
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:39,420
To lunch, with Mr. Inaba.

92
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:42,010
A date with Mr. Inaba? Sounds fun.

93
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:44,220
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

94
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:00,680
You quit your job?

95
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:07,330
Yes. I was only a contract worker,
and being in custody... Well, you know.

96
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:12,310
I understand. I lost my place by the time I was let out as well.

97
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:17,130
Allow me to help with the job search.

98
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:19,980
Thank you, but it's alright.

99
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,870
I couldn't trouble you any more.

100
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,910
Still...

101
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:27,770
You truly are so kind, Ms. Miyashita.

102
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:31,040
I envy your significant other.

103
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:35,160
I have no such other in my life.

104
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,620
- You don't?
- No.

105
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,600
That's unexpected.

106
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,420
Then is there someone you have feelings for?

107
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:55,050
I'm sorry, I overstepped my boundaries with that one.

108
00:10:57,410 --> 00:11:01,620
As a matter of fact, I confessed to them recently.

109
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:04,010
But...

110
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:06,950
But?

111
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:15,260
I was told not to love them, and have decided to move on.

112
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,790
Personally, I would have said yes.

113
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:26,950
I would go out with you, Ms. Sakura.

114
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,850
Please don't jest -

115
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:33,950
I'm being entirely serious right now.

116
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:41,420
Welcome!

117
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:43,450
A table for one, sir?

118
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:45,730
- Are you alright?
- Y-Yes, fine.

119
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:48,210
My apologies, sir.

120
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:50,010
Mr. Tateishi?

121
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:57,610
Oh? What a coincidence.

122
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:59,810
- Wow...
- Care to join us?

123
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:02,040
It's fine, but what a coincidence.

124
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,440
Let's meet again sometime.

125
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,290
- You wouldn't mind?
- Of course.

126
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:16,880
We were rudely interrupted today, after all.

127
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:20,250
Then I'll reach out again.

128
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,450
I look forward to it.

129
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,040
Have a good one.

130
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:34,810
Care to explain yourself?

131
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:37,290
- What?
- Why did you follow me?

132
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:39,830
I don't know what you're talking about.

133
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:41,580
Tell me why, now.

134
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:45,930
No real reason.

135
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:54,630
Don't just clam up on me, Mr. Tateishi.

136
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:02,600
I want an answer.

137
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,860
- Something's off with that guy.
- And your proof?

138
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:08,670
I'll tell you as soon as I have something concrete.

139
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:11,200
- Tell me now.
- I can't.

140
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,720
Not now.

141
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,760
Then no more tailing after me.

142
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:27,970
I know he's involved in this somehow...

143
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:42,060
If the accused committed no robbery,
then the reason for this murder falls through completely.

144
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,840
That is all from the Defense.

145
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:54,080
I declare the accused, not guilty.

146
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:21,480
What did you need from me, sir?

147
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,870
Do you know of a "Ryujiro Haneda"?

148
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:30,020
No sir.

149
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:33,820
Then what about a "Takahiko Inaba"?

150
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:37,330
I do not know who that is either.

151
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:43,680
Then why did you come to every one of his hearings?

152
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:50,990
The case piqued my interest, sir.

153
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:54,250
Your interest? How so?

154
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,790
I'm glad we spoke today.

155
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,060
Know that I'm on your side.

156
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:11,410
If anything crops up, feel free to call.

157
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:17,400
I will aid you in any way I can.

158
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:36,600
What?

159
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:41,000
You were looking for the photograph
that disappeared from Mr. Haneda's home, right?

160
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,810
Well we found it at his sister's place.

161
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:45,830
Send a picture of it to me.

162
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:50,200
No can do. This is evidence.

163
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,660
I'll be right over.

164
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:58,680
This was the photograph we found.

165
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:07,770
Someone was taking revenge.

166
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:09,660
Most likely.

167
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:23,370
Then our culprit could be a woman he wronged,

168
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:28,300
or perhaps someone related to them.

169
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:55,310
Hello?

170
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,640
This is Momoi, from the forensics team.

171
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,270
Ah, from back then.

172
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:05,280
Ms. Miyashita, there's something I wish to speak with you about.

173
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,950
What is it?

174
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:15,260
I wanted to tell you who bought those shoes you found.

175
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,840
Who was it?

176
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,800
No, let's speak in person.

177
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,040
I will head your way shortly.

178
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:52,240
Thanks, this is a huge lead.

179
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:04,790
Don't go.

180
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:32,450
[Miyashita: Momoi from forensics wished to speak with me.
I'll be meeting him at Fujikita Park.]

181
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:14,660
Hello?

182
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:17,460
Where are you right now?

183
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:21,760
Sorry, I'm out.

184
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,950
Is that so.

185
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:29,670
I'm a bit caught up in something. I'll call again later.

186
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,790
"Busy"? You're just standing around in a park.

187
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,830
Found you.

188
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:56,100
Jeez, don't scare me like that!

189
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,720
I felt my heart leap up into my throat.

190
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,530
That's how I feel.

191
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:03,560
Why did you come here alone?

192
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:06,030
Use that head of yours.

193
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:08,260
What if something happened to you?

194
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,810
What happens to me?

195
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:12,950
Then what should I have done?

196
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:15,460
You weren't answering your phone.

197
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:18,000
- Wait until I arrive.
- I did.

198
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,200
That's why I never entered the park itself.

199
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,750
I thought you would get mad if something were to happen.

200
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:32,800
I never saw Mr. Momoi, so I left to wait out here,
scared out of my mind.

201
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:01,440
Atone...

202
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,090
Atone your sins!

203
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:07,020
I... can't take it anymore!

204
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:58,690
I'm sorry for the trouble I caused today.

205
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:02,120
Likewise.

206
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:05,580
Sorry.

207
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:11,010
Was that a sincere apology?

208
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:15,660
It was.

209
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,830
Your expression will tell me the truth.

210
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,870
You meant it alright.

211
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,780
[Preview]

212
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:38,490
I've come to realize my feelings far too late.

213
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:41,440
At least let me feel for you.

214
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,010
You've lost your chance.

215
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:44,420
They found a body.

216
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:48,220
He strategically got close, to see if I would catch on.

217
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:50,710
Don't mess with Inaba again. It's too dangerous.

218
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:53,280
I will overcome this hardship together with Sakura.

219
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,630
I want you to fall for me, now.

220
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:57,300
Sakura, the choice is yours.

221
00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:00,250
This will mark our first day together.

222
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:02,900
That's all for day one.

223
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,020
She's a worthy opponent.
