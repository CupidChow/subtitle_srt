00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,240
The culprit came.

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,800
The one who murdered Sota.

3
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,410
Say what?

4
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:17,770
They're... still here.

5
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:26,590
Wait!

6
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,630
Are you alright?

7
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:58,140
They got away.

8
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,960
Unbelievable...

9
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:06,920
I told you to stay out of harm's way.

10
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:12,760
Don't chase the culprit. That's too dangerous.

11
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,730
I won't.

12
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,310
Goosebumps racked my whole body.

13
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:05,800
I could sense someone else was in the room.

14
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,840
Suddenly, that very presence ran out the door.

15
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:13,710
I overcame my fear and chased after the culprit,
only to lose them, and fast.

16
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:16,480
Why do you sound like you're enjoying this?

17
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,380
I am not.

18

If you insist.

19
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:23,690
Are you worried about me, again?

20
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:28,830
Don't misunderstand.
Even a passerby would worry, given the situation.

21
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:33,950
The panic of this whole debacle almost made me forget.

22
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,640
I tried to end my one-sided crush on him.

23
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,180
Why are you so reckless anyway?

24
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:48,060
You could've been killed.

25
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:51,270
With my circumstances, I'll probably starve to death first.

26
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:55,410
I'll be closing my firm for good.

27
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:57,480
Why?

28
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:01,630
It doesn't matter. No other law firms want me.

29
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:06,310
Especially since I "killed" the Chief Prosecutor's son.

30
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:09,190
- Point taken.
- See?

31
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:12,730
To clear your name, we'll have to catch the culprit.

32
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:14,520
- Right.
- Together.

33
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,100
Right.

34
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:24,670
In any case, you're in danger here.

35
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:26,050
Right?

36
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:39,490
I put myself under a restraining order.

37
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:42,100
But circumstances are circumstances, right?

38
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:46,690
It's more dangerous to be alone.

Back then, did we...

Never mind.

Agh, this is so embarrassing!

00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:26,680
Sorry. Just talking to myself.

So did you not see the intruder's face, ma'am?

55

Unfortunately, no.

That's a real shame.

No need.

But could I have some water?

60
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:52,760
Of course.

And?

66
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:58,250
There was a car parked outside her office.

00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:08,420
It was yours, sir.

What, did you come to complain?

70
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,940
No, sir.

71
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:18,640
I came to ask for a favor.

72
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,580
Does your vehicle have a dash cam by any chance?

73
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:28,800
Your car was the only vehicle parked in the area, sir.

74
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:35,410
Unfortunately, that car has no camera installed in it.

What is it you're looking for?

00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:42,290
Don't tell me it's the "culprit" that woman is insistent about?

That's exactly it, sir.

Why do you believe that woman?

79
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,560
What I believe are the circumstances and evidence we have.

If she is innocent,

81
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,820

Myself, for what I've done...

And you, sir, for forging evidence, and placing the blame on her.

You picked another fight with the Chief Prosecutor?

How long will you continue to obsess over this case?

87
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:50,570
The case is my responsibility as well.

88
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:53,320
- Are you doing this for Ms. Miyashita?
- No.

89
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:58,620
She put a wrench in my life. I don't want anything to do with her.

90
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,430
The two years I spent without her...

91
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:12,680
were nothing but peace and quiet.

Yesterday's became today, today's became tomorrow,

93
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,000
and the days started to blend together.

94

Every day that passed was a repeat of the usual routine.

184
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:41,150
- Here is my resume.
- Oh, no need for that.

185
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:43,440
Let's get to know one another over drinks, yeah?

186
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,740
Say, could you stand for us?

187
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,430
- Go ahead.
- Yes, sir.

188
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,000
Yeah, a shorter skirt would probably do.

189
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:57,060
Think she's job hunting?

190
00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:00,060
Like I'd know.

191
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:02,790
Excuse me, could I get another beer?

192
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,550
Yes, sir.

193
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:07,580
Weren't you heading home?

194
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:11,800
I suddenly feel like drinking another glass.

195
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:18,040
[Toilet]

196
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:24,090
Who are those people?

197
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,140
They're from a law firm. I'm applying to join them.

198
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:33,850
Who holds an interview at a bar? That's unheard of.

199
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:35,710
I don't care.

200
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:39,100
Beggars can't be choosers.

201
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:41,880
That's no reason to entertain those sleaze bags.

202
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:45,350
Sleaze bag or not, they gave me a chance.

203
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:49,530
Take your time, and find a better job.

204
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:52,030
I don't have that sort of time.

205
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:56,430
I can't trouble you as a freeloader any more than I already have.

206
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:03,770
Ms. Miyashita, you're hired. Come to our office next week.

207
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:06,080
Really? Thank you so much.

208
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,140
You'd be the perfect visiting attorney.

209
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,630
Visiting attorney?

210
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:16,010
You'll visit clients in prison, and listen to their woes.

211
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:20,220
Just give them a bit of your pity, you know?

212
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:24,320
- Well...
- And here's the thing.

213
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,960
You need to up the sex appeal.

214
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:31,510
Our clients love short skirts and skimpy shirts, after all.

215
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:41,150
We're glad to have you. Let's drink till morning!

216
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:42,830
An excellent idea.

217
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:46,580
Don't ridicule me.

218
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:06,240
Don't entertain these swines.

219
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,540
It wastes the good alcohol.

220
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:17,230
- Let's go.
- Right.

221
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:21,930
Was that a highball?

222
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:23,680
Yes, a strong one.

223
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,220
Damn it...

224
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:32,370
I'm sorry I caused you more trouble.

225
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:35,220
I promise to be out of your place by next week.

226
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:48,600
You're... no trouble.

227
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:54,440
Let me hire you.

228
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,310
Agh, my head...

229
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:35,500
Finally awake?

230
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:51,870
W-Why are you acting so shy?

231
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:59,010
Quit it. You're not making sense.

232
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:05,020
Don't tell me. Last night, did we...

233
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:07,520
No, of course not.

234
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:12,780
- Well...
- "Well"? I'd appreciate a solid answer.

235
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:15,910
Well...

236
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:20,000
What have I done?

237
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:32,100
Yes?

238
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:35,430
Haruto.

239
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:38,620
Long time no see.

240
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:44,050
Dense as I may be, a glance was all I needed to connect the dots.

241
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:49,680
She was the one who betrayed him.

242
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:51,750
A letter of resignation?

243
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:54,890
I'm sure this is Haruto's own way of taking responsibility.

244
00:23:54,890 --> 00:24:00,310
You're brazen. But that's another charm of yours.

245
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:02,220
Haruto, I want to be here for you.

246
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:05,060
This is my last day here, in this home.
