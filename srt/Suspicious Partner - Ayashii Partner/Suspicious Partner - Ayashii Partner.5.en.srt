1
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,550
Haruto.

2
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,730
Long time no see.

3
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:15,020
Dense as I may be, a glance was all I needed to connect the dots.

4
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:19,830
She was the one who betrayed him.

5
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,560
I haven't seen you ever since you quit as a prosecutor.

6
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,420
What are you up to nowadays?

7
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:30,330
- I'm busy.
- I want to talk.

8
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,390
We have nothing to talk about.

9
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:34,440
Please, leave.

10
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,800
Who's there at the door?

11
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:44,390
You're from the cafe yesterday.

12
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:49,010
Hello! Did you need anything from my boyfriend?

13
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:52,850
You're dating him?

14
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:57,000
Yes, I am his girlfriend.

15
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:01,440
- Really?
- No, she's -

16
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,170
Yes. He confessed to me
with an entire bouquet of roses just last year.

17
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:07,670
Right, Harupyon?

18
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:09,400
"Pyon"?

19
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,470
- Now if you'll excuse us.
- "Pyon"?

20
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:24,320
What was all that about?

21
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,150
I'm repaying the favor.

22
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:27,730
Favor?

23
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:29,780
You saved me in a similar manner before.

24
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:34,540
When I set eyes on her, it was love at first sight.

25
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:37,890
I won't ever forget it.

26
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:41,060
That's nothing worth remembering.

27
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:43,020
But it is.

28
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,720
It's an important moment to me.

29
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,240
Damn it, I'll be late.

30
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:57,950
And drop the "H-Harupyon", alright?

31
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:00,790
Have a great day, Harupyon.

32
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,950
And there. Looking sharp, sir.
[Happy Birthday]

33
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:55,240
Is this really necessary?

34
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,870
Absolutely. Where's Haruto?

35
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,360
It's not lying flat.

36
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,570
- Stop fussing.
- Then fix it.

37
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:04,930
I apologize for running late.

38
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:09,770
You have some nerve, coming in late on my birthday.

39
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:15,260
Sorry, sir. But why are we celebrating in the office?

40
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:17,800
You two wouldn't bother if we did it after hours.

41
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,790
- Touche.
- Touche.

42
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:21,020
Did you just agree with him?

43
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,310
Here's my gift! It's a bottle of wine from your birth year, sir.

44
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:27,970
Really? Thanks.

45
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:31,600
Jeez, you weren't kidding!

46
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,480
You've got taste, I'll give you props for that.

47
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,720
I'll be sure to enjoy it.

48
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:43,540
- And?
- Yes, I brought a gift as well. Here.

49
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,560
You were late buying this?

50
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,370
Sorry, Haruto.

51
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:51,200
Didn't mean to doubt you. Can I read this card?

52
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,040
Of course.

53
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:57,560
"Letter of Resignation".

54
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,790
- Say what?
- I appreciated all your guidance, sir.

55
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:02,620
Then if you'll excuse me.

56
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:05,040
What? I don't understand!

57
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,900
Haruto? Haruto!

58
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,830
Come back for cake!

59
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:12,580
Ren? Ren! Ren, what're you looking at?

60
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:33,040
Hungry?

61
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:40,200
Starving.

62
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:59,950
Quit questioning me.

63
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:03,460
- I haven't said a word.
- Your eyes have.

64
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,480
Then I'll verbalize it as well.

65
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,950
What happened between you and the person who visited?

66
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:21,380
Please tell me.

67
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:24,140
Or else I'll be up all night wondering,

68
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:27,840
- and stuck in bed in the morning.
- That second one is your own issue.

69
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,700
Busted, huh?

70
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:41,810
I found her alone with another man in my house.

71
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,590
That's all.

72
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:52,230
Unbelievable. I'll sock her a good one next time I see her.

73
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:55,010
Want me to badmouth her for you?

74
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:58,060
She's a goddamn cheater.

75
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:01,030
Don't bother. And I'd never say that.

76
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:05,370
If you ever feel like cussing someone out, I'll handle it for you.

77
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,800
You're kind in the subtlest ways, aren't you?

78
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,880
I'm upfront with my kindness, mind you.

79
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,280
Oh? Does that apply to me as well?

80
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,770
Whatever I've done for you,
I do out of my love for humanity.

81
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:24,100
Love, you say?

82
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:27,090
Right, for humanity.

83
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:32,780
[Love for humanity: someone who loves all people,
not a specific individual]

84
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:38,390
Love, for humanity.

85
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:40,600
Fine.

86
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:44,540
This is my last day here, in this home.

87
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:47,030
A letter of resignation?

88
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:50,390
I thought you ought to know.

89
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,190
In my opinion,

90
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:56,530
this is Haruto's way of taking responsibility.

91
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:58,220
You see,

92
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,680
our firm has made an enemy of various prosecutors.

93
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,420
Huh?

94
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:05,640
The Chief Public Prosecutor despises Haruto.

95
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,990
And recently, they got into another disagreement.

96
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:13,600
He apparently told the Chief not to treat you like a criminal.

97
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:22,100
You'll have seconds, right?

98
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:26,060
Absolutely. I'll eat every last dumpling you offer.

99
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,850
You're seriously a glutton.

100
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:31,660
- Is that so wrong?
- No. It makes cooking all the more worth it.

101
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,680
Hot.

102
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:41,990
The longer he stays with me, the more he'll continue to lose.

103
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:29,200
Mr. Haruto Tateishi.
Thank you for allowing me to stay for as long as I have.

104
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,440
Although I cannot do much to show my appreciation,

105
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,040
I have left various gifts of gratitude around your home.

106
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,790
Nuts are a great snack for insomnia.

107
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:50,660
There's too much.

108
00:09:55,090 --> 00:10:01,600
And on sleepless nights, please don't turn to alcohol.
Drink this tea instead.

109
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:09,330
This stuff is too bitter.

110
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:14,950
I promise I'll repay my debts in full one day.

111
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:18,450
She really cleaned the place up.

112
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:28,040

114
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:20,450
Sakura, are you sure about this?

115
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:23,870
Yup. Watch me, I'll become a cafe pro in no time.

116
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:28,150
Oh my gosh.

117
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:32,010
Why don't you become a cleaning pro first?

118
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:35,230
- Yeah.
- Jeez...

119
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:37,380
Sorry, we're closed for lunch -

120
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:40,890
You'll quit working as a lawyer?

121
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,080
Yes.

122
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:52,730
My firm wasn't getting any decent clients anyway.

123
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:54,230
So I'm calling it here.

124
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:58,220
Why are you giving up so easily?

125
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:00,450
It wasn't easy.

126
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:03,450
Giving up is a difficult ordeal.

127
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:07,950
That goes both for work, and people as well.

128
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,990
Are you turning down my offer?

129
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,060
What?

130
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:21,400
I said to let me hire you, didn't I?

131
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,330
"Let me hire you"?

132
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:26,580
Let me hire you.

133
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:32,120
- You were drunk.
- But I meant it.

134
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,030
What?

135
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:42,040
Your expression will tell me the truth.

136
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,700
You actually meant it.

137
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:53,040
Does that mean you remember the rest of that night as well?

138
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:02,180
N-Not in the slightest.

139
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,080
Really now.

140
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:08,920
Come with me.

141
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,370
While I appreciate the offer, I'll have to decline.

142
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:13,610
Why?

143
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:17,420
Because I can't be causing you any more trouble.

144
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:19,630
That'd be shameless of me.

145
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:23,110
Thank you for coming to check in on me.

146
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,720
You're shameless.

147
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:31,750
But that's another charm of yours.

148
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,920
I'll be waiting.

149
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:42,990
That was a great one-liner, even for me.

150
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:52,490
It took every bit of courage I had to give up on him, and my job.

151
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:12,750
Twelve minutes. That's earlier than I thought.

152
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:15,040
They were a long twelve minutes to me.

153
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:19,640
Even so, I want to stay with him.

154
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:23,060

00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,740
I'll sue you for slander.

182
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:55,080
I'm speaking the "what-if's", alright?

183
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:59,090
Rest easy, sir. I'll rake in the dough for us.

184
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:02,520
You? No, never. Get out.

185
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,210
Haruto, let me explain -

186
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:06,160
It's not worth my time.

187
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:09,040
I know, but please.

188
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:13,430
You could at least listen to him.

189
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:19,330
I'm giving you five minutes.

190
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:27,400
We used to come here all the time, remember?

191
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,500
It was our secret base of sorts.

192
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,760
That's ancient history by now.

193
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:38,580
Mind if I reminisce a bit?

194
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:46,800
"Would you go out with me?"

195
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:51,460
"I love you."

196
00:16:55,730 --> 00:17:02,790
I think... I might love you, Haruto.

197
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:10,120
I think... I might love you, too.

198
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,410
I thought I'd be able to give up.

199
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,760
I bring the sun.

200
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,920
So do I.

201
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:33,410
- The sun loves me more.
- No, it loves me.

202
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:36,740
But... I just couldn't.

203
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:47,840
I couldn't fully let go.

204
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:51,560
I have no excuses.

205
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,830
I never intended on forgiving you.

206
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,830
- I understand.
- No, you don't.

207
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:06,640
When my father passed away, you two were what kept me stable.

208
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,910
- Here.
- Eat this.

209
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,670
You like sweet things, right?

210
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:21,100
- Don't cry.
- Let's eat them, together.

211
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,010
It'll be okay.

212
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:28,100
- Let's study together.
- Three heads are better than two.

213
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,010
- I can't concentrate.
- Wait, what's that?

214
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:31,320
Let's see.

215
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,310
What does that say?

216
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:35,080
- Huh?
- Too hard.

217
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,840
- Try this instead.
- Guys!

218
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:41,410
And yet, you two betrayed me.

219
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,540
Sorry.

220
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:50,510
An apology won't mend what's been broken.

221
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:55,620
You don't have to forgive me.

222
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,690
But I want to help you.

223
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:02,250
No, I know I can help you.

224
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:06,790
Because I think there are things only I can do as well.

225
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:13,010
Do what you want.

226
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:24,160
Will something actually change from working together?

227
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:31,960
Welcome back.

228
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,630
Thanks.

229
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:38,990
Starting a firm with the five of us is sort of exciting, isn't it?

230
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,840
I wouldn't say that.

231
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,140
Don't misunderstand.

232
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,980
Misunderstand what?

233
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:12,410
I wasn't touching your face. I was supporting your head, and -

234
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:14,330
- Thank you.
- Don't thank me.

235
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:16,190
You were just sleeping weird, so I -

236
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:20,290
I truly appreciate that you opened an office for us.

237
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:24,980
I don't need gratitude.

238
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:27,050
Pay me back with your hard work.

239
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:34,080
How adorable.

240
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,950
I'm truly grateful to you, Ms. Miyashita.

241
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:43,650
You're the reason Haruto reached out to me at all.

242
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:47,770
Not to mention I get to work here, of all places.

243
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:52,180
Why are you always smiling?

244
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:58,830
It's the only way I know how to deal with Haruto now.

245
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:03,790
Let me know if there's any way I can amend that.

246
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,660
You're a kind person, Ms. Miyashita.

247
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:12,830
Most would laugh at that, you know?
The world thinks I'm a murderer.

248
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:19,600
I think that smile looked much more genuine.

249
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,060
- You think?
- Yes, definitely.

250
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:25,310
But I can't tell what's natural or not.

251
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:29,390
I see those two get along quite well.

252
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,430
Do they?

253
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:36,020
Are you jealous?

254
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:39,520
No, I am not.

255
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,800
- You are.
- Am not.

256
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,630
- Are.
- Not.

257
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:45,080
You are.

258
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:50,390
My hand slipped, sorry.

259
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:53,300
- What the heck are you doing?
- My hand slipped.

260
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:56,120
Haruto! Knock it off!

261
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:05,040
- You're doing that on purpose!
- I'm drenched!

262
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:08,830
Everything was going smoothly for us.

263
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:20,190
We have our first client.

264
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,880
- Oh?
- Oh?

265
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,310
Oh?

266
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:24,790
Who is it?

267
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:32,190
Chef and owner of Ristorante Haneda,
Mr. Ryujiro Haneda was found murdered in his home.

268
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:39,030
Police have arrested the delivery driver,
Takahiko Inaba, aged 31, as the prime suspect.

269
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:43,270
He is our first client.

270
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:48,250
That is, until this man appeared before us.

271
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,040
He has requested you to be his defense attorney.

272
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,970
You are the only one who can save me now.

273
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:57,130
He may be innocent.

274
00:23:57,130 --> 00:23:58,920
Don't let your empathy sway you.

275
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:02,190
Are you truly Haruto's girlfriend?

276
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:05,110
Don't fall in love with me.
