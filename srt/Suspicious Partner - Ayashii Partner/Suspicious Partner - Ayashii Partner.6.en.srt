1
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:11,610
Chef and owner of Ristorante Haneda,
Mr. Ryujiro Haneda was found murdered in his home.

2
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:18,400
Police have arrested the delivery driver,
Takahiko Inaba, aged 31, as the prime suspect.

3
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,400
He is our first client.

4
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,680
Officials report that Inaba's DNA was found...

5
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:28,960
He has requested you to be his defense attorney.

6
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,670
Me?

7
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:37,250
We ought to turn him down.
No one requesting my help is an actual client.

8
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:41,520
No, let's take on this case.

9
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,000
It'll do great publicity for us.

10
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:34,590
A button left at the scene was found to have your DNA on it.

11
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:38,230
There's no use denying cold hard facts.

12
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:41,680
I will have you prosecuted for theft and murder.

13
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,410
Maintaining your right to stay silent?

14
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,960
You wouldn't believe my side of things, even if I spoke.

15
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,420
No one believes me.

16
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,730
Hello there. How have you been?

17
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:24,150
Horrible. And you, Attorney Miyashita?

18
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:25,960
I've been well.

19
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,800
Are you truly Haruto's girlfriend?

20
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,100
I am not obligated to answer.

21
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:41,710
I can't believe it's you, of all people.

22
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:44,530
The sentiment is mine.

23
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:49,330
I can't believe his ex is someone so charismatic.

24
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:51,390
Please give me an answer.

25
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:54,220
We're in a relationship.

26
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,240
So you are lying.

27
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,010
I'm telling the truth.

28
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,760
Let's be off.

29
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,340
You alright?

30
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,590
I'd forgotten to breathe.

31
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:24,760
How is that remotely possible?

32
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,290
I thought you didn't appreciate the lovers act.

33
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:31,180
I can't have my coworker be a liar now, can I?

34
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:37,580
Yikes, we'll be late.

35
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:40,330
We already are!

36
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:43,370
Why did you request that I become your attorney?

37
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:45,820
If you wanted to evade court, then -

38
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:51,000
Because you're the only one who can save me now.

39
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:59,490
I had frequented Mr. Haneda's home many times
as part of my job.

40
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:06,310
But that reason alone is why I've been suspected of murder.

41
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:08,420
That's why they've placed me here.

42
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:14,500
No one has taken my side.

43
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:18,830
And being here terrifies me.

44
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:27,510
But I thought you might believe my side of things.

45
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:34,510
That's why I've requested your help.

46
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:44,900
I did not kill him.

47
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,440
Sir, are you doubting me as well?

48
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:52,390
Mr. Tateishi. Only you can save me now.

49
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:01,490
I understand. I will accept your case.

50
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:04,520
Thank you.

51
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:14,420
When the incident occurred,
I had been eating lunch at a cafe I frequent.

52
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:16,740
All together now. Happy birthday!

53
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:20,040
A couple was celebrating a birthday with friends behind me.

54
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:26,300
I saw they had a cake with candles in it as well.

55
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:29,370
Everyone, say cheese!

56
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,600
- Just kidding, it was a video!
- Seriously?

57
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,900
Dude, come on!

58
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:38,210
The folks around celebrated as well.

59
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:42,230
I recall everyone was in a jovial mood.

60
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,790
Afterwards...

61
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:52,210
Let's not handle this case.

62
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:53,910
Why?

63
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:56,050
His alibi has no solid proof.

64
00:05:56,050 --> 00:06:00,040
The cafe had no security cameras, and he paid in cash.

65
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:03,290
We can't prove he was ever in that store.

66
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:05,540
That was the same for my case as well.

67
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:07,210
Don't let your empathy sway you.

68
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:10,970
An attorney is an ally to their client.

69
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:12,520
This is why I hate attorneys.

70
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:15,440
- But you're one yourself.
- That's your -

71
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,340
- He may be innocent.
- There's no proof.

72
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:28,320
If a client claims they are innocent, our job is to believe them.

73
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,970
You believe him?

74
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:31,930
Yes, I'm an attorney.

75
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:36,300
I truly hate attorneys.

76
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:40,220
Our conversation is getting nowhere, no thanks to you.

77
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,200
Why won't you answer my calls?

78
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,450
Or are you ignoring me too?

79
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:02,060
What's up with you two?

80
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:06,790
Sorry.

81
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:09,600
I'm being immature.

82
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:18,390
I know it's my fault. But you share the blame too, Ren.

83
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:23,210
It's been a while.

84
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:29,430
Yeah, it has.

85
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:32,230
See you around.

86
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:43,040
If we ever cross paths again, it'll be a coincidence.

87
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:20,680
[Cafe Shiki]

88
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:26,000
I'd like to ask about this individual.
He was sitting in that seat, back there.

89
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,660
Was he?

90
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:31,630
I unfortunately don't recall anyone there.

91
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:34,160
- Excuse me.
- I'll be right with you.

92
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,960
My apologies.

93
00:08:55,770 --> 00:09:01,490
I thought you might believe my side of things.

94
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:09,970
Thank you again.

95
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:16,240
Your son is turning 28 this year?

96
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,650
Happy birthday.

97
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:19,790
Thank you.

98
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:33,950
You.

99
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:40,850
How dare you smile without a care?

100
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:46,990
Do you realize what day it is today?

101
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:49,260
If my son were alive...

102
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:55,010
I... I would be celebrating with him.

103
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:59,220
I would be grasping his hand.

104
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:03,000
And yet...

105
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:21,230
Don't smile in my presence ever again.

106
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:29,830
Sir, I am innocent.

107
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,240
Although I know you won't believe anything I say,

108
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:39,120
your threats won't change the fact I am innocent.

109
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:44,710
And your action just now counts as assault.
A crime, punishable by law.

110
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:51,050
Unless a true culprit is found, you will always be guilty.

111
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:54,890
I will continue to pressure your firm, mark my words.

112
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,240
I've found proof of his alibi.

113
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:42,660
This couple celebrated a birthday on March 23rd,
the day of the incident.

114
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,950
Just as he testified.

115
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:50,120
This isn't enough to solidify his alibi.

116
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:54,620
But it's enough to believe his statement.

117
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:27,250
Did something happen while you were out?

118
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:31,900
No, nothing at all.

119
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:34,050
Why won't you talk to me?

120
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:41,140
I don't wish to bring it up.

121
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,240
Are you alright?

122
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,300
Then I won't press.

123
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:09,320
It's unfortunate they wouldn't talk.

124
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,950
You were asking the wrong questions.

125
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:12,710
As were you.

126
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:15,050
No, I was -

127
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,950
Yikes.

128
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,990
Let's run.

129
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:48,320
Doesn't look like it'll let up any time soon.

130
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,980
It sure doesn't.

131
00:13:56,790 --> 00:14:00,030
Why do you look so happy?

132
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,850
Because it's a beautiful sight.

133
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:38,270
I hope we win.

134
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:42,570
Not hope. We will win.

135
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:44,020
Right.

136
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:02,600
Are you alright?

137
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,180
I'm fine, thank you.

138
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:14,160
In an effort to steal Ryujiro Haneda's valuables,
the accused murdered Mr. Haneda.

139
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,880
Mr. Haneda was stabbed several times with a 12cm long blade,

140
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,220
and died instantly due to major blood loss.

141
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:28,830
The accused then stole three watches,
and several branded bags totaling 10 million yen.

142
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:33,740
Accused, I will now ask about the charges
the prosecution has made against you.

143
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,740
Do they speak the truth?

144
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:38,420
Are there any errors in their statement?

145
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:44,040
Defense, may we hear your opinion on this matter?

146
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:49,000
Judge, I believe our accused is innocent.

147
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:54,810
The accused has no motive to commit this offense.

148
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:58,090
A murder with theft as the reason needs no motive.

149
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:00,850
But for that reason to check out,

150
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:03,050
the theft must have happened at all.

151
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:05,040
Valuables have disappeared from Mr. Haneda's home.

152
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,270
There's no proof the accused was involved.

153
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:11,580
For these items were not found in his home, nor his office.

154
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:15,300
Defense, are you suggesting the accused was not a thief?

155
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:20,580
Yes, sir. Our conclusion now relies heavily on this "theft".

156
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:23,610
But if the accused committed no robbery,

157
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:27,520
then the reason for this murder falls through completely.

158
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,180
That is all from the Defense.

159
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:51,090
You played the part of an attorney to a tee.

160
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:54,250
Of course.

161
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:59,350
You okay?

162
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:04,370
I'm fine. I just became a bit dizzy.

163
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:05,980
Here, grab my arm.

164
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,160
I'm going to say something very immature.

165
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,820
I'm not one to fall ill,

166
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:40,710
so while this might not be the time, I am a bit jealous of her.

167
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:45,390
So am I.

168
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:52,460
I envy the fact he can offer help like that with ease.

169
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,440
Shall we?

170
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:25,550
Thank you.

171
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:27,590
- Here.
- Thanks.

172
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:29,290
Please give us a moment.

173
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:31,170
- Thanks again.
- Sure.

174
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,760
Are you sure you don't need to see a doctor?

175
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:41,660
No, some medicine will pick me right back up.

176
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:44,000
You know that works for me, right?

177
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,960
Let's call it here.

178
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,810
Right.

179
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:02,750
Wait.

180
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:11,220
Stay with me a bit longer.

181
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:21,790
I'm sorry I hurt you back then.

182
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:26,470
I just wanted you to actually "see" me.

183
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:34,640
I know I'm in no position to say this.

184
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:43,640
But I want to stay with you, Haruto.

185
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:09,660
Maybe I'll clean up a bit.

186
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,830
The place is already spotless.

187
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:30,220
I'll clean out the fridge instead.

188
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,890
Also spotless.

189
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,740
You're...

190
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:56,410
no trouble.

191
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:02,130
Let me hire you.

192
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,180
I'm back.

193
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:45,720
I thought you weren't ever coming back.

194
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:49,560
I'm here now.

195
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:01,170
I love you.

196
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:07,890
I love you, sir.

197
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:24,990
Don't...

198
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:30,270
Don't fall in love with me.

199
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:47,390
Why?

200
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:59,830
I don't even get a reason?

201
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:16,050
I must ask you for a favor.

202
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:25,850
Please hug me, so I can move on.

203
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:39,490
I will return to the way I was, before I ever loved you.

204
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:41,440
Did something happen between you and Haruto?

205
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,720
Inaba has a criminal record.

206
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,070
You'll defend someone like him?

207
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:47,430
I only did what I needed to.

208
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:51,430
Is Ms. Miyashita currently in a relationship with anyone?

209
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,380
She's quite the wonderful individual.

210
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:56,120
I think I'll invite her to eat out sometime.

211
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:59,750
Will I come to regret this decision?

212
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:01,990
I don't care if it's done out of pity.

213
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:04,980
Could you just stay by my side?
