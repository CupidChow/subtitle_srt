1
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:11,080
Can't wait to crack open a cold one.

2
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:18,880
A turning point in life always comes without warning.

3
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,590
Sota?

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:24,040
What're you doing here?

5
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,170
Sota.

6
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:44,120
That night...

7
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:56,010
I became accused of murder.

8
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,010
Mr. Tateishi. We've got trouble.

9
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:23,410
When you returned home, your former partner,
Mr. Sota Aoki, was found dead.

10
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,060
Yes, sir.

11
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:29,210
Was there any trouble between you and Mr. Aoki?

12
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,100
No, ma'am.

13
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:36,210
And yet, he was found murdered in your home.

14
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:40,260
Sir, I am innocent.

15
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:44,950
We shall investigate that matter, with your utmost cooperation.

16
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,720
Sota has died.

17
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:56,080
I was devestated to know he cheated on me, and now he's gone.

18
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:00,310
I cursed Sota for what he had done.

19
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:04,050
But our time together wasn't all bad.

20
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,400
He's gone.

21
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,590
He's really, truly gone.

22
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:51,240
On to our next headline.

23
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:56,330
Police have apprehended legal apprentice,
Sakura Miyashita, age 26,

24
00:02:56,330 --> 00:03:02,700
under suspicions of murdering fellow apprentice, Sota Aoki.

25
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:09,410
The victim is the eldest son of Chief Public Prosecutor,
Soichiro Aoki.

26
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:15,360
The suspect had a less than amicable relationship
with her former partner, Mr. Aoki.

27
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,640
It seems their circumstances were-

28
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:35,380
Understood.

29
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:39,890
Sakura Miyashita was your apprentice, correct?
[Chief Public Prosecutor: Soichiro Aoki]

30
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:42,450
- Yes, sir.
- What was she like?

31
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:43,830
In other words?

32
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:47,200
Is she someone who would kill a man?

33
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:52,960
While she was a bit crude, I wouldn't make that stretch, sir.

34
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,870
And yet, my son has been killed.

35
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:05,190
I'm putting you in charge of this case.

36
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:11,480
I hear you're able to make the accused plead guilty every time.

37
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:16,370
Go to court, and put that woman behind bars immediately.

38
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,220
Mr. Tateishi...

39
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:33,290
I am the prosecutor assigned to your case, Haruto Tateishi.

40
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:38,310
Now allow me to get our facts straight.

41
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:42,750
The store clerk indeed confirmed
that a customer came that night.

42
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:46,100
However, she cannot recall if the individual was you.

43
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:50,400
I went to the store, sir.

44
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:57,590
Due to the blackout that night, all security cameras were out.

45
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:03,340
In other words, there is no evidence to support your alibi.

46
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:07,050
I did not kill him.

47
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:09,720
Sir, are you doubting me as well?

48
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,900
- Please believe me.
- I am the prosecutor.

49
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,280
If you need to rely on anyone, go to your attorney.

50
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,510
Of course I'll rely on you.

51
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:19,800
Mr. Tateishi.

52
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,270
Only you can save me now.

53
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,390
I truly know nothing, sir.

54
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:35,270
The victim cheated on you.

55
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:37,960
I understand your pain all too well.

56
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,990
- That is when-
- Don't even bother.

57
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:48,060
Your sympathy tactics won't get me to fess up.

58
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:59,980
The only marks and DNA we found in your room,
were yours and the victim's.

59
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:04,720
Do you still choose to play innocent?

60
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:09,370
Your intimidation tactics won't work either, sir.

61
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:20,190
You have a motive, no alibi, and there are no other suspects.

62
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:25,290
You will be found guilty if taken to court. So please... Confess.

63
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:31,620
I've killed no one.

64
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:39,790
Given her current circumstances, no matter what she denies,
she'll be deemed guilty.

65
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:45,130
I will believe in you, Mr. Tateishi.

66
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:49,220
You've saved me time and time again, after all.

67
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,770
[Certificate: Kazuhiro Shinjo]

68
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:58,290
[Shinjo Partners Law Office]

69
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:09,260
Who will serve as her defense attorney?

70
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:14,860
The victim is the Chief Public Prosecutor's son.

71
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:17,160
No one wants to step up for her.

72
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,860
What's up?

73
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:29,140
Haruto's calling.

74
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:31,390
It's been years since he last called.

75
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:35,680
Hello?

76
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:39,880
What?

77
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:48,110
What brings you here, Mr. Umehara?

78
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:55,380
Haruto asked me to be your attorney.

79
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,440
Mr. Tateishi did?

80
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:02,210
Since it was his request, I'll be sure to give it my all.

81
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,190
Can I ask you just one question?

82
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:08,170
Go ahead.

83
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:11,060
Did you kill Sota Aoki?

84
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:14,640
No, I did not.

85
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:21,020
That's all I need to hear.

86
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:28,950
The security cameras weren't on because of the blackout.

87
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:31,680
- And the murder weapon?
- It hasn't been found.

88
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:37,230
Still, it's unusual of you to visit the crime scene yourself.

89
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:41,370
There could be another suspect, like she claims.

90
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:43,510
I'm only checking to be certain.

91
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:15,220
At around 12:30 AM, I opened the window to get some fresh air.

92
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:21,220
I couldn't see much, because I had taken off my glasses.

93
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:27,970
What if she had witnessed another crime, without her knowledge?

94
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:39,980
Were there any other incidents in the area that night?

95
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,600
I don't believe so.

96
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,420
Could you look into it anyway?

97
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,960
Sure thing.

98
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:54,750
It's an odd feeling, searching an acquaintance's room.
I feel as though we're snooping.

99
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:04,060
[Mr. Tateishi is as annoying as ever.]

100
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:06,410
What's that?

101
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:09,390
- This? It's nothing.
- Allow me.

102
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:12,610
A handshake? Of course.

103
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:14,350
No.

104
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:17,220
Right...

105
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:21,140
- You want to take a look?
- Yes.

106
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:31,190
I warned you.
[Mr. Tateishi is as annoying as ever. Good luck, Sakura!]

107
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,900
This is Yoneda, speaking.

108
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,380
Yes.

109
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,230
I see.

110
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,650
Sir, they found the weapon.

111
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:02,470
It's located seven kilometers away.

112
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:13,660
The police combed this room thoroughly, yes?

113
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:15,740
Of course.

114
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:21,090
And yet, I've just discovered another weapon under the fridge.

115
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:25,010
There are two weapons?

116
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,950
We've found the murder weapon.

117
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:32,990
Excellent.

118
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:37,780
Now we can take that woman to court.

119
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:43,080
However, for some reason, we have found two weapons.

120
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,190
One weapon was found in her room.

121
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:52,080
Another, was found seven kilometers away from her abode.

122
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,330
What do you think is going on here, sir?

123
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,390
There is no need for "two" weapons.

124
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:04,220
The one found in her room is the only weapon.

125
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:09,560
I'm expecting great things from you.

126
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:45,730
Upon hearing Sota Aoki's refusal to make amends with her,

127
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:50,020
the accused was overcome with a murderous urge.

128
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:56,770
She then took a knife and stabbed the victim
twice in the stomach, and once in the chest.

129
00:12:56,770 --> 00:13:01,230
The victim then died due to blood loss,

130
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:05,230
because of the violent actions of the accused.

131
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:10,390
She ought to be charged with homicide,
under Article 199 of the Penal Code.

132
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:15,800
Do you have any objection against the truths
stated by the prosecution?

133
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,650
Yes, sir. I have not killed a single soul.

134
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:23,210
Defense. Your opinion?

135
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:29,390
The accused did not kill Mr. Sota Aoki. She is innocent.

136
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:41,330
You witnessed the accused verbally abusing the victim, correct?

137
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:42,940
Yes, sir.

138
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,580
With my own two eyes.

139
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:51,240
♪ I am going to kill you, kill you ♪

140
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:04,290
I only meant it as a joke. I wasn't being serious.

141
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:06,340
You killed Sota, didn't you?

142
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:08,870
I did not. I am innocent.

143
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:10,870
Order.

144
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,620
I have no further questions.

145
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:24,880
Recently, we found the weapon most likely used in this case
within the accused's abode.

146
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:31,480
This weapon was nowhere to be found
during prior police inspections.

147
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:35,030
To have a weapon turn up now, is nothing but suspicious.

148
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:39,240
We shall send this knife to our forensics team,
and await further information.

149
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:48,010
Defense, could we get your thoughts on Evidence 12,
submitted by the prosecution?

150
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:52,450
So the wounds on the victim match the knife, is that correct?

151
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:57,820
Yes, sir. After running a DNA test on the blood from this knife,

152
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:01,250
we have confirmed it matches the victim's DNA.

153
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:05,460
The wounds on the victim also help to characterize the weapon.

154
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:08,620
Either way, it is a perfect match to this knife.

155
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:18,360
Prosecution, your closing remarks.

156
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:24,290
The accused invited the victim to her abode,
in hopes of getting back together.

157
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:27,970
However, upon being turned down, she murdered Sota Aoki.

158
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:30,030
There is no doubt about her motive.

159
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:36,690
Yet the accused denies all claims,
and doesn't seem to regret her actions in the slightest.

160
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:41,300
As such, I believe the accused must appropriately be sentenced

161
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:48,330
to at least 15 years of penal servitude.

162
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:50,010
This concludes my statement.

163
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:31,000
I will believe in you, Mr. Tateishi.

164
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:34,730
You've saved me time and time again, after all.

165
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:49,450
We shall now sentence the accused with our verdict.

166
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,670
The accused has been found...

167
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:04,470
Judge. I'd like to submit another piece of evidence.

168
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:06,990
More evidence, you say?

169
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:08,410
Yes, sir.

170
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:13,850
Truth be told, we discovered another weapon.

171
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:18,620
This second weapon was found in an entirely separate location.

172
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:23,290
Both weapons were marked with the victim's blood.

173
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:26,310
Here is where this second weapon was found.

174
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:29,190
It was found seven kilometers away from the scene of the crime.

175
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:37,650
Unless the accused can teleport,
she could not have tossed the weapon so far away.

176
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:40,390
Prosecution, why were there two weapons?

177
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:46,420
I believe of the two weapons, one was a plant.

178
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:50,630
Why was this evidence kept from us?

179
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:52,380
It was done with intent.

180
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:56,790
We prioritized this hearing, over probing into the truth.

181
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:04,690
If there is even a single fake,
both lose their reputability as evidence.

182
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:08,790
In accordance to Article 257 of the Code of Criminal Procedure,

183
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:12,560
I withdraw my prosecution.

184
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,160
Why were there two weapons found?

185
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,510
Withdrawing is unheard of.

186
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:03,440
- Why did you withdraw your prosecution?
- Please, tell us your reasoning.

187
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,120
She's here!

188
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:08,350
Will you return to being a legal apprentice?

189
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:10,300
Do you have anything to say to the prosecution?

190
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,080
Who do you wish to owe this withdrawal to?

191
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,850
- Please, tell us how you feel.
- Anything at all.

192
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:18,410
Even a word.

193
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:55,540
- Ms. Miyashita, could we get a word?
- A word. Just a word.

194
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:58,440
Please, we would appreciate it.

195
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:01,590
Do you realize what you've done?

196
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:06,410
Sir. Did you place the weapon at the scene of the crime?

197
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:09,110
What?

198
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:14,020
I believe withdrawing our prosecution
was the appropriate course of action.

199
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,000
You'd best not regret your choice.

200
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:25,290
Your life as a prosecutor ends today.

201
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:31,200
Don't step foot in our premises ever again.

202
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,000
[Mr. Tateishi is as annoying as ever. He's sort of cool, too.]
[I agree.]

203
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:17,810
I never thought you would stand up against
the Chief Prosecutor.

204
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:28,760
But above all else... I believe you made the right choice.

205
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:44,000
I thought I'd never trust anyone ever again.

206
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,230
But that's changed. I've learned to trust once more.

207
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:51,450
Because that person chose to save me.

208
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:19,790
We first met in a bus. Then, we worked together at the office.

209
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:26,250
And in court, we were prosecutor and accused.

210
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:30,350
No matter how you spin it, we're tied by fate.

211
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:36,390
- Yes, we-
- In a bad way.

212
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:42,540
Don't barge into my life, ever again.

213
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,430
I'm no longer a prosecutor.

214
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:53,990
So you're worried about me.

215
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:56,770
I'm not "worried". I'm troubled by you.

216
00:23:56,770 --> 00:24:00,990
Whenever I struggled, I always caught myself looking for you.

217
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:05,020
Mr. Tateishi, I will prove you made the right choice.
