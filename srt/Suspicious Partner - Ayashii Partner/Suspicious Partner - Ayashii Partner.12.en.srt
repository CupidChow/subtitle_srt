1
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:11,990
Mr. Tateishi!

2
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:14,780
- Dad!
- Haruto! Run!

3
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:16,750
Mr. Prosecutor!

4
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:20,190
Take Haruto, and run.

5
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:22,940
I've got you now, kid. Let's go.

6
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,630
Dad!

7
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:30,850
Run outside, alright? I'll go get your father.

8
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:56,140
Thank god...

9
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:16,220
Sakura. There's something I need to tell you.

10
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,240
Right.

11
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:31,370
I remember what really happened in that house fire.

12
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:39,040
Your father was innocent.

13
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:45,450
He wasn't the one who set the flames.

14
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:49,040
He was the opposite - a hero.

15
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:55,370
After he grabbed me, he went back in to save my parents.

16
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:00,620
- But because he did...
- Then why was he declared guilty?

17
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:07,200
It was my fault.

18
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:11,510
What do you mean?

19
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:18,750
I testified against your father. I said he was the culprit.

20
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:25,020
Haruto. This man was at your house, correct?

21
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:33,550
And he set your home on fire, didn't he?

22
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,260
I...

23
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:42,810
I said your father set the fire.

24
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:47,120
I testified against him, to Prosecutor Aoki.

25
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,370
Isn't that right?

26
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,560
I'm responsible for his ruling.

27
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,670
What do you want?

28
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:42,590
My father's name was Mikihiko Miyashita.

29
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:50,940
I am the daughter of the man

30
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:53,790
you pinned that house fire on.

31
00:04:55,300 --> 00:05:00,810
My father is an innocent man. He is no arsonist.

32
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:06,790
And like him, I did not murder your son.

33
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:12,570
Yet you only believe what you understand to be true.

34
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:16,980
You ignore conflicting testimonies,
and even forge evidence in your favor.

35
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:28,180
Both my father and I have done no wrong.

36
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:32,260
The one who has, is you.

37
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,180
Recognize the crimes you have committed.

38
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,380
We're gathering evidence by the hour.

39
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:48,210
If you want to fess up, now's your last chance.

40
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:55,510
I killed all five of them.

41
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,370
Who should I start with?

42
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:08,990
There was Tabata, Haneda, Momoi, Shimano, and...

43
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:18,840
Sota Aoki. Now that was the unluckiest guy of the whole bunch.

44
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:23,950
I only wanted to keep Ms. Miyashita quiet.

45
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:27,840
But who was at her apartment instead? That guy.

46
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:33,040
He saw my face. I had no choice but to kill him.

47
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:38,050
"Help me."

48
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:42,290
"I'm scared!"

49
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:44,340
He was crying like a real maniac.

50
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:48,400
I had to deal the final blow to keep his mouth shut.

51
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,770
What's up?

52
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:07,350
Inaba fessed up to all his crimes.

53
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,040
I see.

54
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:18,330
What?

55
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:26,040
Chief Prosecutor Aoki drove off with him.
We don't know where they went.

56
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,620
Where are you going?

57
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:41,780
Chief Prosecutor Aoki took off with Inaba.

58
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:43,260
What?

59
00:07:55,540 --> 00:08:00,010
Chief, taking the suspect without permission is...

60
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,710
Get out.

61
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:09,270
Look familiar?

62
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:18,670
This is where you killed my son. My innocent son.

63
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:21,200
"Innocent"? I disagree.

64
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,510
Say what?

65
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:29,040
Yes, your son may be innocent. But not you.

66
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:32,470
What are you talking about?

67
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,550
14 years ago.

68
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:42,540
You handled a case.

69
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:50,630
A case, where a young girl was assaulted by a group of bastards.

70
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,750
Her name was Kanade Honda.

71
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,760
And you helped to cover up the whole damn incident.

72
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:22,580
You abandoned Kanade.

73
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:28,190
You chose to protect those scumbags,
with their influential parents.

74
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:32,300
Sound familiar?

75
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,170
Let this anguish torment you, like it's tormented me.

76
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,430
- Sakura, check the room!
- Right!

77
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,340
Wait!

78
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:23,560
Isn't that stab wound fresh?

79
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:26,250
I reckon you shouldn't move around too much.

80
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:30,170
And I reckon those handcuffs aren't helping you either.

81
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:48,410
Inaba! Don't add to your list of sins!

82
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:51,310
I've lost the one person who matters to me.

83
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:55,960
I have nothing left to lose!

84
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:06,810
I've... got you.

85
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:34,600
I've been thinking about my father's incident.

86
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:39,470
The one to blame is Prosecutor Aoki,
for coaxing you into giving a testimony.

87
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:47,880
Your father saved my life.

88
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:52,960
He then dove back in, in an attempt to save my father.

89
00:11:56,810 --> 00:12:01,790
I'm truly sorry for what became of him.

90
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:06,620
My father was simply unlucky.

91
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:09,050
None of it was your fault, Mr. Tateishi.

92
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:19,800
Shall we use this moment as an opportunity...

93
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:25,190
to give ourselves a fresh start?

94
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:52,500
[Prosecutor - Haruto Tateishi]

95
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:54,930
Welcome back.

96
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:59,590
I look forward to working with you.

97
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:03,470
Why did you decide to return as a prosecutor?

98
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:09,930
This is far more my speed, is all.

99
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:32,620
First your lawyer, and now your prosecutor.
It seems it was meant to be.

100
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:39,690
[Arrested Kanto Chief Prosecutor -
Involvement in an incident from 24 years ago]

101
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:43,650
I'm glad your father was rightfully declared innocent.

102
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:45,180
As am I.

103
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,250
You've been doing well?

104
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:52,250
As well as I look. And you?

105
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:54,430
I'm doing fine.

106
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:58,020
So you're in a slump.

107
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:01,550
And you?

108
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:04,020
I'm working myself out of it.

109
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:09,620
Don't overthink it. Just be honest with yourself.

110
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:12,110
Is that what you've been doing?

111
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:13,680
Of course.

112
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:21,080
I've been so honest, I fell for the same individual all over again.

113
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:23,750
It's been tough.

114
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:29,080
Are you looking into that incident?

115
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:41,370
Chief Prosecutor Aoki was in charge of Kanade Honda's case.

116
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:46,080
But the perpetrator's parents were influential folk.

117
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,290
So he helped them cover up the case.

118
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:58,090
Kanade Honda took her own life as a result of his actions.

119
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:04,510
Inaba was exacting revenge
on all those involved in the cover up.

120
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:33,870
The accused, Takahiko Inaba, murdered five individuals.
Masashi Tabata, Sota Aoki,

121
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:40,410
Ryujiro Haneda, Daisuke Shimano, and Yuma Momoi.

122
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:49,380
Tabata, Haneda, Shimano, and Momoi

123
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:57,050
were accused of sexually assaulting one Kanade Honda,
at around 5 PM on July 11th, 2011.

124
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,950
Ms. Kanade was your childhood friend.

125
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:06,840
That is why you killed each and every person involved
in this incident.

126
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:13,960
They brought this on themselves.

127
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:30,470
As a prosecutor, I would first like to apologize.

128
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:36,860
The prosecutor handling Ms. Kanade's case at the time,
covered up the incident.

129
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:44,040
And as a result of his actions, your friend took her own life.

130
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:50,740
If the prosecutor handling her case had done his job,

131
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:55,880
you would not have found yourself here in court today.

132
00:16:57,510 --> 00:17:01,650
- So what?
- You are entirely right.

133
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:04,330
The job ought to have been done long ago.

134
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:09,240
But it is not too late.

135
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:14,580
I will take full responsibility,
and bring the truth of her tragedy to light.

So I ask you this.

137
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:29,290
I want you to come clean, and repent for your crimes.

138
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:38,230
I imagine Ms. Kanade - your childhood friend,
would hope you do the very same.

139
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:46,040
She would not wish to see you become a villain.

140
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:51,020

141
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:06,600

That is a feeling I understand all too well.

I believe she would only hope for your happiness as well.

149
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:40,250
Prosecuting with Haruto is so awkward.

150

But you looked awesome up there.

151
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:48,050
But of course. I'm the best prosecutor this district has.

Yeah, let's go.

158
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:37,220

No.

00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:57,210
This was all you, Sakura.

168
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:09,970
For some reason, he was always there to help me.

169
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,930
Our relationship was awful.

170
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:14,870
The absolute worst.

171
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:17,240
Or so, it was supposed to be.

172
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:20,580
But the two of us crossed paths.

173
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:23,920
And for that, I'm truly grateful.

174
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:28,000

- And I'm glad I met her.

175
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:37,730
I want you to stay with me forever.

176
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:42,210

00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,950
No matter what?

178
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:50,330
No matter what. I'll be here, for the years to come.

179
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,620
