00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:07,850
When you've been betrayed by someone important to you,

185
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:10,850
your instinct is to blame yourself.

186
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:19,680
You wonder if you have any faults,
or if you've done your partner wrong.

187
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:25,980
In other words, you take all the blame on yourself.

188
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,140
I would know, because I've gone through this as well.

189
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:36,930
Your partner's betrayal isn't your fault.

190
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:43,540
The fault lies solely on the one who betrayed.

191
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:49,640
None of this is your fault.

192
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:11,500
[Mr. Tateishi is as annoying as ever]

193
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,260
He's annoying.

194
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:17,020
Incredibly so. And yet...

195
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:26,470
[He's sort of cool, too.]

197
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:50,470
But I can't remember. Did we actually do anything that night?

♫  ♫

199
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,850
I need fresh air.

200
00:20:55,850 --> 00:21:00,820
Every happening occurs for a certain reason.

201
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:05,070
However, sometimes that reason isn't all too clear.

203

Trouble could be brewing under your nose,
and you'd never know it.

204
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:19,710
I certainly didn't.

♫  ♫

206
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:25,570
I'm craving for beer.

207
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:29,720
I'm out?

208
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:40,390
Sakura.

209
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:45,100
Sakura.

00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,610
Good evening.

212
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:26,210
Paying by cash left no record.

213
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:28,710
The power outage stopped the cameras.

214
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:32,110
The part-timer didn't remember my face.

215
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:37,550
There was no evidence I left my home.

216
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:11,970
Can't wait to crack open a cold one.

217
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:14,930
That night...

218
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,640
Ouch...

219
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:25,490
Sota?

220
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:28,910
What're you doing here?

221
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:33,100
Sota.

222
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,480
I became accused of murder.

[Next Episode]

224
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:51,760
I'm innocent.

225
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,040
I leave this case to you.

226
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,170
Put that woman behind bars.

227
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:59,610
You're the only one who can save me, Mr. Tateishi.

228
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:01,790
I've been assigned as her defense attorney.

229
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:04,740
No matter how you spin it, we're tied by fate.
