Help!

185
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,720
Help!

186
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,010
We've gotten a grasp on Inaba's motive.

187
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:11,290
Tell me.

188
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:12,650
14 years ago,

189
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:16,640
Kanade Honda was assaulted by a group of men.

190
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,350
She then proceeded to take her own life.

191
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:27,140
The men who assailed her are the now dead Tabata,
Haneda, Momoi, and Shimano.

192
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:32,510
Inaba loved Ms. Kanade.

193
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:44,220
So that's what this is about.

194
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:56,200
[Introducing Chief Public Prosecutor, Soichiro Aoki]

195
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,590
Don't work yourself into the night.

196
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:11,850
Thank you. I'll make sure to turn in
after I look a bit more into Ms. Kanade.

197
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:16,000
Mr. Tateishi sure is late.

198
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:18,520
In any case, I will see you tomorrow.

199
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:21,140
Good night.

200
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:45,930
Evening.

201
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,120
Don't.

202
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:55,310
Stop!

203
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,110
You're not getting away this time.

204
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:46,500
Ms. Miyashita, the police.

205
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,340
Right.

206
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:55,080
Mr. Tateishi?

207
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:59,370
Mr. Tateishi? Mr. Tateishi!

208
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:03,320
Mr. Tateishi, stay with us!

209
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:07,910
Mr. Tateishi!

210
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:10,220
Dad!

211
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:15,420
Dad!

212
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:17,070
Haruto, run!

213
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:18,920
Dad!

214
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,900
Haruto!

215
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:30,930
Mr. Prosecutor! Are you alright?

216
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:34,940
Take Haruto... and run...

217
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:37,950
Dad!

218
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:40,660
I've got you now, kid. Let's go.

219
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:43,780
Dad!

220
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:52,250
I remembered what really happened.

221
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:55,840
Don't overthink it, and be honest with yourself.

222
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,310
I want the person I cherish to be happy.

223
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:04,380
Shall we have a fresh start?
