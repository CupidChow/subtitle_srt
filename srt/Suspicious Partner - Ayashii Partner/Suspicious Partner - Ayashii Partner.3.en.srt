You'll trust my intuition?

178
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:29,240
Come on.

179
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:38,450
Nana?

180
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:46,020
Nana?

181
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,100
Nana?

182
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:56,700
Nana?

183
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:21,150
I missed you, Nana.

184
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:23,290
Let's have a nice, long chat, shall we?

185
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,480
Mr. Hayashi!

186
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,370
Not another step!

187
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,790
Don't get in my way!

188
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:47,950
I only wanted to be by your side...

189
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:59,190
I'm truly sorry for all the trouble.

190
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:02,800
I misjudged Mr. Hayashi's character.

191
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,200
Don't blame yourself.

192
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,680
Scum like him always look normal.

193
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:12,790
Besides, we were able to prevent another incident thanks to you.

194
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:15,400
I appreciate your consolation.

195
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,550
It's the truth.

196
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:23,720
I mean, I only speak the truth.

197
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:31,680
It hurts to not be loved by the person you love.

198
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:38,340
But it's even worse to pursue someone who has no eyes for you.

199
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,620
Mr. Tateishi, I will not bother you ever again.

200
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,310
Nor do I like you.

201
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:51,080
With that said, take care.

202
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:11,790
I've put a restraining order on myself.

203
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:26,410
Why did I say my farewells like that? We weren't even dating.

204
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,560
[For you]

205
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:01,520
[Don't come searching for me ever again.]

206
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:17,450
Unbelievable...

207
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:28,310
You forgot something, again.

208
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:33,310
The culprit came. The one who murdered Sota.

209
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:35,270
Say what?

210
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:41,800
They're... still here.

211
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:52,360
I told you to stay out of harm's way.

212
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,800
Don't do something so dangerous.

213
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,820
You didn't catch the culprit's face?

214
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:58,860
I'm grasping for straws at this point.

215
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:02,550
That case is my responsibility as well.

216
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:05,020
Let me hire you.
