00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:16,450
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:40,660
Hello, teacher.

3
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:42,150
Thank you for your training, teacher!

4
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,550
I can take the elixir and become the immortal!

5
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:45,990
Is there anyone in our generation
who will get the "White Elixir"?

6
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,410
What's Thirteen doing here?

7
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,270
I'm also confused.

8
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,380
-You found it on the ground, right?
-He was found on the ground as well.

9
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:09,780
Yeah.

10
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,140
Are you kidding?

11
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,270
Be off!

12
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,520
Have you finished transcribing
the "Handbook of Claman"?

13
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:24,070
Have you cleaned the academy?

14
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:26,450
Are you qualified to be here?

15
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,100
Gathering the spirits of human,

16
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:22,670
nurtured by energies of sun and moon,

17
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:24,970
this quintessential elixir...

18
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,740
can transform foxes into immortals.

19
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:30,540
The "Elixirs of Soul" were planted
into bodies of "clamen" since hundreds of years ago,

20
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:34,390
which was cultivated by
the spirits of these humans.

21
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:37,370
They can only be harvested at the right time.

22
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,090
The acquisition of elixirs...

23
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,770
has long been the most significant
test for the juniors of our foxes.

24
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:44,870
The quality of the elixir...

25
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,460
can represent your power.

26
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:50,580
You...

27
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,270
How did you get this elixir?

28
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,270
I disguised as this claman's wife...

29
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,520
and pretended to be seriously ill.

30
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,150
So he willingly gave me his elixir.

31
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:00,420
Moving towards the Extreme Emptiness.

32
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,180
Being faithful to the spirits.

33
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:04,440
The spirit of one thing...

34
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:06,280
can be the spirit of everything.

35
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:08,060
Witnessing the operation of all things,

36
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:09,800
I am observing their essences.

37
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:12,080
All the students got the "Black Elixir".

38
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:14,180
Azi is the best student who took the elixir...

39
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:17,220
and became a fox spirit with five tails.

40
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,920
The claman volunteered to give her the elixir,

41
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:22,820
which shows that she was good at deceiving.

42
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,980
On the 15th day of next month,
the Night of Purple Moon,

43
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:28,590
the "White Elixir of the Soul" that
occurs only once in a thousand years...

44
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,490
will be acquired by our foxes.

45
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:34,800
Students of this year, come to
the stage for the lots of clamen.

46
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:38,780
The White Elixir is rare for thousands of years.

47
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:41,590
If you can let the claman
donate the elixir voluntarily,

48
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:44,540
you will become the first-class
fox spirit with nine tails...

49
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:46,520
and the supreme among foxes.

50
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:05,840
What's the matter?

51
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:07,890
There is one more lot in the furnace.

52
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,600
Who hasn't come to the stage yet?

53
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:11,310
Nobody.

54
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,990
The formal students are all here.

55
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:13,640
Me!

56
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:26,150
Me! Me!

57
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:26,870
What are you doing?

58
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:27,890
Aren't you missing one student here?

59
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,620
If that lot doesn't belong to you,

60
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:30,960
you can't get it...

61
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,390
even if the furnace opens.

62
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:33,240
Give me a chance!

63
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,410
I got a lot.

64
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:15,010
You can go find your claman...

65
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,440
according to the notes on the lot.

66
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,340
Why haven't I got a lot?

67
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:46,070
I got one.

68
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:48,450
I got a lot too.

69
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:54,390
I got a lot.

70
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:02,220
I got a lot.

71
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:04,090
Why are you so proud?
You only got an incomplete lot.

72
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:06,900
Incomplete...

73
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,590
What are they?

74
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,770
A pair of ears?

75
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:12,420
Can I take another draw?

76
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:18,910
Thirteen,

77
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:20,650
you only got an incomplete lot.

78
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,820
There's a good chance that you'll fail.

79
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,570
Anyway, I won't die.

80
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:27,130
That's possible too.

81
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,220
Even if you would survive,

82
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:32,420
It'll take another 500 years...

83
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:34,560
if you had wasted this opportunity.

84
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:36,550
Anyway, it's an opportunity.

85
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:39,580
Do you know why you are the only half-bred fox...

86
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:41,510
in our tribe of red foxes?

87
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:43,040
It's because...

88
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:45,580
you have an impressive pedigree.

89
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:49,650
You were originally an immortal fox...

90
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,530
on the Spiritual Mountain from the
Territory of Departure and Hatred in the West.

91
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:55,530
You were exiled to the mundane
world to go through your difficulties,

92
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:59,320
but you are destined to become
a first-class immortal fox...

93
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,700
and return to Heaven.

94
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,410
I found you by the roadside.

95
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,070
Did you hear me?

96
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:11,490
I said that I found you by the roadside.

97
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,040
Any legend?

98
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,490
No.

99
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:24,290
Not at all? Maybe a little bit?

100
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:27,590
Not at all.

101
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,100
You don't have an immortal's background,

102
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,490
so if you're not careful enough...

103
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:34,370
you'll be beaten back to your original form.

104
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,270
If you still want to go,

105
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,840
here,

106
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:43,400
take this treasure which can be used
to kill those demons and monsters...

107
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,450
and take the elixir.

108
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:50,670
Take care.

109
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:51,390
Grandpa!

110
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:53,220
You are my natural grandfather!

111
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:55,120
-You are the kindest to me.
-Don't say that! Don't!

112
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:58,770
The fact that you can take that lot...

113
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:00,460
is also a providence.

114
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:02,690
According to this tour, you...

115
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:04,530
Thirteen...

116
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,610
You still don't know where that claman is.

117
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:07,320
Grandpa!

118
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,950
I'll give you my most precious thing...

119
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:10,090
to exchange your Ying Wuxie.

120
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:10,810
Thirteen Bai,

121
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:12,140
I refuse to be tied up with you.

122
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:12,980
Leave me alone!

123
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:19,370
You brat! How dare you steal my thing!

124
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:21,100
Wait for my good news, grandpa!

125
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,140
Elder, help me...

126
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:25,080
Come out.

127
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:26,770
I know you're here.

128
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:35,710
Chief...

129
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:37,170
Recently,

130
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:41,410
many of our juniors died on
the way of acquiring the elixir.

131
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:43,050
The spiritual cultivation
of Thirteen is not enough...

132
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:43,470
I...

133
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:46,500
I'm worried that he might be too
careless and make too many troubles.

134
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:46,870
He...

135
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:49,810
He may be the one who will get the White Elixir.

136
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:50,220
You...

137
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:53,190
Take care of him for me.

138
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:54,140
Okay.

139
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,700
Human world!

140
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:23,410
I'm here!

141
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:26,210
I don't want to be here!

142
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,700
Lady, lady.

143
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:53,570
Excuse me.

144
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:55,450
Have you ever seen the man in this painting?

145
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:56,990
No.

146
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,280
No? Thanks.

147
00:12:58,510 --> 00:12:59,280
Sorry.

148
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,540
Excuse me.

149
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:02,380
Have you ever seen the man in this painting?

150
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:04,370
Maybe...

151
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:05,430
not.

152
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:08,000
Excuse me.

153
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,290
Have you ever seen the man in
this painting? He is Liu Daoran.

154
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,820
No.

155
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:12,490
Thanks.

156
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:13,680
Let's go.

157
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:16,240
This Childe,

158
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,290
Have you ever seen the man in this painting?

159
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,050
This Childe,

160
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,380
The Childe who's eating the chicken...

161
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:29,930
Please forgive me.

162
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:32,300
Let's go.

163
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:41,090
What?

164
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:44,220
Thirteen Bai, did you come
down here to improve your food?

165
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,930
Is eating chicken so happy?

166
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:46,580
What's the rush!

167
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:47,340
I'll do it after eating it.

168
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:50,690
It's killing me! Claman is already there.

169
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:52,050
A pair of long ears...

170
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:52,680
Claman?

171
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,480
Where? Where?

172
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:55,880
Ears!

173
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:03,060
Childe,

174
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:04,960
you haven't paid the bill.

175
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:06,130
The bill!

176
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,220
Don't tell me it's a...

177
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:36,030
clamkey?

178
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:37,870
Childe,

179
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:39,760
would you like to rent a donkey?

180
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:40,890
Our donkeys...

181
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:41,820
are extremely tolerant.

182
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:42,890
You can go everywhere you want.

183
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:45,220
Childe, according to my observation,
you will pass the examination...

184
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,140
and return to your home proudly.

185
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:48,510
Let's... be my friend! I'll give you a discount.

186
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:48,950
No!

187
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:50,960
Childe, you can share a donkey with others...

188
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,970
You can have a cheaper trip if you
return your donkeys in other places.

189
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:56,080
Tomatoes on sticks! Sour and sweet!

190
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:57,930
Childe, Would you consider our donkeys?

191
00:14:59,370 --> 00:14:59,850
Too many people!

192
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:00,670
Where is he?

193
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:01,410
That one.

194
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:02,610
There are many ones!

195
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:03,520
It's killing me!

196
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:05,070
Exactly that one.

197
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,300
Exactly!

198
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,020
Please, please!

199
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:33,760
Please save my little grandson!

200
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:06,490
Come on.

201
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:24,300
Thank you, doctor.

202
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:24,830
Stand up!

203
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,270
Thank you, doctor.

204
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,280
There are different kinds of
ghosts sealed in this painting.

205
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:30,580
Drink a bowl of blood every day...

206
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:31,890
then your grandson will recover from his illness...

207
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:34,390
when the people in the paintings are dead.

208
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,310
Thank you so much!

209
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:38,570
What are you doing? The claman is here!

210
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:40,380
We shouldn't stay here for a long time.
Maybe next time.

211
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,060
Are you blind?

212
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:44,220
Sorry, sorry.

213
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:51,490
Get up! Your head would get kicked by donkeys!

214
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:52,250
Don't kick me!

215
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:30,610
Childe,

216
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:31,440
are you okay?

217
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:32,630
Let your donkey stay away from me.

218
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:34,830
My donkey,

219
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:36,940
my donkey!

220
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:38,420
Come back!

221
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:40,010
My donkey!

222
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,100
My donkey!

223
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,120
Who can stop it for me?

224
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:50,150
My donkey!

225
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,830
Come back!

226
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:03,890
Excuse me, excuse me!

227
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:08,290
Don't run!

228
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:13,310
Sorry!

229
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:20,900
Don't run!

230
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:22,090
My donkey,

231
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:23,780
wait!

232
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:26,510
My donkey.

233
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:32,290
Ah!

234
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,160
If I wasn't trapped in this box...

235
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:40,310
The more you rub, the dirtier I get.

236
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:55,720
Why are you dragging me?

237
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,780
Where is my donkey?

238
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,350
How can I know?

239
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,280
Let me go!

240
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:01,370
Let me go!

241
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:01,800
No!

242
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:02,740
Give my donkey back!

243
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,180
I warn you to stop, or I will kick your ass.

244
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:08,780
Isn't that your donkey?

245
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:16,160
Come back!

246
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:21,570
Don't run! Give my donkey back!

247
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:23,730
You should pursue the donkey.
Why are you pursuing me?

248
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:25,300
Don't run!

249
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,340
Come back.

250
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:33,840
You, an intellectual,

251
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:36,380
why can you run so fast?

252
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,130
A gentleman...

253
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:43,070
should be agile in words and quick in deeds.

254
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:50,370
We got lost.

255
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,250
Are you happy now?

256
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:54,800
You spoiled my important business!

257
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:56,950
Do you know the importance of that donkey?

258
00:19:57,010 --> 00:19:58,210
It's not my donkey.

259
00:19:58,470 --> 00:19:59,760
It's Daoran's donkey.

260
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,620
Well,

261
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,130
we'll just have a rest here.

262
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,330
We could find it tomorrow.

263
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:09,210
You are as stubborn as a donkey.

264
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:15,220
It's only a donkey...

265
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:19,410
Donkey...

266
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,370
Is he my claman?

267
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:26,170
You are so dull...

268
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,230
Gosh, what a gift!

269
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:32,460
Maybe this gift will kill you.

270
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:34,690
You should pay me a donkey...

271
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,140
Are you going to take the imperial examination?

272
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:43,440
Me too.

273
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:45,110
How about we go together?

274
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,170
I'm not a bad guy.

275
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,010
Give it back to me!

276
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:01,880
Okay, okay.

277
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:06,230
What an idiot.

278
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:14,140
Are you from Tushan?

279
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:17,400
My name is Thirteen. How about you?

280
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:19,930
Grandma let me give that donkey to Brother Daoran.

281
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,150
It's only a donkey.

282
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:49,150
Several years ago...

283
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,020
Daoran didn't pass the exam.

284
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:52,620
We had a promise made...

285
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,050
that we will meet by the riverside...

286
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:56,170
and go to the exam together this year.

287
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:57,970
Poor grandma,

288
00:21:58,110 --> 00:21:59,360
she missed Daoran so much...

289
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,210
and she entrusted me with the last donkey at home

290
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:02,730
and let me give it to Daoran...

291
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,090
However, by the time I got here,

292
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:05,730
I was already a day late.

293
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:07,130
I didn't find him,

294
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:08,260
but I met you.

295
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,620
Everyone laughs at me for being stupid,

296
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:12,370
but he never.

297
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,520
I'm sleepy. I'm going to sleep.

298
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,660
You must help me find my donkey tomorrow.

299
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:21,250
Of course, I will.

300
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,990
Could you sleep over there?

301
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:31,570
Okay.

302
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,540
Do you know who I am?

303
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,720
How dare you!

304
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,930
The chief asked me to take care of you.

305
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:31,720
So what?

306
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:33,490
It might be a White Elixir this time...

307
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,450
so you come here to flatter me.

308
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:37,560
It's the chief's order!

309
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:40,600
First,

310
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:42,940
beware of a Taoist priest.

311
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:44,220
Second,

312
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:47,750
think about Chapter 3 and
Section 5 of "Handbook of Claman":

313
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:50,840
If you want a human to believe you,
you should do two important things.

314
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:52,370
"You should lead him into a dangerous situation.

315
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,160
Let him become hopeless or fearful.

316
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:57,380
Then, give him some hope or clean up the crises."

317
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,490
Third...

318
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,020
And so this humble hut of mine
may shelter virtues half divine.

319
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,690
The moss may climb its ruined stair,
and grassy stains the curtain wear,

320
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:08,830
but...

321
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:11,300
but...

322
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,130
but...

323
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:15,920
but...

324
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:16,910
but scholars...

325
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,080
But scholars at their ease within,

326
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,220
for all but Ignorance enters in...

327
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:38,320
There are crises everywhere.

328
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,800
The human's heart is sinful.

329
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:51,290
It was Grandpa who let you help me.

330
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:52,720
To protect you secretly.

331
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,680
So you should do something for me first...

332
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:12,960
Wow!

333
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:16,430
My donkey!

334
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,080
Where did you go?

335
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:21,920
It's amazing! Amazing!

336
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:30,440
Do you know Tushan as well?

337
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:32,250
My name is Wang Zijin.

338
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:33,510
How about you?

339
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:35,010
Thirteen.

340
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,210
Thirteen...

341
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:37,140
How about your family name?

342
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:39,380
Bai.

343
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:41,160
Bai?

344
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,960
Then I'll call you Brother Bai later.

345
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:45,210
Just call me Xiao Bai.

346
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,180
Brother Xiao Bai.

347
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,170
Bamboo is good.

348
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:50,770
Hollow inside, straight outside.

349
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,720
They would rather break than bend.

350
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,790
It would be better if it is drizzling,

351
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:55,430
right?

352
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:56,870
Let's ride the donkey.

353
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:57,560
Me first.

354
00:25:58,620 --> 00:25:59,410
No!

355
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:00,260
We can't ride this donkey.

356
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,210
It's Daoran's donkey.

357
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:01,950
Then you first.

358
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:02,930
No, no,

359
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:03,690
let's walk.

360
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:05,350
It's Daoran's donkey.

361
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:06,180
We can't ride it.

362
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:06,680
It won't be destroyed.

363
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,760
We can ride it together.

364
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,470
No.

365
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:10,050
You have a donkey, but you don't ride it.

366
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:11,750
Maybe it wants to be ridden?

367
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,930
This way?

368
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:16,100
Don't worry.

369
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,850
We'll just take a shortcut.

370
00:26:57,770 --> 00:26:59,480
Excuse me, is there a hostel near here?

371
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,410
The Academy of Miserable Sea.

372
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,010
Yes.

373
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:35,930
The Academy of Miserable Sea.

374
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:42,890
Don't disturb them.

375
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:46,210
Do you also come to take the imperial examination?

376
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:48,490
Come in, please.

377
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:56,050
Knowledge is infinite.

378
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:57,720
If you intend to take the examination,

379
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,960
you must pass the Academy of Miserable Sea.

380
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,550
Do you want to know about our
tutorial lessons before the exam?

381
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:07,060
Three years of examination, five years of guidance.

382
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:08,510
We have custom-built lessons...

383
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:10,100
including the whole set of services,
from guessing the questions...

384
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,640
to passing the exam.

385
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,800
One teacher, one student. We don't need 8800,

386
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,470
all we want is 88.

387
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:16,340
88 pennies?

388
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,800
88 taels.

389
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:18,540
88 taels of silver!

390
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:23,300
Don't disturb them!

391
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,130
Let's go, Xiao Bai.

392
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:25,270
We can really guess the examination questions!

393
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:27,140
The imperial examination became business here.

394
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:27,930
You can't find a place to sleep...

395
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:30,010
in the circumference of dozens of miles.

396
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:31,550
We don't need any lessons.

397
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:33,860
One room. Two guests. Only for tonight.

398
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:37,430
Xiao Bai...

399
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:02,010
Xiao Bai...

400
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:04,800
Xiao Bai...

401
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:37,800
Childe.

402
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:45,650
Childe.

403
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,390
Childe.

404
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,330
Childe.

405
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,290
Come here. Come.

406
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:38,450
Where is...

407
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:01,970
Xiao Bai.

408
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:04,000
Hurry up!

409
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:09,260
That way!

410
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:10,440
Go!  Let's go!

411
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,590
That way. Go that way!

412
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,650
Jump!

413
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:21,260
-Xiao Bai.
-Jump, bro.

414
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:21,850
Sorry.

415
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:38,640
Help me!

416
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:38,800
Zijin, Zijin!

417
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,100
Get up! Get up!

418
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,980
Sorry, Xiao Bai!

419
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,470
Hurry up!

420
00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:28,930
Zijin, Zijin!

421
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:31,260
-Sorry!
-It's me.

422
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:32,010
Hurry up!

423
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,140
Are you okay?

424
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,340
Sorry! Sorry!

425
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:38,130
Go, go!

426
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:42,620
Zijin, Zijin!

427
00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:43,550
Jump!

428
00:36:53,890 --> 00:36:56,310
My target is that one.

429
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:57,970
Get out of the way now,

430
00:36:58,050 --> 00:36:59,590
then I won't kill you.

431
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:02,220
Monster!

432
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,450
I know everything about you.

433
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:07,660
You are not qualified to criticize me.

434
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:09,600
Too much nonsense.

435
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:13,100
Run!

436
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,340
Xiao Bai!

437
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,930
Zijin, run!

438
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:19,410
We can meet again in the future life.

439
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:52,800
Your puppet trick is superb.

440
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,410
You are a competent companion of me.

441
00:37:55,970 --> 00:37:57,220
When did you brush your teeth last time?

442
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,510
It's not elastic now.

443
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:03,050
I sacrificed a lot for you.

444
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:06,010
Don't forget if you become the immortal.

445
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:07,550
Okay, okay. I'll make it up for you.

446
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:13,080
How about my performance?

447
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:15,130
It's not too bad.

448
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:17,810
I have prepared for it carefully for you,

449
00:38:17,810 --> 00:38:19,870
to make sure he'll believe you.

450
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:23,550
Xiao Bai!

451
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:25,100
I'm here to save you!

452
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:27,010
Why is he back?

453
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:28,180
I don't have a script!
How can I continue to perform?

454
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:29,300
I'm not ready to act later.

455
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:30,260
I just don't know how to do it.

456
00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:31,300
Shut up!

457
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,180
Open your mouth.

458
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,990
Transform your body first.

459
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,650
Oops.

460
00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:48,830
Monster!

461
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:50,350
Spit out Xiao Bai! Hurry up!

462
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:51,720
Don't push me!

463
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:53,620
I don't want to kill anything!

464
00:38:54,650 --> 00:38:56,530
Okay! You don't want to do it, right?

465
00:38:57,010 --> 00:38:57,920
Monster!

466
00:38:58,170 --> 00:38:59,820
-Spit out Xiao Bai!
-There's gunpowder in his hands!

467
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,770
What should we do?

468
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:01,850
How can I know?

469
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:04,890
Spit out!

470
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,380
Did you hear me?

471
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:07,850
What should I do? Really spit you out?

472
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:08,750
What should I do?

473
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:10,180
Use the unique skill!

474
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:11,170
Spit out!

475
00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:15,270
Xiao Bai!

476
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,160
Xiao Bai!

477
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,430
Xiao Bai!

478
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:29,610
Xiao...

479
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,440
Let a monster do something wrong...

480
00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:11,730
It's a set of interlocking tricks.

481
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,540
Risk one's life to save another...

482
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:15,890
It's a trick of having oneself
tortured to win someone's heart.

483
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:18,790
How dare you not consult with me in advance?

484
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:21,010
-How can I know?
-I think my mouth got burned.

485
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:21,850
Who are you?

486
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:24,160
I...you...

487
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:25,890
This is my master.

488
00:41:26,330 --> 00:41:27,010
This is my footman.

489
00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:30,410
Nice to meet you.

490
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,980
See how bad I was injured!

491
00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:36,370
You should give me something more.

492
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:37,010
Alright.

493
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:39,250
I'm taking an elixir,

494
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:40,450
the White Elixir!

495
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:42,680
Certainly, I'll look after
you when I become immortal.

496
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:45,690
What if it's not a White Elixir?

497
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:50,670
You're exposed so we have to
play along with this situation.

498
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:55,700
You just trick that claman to Jiankang City.

499
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:58,030
I'll help you take a look at that elixir.

500
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:01,840
Follow my guidance.

501
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:03,410
Monster!

502
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:06,610
Spit Xiao Bai out!

503
00:42:08,470 --> 00:42:10,270
Grasp the opportunity! Don't let him run away!

504
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:12,000
I'll...

505
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,870
protect you secretly.

506
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:15,120
Just go!

507
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:49,730
You...you are...

508
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:51,450
Sorry...

509
00:42:52,910 --> 00:42:54,120
I'm a fox spirit.

510
00:42:56,730 --> 00:42:57,680
I come here to requite your kindness...

511
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:00,410
Requite the kindness...

512
00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:02,550
What an old-fashioned reason...

513
00:43:02,970 --> 00:43:04,350
I won't hurt you.

514
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:05,500
Don't be afraid.

515
00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:06,450
I'll transform back to human form.

516
00:43:15,910 --> 00:43:18,800
I remember saving chick, puppy, and piggy...

517
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:21,370
but little fox? I don't remember...

518
00:43:22,370 --> 00:43:24,430
Because it was 500 years ago.

519
00:43:28,330 --> 00:43:29,340
I can't recall.

520
00:43:29,810 --> 00:43:31,490
You certainly can't!

521
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:33,400
That happened in your pre-pre-previous life!

522
00:43:52,910 --> 00:43:54,200
It hurts!

523
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:56,250
It's real!

524
00:44:02,450 --> 00:44:03,410
Weren't you scared?

525
00:44:04,870 --> 00:44:05,790
I've liked...

526
00:44:05,830 --> 00:44:07,870
these plays about monsters
and ghosts since I was a child.

527
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:10,390
I never expect that it actually exists...

528
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:11,790
and I could meet a fox spirit...

529
00:44:11,930 --> 00:44:13,030
who would save my life.

530
00:44:13,330 --> 00:44:14,800
You saved me too.

531
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,580
I remember when I was little,

532
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:29,270
I fell into a pigsty and got bitten.

533
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:31,250
Grandma...

534
00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:32,670
took this to treat me.

535
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:37,160
You should...

536
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:38,350
chew it up...

537
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:40,250
and apply it to the wound.

538
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:43,370
I don't think I'm hurt that bad...

539
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:49,910
Donkey...

540
00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:51,670
Where is my donkey!

541
00:45:02,870 --> 00:45:04,070
Why are you all wet?

542
00:45:06,790 --> 00:45:08,330
I knew you wouldn't leave my donkey.

543
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:40,370
Great!

544
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:42,290
I can eat chicken if I follow you.

545
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:50,160
Hey, this boat doesn't depend on paddles...

546
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:51,190
Does it really depend on waves?

547
00:45:51,910 --> 00:45:52,970
It depends on me.

548
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:54,880
It's amazing!

549
00:45:59,610 --> 00:46:00,910
Her name is Ying Wuxie.

550
00:46:00,910 --> 00:46:01,870
It's our foxes' greatest treasure.

551
00:46:01,870 --> 00:46:03,660
My grandpa gave her to me.

552
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:05,410
This is Zijin. This is Ying Wuxie.

553
00:46:05,410 --> 00:46:06,190
My name is Zijin.

554
00:46:06,250 --> 00:46:07,150
What can she do?

555
00:46:07,330 --> 00:46:08,140
Well...

556
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:09,490
It's useless. It's just a kind of accessories.

557
00:46:09,490 --> 00:46:10,310
Let me have a look.

558
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:10,950
Of course not.

559
00:46:10,950 --> 00:46:11,870
This is the treasure of our fox spirits.

560
00:46:11,870 --> 00:46:12,540
Let me have a look!

561
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:13,180
No.

562
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:14,080
Hey,

563
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:15,250
do me a favor.

564
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:18,220
Okay. Is it favorable enough?

565
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:39,830
The king of foxes...

566
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:42,000
He is the king of foxes!

567
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,040
He is Wang Zijin!

568
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:46,770
I'm Wang Zijin.

569
00:46:52,790 --> 00:46:54,930
You're the kind of fox spirits
that have immense power, right?

570
00:46:55,130 --> 00:46:56,000
Of course!

571
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,490
I can do whatever I want.

572
00:46:57,510 --> 00:46:58,630
Wow! That's awesome...

573
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:01,010
We are just ordinary humans.

574
00:47:01,490 --> 00:47:05,250
We take the examinations of
provinces, prefectures, and counties.

575
00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:07,010
We need to pass these different levels of exams

576
00:47:07,050 --> 00:47:08,080
and eventually become a successful scholar.

577
00:47:08,370 --> 00:47:09,210
We fight for achievements and reputations.

578
00:47:10,570 --> 00:47:11,740
I envy your freedom...

579
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:13,160
and comfort.

580
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,580
Come on, we also have to take examinations.

581
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:17,390
Really?

582
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:19,710
It's just different from your way.

583
00:47:19,990 --> 00:47:21,330
How about you come with me
to take the imperial exam?

584
00:47:21,450 --> 00:47:22,660
When you take your exam,

585
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:23,850
I'll do something for you then.

586
00:47:25,830 --> 00:47:27,020
It's a deal, okay?

587
00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:30,130
I'm here to requite your kindness...

588
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,580
so maybe I can grant you three wishes.

589
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:34,470
Passing the examination,

590
00:47:34,470 --> 00:47:35,630
enjoying a happy marriage
and becoming extremely wealthy.

591
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:36,490
How do you like them?

592
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:39,210
Okay,

593
00:47:39,750 --> 00:47:40,910
you can help me to find Brother Daoran.

594
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,190
This's your first wish.

595
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:45,710
Why did you always talk about
Daoran, Daoran, and Daoran?

596
00:47:47,790 --> 00:47:49,360
My family had a history of ink-making,

597
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,250
and our ink supplied to the academy at the county.

598
00:47:51,790 --> 00:47:54,610
Brother Daoran was one of the
first-class talents in the academy.

599
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:57,370
He became the best primary scholar when he was 17.

600
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:00,210
Without him,

601
00:48:00,790 --> 00:48:02,080
I may not even know the words.

602
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:06,360
Brother Daoran is my role model.

603
00:48:09,410 --> 00:48:09,870
Okay,

604
00:48:10,890 --> 00:48:12,990
I'll help you find Daoran.

605
00:48:17,110 --> 00:48:18,500
Second,

606
00:48:20,270 --> 00:48:21,300
heal your wound as soon as possible.

607
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:24,530
I'm already fine.

608
00:48:25,050 --> 00:48:25,770
This doesn't count.

609
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:28,820
Forget it. Maybe next time.

610
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:32,490
Hey,

611
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:36,190
do foxes like to steal chickens?

612
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:37,930
Those are weasels!

613
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:41,200
However, my grandma told me that...

614
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:42,760
the most hateful thing in the world...

615
00:48:42,770 --> 00:48:43,350
is stealing.

616
00:48:45,110 --> 00:48:46,060
I thought killing might be more serious.

617
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:47,820
To kill is to steal others' lives.

618
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:48,570
How about lying?

619
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,310
To lie is to steal others' trust.

620
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:53,120
All of them are stealing.

621
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:53,840
All of them are hateful.

622
00:48:54,870 --> 00:48:55,380
Xiao Bai,

623
00:48:56,330 --> 00:48:57,830
you are a fox spirit,

624
00:48:57,830 --> 00:48:59,160
so you must know a lot.

625
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:00,710
Just ask, idiot.

626
00:49:01,620 --> 00:49:02,700
Hmmm...

627
00:49:02,710 --> 00:49:04,530
Do foxes have something to do with bromhidrosis?

628
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:05,630
It's not a question.

629
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:06,920
Don't be angry.

630
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:08,450
So does it matter or not?

631
00:49:08,450 --> 00:49:10,030
It doesn't matter!

632
00:49:26,450 --> 00:49:27,870
Xiao Bai, Xiao Bai!

633
00:49:27,870 --> 00:49:28,670
Look over there.

634
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:31,660
After we've crossed Jiankang City,

635
00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:32,730
we'll arrive the Imperial Examination Room,

636
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,490
where I'll take the exam.

637
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:39,540
Keep it at the hostel and
we'll pick it up in two days.

638
00:49:39,790 --> 00:49:40,330
Okay.

639
00:49:40,330 --> 00:49:41,040
You don't have to worry.

640
00:49:42,950 --> 00:49:43,540
Let's go.

641
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:45,830
Where's the donkey?

642
00:49:45,870 --> 00:49:47,790
Everything is arranged. Don't worry.

643
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:49,410
We hardly have the opportunity
to come to Jiankang City.

644
00:49:49,410 --> 00:49:50,970
We should really check it out.

645
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:52,830
But...

646
00:49:52,950 --> 00:49:53,790
Let's go!

647
00:49:59,790 --> 00:50:00,790
So beautiful...

648
00:50:17,330 --> 00:50:18,370
Xiao Bai...

649
00:50:18,690 --> 00:50:19,660
It's the brothel!

650
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:46,280
Childes, come in, take a seat.

651
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:48,680
Don't go!

652
00:51:04,870 --> 00:51:05,640
Childe,

653
00:51:07,370 --> 00:51:08,810
someone is waiting for you there.

654
00:51:12,750 --> 00:51:13,840
He must be Daoran.

655
00:51:28,410 --> 00:51:29,500
Where is that page boy?

656
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:30,680
Childe,

657
00:51:30,930 --> 00:51:32,690
just cross the bridge.

658
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:43,870
It must be here.

659
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:48,020
What brings Brother Daoran here?

660
00:51:56,380 --> 00:51:57,840
I'm looking for Mr. Liu from Tushan.

661
00:51:57,840 --> 00:51:58,750
Looking for someone?

662
00:51:59,010 --> 00:52:01,470
Everyone comes here is looking for someone.

663
00:52:03,530 --> 00:52:04,490
Wait wait,

664
00:52:05,790 --> 00:52:06,370
wait...

665
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:09,020
wait...

666
00:52:10,030 --> 00:52:11,410
I'm looking for Liu Daoran from Tushan.

667
00:52:11,830 --> 00:52:12,700
He is on the second floor.

668
00:52:12,790 --> 00:52:13,660
Upstairs.

669
00:52:21,870 --> 00:52:22,680
Childe,

670
00:52:22,850 --> 00:52:24,370
We've been waiting for you for a long time.

671
00:52:34,910 --> 00:52:36,660
I make this sacrifice for you,

672
00:52:36,790 --> 00:52:38,860
but you are such an unfilial
apprentice...How dare you laugh?

673
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:41,510
So, should I laugh or "unfiliaugh"ï¼Ÿ

674
00:52:42,370 --> 00:52:43,260
Wait a moment...

675
00:52:43,650 --> 00:52:44,940
I thought we are going to find Brother Daoran...

676
00:52:45,290 --> 00:52:45,810
Yes.

677
00:52:46,230 --> 00:52:46,960
Go!

678
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:48,510
Wait, what are you doing?

679
00:52:48,620 --> 00:52:49,600
Wait a moment...

680
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:50,540
Don't get me wrong!

681
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:52,040
I don't have the money to spend.

682
00:52:52,410 --> 00:52:53,160
Xiao Bai!

683
00:52:53,790 --> 00:52:55,190
Xiao Bai!

684
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:56,360
I'm here. Don't be afraid.

685
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:58,460
Let me go!

686
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:00,200
Xiao Bai!

687
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:01,250
Tonight will be the most important night.

688
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:04,750
Do we have to do it?

689
00:53:05,370 --> 00:53:06,700
Humans and foxes belong to different worlds,

690
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:08,200
but ghosts are different from both of them.

691
00:53:08,870 --> 00:53:11,830
They can travel freely between
worlds of humans and foxes,

692
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:15,170
so they can see what we can't.

693
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:19,000
They can see the location...

694
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:20,770
and the quality of elixir.

695
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:25,490
They sure can confirm both.

696
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:27,540
Even if you fail,

697
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:29,870
I'll think of a way to get the elixir,

698
00:53:29,870 --> 00:53:32,430
which is something you can't
learn from the "Claman Manual".

699
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:35,750
What are you doing in this broad daylight!

700
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:37,670
It's already getting dark.

701
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:47,830
Open the door!

702
00:53:47,830 --> 00:53:49,410
She's not going to do
anything to my claman, is she?

703
00:53:49,410 --> 00:53:50,160
Xiao Bai!

704
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:51,300
What can she do?

705
00:53:53,170 --> 00:53:56,680
Open the door!

706
00:54:47,750 --> 00:54:53,170
Waves of spring river are as high as the sea,

707
00:54:54,260 --> 00:55:00,270
a bright moon rises with the tide.

708
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:05,290
Shimmering moonlight flows with the waves,

709
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:12,530
we can find this moonlight on every spring river.

710
00:55:44,370 --> 00:55:45,820
Childe, sorry to have kept you waiting.

711
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:49,160
My name is Yinglian.

712
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:16,820
You look like my grandma...

713
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:19,590
the fairy in her stories.

714
00:56:29,290 --> 00:56:30,190
What's that sound?

715
00:56:31,290 --> 00:56:32,000
It's hopeful!

716
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:33,370
Will she eat him?

717
00:56:33,410 --> 00:56:34,080
She?

718
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:34,950
She dare not do that.

719
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:36,540
She may suck some blood at the most.

720
00:56:36,950 --> 00:56:37,640
Okay,

721
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:39,950
I have to take care of my business.

722
00:56:40,370 --> 00:56:41,940
If it's not because of the White Elixir,

723
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:44,720
I won't spend that much of effort.

724
00:57:04,460 --> 00:57:05,360
Childe,

725
00:57:05,820 --> 00:57:06,910
why?

726
00:57:28,410 --> 00:57:29,190
Childe,

727
00:57:30,030 --> 00:57:30,910
you are bleeding.

728
00:57:36,580 --> 00:57:37,410
My name is Wang Zijin.

729
00:57:37,750 --> 00:57:38,750
Sorry to break into your boudoir.

730
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:40,950
I also shouldn't have some
dirty thoughts about you.

731
00:57:41,290 --> 00:57:42,080
I'm sorry but I have to leave.

732
00:57:45,370 --> 00:57:46,500
May I ask your age, Childe?

733
00:57:47,370 --> 00:57:48,340
Thirteen.

734
00:57:48,450 --> 00:57:49,570
Thirteen?

735
00:57:50,330 --> 00:57:50,870
Xiao Bai!

736
00:57:50,950 --> 00:57:51,890
Xiao Bai?

737
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:53,620
Sorry to bother you!

738
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:55,650
Why did you run away like this?

739
00:57:56,230 --> 00:57:57,400
Do you dislike me?

740
00:57:57,620 --> 00:57:59,160
No, you get me wrong.

741
00:57:59,580 --> 00:58:00,870
That's not my idea.

742
00:58:01,250 --> 00:58:02,340
You look so gorgeous,

743
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:03,370
so...

744
00:58:03,370 --> 00:58:04,500
I'd like to ask you...

745
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:05,910
What?

746
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:07,710
that...that...

747
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:09,870
where are you from?

748
00:58:10,370 --> 00:58:11,380
Maybe the Western Regions.

749
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:12,530
I don't remember.

750
00:58:18,750 --> 00:58:19,690
It...It...

751
00:58:19,870 --> 00:58:20,900
It's broken...

752
00:58:21,260 --> 00:58:22,540
May I ask your age, please?

753
00:58:26,910 --> 00:58:28,370
Your questions were so detailed...

754
00:58:28,890 --> 00:58:29,660
Are you going to marry me?

755
00:58:30,290 --> 00:58:31,620
I'm not married.

756
00:58:31,930 --> 00:58:32,850
What a coincidence!

757
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:35,760
I'm not married, too.

758
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:36,890
I didn't mean it.

759
00:58:37,070 --> 00:58:39,210
I meant that I haven't
thought about getting married.

760
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:44,320
I'll compensate for your losses.

761
00:58:45,660 --> 00:58:46,630
Okay,

762
00:58:46,890 --> 00:58:48,550
I'd like you to compensate for my loneliness.

763
00:58:51,810 --> 00:58:52,620
It's bleeding...

764
00:59:09,650 --> 00:59:10,120
Lady,

765
00:59:10,490 --> 00:59:11,120
what's wrong?

766
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:14,560
I'm a dancer, so I have to
practice hard in my daily life.

767
00:59:16,450 --> 00:59:17,950
You are so hardworking.

768
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:27,370
Lady, why...

769
00:59:29,950 --> 00:59:30,690
My makeup was messed up..

770
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:31,610
I have to refine it.

771
00:59:33,130 --> 00:59:33,520
So...

772
00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:34,060
Don't move!

773
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:36,050
Stand there!

774
00:59:37,310 --> 00:59:38,610
Don't turn around!

775
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:43,810
I shouldn't look at things which
do not conform to the rites...

776
00:59:46,650 --> 00:59:47,390
Sorry to offend you.

777
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:51,030
Lady, how can I compensate for my damage?

778
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:52,270
Lady?

779
00:59:57,540 --> 00:59:58,160
Lady?

780
01:00:01,290 --> 01:00:01,870
Lady?

781
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:05,120
Lady?

782
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:13,500
Lady?

783
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,410
Is it too exciting?

784
01:00:20,590 --> 01:00:22,200
If you are curious, you can go in to see.

785
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:23,620
If you are distressed, you can go in and persuade.

786
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:24,540
Don't just sit and watch the game.

787
01:00:24,620 --> 01:00:25,120
Wait a moment.

788
01:00:25,450 --> 01:00:26,450
Don't be unreasonable.

789
01:00:26,450 --> 01:00:27,370
You can't blame me for your failure...

790
01:00:33,700 --> 01:00:34,320
Lady?

791
01:00:34,790 --> 01:00:37,870
Did I let you think about something bad?

792
01:00:37,950 --> 01:00:39,410
I've never met a person like you.

793
01:00:39,700 --> 01:00:42,370
I've never met a lady like you
too. You're just like a fairy.

794
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:44,130
You're so beautiful and talented.

795
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:45,200
Obviously,

796
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:46,570
you're here because of...

797
01:00:46,580 --> 01:00:47,820
your miserable fate.

798
01:00:47,930 --> 01:00:49,160
I don't have too much money in my wallet.

799
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:50,620
If...

800
01:00:50,870 --> 01:00:52,140
I can get good grades this year,

801
01:00:52,580 --> 01:00:54,050
I must help you to get out of here...

802
01:00:54,070 --> 01:00:54,910
and get rid of all these sufferings.

803
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:55,740
What are you doing?

804
01:00:56,730 --> 01:00:58,270
I won't turn around anymore.

805
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:02,590
This is my favorite book,

806
01:01:02,910 --> 01:01:03,620
and I would like to give you as a gift.

807
01:01:05,630 --> 01:01:06,670
It's bleeding again...

808
01:01:11,450 --> 01:01:12,130
Lady,

809
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:13,080
you...

810
01:01:13,620 --> 01:01:14,100
I...

811
01:01:14,510 --> 01:01:16,690
you're the only one I'll marry!

812
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:18,890
Are you crazy?

813
01:01:19,110 --> 01:01:20,290
I'm absolutely healthy.

814
01:01:23,450 --> 01:01:24,190
It stops...

815
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:26,270
Don't move.

816
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:34,180
Lady...

817
01:01:34,780 --> 01:01:36,960
If we do what spouses do...

818
01:01:37,130 --> 01:01:40,730
before the rituals of a spouse,

819
01:01:40,770 --> 01:01:43,150
it'll be a humiliation to you.

820
01:01:49,410 --> 01:01:51,040
Lady, lady!

821
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:52,500
What do you want?

822
01:01:52,620 --> 01:01:53,830
What the hell is it?

823
01:01:53,830 --> 01:01:55,030
It covered everything.

824
01:01:57,250 --> 01:01:57,660
Lady,

825
01:01:59,040 --> 01:01:59,430
come on.

826
01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:02,120
I'm afraid that I can't control myself.

827
01:02:02,540 --> 01:02:05,460
So, please tie up my hands and feet for me.

828
01:02:16,830 --> 01:02:18,180
I, Wang Zijin, swear to god,

829
01:02:18,750 --> 01:02:19,790
I will pass the exam...

830
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:21,080
and propose to you,

831
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:23,610
if you agree.

832
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:26,180
Tonight only belongs to you and me.

833
01:02:26,450 --> 01:02:27,620
It's a long night...

834
01:02:27,890 --> 01:02:28,890
Do you...

835
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:31,130
really want to discuss theories
of Confucius and Mencius?

836
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:31,790
No, no.

837
01:02:31,950 --> 01:02:33,040
That's so boring.

838
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:35,140
How about The Nanhua Classic?

839
01:02:42,290 --> 01:02:44,140
There was a fish in the North Ocean,

840
01:02:45,450 --> 01:02:47,520
and its name was Kun.

841
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:50,520
The Kun was so huge...

842
01:02:50,610 --> 01:02:53,210
and I just didn't know how big it is.

843
01:02:54,540 --> 01:02:55,500
Then it became a bird,

844
01:02:56,290 --> 01:02:57,540
and its name was Peng.

845
01:02:59,950 --> 01:03:00,870
The back of Peng is so huge...

846
01:03:01,750 --> 01:03:03,620
and I just didn't know how big it is.

847
01:03:05,660 --> 01:03:06,850
When it vibrated its wings and flied straight up,

848
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:10,110
these wings were just like
clouds hanging in the sky.

849
01:03:11,540 --> 01:03:12,660
When the wind blew the sea,

850
01:03:13,660 --> 01:03:16,500
this bird would migrate to the southern sea...

851
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:21,970
Idiot,

852
01:03:23,460 --> 01:03:25,090
I didn't let you suffer too many losses.

853
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:52,730
Silly boy...

854
01:03:58,620 --> 01:03:59,870
You can't sleep without his snores, right?

855
01:03:59,870 --> 01:04:01,170
Or you want a game of three-player Chinese poker?

856
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:02,600
Give it back to me.

857
01:04:04,290 --> 01:04:05,040
What?

858
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:06,270
Give it back to me.

859
01:04:08,190 --> 01:04:08,820
Have you seen it?

860
01:04:10,650 --> 01:04:11,540
I haven't been close to him.

861
01:04:12,340 --> 01:04:13,500
I don't have the opportunity to see it.

862
01:04:23,730 --> 01:04:25,750
I think that achieving the
elixir is not my destiny.

863
01:04:26,050 --> 01:04:28,040
People who don't have wisdom and guts...

864
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:28,880
like to complain about their fate most.

865
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:31,300
Xiao Bai, I'm in love with someone.

866
01:04:33,380 --> 01:04:34,990
I only love Yinglian...

867
01:04:41,550 --> 01:04:43,920
If he's not my claman,

868
01:04:46,090 --> 01:04:47,090
maybe...

869
01:04:48,090 --> 01:04:50,000
we could become very intimate friends.

870
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,130
Thirteen Bai,

871
01:04:51,130 --> 01:04:52,710
because of your background...

872
01:04:52,710 --> 01:04:54,710
you have been laughed by
other foxes all these years.

873
01:04:54,710 --> 01:04:56,250
Aren't their laughter harsh enough?

874
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:58,460
You're such a great guy.

875
01:04:58,460 --> 01:04:59,480
You have a great mindset.

876
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:02,290
I'll see who dares to laugh at me.

877
01:05:02,690 --> 01:05:03,670
Why don't you keep laughing?

878
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:05,600
-Keep pretending you don't hear me.
-Why aren't you laughing?

879
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:06,450
Hello?

880
01:05:06,460 --> 01:05:07,920
-Laugh! Laugh!
-Wake up!

881
01:05:16,410 --> 01:05:17,250
Wake up!

882
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:23,250
You're so naughty!

883
01:05:25,010 --> 01:05:26,810
No, no, no!

884
01:05:27,330 --> 01:05:28,200
Afraid of water?

885
01:05:28,290 --> 01:05:30,090
You'll only bully me.

886
01:05:30,110 --> 01:05:32,260
But I'm still happy for you.

887
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:33,710
At least you could live happily ever after...

888
01:05:33,710 --> 01:05:34,540
as you'll never know how dumb you are.

889
01:05:36,370 --> 01:05:37,020
Hey, girl.

890
01:05:43,610 --> 01:05:45,690
How dare you play tricks?

891
01:05:46,310 --> 01:05:47,990
Why can't you do such a little tiny thing?

892
01:05:52,750 --> 01:05:55,820
The lotus that your soul
possessed in is still in my hands.

893
01:05:58,290 --> 01:06:00,370
If I didn't have to use you to get that elixir,

894
01:06:00,370 --> 01:06:02,210
I could destroy you right now!

895
01:06:14,290 --> 01:06:16,170
I must pass the exam this time.

896
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:20,090
have you ever seen this man in the painting?

897
01:06:20,340 --> 01:06:21,750
If you see him later,

898
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:23,110
please tell him that Wang Zijin is waiting for him

899
01:06:23,110 --> 01:06:24,390
in the Imperial Examination Room.

900
01:06:24,420 --> 01:06:26,380
Have you ever seen this man in the painting?

901
01:06:26,380 --> 01:06:27,370
Who are you?

902
01:06:28,270 --> 01:06:29,450
My name is Wang Zijin.

903
01:06:30,170 --> 01:06:31,910
Is your father Mr. Wang from Nanjing?

904
01:06:32,050 --> 01:06:33,370
My father is skilled in making inks,

905
01:06:33,450 --> 01:06:34,340
which is...

906
01:06:34,900 --> 01:06:36,820
Oh, that's good.

907
01:06:37,450 --> 01:06:39,310
Have you ever seen this man...

908
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:42,500
I passed!

909
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:44,690
I won!

910
01:06:45,370 --> 01:06:46,090
Don't touch it!

911
01:06:46,530 --> 01:06:47,650
It's mine!

912
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:48,840
Don't touch it!

913
01:07:02,730 --> 01:07:04,580
What are you thinking about?
You'll take the exam tomorrow.

914
01:07:05,350 --> 01:07:06,260
According to your opinions,

915
01:07:07,290 --> 01:07:09,430
how many people will
participate in this examination?

916
01:07:09,780 --> 01:07:12,750
There are only a few that make it...

917
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,230
Why are you so indecisive?

918
01:07:14,590 --> 01:07:17,220
If you don't pass it,
 nobody will respect you, right?

919
01:07:17,490 --> 01:07:19,470
You don't have the strength to
propose to your sweetheart, right?

920
01:07:19,750 --> 01:07:20,960
I knew it.

921
01:07:21,470 --> 01:07:23,330
I don't have a respectable
background, just like you.

922
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:25,670
Actually...

923
01:07:26,650 --> 01:07:29,700
I'm not a real fox spirit now.

924
01:07:29,930 --> 01:07:30,530
It's just an exam.

925
01:07:32,540 --> 01:07:33,810
If you wouldn't pass this time,

926
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:35,680
you could retake next year.

927
01:07:36,710 --> 01:07:37,460
You studied...

928
01:07:38,230 --> 01:07:39,500
for yourself.

929
01:07:40,590 --> 01:07:42,010
I believe you can do it.

930
01:07:57,290 --> 01:07:58,800
You can become a real fox spirit.

931
01:07:59,390 --> 01:08:00,730
And a good one.

932
01:08:14,190 --> 01:08:15,800
I'll work hard!

933
01:08:16,630 --> 01:08:18,170
I can do it!

934
01:08:22,250 --> 01:08:23,500
God is answering me!

935
01:08:25,540 --> 01:08:26,630
He'll work hard!

936
01:08:27,380 --> 01:08:28,340
He can do it!

937
01:08:33,420 --> 01:08:34,450
Talk about yourself!

938
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:38,050
I'll be a good fox spirit!

939
01:08:39,330 --> 01:08:40,660
Do it again! Do it again!

940
01:08:41,090 --> 01:08:42,460
I'll work hard!

941
01:08:42,460 --> 01:08:44,090
I can do it!

942
01:08:46,170 --> 01:08:48,470
He'll be a good fox spirit!

943
01:09:10,019 --> 01:09:11,389
We're selecting the scholars of our big country.

944
01:09:11,809 --> 01:09:13,280
All we want are talented people.

945
01:09:13,940 --> 01:09:15,370
The classics are here.

946
01:09:15,429 --> 01:09:17,220
Please search for what you want.

947
01:09:17,330 --> 01:09:18,780
However, if you want to
cheat with your private notes,

948
01:09:18,929 --> 01:09:19,960
once discovered...

949
01:09:20,330 --> 01:09:21,280
you'll be punished.

950
01:09:21,290 --> 01:09:22,010
The Official!

951
01:09:22,010 --> 01:09:23,380
Please have mercy on me!

952
01:09:23,530 --> 01:09:24,269
Don't talk!

953
01:09:28,290 --> 01:09:29,120
Go in.

954
01:09:33,630 --> 01:09:35,340
Do you want to cut it up to have a look?

955
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:37,710
Cut it here.

956
01:09:37,710 --> 01:09:38,710
Cut it there.

957
01:09:38,710 --> 01:09:39,540
Cut!

958
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:44,769
Your skill is great.

959
01:09:46,510 --> 01:09:47,979
People who have been searched...

960
01:09:48,309 --> 01:09:49,929
please take the examination paper...

961
01:09:50,090 --> 01:09:51,620
and wait for the exam.

962
01:10:36,370 --> 01:10:38,460
Pass the Dragon Gate.

963
01:11:26,630 --> 01:11:28,220
Examination starts now.

964
01:12:24,090 --> 01:12:25,360
7 o'clock in the evening.

965
01:12:25,750 --> 01:12:28,000
You can only pass the exam
if you understand the classics.

966
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,960
Just do it in a spurt of energy.

967
01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:31,710
Sit up straight!

968
01:12:42,170 --> 01:12:43,060
I've passed it!

969
01:12:50,630 --> 01:12:51,460
Ghost!

970
01:12:51,810 --> 01:12:54,330
There's a ghost! Ghost!

971
01:12:54,870 --> 01:12:56,750
There's a ghost! Ghost!

972
01:12:56,770 --> 01:12:58,440
Ah!

973
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:07,360
Silence!

974
01:13:15,110 --> 01:13:16,380
9 o'clock in the evening.

975
01:13:17,590 --> 01:13:19,170
Don't look anywhere else.

976
01:13:19,590 --> 01:13:21,630
Don't talk to anyone.

977
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:23,670
Stabilize your mind!

978
01:13:55,750 --> 01:13:56,400
What are you doing here?

979
01:14:04,090 --> 01:14:05,960
Would like to do a business with you.

980
01:14:06,130 --> 01:14:07,000
Tonight...

981
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:10,610
the ghost of this examination room
will capture a bunch of students' souls,

982
01:14:12,210 --> 01:14:13,710
including Zijin's.

983
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:15,350
Passed...

984
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:20,190
Passed...

985
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:23,800
I've passed.

986
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:28,380
If the evil spirit is subdued,

987
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:30,340
the spell will naturally disappear,

988
01:14:30,340 --> 01:14:32,810
which that old fox doesn't know.

989
01:14:37,610 --> 01:14:39,790
Zijin's soul was gone,

990
01:14:39,790 --> 01:14:41,510
so he won't feel any pain.

991
01:14:41,790 --> 01:14:43,490
It's the perfect time to kill him,

992
01:14:43,670 --> 01:14:46,330
as the quality of the elixir won't be changed.

993
01:14:55,880 --> 01:14:58,010
Three fingers next to the Tianchi point.

994
01:14:58,540 --> 01:14:59,630
White elixir.

995
01:15:00,130 --> 01:15:01,400
Did you see it?

996
01:15:04,460 --> 01:15:06,230
When it's done,

997
01:15:06,470 --> 01:15:08,930
you should help me to take back the lotus.

998
01:15:10,340 --> 01:15:11,490
Don't forget that,

999
01:15:12,150 --> 01:15:13,730
if you don't get it,

1000
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:17,180
your 500 years of cultivation will be wasted!

1001
01:15:17,370 --> 01:15:19,180
I help you this time,

1002
01:15:19,260 --> 01:15:20,940
and you should help me too,

1003
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:22,750
okay?

1004
01:15:23,090 --> 01:15:23,780
Okay.

1005
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:25,480
Brother Daoran!

1006
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:28,360
I finally found you!

1007
01:16:30,340 --> 01:16:31,500
I'm Zijin!

1008
01:16:32,790 --> 01:16:34,090
Why are you ignoring me?

1009
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:36,250
I haven't seen you for so many years,

1010
01:16:36,920 --> 01:16:38,320
Grandma has thought about you for days and nights.

1011
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:40,820
Many things happened at home...

1012
01:16:41,250 --> 01:16:43,290
I have made a new friend called "Xiao Bai".

1013
01:16:43,290 --> 01:16:44,090
Brother Daoran!

1014
01:16:44,090 --> 01:16:45,290
grandma let me give that donkey to you.

1015
01:16:45,290 --> 01:16:46,180
Be off!

1016
01:17:00,300 --> 01:17:00,930
Leave!

1017
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:02,500
Wait a moment, Xiao Bai...

1018
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:03,250
Waiting for what?

1019
01:17:03,460 --> 01:17:05,090
Your soul is leaving your body!
It'll be too late if you don't go back!

1020
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:06,790
He is Brother Daoran I was always looking for...

1021
01:17:06,790 --> 01:17:08,040
He is already dead!

1022
01:17:08,790 --> 01:17:09,540
Dead?

1023
01:17:10,090 --> 01:17:11,250
I don't believe it!

1024
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:15,750
Don't disturb me! I'm answering the questions!

1025
01:17:16,630 --> 01:17:17,290
Leave now!

1026
01:17:22,870 --> 01:17:25,250
If I can't pass, nobody can do it...

1027
01:17:37,270 --> 01:17:38,390
We're all the same!

1028
01:17:38,700 --> 01:17:40,440
Who can escape?

1029
01:17:41,460 --> 01:17:42,450
Who can do it?

1030
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:16,480
Zijin!

1031
01:18:21,220 --> 01:18:23,330
Liu Daoran failed too many times in
this exam and died in the examination room.

1032
01:18:23,340 --> 01:18:25,240
He became the ghost and no one could handle it.

1033
01:18:25,250 --> 01:18:26,790
Did you forget your objective?

1034
01:18:26,860 --> 01:18:28,400
That was White Elixir!

1035
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:52,390
You really want to die, right?

1036
01:18:53,630 --> 01:18:55,020
It's over. I'm dead.

1037
01:19:42,110 --> 01:19:43,860
Don't you want to take the elixir?

1038
01:19:51,490 --> 01:19:54,140
Don't you want to be immortal?

1039
01:20:00,760 --> 01:20:02,960
Don't you want to live?

1040
01:20:07,570 --> 01:20:10,050
If you want to save others,
you should recognize yourself.

1041
01:20:10,490 --> 01:20:12,210
I can get you out of here,

1042
01:20:12,550 --> 01:20:14,220
only if Liu Daoran can remember the past.

1043
01:20:14,520 --> 01:20:16,460
Don't worry about being alone...

1044
01:20:19,790 --> 01:20:20,870
on the way ahead.

1045
01:20:20,900 --> 01:20:22,850
It's up to you to decide...

1046
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,440
how far my light will reach.

1047
01:20:25,680 --> 01:20:27,070
Don't worry about being alone...

1048
01:20:27,090 --> 01:20:28,670
on the way ahead.

1049
01:20:28,670 --> 01:20:29,750
Brother Daoran!

1050
01:20:29,750 --> 01:20:30,550
Zijin!

1051
01:20:30,660 --> 01:20:31,590
Here's the ink.

1052
01:20:32,650 --> 01:20:33,820
Thanks, Zijin.

1053
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:35,880
I'll give this pen to you.

1054
01:20:36,240 --> 01:20:38,440
You should study hard later.

1055
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:42,190
Thanks, Brother Daoran.

1056
01:20:43,720 --> 01:20:45,090
Don't worry about being alone...

1057
01:20:45,260 --> 01:20:46,290
on the way ahead.

1058
01:20:47,330 --> 01:20:49,000
Everyone in the world...

1059
01:20:50,250 --> 01:20:51,540
knows my heart.

1060
01:20:53,970 --> 01:20:54,750
Zijin...

1061
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:56,940
Maybe one day...

1062
01:20:57,330 --> 01:20:59,000
you'll walk into the examination room.

1063
01:20:59,950 --> 01:21:01,250
The pen in your hands...

1064
01:21:01,530 --> 01:21:03,140
will draw a bright future...

1065
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:05,380
and support your great ideal.

1066
01:21:07,620 --> 01:21:10,570
If you and I could be talented
and great contributors...

1067
01:21:10,990 --> 01:21:13,760
we should not be greedy for the earthly attachment.

1068
01:21:14,790 --> 01:21:18,380
Families, confidants, lovers...

1069
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:21,390
even what we think when we first pick up the pen...

1070
01:21:22,090 --> 01:21:23,380
can be discarded...

1071
01:21:24,020 --> 01:21:25,260
if it's for merit and fame.

1072
01:21:26,130 --> 01:21:26,790
Zijin,

1073
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:28,930
when we meet again,

1074
01:21:29,610 --> 01:21:31,090
the names of you and me...

1075
01:21:31,250 --> 01:21:33,660
will be written into history and epic.

1076
01:21:36,150 --> 01:21:38,220
Don't worry about being alone...

1077
01:21:39,330 --> 01:21:41,170
Don't worry about being alone...

1078
01:21:41,170 --> 01:21:42,520
on the way ahead.

1079
01:21:42,740 --> 01:21:44,670
Everyone in the world...

1080
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:47,470
knows my heart.

1081
01:21:49,340 --> 01:21:50,380
Brother Daoran!

1082
01:22:02,090 --> 01:22:02,830
Zijin.

1083
01:22:05,650 --> 01:22:06,670
It's been a long time.

1084
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:10,880
Brother Daoran!

1085
01:22:12,540 --> 01:22:13,840
I missed you.

1086
01:22:14,530 --> 01:22:16,600
Both grandma and I thought of you every day,

1087
01:22:17,170 --> 01:22:18,780
waiting for you to go home.

1088
01:22:20,340 --> 01:22:21,320
It's too late.

1089
01:22:22,420 --> 01:22:23,930
Everything is too late.

1090
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:29,250
It's all that I can do.

1091
01:22:32,590 --> 01:22:34,090
Wuxie...

1092
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:39,310
I don't have to be stuck in this box anymore.

1093
01:22:40,690 --> 01:22:41,870
Thirteen,

1094
01:22:42,710 --> 01:22:43,880
farewell.

1095
01:22:51,220 --> 01:22:52,340
Zijin,

1096
01:22:54,500 --> 01:22:55,860
you should be careful.

1097
01:22:56,720 --> 01:22:59,330
That fox spirit has followed you all the way...

1098
01:23:00,210 --> 01:23:03,910
only to take the elixir of the soul in your body.

1099
01:23:18,150 --> 01:23:19,330
3 o'clock in the morning.

1100
01:23:24,110 --> 01:23:24,900
Please enjoy your meal!

1101
01:23:36,750 --> 01:23:37,440
Xiao Bai!

1102
01:23:39,850 --> 01:23:41,440
Thank you for saving me again.

1103
01:23:42,410 --> 01:23:44,120
It's Ying Wuxie who saved us.

1104
01:23:45,700 --> 01:23:47,980
She was supposed to be with my grandpa...

1105
01:23:49,050 --> 01:23:49,990
It's my fault.

1106
01:23:52,040 --> 01:23:53,720
If you have any wish,

1107
01:23:54,740 --> 01:23:56,270
you must tell me.

1108
01:23:58,160 --> 01:23:59,660
I also want to do something for you.

1109
01:24:06,030 --> 01:24:06,720
Xiao Bai,

1110
01:24:12,120 --> 01:24:13,670
what is the elixir of the soul?

1111
01:24:22,250 --> 01:24:23,250
It is...

1112
01:24:26,910 --> 01:24:27,880
It is a...

1113
01:24:32,160 --> 01:24:32,620
elixir.

1114
01:24:34,330 --> 01:24:34,920
Do I have it?

1115
01:24:38,790 --> 01:24:39,870
I can give it to you.

1116
01:24:41,790 --> 01:24:43,090
I'm totally fine.

1117
01:24:45,450 --> 01:24:46,070
Xiao Bai...

1118
01:24:47,880 --> 01:24:49,270
I have another wish...

1119
01:24:50,570 --> 01:24:52,330
I want to get Yinglian out of here.

1120
01:24:55,330 --> 01:24:57,520
She used to be an orphan,
abducted by human traders,

1121
01:24:58,280 --> 01:24:59,670
sold to Peony Brothel as a prostitute.

1122
01:25:01,090 --> 01:25:02,100
She finally jumped into a river to commit suicide.

1123
01:25:04,040 --> 01:25:05,330
Her resentment was too powerful,

1124
01:25:06,010 --> 01:25:08,050
which made her soul possessed
the body of this lotus.

1125
01:25:08,710 --> 01:25:11,730
Then, she became the best beauty in Peony Brothel.

1126
01:25:12,450 --> 01:25:13,620
She ate human hearts...

1127
01:25:13,910 --> 01:25:14,780
and sucked their blood...

1128
01:25:15,610 --> 01:25:16,780
to maintain her look.

1129
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:19,680
You've already known it.

1130
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:24,450
Only someone who really loves her...

1131
01:25:25,690 --> 01:25:26,780
can help her release the soul.

1132
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:32,240
Will you help me to meet my second wish?

1133
01:25:37,080 --> 01:25:38,440
You should think twice...

1134
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:00,370
I, Wang Zijin from Tushan,

1135
01:26:02,620 --> 01:26:04,450
have sincerely prepared the betrothal gift...

1136
01:26:06,050 --> 01:26:07,980
for asking Yinglian from the Peony to marry me.

1137
01:26:10,210 --> 01:26:11,550
This wedding is a chance for you...

1138
01:26:12,010 --> 01:26:14,000
to take the elixir with the help of that ghost.

1139
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
What a luck for you loser.

1140
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:17,370
Just follow my lead.

1141
01:26:17,370 --> 01:26:18,140
Ms. Yinglian...

1142
01:26:19,580 --> 01:26:20,550
will you marry me?

1143
01:26:24,290 --> 01:26:25,540
You've known that I'm...

1144
01:26:25,540 --> 01:26:26,690
Yes, I've known it.
That's why I become more determined.

1145
01:26:27,940 --> 01:26:29,410
More importantly, I've promised you before.

1146
01:26:30,450 --> 01:26:31,600
I love you sincerely,

1147
01:26:36,580 --> 01:26:38,460
so I don't care if you are human or ghost.

1148
01:26:43,250 --> 01:26:45,320
I get along with tree demons.

1149
01:26:45,790 --> 01:26:47,520
I'm used to fool around in the
human world with these companions.

1150
01:26:48,540 --> 01:26:49,590
I've got no attachments.

1151
01:26:51,430 --> 01:26:52,150
Scared now?

1152
01:26:55,200 --> 01:26:55,830
Do you want to marry me now?

1153
01:26:55,830 --> 01:26:56,410
Yes.

1154
01:26:57,760 --> 01:26:59,120
I'm a flower ghost.

1155
01:26:59,570 --> 01:27:00,760
You'll die soon...

1156
01:27:01,260 --> 01:27:02,540
if you are with me.

1157
01:27:05,420 --> 01:27:06,830
It's because you don't like me?

1158
01:27:08,690 --> 01:27:09,320
Life...

1159
01:27:10,120 --> 01:27:12,010
should be wasted on people you love!

1160
01:27:13,260 --> 01:27:14,360
Silly kid,

1161
01:27:14,980 --> 01:27:16,980
we met by chance like patches of drifting duckweed.

1162
01:27:18,200 --> 01:27:19,050
If my life...

1163
01:27:19,750 --> 01:27:21,370
can make my dearest families
or lover fulfill their wishes,

1164
01:27:22,520 --> 01:27:23,810
I won't consider it as "waste".

1165
01:27:25,500 --> 01:27:26,770
Everyone will die, sooner or later.

1166
01:27:27,450 --> 01:27:29,620
I don't have the ambition to save the whole world.

1167
01:27:30,990 --> 01:27:32,870
I only hope that everyone I care about...

1168
01:27:34,290 --> 01:27:35,610
can have a bright future.

1169
01:27:38,380 --> 01:27:40,020
I'm only a poor student...

1170
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:42,830
who was despised when I was a kid.

1171
01:27:46,190 --> 01:27:47,600
I've been worrying that if I fail,

1172
01:27:47,890 --> 01:27:49,580
I won't be able to give you a wealthy life.

1173
01:27:50,830 --> 01:27:52,380
But I've been thinking that...

1174
01:27:53,180 --> 01:27:53,940
fame is nothing more than a weapon,

1175
01:27:55,580 --> 01:27:58,550
which will make me more
capable of protecting others.

1176
01:28:02,300 --> 01:28:03,440
On this way of taking the exam,

1177
01:28:04,900 --> 01:28:06,220
I made a bosom friend,

1178
01:28:07,500 --> 01:28:08,870
and I also met you.

1179
01:28:09,790 --> 01:28:11,990
This is what I have always dreamed of.

1180
01:28:20,810 --> 01:28:22,070
Under the sun, the moon and the sky,

1181
01:28:23,080 --> 01:28:24,720
witnessed by mountains,
rivers, ghosts, and immortals,

1182
01:28:26,330 --> 01:28:27,370
I...

1183
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:30,660
wish that Yinglian and I can be wife and husband.

1184
01:28:32,010 --> 01:28:33,350
We can take care of each other...

1185
01:28:33,910 --> 01:28:35,200
until the advent of samsara.

1186
01:28:36,250 --> 01:28:37,650
We won't separate from each other forever and ever,

1187
01:28:38,330 --> 01:28:39,400
whether we are alive or dead.

1188
01:28:40,870 --> 01:28:41,890
I'm late for being in your life,

1189
01:28:43,500 --> 01:28:45,000
but in the future,

1190
01:28:46,250 --> 01:28:47,290
I'll...

1191
01:28:49,350 --> 01:28:51,100
never let you suffer any grievance.

1192
01:29:10,430 --> 01:29:11,490
Zijin...

1193
01:29:12,620 --> 01:29:13,440
Sorry.

1194
01:29:17,080 --> 01:29:18,900
Old fox, you listen to me.

1195
01:29:20,750 --> 01:29:21,750
I quit!

1196
01:29:35,790 --> 01:29:36,580
Zijin...

1197
01:29:36,830 --> 01:29:37,330
Come over.

1198
01:29:37,540 --> 01:29:38,290
Xiao Bai...

1199
01:29:38,290 --> 01:29:38,950
Don't go over there!

1200
01:29:39,820 --> 01:29:42,740
He wants to take advantage of
the wedding to take the elixir.

1201
01:29:44,070 --> 01:29:45,500
Yinglian, you're mistaken.

1202
01:29:45,500 --> 01:29:47,070
I made him a promise.

1203
01:29:52,660 --> 01:29:53,290
Zijin,

1204
01:29:53,620 --> 01:29:54,800
don't trust her!

1205
01:29:56,620 --> 01:29:57,950
Don't act like you're trying to save him.

1206
01:29:57,950 --> 01:29:59,840
You're the one who wanted him dead.

1207
01:30:03,080 --> 01:30:04,120
Yinglian, no!

1208
01:30:09,160 --> 01:30:10,870
Xiao Bai!

1209
01:30:10,950 --> 01:30:12,250
I can't let him lie to you anymore.

1210
01:30:12,250 --> 01:30:13,700
Yinglian, let go of Xiao Bai.

1211
01:30:13,870 --> 01:30:15,480
He's my best friend.

1212
01:30:16,870 --> 01:30:17,610
Friend?

1213
01:30:20,240 --> 01:30:21,500
He made up lies,

1214
01:30:21,500 --> 01:30:22,450
pretended to return your favors,

1215
01:30:22,450 --> 01:30:23,610
and cheated you to win your trust,

1216
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:25,230
just for the trail of acquiring his elixir!

1217
01:30:25,420 --> 01:30:27,160
What he wanted was the White Elixir in your body!

1218
01:30:27,210 --> 01:30:28,610
I didn't!

1219
01:30:28,630 --> 01:30:29,870
What? White Elixir?

1220
01:30:29,900 --> 01:30:31,740
If he wants it, he can just take it!

1221
01:30:31,780 --> 01:30:33,130
Take it? Then you'll be dead!

1222
01:30:34,020 --> 01:30:34,830
Xiao Bai!

1223
01:30:36,210 --> 01:30:37,490
Zijin, just go!

1224
01:30:37,730 --> 01:30:38,510
Xiao Bai!

1225
01:30:38,790 --> 01:30:41,450
I never meant to hurt him...

1226
01:30:41,730 --> 01:30:42,910
Still lying!

1227
01:30:46,580 --> 01:30:47,670
Still protecting him!

1228
01:30:52,620 --> 01:30:53,580
Xiao Bai!

1229
01:30:53,660 --> 01:30:54,450
Zijin,

1230
01:30:54,660 --> 01:30:57,490
there are many things,
and I'll explain to you later.

1231
01:30:57,660 --> 01:30:58,670
Explain what?

1232
01:30:59,010 --> 01:31:00,710
You foxes are deceitful by nature.

1233
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:02,250
The time is almost up.

1234
01:31:02,260 --> 01:31:03,690
We all know that if you don't take the elixir,

1235
01:31:03,700 --> 01:31:05,290
you'll return to your original form.

1236
01:31:05,290 --> 01:31:06,760
You'll give up...

1237
01:31:06,900 --> 01:31:08,110
your five hundred years of training?

1238
01:31:08,790 --> 01:31:10,000
Big joke.

1239
01:31:10,120 --> 01:31:10,780
Yinglian!

1240
01:31:10,780 --> 01:31:11,900
I'm begging you!

1241
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:13,030
Let Xiao Bai go!

1242
01:31:13,070 --> 01:31:14,490
He helped me all the way.

1243
01:31:14,510 --> 01:31:16,150
He won't hurt me!

1244
01:31:18,090 --> 01:31:18,790
Xiao Bai!

1245
01:31:18,810 --> 01:31:20,130
How can you be so stupid?

1246
01:31:20,500 --> 01:31:22,160
I have to kill him today.

1247
01:31:22,210 --> 01:31:23,580
Or he'll kill you.

1248
01:31:23,700 --> 01:31:25,000
Yinglian, don't do it!

1249
01:31:40,620 --> 01:31:41,500
Yinglian!

1250
01:31:44,160 --> 01:31:44,790
Thirteen,

1251
01:31:46,760 --> 01:31:47,730
are you alright?

1252
01:31:48,590 --> 01:31:50,110
I had to do it.

1253
01:31:50,120 --> 01:31:51,400
See?

1254
01:31:51,900 --> 01:31:53,170
They're all liars.

1255
01:32:02,660 --> 01:32:03,260
Go!

1256
01:32:22,370 --> 01:32:23,170
Yinglian!

1257
01:32:28,330 --> 01:32:29,450
Sorry!

1258
01:32:30,330 --> 01:32:31,980
What can I do to save you?

1259
01:32:33,200 --> 01:32:34,530
Too late.

1260
01:32:35,160 --> 01:32:36,370
Forgive me...

1261
01:32:38,120 --> 01:32:40,470
I've wasted your kindness.

1262
01:32:41,640 --> 01:32:43,790
Sorry, sorry!

1263
01:32:44,440 --> 01:32:45,430
Please tell me!

1264
01:32:45,770 --> 01:32:47,290
What else can I do?

1265
01:32:48,410 --> 01:32:50,390
I'm willing to do anything!

1266
01:32:51,160 --> 01:32:52,870
I'm just a lonely soul...

1267
01:32:54,370 --> 01:32:56,600
You've already saved me...

1268
01:32:58,260 --> 01:33:00,140
with your sincere care.

1269
01:33:02,200 --> 01:33:03,200
I have no regrets...

1270
01:33:05,200 --> 01:33:07,000
in this life.

1271
01:33:20,760 --> 01:33:22,290
It's a red-letter day!

1272
01:33:23,700 --> 01:33:25,220
You shouldn't cry.

1273
01:33:35,250 --> 01:33:36,980
I'm afraid there'll be no afterlife...

1274
01:33:38,410 --> 01:33:40,190
Only wish Zijin peace...

1275
01:33:41,580 --> 01:33:43,090
in this life.

1276
01:34:04,310 --> 01:34:06,880
Yinglian!

1277
01:34:21,790 --> 01:34:22,530
Zijin!

1278
01:34:25,620 --> 01:34:28,200
I just pretended not to know.

1279
01:34:29,820 --> 01:34:31,470
I don't want to know.

1280
01:34:34,040 --> 01:34:35,760
I've always trusted you.

1281
01:34:36,500 --> 01:34:38,520
Always regarded you as my best friend,

1282
01:34:40,410 --> 01:34:41,900
my brother.

1283
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:48,690
Have you ever been sad?

1284
01:34:51,250 --> 01:34:53,490
Have you ever shed tears for anyone?

1285
01:34:58,250 --> 01:35:00,550
I'd rather die just now...

1286
01:35:01,700 --> 01:35:05,840
than believe that this is all your scam.

1287
01:35:06,950 --> 01:35:09,000
You said that you've never stolen...

1288
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
but you're a liar.

1289
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:12,200
Where's Yinglian?

1290
01:35:12,200 --> 01:35:14,790
Tell me where Yinglian is!

1291
01:35:14,790 --> 01:35:17,450
You stole everything from me!

1292
01:35:18,120 --> 01:35:20,080
All you want is the elixir of the soul, right?

1293
01:35:20,080 --> 01:35:20,930
Come on!

1294
01:35:21,220 --> 01:35:22,410
Come and get it!

1295
01:35:25,040 --> 01:35:26,350
Do you think that I really want to get it?

1296
01:35:26,380 --> 01:35:27,740
The acquisition of elixir is my exam!

1297
01:35:27,760 --> 01:35:29,050
What can I do?

1298
01:35:33,270 --> 01:35:34,290
Enough!

1299
01:35:36,370 --> 01:35:38,330
What's all this for?

1300
01:35:50,250 --> 01:35:52,650
How I wish you were not my claman...

1301
01:35:52,790 --> 01:35:54,540
because you are my most cherished friend...

1302
01:35:54,540 --> 01:35:56,740
in my world.

1303
01:35:56,740 --> 01:35:58,160
Go away!

1304
01:36:19,360 --> 01:36:21,460
I should never have come to take this elixir...

1305
01:36:23,670 --> 01:36:25,520
and I shouldn't have lied to you.

1306
01:36:26,380 --> 01:36:27,620
I owe you this...

1307
01:36:29,790 --> 01:36:32,140
I'll give it back to you now!

1308
01:36:48,160 --> 01:36:49,170
Xiao Bai!

1309
01:37:02,690 --> 01:37:03,780
Thirteen,

1310
01:37:05,710 --> 01:37:06,850
salute to Priest Zhang.

1311
01:37:12,180 --> 01:37:15,780
He has been supervising your
spiritual practice in the human world.

1312
01:37:16,470 --> 01:37:17,900
Without him,

1313
01:37:18,590 --> 01:37:20,400
you almost made a big mistake.

1314
01:37:22,480 --> 01:37:23,790
The White Elixir...

1315
01:37:26,130 --> 01:37:27,570
only appears once in a blue moon.

1316
01:37:27,720 --> 01:37:28,670
Stupid kid,

1317
01:37:29,190 --> 01:37:32,050
what occurs once in a blue
moon is not the White Elixir...

1318
01:37:33,060 --> 01:37:35,020
but people who can truly sacrifice their lives...

1319
01:37:35,020 --> 01:37:37,370
for each other.

1320
01:37:38,180 --> 01:37:40,450
You haven't possessed the
wisdom a thousand years ago...

1321
01:37:40,990 --> 01:37:42,190
so you certainly didn't know that

1322
01:37:42,190 --> 01:37:44,430
you once met a herb-gathering
kid in the mountains...

1323
01:37:44,910 --> 01:37:47,040
who saved your life.

1324
01:38:02,270 --> 01:38:06,090
That tear is the elixir you planted for yourself.

1325
01:38:07,310 --> 01:38:08,690
I thought it was a casual talk.

1326
01:38:11,260 --> 01:38:12,160
Unexpectedly...

1327
01:38:15,100 --> 01:38:16,020
The fox...

1328
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:18,260
who had planted it...

1329
01:38:19,770 --> 01:38:21,390
should take it himself.

1330
01:38:22,560 --> 01:38:24,300
It's not your fault to take
the elixir according to your fate.

1331
01:38:27,480 --> 01:38:28,740
Over the years,

1332
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,130
you are the only one who
had taken the White Elixir.

1333
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:37,230
I want to know ...

1334
01:38:38,570 --> 01:38:41,150
what happened to the claman...

1335
01:38:41,600 --> 01:38:42,850
who volunteered to give you the elixir.

1336
01:38:45,490 --> 01:38:47,160
He has already entered the samsara.

1337
01:38:48,980 --> 01:38:51,150
The best fox furs! Have a look!

1338
01:38:51,180 --> 01:38:52,400
Fox?

1339
01:38:54,730 --> 01:38:55,680
Go away, go away!

1340
01:38:57,980 --> 01:38:59,590
Poor things.

1341
01:38:59,900 --> 01:39:00,850
Dad has said that...

1342
01:39:00,850 --> 01:39:03,290
foxes are bad creatures who tell lies.

1343
01:39:03,550 --> 01:39:05,860
But it's so sad.

1344
01:39:09,510 --> 01:39:12,100
The fate of the claman has long been doomed.

1345
01:39:12,900 --> 01:39:15,560
You can't run away from your fate.

1346
01:39:16,690 --> 01:39:18,480
I know, it's hard,

1347
01:39:19,200 --> 01:39:21,730
but you have to get through this
process of acquiring the elixir.

1348
01:39:22,110 --> 01:39:24,190
If you take it, every problem will be solved.

1349
01:39:24,590 --> 01:39:25,950
Everyone will respect you.

1350
01:39:27,190 --> 01:39:29,760
If you don't, 500 years of effort will be wasted.

1351
01:39:30,600 --> 01:39:32,020
This is the spiritual practice.

1352
01:39:32,980 --> 01:39:34,130
It's providence.

1353
01:39:39,310 --> 01:39:40,060
I get it.

1354
01:39:45,440 --> 01:39:46,710
Thirteen,

1355
01:39:47,460 --> 01:39:48,990
it's the last hurdle,

1356
01:39:50,350 --> 01:39:53,010
and you have to do it yourself after all.

1357
01:40:23,100 --> 01:40:23,790
I know...

1358
01:40:25,850 --> 01:40:26,800
you won't forgive me.

1359
01:40:28,310 --> 01:40:29,140
I lied to you all the way...

1360
01:40:31,130 --> 01:40:33,060
I did all the things only to take that elixir.

1361
01:40:34,520 --> 01:40:35,350
It's true.

1362
01:40:37,440 --> 01:40:38,620
It's impossible to say that...

1363
01:40:40,720 --> 01:40:41,470
I won't be sad.

1364
01:40:43,530 --> 01:40:44,340
Just pretend that...

1365
01:40:47,020 --> 01:40:48,360
you never knew me.

1366
01:40:51,500 --> 01:40:52,920
What'll happen to you if you can't get the elixir?

1367
01:40:56,100 --> 01:40:56,640
Xiao Bai!

1368
01:40:58,730 --> 01:41:00,320
You've always been with me all the way.

1369
01:41:01,350 --> 01:41:03,680
I thought I had made the best friend.

1370
01:41:04,980 --> 01:41:07,110
I thought I still had a long life ahead,

1371
01:41:08,270 --> 01:41:09,740
plenty of time...

1372
01:41:10,890 --> 01:41:11,870
and plenty of stories.

1373
01:41:15,020 --> 01:41:16,180
I thought there would be you...

1374
01:41:18,280 --> 01:41:19,280
and Yinglian in my life.

1375
01:41:22,040 --> 01:41:24,360
And I'm the happiest person in the world.

1376
01:41:26,940 --> 01:41:28,690
If it's all because I have one more thing...

1377
01:41:29,180 --> 01:41:30,730
that is available for your use...

1378
01:41:35,900 --> 01:41:36,730
You can just take it.

1379
01:41:38,470 --> 01:41:39,270
Sorry...

1380
01:41:45,690 --> 01:41:47,980
I don't remember things in my previous life...

1381
01:41:50,900 --> 01:41:53,160
so I don't want to have any
more regrets in this life.

1382
01:41:54,150 --> 01:41:55,460
I can now assure that my visit to this world...

1383
01:41:57,380 --> 01:41:58,240
is worthy.

1384
01:41:59,790 --> 01:42:02,120
I know that becoming immortal is
the most important thing to you.

1385
01:42:05,350 --> 01:42:06,600
I'm willing to do it for you.

1386
01:42:12,350 --> 01:42:14,220
Let me make my last wish...

1387
01:42:16,060 --> 01:42:17,840
you'll be a good fox spirit.

1388
01:42:19,630 --> 01:42:20,690
I'm...

1389
01:42:22,270 --> 01:42:23,890
willing to give you the elixir as a gift.

1390
01:43:47,650 --> 01:43:49,970
I knew that you would come.

1391
01:43:51,880 --> 01:43:53,380
He was happy.

1392
01:43:54,010 --> 01:43:55,440
At the last moment,

1393
01:43:55,850 --> 01:43:59,210
he still thought that the elixir
could help you become immortal.

1394
01:44:00,340 --> 01:44:03,290
I was intended to bury him with kindness...

1395
01:44:08,810 --> 01:44:10,580
I overestimated you.

1396
01:44:11,310 --> 01:44:13,670
It's just an ordinary Black Elixir.

1397
01:44:18,600 --> 01:44:20,660
I wasted all my efforts on it.

1398
01:44:35,260 --> 01:44:37,360
You'll pay for his life!

1399
01:44:40,860 --> 01:44:42,100
What can you do?

1400
01:45:00,770 --> 01:45:04,430
Why do you think I followed you all the way?

1401
01:45:05,590 --> 01:45:07,420
How can it be your turn to get this White Elixir,

1402
01:45:08,200 --> 01:45:11,350
which only occurs once in a
thousand years and I can't even get it?

1403
01:45:11,940 --> 01:45:16,210
You were destined to be trash
from the day you were born.

1404
01:47:43,430 --> 01:47:46,570
You don't know what you're capable of.
How can you fight me?

1405
01:47:47,440 --> 01:47:49,880
If you want to die with him,

1406
01:47:50,230 --> 01:47:52,910
I'll let you.

1407
01:47:58,800 --> 01:47:59,900
My name is Wang Zijin.

1408
01:47:59,900 --> 01:48:00,980
How about you?

1409
01:48:00,980 --> 01:48:02,980
Just call me Xiao Bai.

1410
01:48:02,980 --> 01:48:03,850
Brother Xiao Bai.

1411
01:48:06,150 --> 01:48:07,160
Sorry...

1412
01:48:08,470 --> 01:48:09,920
I'm a fox spirit.

1413
01:48:12,120 --> 01:48:13,300
I come here to requite your kindness...

1414
01:48:13,810 --> 01:48:14,930
I don't remember.

1415
01:48:15,350 --> 01:48:17,470
Because it was 500 years ago...

1416
01:48:18,350 --> 01:48:20,100
If you have any wish,

1417
01:48:21,020 --> 01:48:22,350
you must tell me.

1418
01:48:23,940 --> 01:48:25,780
I also want to do something for you.

1419
01:48:27,410 --> 01:48:28,390
Zijin,

1420
01:48:29,870 --> 01:48:31,170
Sorry.

1421
01:48:37,150 --> 01:48:38,190
Stupid kid,

1422
01:48:38,560 --> 01:48:41,450
what occurs once in a blue
moon is not the White Elixir...

1423
01:48:42,190 --> 01:48:44,020
but people who can truly sacrifice their lives...

1424
01:48:44,020 --> 01:48:46,200
for each other.

1425
01:48:48,850 --> 01:48:49,990
The fox...

1426
01:48:50,720 --> 01:48:52,230
who has planted it...

1427
01:48:53,400 --> 01:48:55,290
should take it himself.

1428
01:48:56,220 --> 01:48:58,020
It's not your fault to take
the elixir according to your fate.

1429
01:50:40,730 --> 01:50:43,600
But you're immortal.

1430
01:50:43,600 --> 01:50:48,270
Isn't that what you want?

1431
01:50:48,270 --> 01:50:50,400
Xiao Bai.

1432
01:50:52,560 --> 01:50:55,010
I know that becoming immortal is
the most important thing to you.

1433
01:50:55,020 --> 01:50:56,920
I'm willing to do it for you.

1434
01:50:58,230 --> 01:50:59,520
I'm...

1435
01:50:59,600 --> 01:51:02,160
willing to give you the elixir as a gift.

1436
01:51:03,030 --> 01:51:04,890
You can become a real fox spirit.

1437
01:51:05,940 --> 01:51:07,410
And a good one.

1438
01:51:09,690 --> 01:51:10,470
If my life...

1439
01:51:10,480 --> 01:51:12,190
can make my dearest families
or lover fulfill their wishes,

1440
01:51:12,350 --> 01:51:13,880
I won't consider it as "waste".

1441
01:51:14,380 --> 01:51:15,430
Fame is nothing more than a weapon,

1442
01:51:15,730 --> 01:51:18,820
which will make me more
capable of protecting others.

1443
01:51:22,810 --> 01:51:23,640
Zijin,

1444
01:51:24,950 --> 01:51:26,820
Is this really what I want?

1445
01:53:16,480 --> 01:53:17,070
Grandma!

1446
01:53:18,190 --> 01:53:19,800
You're always in a daze.

1447
01:53:21,310 --> 01:53:23,110
The neighbors are asking...

1448
01:53:23,330 --> 01:53:24,520
Why don't you become an official...

1449
01:53:24,740 --> 01:53:26,210
after passing the exam?

1450
01:53:29,850 --> 01:53:30,580
Grandma,

1451
01:53:31,100 --> 01:53:32,450
Zijin doesn't have ambitions...

1452
01:53:32,770 --> 01:53:34,310
and abilities to be an official.

1453
01:53:35,270 --> 01:53:37,150
It's a big deal for me...

1454
01:53:37,330 --> 01:53:39,080
to take care of you for Brother Daoran.

1455
01:53:43,460 --> 01:53:46,030
You always look unhappy.

1456
01:53:48,560 --> 01:53:50,590
I always feel like I've forgotten lots of things...

1457
01:53:51,900 --> 01:53:53,570
but I don't remember what they are.

1458
01:54:36,960 --> 01:54:37,440
Come,

1459
01:54:38,560 --> 01:54:39,210
come here!

1460
01:54:44,770 --> 01:54:45,400
Don't be afraid!

1461
01:54:51,270 --> 01:54:52,470
Why are you hurt?

1462
01:54:53,170 --> 01:54:53,840
Are you in pain?

1463
01:54:56,270 --> 01:54:57,980
Can I take you home?

1464
01:54:58,240 --> 01:54:59,290
Then I'll treat you.

1465
01:55:02,270 --> 01:55:03,120
Do you have a name?

1466
01:55:04,040 --> 01:55:05,230
Let me give you a name.

1467
01:55:06,630 --> 01:55:08,110
How about...

1468
01:55:09,580 --> 01:55:10,360
How about Xiao Bai?

1469
01:55:10,710 --> 01:55:11,570
Do you like it?

1470
01:55:22,600 --> 01:55:23,500
Zijin,

1471
01:55:26,780 --> 01:55:28,730
I wish you hadn't met me.

1472
01:55:35,570 --> 01:55:36,540
Then,

1473
01:55:37,300 --> 01:55:40,410
there would only be one less
nine-tailed fox spirit in the world.

1474
01:55:50,290 --> 01:55:50,940
Zijin,

1475
01:55:52,600 --> 01:55:53,700
I'm going to be immortal.

1476
01:55:55,690 --> 01:55:57,420
This is the last time I lied to you.

1477
01:56:11,920 --> 01:56:13,700
With immortals from the heaven and the earth,

1478
01:56:14,900 --> 01:56:17,410
if the scholar Wang Zijin could be reborn...

1479
01:56:17,620 --> 01:56:20,880
I,Thirteen Bai,am willing
to give up my life's work...

1480
01:56:21,150 --> 01:56:23,060
and take the punishment of
the thunder and earthquake.

1481
01:57:00,020 --> 01:57:00,970
Idiot,

1482
01:57:01,870 --> 01:57:03,600
there's no more Thirteen.

1483
01:57:05,090 --> 01:57:07,040
You'll forget everything.

1484
01:57:07,980 --> 01:57:10,410
You'll be the same old Zijin.

1485
01:57:48,780 --> 01:57:49,590
Okay...

1486
01:57:49,870 --> 01:57:52,110
only the snake will dance
with the sound of the flute.

1487
01:57:56,440 --> 01:57:58,250
From the beginning...

1488
01:57:59,070 --> 01:58:02,580
I doubt that the deaths of
juniors of foxes were no accidents.

1489
01:58:02,950 --> 01:58:05,710
It's the difficulty you set for yourself.

1490
01:58:07,390 --> 01:58:10,040
Thirteen might be the only pity.

1491
01:58:10,980 --> 01:58:12,920
That kid will finally become immortal.

1492
01:58:13,490 --> 01:58:15,480
How can you know that he's not happy now,

1493
01:58:15,800 --> 01:58:17,240
and he won't be happy in the future?

1494
01:58:28,400 --> 01:58:30,400
Granny Li's chicken was missing.

1495
01:58:30,400 --> 01:58:31,490
Did you steal it?

1496
01:58:31,810 --> 01:58:32,510
Say something!

1497
01:58:33,230 --> 01:58:34,310
I found them!

1498
01:58:34,470 --> 01:58:35,300
I found the chickens!

1499
01:58:35,330 --> 01:58:35,830
Mum!

1500
01:58:37,020 --> 01:58:38,020
I found them!

1501
01:58:38,020 --> 01:58:38,960
I found the chickens!

1502
01:58:49,230 --> 01:58:50,270
Sorry...

1503
01:58:50,270 --> 01:58:51,040
I got you wrong.

1504
01:58:51,400 --> 01:58:52,270
Remember.

1505
01:58:52,350 --> 01:58:54,230
Never steal other people's chickens.

1506
01:58:54,300 --> 01:58:55,010
Did you understand?

1507
01:58:55,030 --> 01:58:56,750
Drink as much wine as you like at home.
