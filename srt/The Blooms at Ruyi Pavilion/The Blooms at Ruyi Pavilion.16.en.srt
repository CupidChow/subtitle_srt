Father,

when I was in Jichang City

In Yu Hua Summer House

145

I suspect

147
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,560
the landslide was man-made

148
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:06,170
However, I have no idea what is
the purpose of the landslide

In Jichang City

the person who is capable of doing so

151
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,110
is the local official

152
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:13,380
Therefore

153
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:15,670
Shang Kai Yang is the most suspicious

154
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:18,970
In order to hide it from us,
Shang Kai Yang

155
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,540

Fortunately

157
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:26,850

This account book

159

doesn't seem to have any problem
at first glance

160

but if you take a closer look

161
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,650

Jichang City is surrounded by mountains

The transportation is inefficient

167
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:54,610
Isn't transporting the marbles
from Mount Mo

168
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:58,220
adding burden to themselves for no reason?

169
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:59,810
Mount Heng in the East

170
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,920
produces plenty of marbles

171
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:05,300
The distance is obviously shorter too

172
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:07,940
White marble and white granite

173
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:10,360
look alike at one glance

174
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:11,990
However, white granite

175
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:14,590
is only worth a quarter of
white marble's price

176
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,350
Furthermore,
it is easier to mine white granite

177
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:19,080
The order of the imperial court

178
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:22,130
is not known to the craftsmen

179
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:23,170
Therefore

180
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,770
no way would they have known

181
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:28,100
that there would be a problem
if they mixed

182
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,910
white marble and white granite

183
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,240
Last night, I decreed

184
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:35,090
to arrest Shang Kai Yang

185
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,170
He has most likely known that
his plot fell through

186
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:40,730
That's why he killed himself
at Yu Hua Summer House

187
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:42,250
He pleaded guilt in a letter

188
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,800
Have a look, Duke Su

189
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,100
The investigation result of Duke Su

190
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:53,440
is consistent with what Shang Kai Yang did

191
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:55,100
Not long ago

192
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:57,960
he thought I would go to Mount Tai

193
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,500
He was afraid that
I would find out the truth

194
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,990
Hence

195
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,820
in the name of the eclipse,

196
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:05,320
he burnt down Mount Tai

197
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,300
brought down Yu Hua Summer House

198
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:10,380
to destroy all traces of his crime

199
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:15,340
Since the myth of the eclipse
and landslide is resolved

200
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,510
let's put an end to it

201
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,580
After the fasting period

202
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,700
everything will go back to normal

203
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,540
-Yes
-Yes

204
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:32,300
I thought

205
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:34,610
after visiting Jichang City

206
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:37,180
they would recall what they
did in the past

207
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,640
and be ashamed of themselves

208
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,190
Sir

209
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,920
There is something I don't understand

210
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:48,530
You could have made
Xu Jing and Xu Mao suffer

211
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,960
and let His Majesty experience the pain

212
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:54,200
You could have also seized the chance
to defeat Xu Jin

213
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,880
Defeat Xu Jing?

214
00:12:57,730 --> 00:12:59,220
What is the point?

215
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,200
I don't want their apology anymore

216
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,930
I am going to give them

217
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:10,620
a taste of their own medicine

218
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:12,420
Your Highness

219
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,150
I have investigated it

220
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,870
These three needles which are thinner

221
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:19,820
are normal silver needles

222
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,990
They are used for usual needlework

223
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,200
They are not poisoned

224
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,200
However

225
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,270
this needle which is slightly thicker

226
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:31,470
I have no idea what they are

227
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,210
The quality of this needle is quite unique

228
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:37,760
It is very versatile

229
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:40,010
and it is easy to be carried around

230
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,190
[Duke Cheng's Residence]

231
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:45,160
Your Highness

232
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:48,170
In the beginning, we only aimed
to arrest the singer

233
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:50,290
However, a lady appeared out of no where

234
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:52,290
and claimed that
she was willing to replace the singer

235
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,260
Is it possible that she and Duke Su

236
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:55,720
know each other?

237
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,230
What is her name?

238
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:02,230
She said that her surname is Fu

239
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:04,160
but she didn't tell us her full name

240
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:05,400
Now I remember

241
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:07,090
Before this, the spy did inform us that

242
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:09,070
Wu Bai Qi told the Imperial Guards

243
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,780
to look for Young Lady Fu Rong

244
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:12,400
That lady must be Fu Rong

245
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:13,500
Hurry

246
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,250
Bring them away

247
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,950
Get a painter to draw that Fu lady

248
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,930
If she is indeed Fu Rong...

249
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,930
Don't worry

250
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:26,330
I shall get a painter now

251
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:27,480
Let's go

252
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,880
Fu Rong has created so much
trouble for me

253
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,120
I must teach her a lesson

254
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:45,330
Previously, I did calligraphy and painting

255
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,800
This time...

256
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,750
Let me think about it

257
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:52,710
We must be extra careful this time

258
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:53,930
You are right

259
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:08,100
No doubt I was almost down with fever

260
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,870
but thanks to you, Ms Fu

261
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,160
You always think about me

262
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,050
No way

263
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,480
That sounds too playful

264
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:21,940
Not long ago, this place was
obscured by wind and rain

265
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:24,600
As the place was be ruffled by the winds
and drenched by the rain

266
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,870
I felt physical weaknesses

267
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:28,760
That is not right

268
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,150
I am not weak

269
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,120
I am not weak

270
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:42,330
Ms Fu

271
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:45,130
What should I say?

272
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,130
Bao Zhu?

273
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:55,840
Bao Zhu

274
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:57,290
Wake up, Bao Zhu

275
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:59,730
-Bao Zhu, what's wrong?
-Little Marquis

276
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:02,750
Please save the young lady

277
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:03,930
Hurry

278
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:08,050
Little Marquis

279
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:10,180
Bao Zhu, go back to the Fu Residence now

280
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:12,780
Don't tell anyone about it for now
Leave it to me

281
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:33,050
So...

282
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,600
This is Fu Rong?

283
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,230
I think...

284
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:40,350
No doubt...

285
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:42,270
I am sure that she is Fu Rong

286
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,470
Are you blind or stupid?

287
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:46,550
Are you sure she is Fu Rong?

288
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:48,700
Does she look like the portrait?

289
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,320
How dare you say that she is Fu Rong?

290
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,380
That portrait...

291
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:55,680
That portrait is covered in mud

292
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,440
We couldn't see it clearly

293
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,110
-Yes
-That's why you simply

294
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:00,770
bring a random lady to fool me?

295
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,580
-No
-We don't dare to do so

296
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,960
No way we have the guts to do it

297
00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:07,540
We kept a close watch
at the entrance of the Fu Residence

298
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:09,660
She came out from the residence
with a servant

299
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,920
That servant addressed her as Young Lady

300
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,630
She must be Young Lady Fu

301
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:14,730
I am sure about that

302
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,040
Fu Rong has a sister

303
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,680
What is her name again?

304
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:23,530
-Fu...
-Fu Xuan

305
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:30,250
Fu Xuan

306
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:32,990
Fu Xuan

307
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:34,480
Wu Bai Qi?

308
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,350
-What is he doing here?
-Fu Xuan

309
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:37,510
Fu Xuan?

310
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:40,180
Bring her out now

311
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:41,880
to attract the attention of that guy

312
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,930
Cover me up

313
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,470
Don't let him know my presence

314
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:46,100
If Duke Su knows about this

315
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:47,560
we will get into trouble

316
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:21,700
Ms Fu

317
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:24,170
What are you doing?

318
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:27,400
What have you done to her?

319
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,820
Don't come near

320
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:30,740
If you come any nearer

321
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:33,140
-we will kill her
-Yes, we will kill her

322
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:36,880
What are you doing?

323
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:39,660
We knocked her down

324
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,950
trying to sell her away with a good price

325
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,740
Sure

326
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,080
What is the price? I will pay to get her

327
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,440
Put her down

328
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,510
You better honour your words

329
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:54,710
You promise to buy her

330
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:56,540
-Here
-Hurry up

331
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,580
Hold on

332
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:12,530
You said that you wanted to buy her

333
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,650
Who is he?

334
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:17,840
He is...

335
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:19,950
He is a customer who dealt with us

336
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,950
He didn't bring enough money and
he thinks that she is too expensive

337
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:23,380
-The deal fell through
-Yes

338
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:24,640
This lady is expensive

339
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,720
You want to buy her

340
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:27,290
Do you have enough money?

341
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:33,680
Is that enough?

342
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,690
-It is enough
-It is enough

343
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,330
-You can have her
-She is yours

344
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:38,610
-She is yours
-Let's go

345
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:54,120
Let go of me

346
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,560
You will be exiled
if you are caught trading women

347
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,750
Let go of me

348
00:19:59,050 --> 00:19:59,990
Let go of you?

349
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,280
How is that possible?

350
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:04,440
Wu Bai Qi

351
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,900
Are you Wu Bai Qi?

352
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:07,420
Let go of me now

353
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,560
Fine, stop moving
I shall put you down

354
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,300
Ms Fu

355
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:17,640
It is my bad for scaring you

356
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,200
but I am not...

357
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,170
Who abducted me?

358
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:23,720
Where are they?

359
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:25,680
They are still inside the hut

360
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:27,390
I have no idea who they are

361
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,940
They did look like human traffickers

362
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:32,150
However, they are quite silly

363
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:35,850
We'll report to the local authority.
Let them deal with it

364
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:36,780
Bao Zhu

365
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,930
Ms Fu

366
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,210
Don't worry

367
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,350
Bao Zhu is awake

368
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:43,360
I told her to get back to the Fu Residence

369
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,890
and don't spread the matter

370
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:52,750
You...

371
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:54,820
How did you find me?

372
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:58,200
I went to the Fu Residence looking for you

373
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,720
I saw Bao Zhu on my way

374
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:01,060
and tracked you down

375
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,630
Someone refused to pay as he thought that
you were too expensive

376
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:06,960
Hence, I conveniently paid and bought you

377
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,200
Therefore...

378
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:13,580
You belong to me now

379
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,880
-Let me redeem myself
-I refuse to sell

380
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:27,760
Then I shall buy you

381
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:29,180
Sure, I am open to offers

382
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:33,830
Five hundred and seventy

383
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,480
What is going on?

384
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:08,250
I have no idea

385
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,330
However

386
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:12,930
you reminded me of something

387
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:14,300
If they were human traffickers

388
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,630
money would mean everything to them

389
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:17,960
Why didn't they take away your pouch?

390
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,840
That is so strange

391
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,290
I rarely leave home

392
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:23,990
I have no enemies

393
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,720
Besides human traffickers,

394
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,380
who else would abduct me?

395
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,250
When they carried you out of the hut

396
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:32,080
they didn't intend to hurt you

397
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,170
They couldn't wait to hand you to me

398
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:37,670
Furthermore, they left the hut so quickly

399
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:45,870
Perhaps their confederates
have brought them away

400
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,610
Don't think too much

401
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:52,690
By the way,

402
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,400
you said you went to the Fu Residence
to look for me

403
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,450
Why is it?

404
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,030
Nothing

405
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:01,390
I just want to thank you

406
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:02,720
Thanks to the medicine you gave

407
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,750
Otherwise, I would have fallen sick

408
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:07,430
Seriously?

409
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:08,800
You have taken it too seriously

410
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,430
It is not some elixir

411
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:16,840
It is to me

412
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,280
In the beginning

413
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,170
I planned to ask you to go for a walk

414
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:31,030
Somehow, this incident occurred

415
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:34,300
Go for a walk?

416
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:35,280
Yes

417
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:41,110
It's just a walk around the mountains

418
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,730
You are right

419
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:52,000
Walking on the grass

420
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:53,190
when the sky is blue

421
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,560
The person that I want to ask
for an outing is in front of me

422
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,760
No outing can be better than this outing

423
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,280
However, Bao Zhu is still waiting for you
at the Fu Residence

424
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,650
Otherwise...

425
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,970
Wait for me

426
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:17,390
Slow down

427
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:19,810
Wu Bai Qi

428
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,160
You make fun of me again

429
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,590
Stop running

430
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,920
Your Highness

431
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:33,980
Come in

432
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:41,020
Who are you?

433
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,700
Your Highness, it's me

434
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:47,270
Your Highness

435
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,000
Fu Rong...

436
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,870
It is more difficult to catch Fu Rong
than we imagined

437
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:55,500
She is always surrounded by many people

438
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:57,780
Catch Fu Rong?

439
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:04,080
Who told you to catch Fu Rong?

440
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,160
I just want you to teach her a lesson

441
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,640
Why are you catching her?

442
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:11,030
Do you want everyone to know that

443
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,110
I catch the daughter of
a government official in secret?

444
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:15,650
I apologise for being a fool

445
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,920
Fu Rong...

446
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:18,160
Your Highness

447
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:20,360
Do you know Ruyi Pavilion?

448
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:23,900
What does it have to do with Ruyi Pavilion?

449
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:26,390
I am referring to Ruyi Pavilion
that produces jewellery.

450
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:28,450
The manager of Ruyi Pavilion, Liu Ru Yi

451
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:29,900
is Fu Rong's master.

452
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:32,370
Why don't we give Ruyi Pavilion some trouble

453
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:34,220
to teach them a lesson?

454
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:40,780
Liaise with Ding Peng

455
00:25:41,930 --> 00:25:43,990
Tell him to ensure that Ruyi Pavilion

456
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:47,590
closes down for good

457
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:49,040
Yes

458
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,040
Hold on

459
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:56,860
Your mask

460
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:00,920
fits you well

461
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:02,570
Thank you, Your Highness

462
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:04,430
I think that I look quite good in it

463
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,170
Master

464
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:11,930
Rong'er

465
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:16,630
Master, you were aware that
I followed you to Jichang City, right?

466
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:19,490
I don't know what you mean

467
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:22,310
Even Xiao Ba came to the Fu Residence
looking for me

468
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:24,450
He was relieved when he found out
that I was at home

469
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:25,960
You, on the other hand,
didn't ask me anything

470
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,690
You must have known everything

471
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,130
Rong'er

472
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,940
You came home together with Duke An

473
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:34,760
Many people know about it

474
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,640
Rong'er

475
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:43,150
You promised me not to be close
with people from the palace

476
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:46,150
What happened between you and Duke An?

477
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,620
What can happen between us?

478
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:52,510
If it weren't for you, I wouldn't
have had gone to Jichang City

479
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:56,030
You didn't go there for me

480
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,550
You were trying to investigate me

481
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:59,050
You are suspecting me

482
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:03,210
Do you know that you are being nosy?

483
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,570
I am being nosy?

484
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,160
Rong'er, swear that

485
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:14,540
you will keep distance from Duke An

486
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:17,220
That is not enough

487
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:18,720
Swear that you won't

488
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,300
keep in touch with Duke An

489
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,240
Why?

490
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:25,730
Anyhow...

491
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:27,210
Anyhow, listen to me

492
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,970
and swear, okay?

493
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,200
Master, you want me to listen to you
all the time

494
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,720
However, you are not willing to tell me

495
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:36,080
what this pattern on the bracelet means

496
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,080
You also refuse to tell me
the reason you went to Hong Village

497
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,600
and Jichang City

498
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,230
Why should I listen to you?

499
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,480
Rong'er

500
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,690
Just stay out of

501
00:27:58,470 --> 00:27:59,810
my business

502
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:03,860
You can't help me out

503
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,440
Fine

504
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:06,850
I shall stay out of it

505
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:10,240
You won't let me interfere
even if I want to do so

506
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,650
In your eyes

507
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,850
I am just a fool who you can trick

508
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:19,010
Since you don't treat me as your disciple

509
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:23,190
I shall stop treating you as my master

510
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,970
[Rong'er]

511
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:41,920
[If I ever made a mistake]

512
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,560
[I might be doomed]

513
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,950
[At the time being]

514
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:52,660
[how can I be honest with you?]

515
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,600
Long time no see

516
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:19,990
You are still very careless

517
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:24,340
Long time no see?

518
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:27,370
Ever since the eclipse,

519
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:30,320
I have been occupied with work

520
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:33,050
I came back to the capital not long ago

521
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:36,720
I see

522
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:41,470
I am sorry. I haven't found out
the truth about the bracelet

523
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,890
Thank you for your help, Your Highness

524
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,530
I shall make a move

525
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:55,660
Did anything happen to you lately?

526
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,730
Nothing

527
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,710
Would you mind going somewhere with me?

528
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:05,700
Let's go

529
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:26,600
Ms Fu, let go of my hand

530
00:30:58,530 --> 00:30:59,640
Are you scared?

531
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:03,060
Who is scared?

532
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,340
Whenever I am not in a good mood

533
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,820
I will come here

534
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:22,080
and look at thousands of lights

535
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:24,370
an array of stars

536
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:27,320
boundless sky and sea

537
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:29,520
In this world

538
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:32,680
we are just a grain of millet
in the vast sea

539
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,320
What differentiates us

540
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:37,700
from bacteria?

541
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:41,480
A moment of happiness

542
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,970
is not worth keeping in mind

543
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,930
With regard to the bracelet

544
00:31:56,930 --> 00:31:59,060
if you don't feel like talking about it

545
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:01,180
I can stop asking

546
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:02,960
Not only the bracelet

547
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:05,160
I am not sure

548
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:06,740
if I can still believe

549
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:09,290
things that I have been believing in

550
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:11,930
or people that I have been believing in

551
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:15,980
I don't know what I should do

552
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,480
[Feel sad when you feel her sadness]

553
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:22,790
[Feel happy when you feel her happiness]

554
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,520
[Both hearts are tied together]

555
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:28,030
[Each movement of hers makes you lovesick]

556
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,340
[How could you not know about it?]

557
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:38,020
If you are upset

558
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:40,710
and feel like crying

559
00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:42,560
it's okay

560
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:44,940
I don't mind closing my eyes

561
00:32:46,370 --> 00:32:47,500
and not to look at you

562
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:49,510
No one is going to cry

563
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,300
Your Highness is so sincere to me

564
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:55,270
I shouldn't hide anything from you

565
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:58,380
This bracelet was given by my master
when I was a child

566
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:01,050
but she refused to tell me
the history of the bracelet

567
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:02,230
Your Highness

568
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:04,560
My master is a very kind person

569
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:07,370
No matter what, I hope that
you won't harm her

570
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:10,250
Does your master own

571
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:13,630
a versatile silverware?

572
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:16,530
Do you mean cane-like silver needle?

573
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:17,670
It is not silver.

574
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,220
It is made of plant's root.

575
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:20,910
After being hammered out,

576
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:24,090
it will become as tough as cane,
as shiny as silver and as sharp as needle

577
00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:25,820
Hence, it is known as
cane-like silver needle

578
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:28,230
My master tried to design
a few jewellery with it

579
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:31,270
but she rarely uses it
due to the complicated process

580
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:34,310
Why did you ask about it?

581
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,510
Nothing

582
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:41,340
Don't worry, I promise

583
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:44,940
I will question her patiently

584
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,360
I won't harm her

585
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:22,739
Who are you?

586
00:34:23,139 --> 00:34:25,340
Why are you in my room?

587
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:33,510
At this time and place,

588
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:35,770
why are you still pretending, Ms Liu?

589
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:41,150
You don't have to be on guard against me

590
00:34:42,909 --> 00:34:47,030
Ever since we met at Ju Shui Pavilion

591
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:51,199
I have never heard of Ruyi Pavilion again

592
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,560
Since the mountain doesn't approach me

593
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:59,030
I have no choice but
to approach the mountain

594
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:03,220
Please leave, Your Highness

595
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:06,040
Why are you doing so?

596
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:07,990
Your Highness should know it well

597
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:10,290
What you did

598
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:12,380
have crossed my tolerance range

599
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:15,860
There is no way Ruyi Pavilion
will work with you again

600
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:17,010
Ms Liu

601
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:20,210
I have a piece of advice for you

602
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:24,160
Ruyi Pavilion has been keeping
a low profile for the past years

603
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,510
but the clue is already there

604
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:27,120
If His Majesty knows about it

605
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,340
what will happen to Ruyi Pavilion?

606
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:35,220
We accept money from people

607
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:36,990
and do them favours

608
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:38,950
It is nothing but business

609
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:41,240
So what if His Majesty knows about it?

610
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:44,020
You are doing a risky business

611
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:45,830
If His Majesty knows about it

612
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:47,360
I am afraid that everyone
in Ruyi Pavilion

613
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,780
will be doomed to perdition

614
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,210
Also

615
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:54,180
if Fu Rong learns about it

616
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,190
what would happen to you?

617
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,130
Are you threatening me?

618
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:03,710
Why did you say so?

619
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:06,350
You have no way to back down

620
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:09,300
After contemplating for a long time,
I found a way

621
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:12,880
Just hand Ruyi Pavilion to me temporarily

622
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:14,590
I shall protect it

623
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,970
with my status as a duke

624
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:22,010
With that, you can continue
to be a good master

625
00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:40,020
Your Highness

626
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,430
Where is Ms Liu?

627
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,010
Ms Liu, Duke Su is here

628
00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:59,430
Duke Su

629
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,310
Lan Xiang

630
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:12,910
Miss Xuan

631
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:15,800
-Where are you going?
-Miss Rong has gone to Ruyi Pavilion

632
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:19,190
It seems that something happened
between her and Ms Liu

633
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:22,730
The weather is getting cold.
I wish to send her some clothes

634
00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:25,400
Is Rong'er in a bad mood lately?

635
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:27,090
Indeed

636
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,610
I am worried about her

637
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:32,040
Give it to me

638
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:34,240
I'll send it for you

639
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,300
You may leave now

640
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:40,440
Well...

641
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:42,370
Yes

642
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,610
Excuse me

643
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:55,700
Excuse me

644
00:37:57,850 --> 00:37:59,040
Excuse me

645
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,580
Can't you drive properly?

646
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,000
You almost hit me

647
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:04,810
I am sorry

648
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,370
I am really sorry

649
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:10,480
That is all?

650
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:11,980
I am in a rush to send the goods

651
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:13,440
Is this sufficient?

652
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:19,940
I am so sorry

653
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:51,700
Master

654
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,950
Master

655
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:55,630
Master

656
00:38:57,890 --> 00:38:59,490
Master, please don't scare me

657
00:38:59,490 --> 00:39:00,870
Master, please wake up

658
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,980
Is there anyone?

659
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:04,480
Help

660
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:06,400
Master

661
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:08,170
Master, please wake up

662
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:10,090
Master

663
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,640
Seal the scene

664
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:21,180
[Ding Peng, the new prosecutor
of Criminal Investigation Bureau]

665
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:21,770
The rest, come with me

666
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,550
Master

667
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,360
-Both of you stay here
-Master

668
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:32,330
Save my master

669
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:36,680
Master

670
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:45,000
You are the murderer

671
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,020
She is dead
Why didn't you run away?

672
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:52,150
She is dead?

673
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:53,770
You are caught red-handed

674
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:55,320
-Men
-Yes

675
00:39:55,410 --> 00:39:56,630
-Master
-Arrest her

676
00:39:56,690 --> 00:39:58,550
Master

677
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,610
-Master
-Come on

678
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,810
-Master
-Come on

679
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:03,390
Master

680
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:05,460
-Both of you, stay here

681
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:07,120

682
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:10,210
Master

683
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:11,360
Mr Hu

684
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,610
[Hu Ming, Coroner,
Criminal Investigation Bureau]

685
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:13,010
You are just in time

686
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:14,810
Check the dead body in detail

687
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:15,930
Yes

688
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:30,090
Your Highness

689
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:32,920
Xiao Bai

690
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:34,910
I don't get an off day easily

691
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:36,380
I purposely came to visit you

692
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:39,910
I shall take the chance to go to
your place and have some good wine

693
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:41,240
Sure

694
00:40:41,330 --> 00:40:43,680
You are just in time
Xu Jia got some good wine

695
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:44,980
You can drink with him

696
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:48,250
I shall thank Your Highness
and Xu Jia in advance

697
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:49,340
Your Highness

698
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:51,570
Why don't you...

699
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:54,230
I can't make it today

700
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:56,620
I have to go the Imperial Guards camp

701
00:40:57,310 --> 00:40:58,290
All right

702
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:00,310
I am going to send my horse for a wash

703
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:02,380
Just now, a few people
from Criminal Investigation Bureau

704
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:04,720
ran as if they were running for life

705
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:07,750
How did you bump into them?

706
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:10,050
I don't know

707
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:11,350
They took that path

708
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,770
and went to the direction
of Ruyi Pavilion

709
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,420
Your Highness, what is wrong?

710
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,250
What happened?

711
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:26,190
Your Highness, slow down

712
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,110
-Rong'er
-Stand there

713
00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:39,880
The Bureau is investigating a case

714
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,140
No one is allowed to enter

715
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:42,400
Investigating a case?

716
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,800
What case is that?

717
00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:45,520
What did my sister do?

718
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,100
Why did you tie her up?

719
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:49,520
She murdered Ms Liu of Ruyi Pavilion

720
00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:51,280
She should be punished
according to the law
