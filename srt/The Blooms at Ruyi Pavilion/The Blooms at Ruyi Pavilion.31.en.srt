[Episode 31]

4
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,430
[They're all here, just as I thought.]

5
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:26,829
Your Highness.

6
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,640
Xu Jia, what are you doing here?

7
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,450
Move! Hurry up.

8
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,520
Hurry, come on.

9
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:35,630
Women from the village
are like that. Dumb.

10
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:36,870
Stop crying or I'll kill you all.

11
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:39,000
Please don't. Where's the fun in that?

12
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,130
Let's go.

13
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:49,210
Your Highness,

14
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,440
where are you going?

15
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:51,880
I have to save them.

16
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,180
Tell me.

17
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:14,740
Yesterday, I won quite a lot.

18
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:16,410
Yes, want to do it again?

19
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:19,220
Hurry up.

20
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:20,390
-Don't drink alone.
-Sure.

21
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:22,650
-Move it all here.
-I'm craving for meat.

22
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:33,540
This is?

23
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,850
This is Cheji Grass.

24
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,750
I didn't know I could find some here.

25
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,350
When I was treating Guan Ge's chickenpox,

26
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:42,230
I learned a few things about herbs.

27
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:44,310
I never thought that it
would come in handy now.

28
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:45,510
What good can it do for us?

29
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:46,579
I'll just kill our way out.

30
00:03:46,579 --> 00:03:47,740
Don't.

31
00:03:47,829 --> 00:03:49,630
Among us, you're the
only one who can fight.

32
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,690
We won't be able to run away. Besides,

33
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:53,730
don't underestimate it.

34
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:08,360
Wen Xing, leave me now.

35
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:09,970
Yes.

36
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,269
Nong Nong.

37
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,370
Nong Nong.

38
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,050
-Stop there.
-Are you new here?

39
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:44,060
I just joined.

40
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,870
Chief said you've all worked hard.

41
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,670
I'm here to send you guys some liquor.

42
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:48,710
We've been craving
for it for the whole day.

43
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:50,250
At last.

44
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:51,970
Here.

45
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:59,640
Girl, come join us.

46
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:01,840
-Sure.
-Cheers. Here.

47
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:04,170
This must be a good wine.

48
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:11,250
-Allow me.
-Fill the cup, fill it.

49
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:22,370
Let's go.

50
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:27,950
Your Highness, that was really impressive.

51
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:30,550
-Take them with you.
-Someone is running away!

52
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:33,790
-Go after them! Go!
-What about you?

53
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:34,920
I'll distract them,

54
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,230
otherwise, none of us can get away.

55
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:37,830
You must get them out safely.

56
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:40,659
This is the material from the palace.
Keep it safe.

57
00:05:40,659 --> 00:05:42,230
It's too dangerous to
leave you here alone.

58
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:43,770
Go now, quick.

59
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:46,620
Stop there! Stop running!

60
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:48,440
Stop running, stop! Grab them!

61
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,150
Hurry, get them! Stop running!

62
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,450
Stop running! Get her!

63
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,300
Quick!

64
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:54,659
Hurry!

65
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,570
Go after them! Stop running!

66
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:58,430
Stop there!

67
00:05:58,510 --> 00:05:59,610
Stop!

68
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:08,010
Fire! Put it out!

69
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:10,090
Water!

70
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:12,490
Get some water here!

71
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:14,690
Put out the fire first.

72
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:21,370
-Grab her!
-Yes!

73
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,170
[Chief of Qingfeng Hideout]

74
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:33,530
-Take her away.
-Yes.

75
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:44,620
Have you seen a girl
with forehead marking,

76
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:45,700
about this tall?

77
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:47,040
No.

78
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:49,150
Excuse me. Have you
seen a girl forehead marking,

79
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:50,680
who is about this tall?

80
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:52,330
No, no.

81
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:55,040
Have you seen a girl
who's about this tall?

82
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:05,690
-How is it?
-No one saw her, Young Master.

83
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:10,870
Let's go.

84
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:17,610
Your Highness,

85
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,890
-bad news.
-What happened?

86
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:23,880
Her Highness is
trapped in the bandits' hideout.

87
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:26,610
She gave me this.

88
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:29,590
She said those materials that
were stolen from the palace

89
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:31,030
are in the bandits' storehouse.

90
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:32,870
In order to save those kidnapped women,

91
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,070
she asked me to bring them out first,

92
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,409
while she stayed there.

93
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:36,780
The stakes are too high.

94
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,190
I had to come back first to report to you

95
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:39,690
after I freed those women.

96
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:43,520
Your Highness, I discovered
something else in the hideout.

97
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:08,690
Weapons from Kushui Village.

98
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:12,030
Your Highness, there is
something dubious about this hideout.

99
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:13,180
If you go alone,

100
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:15,130
you could put yourself in danger.

101
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:18,510
Let's apply for troop deployment
from the capital.

102
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:19,770
Once the army arrives,

103
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:21,650
we'll strike together.

104
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:23,210
It'll be too late then.

105
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,450
Xu Jia, go and borrow
troops from General Yuan,

106
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:27,150
the person in charge of this area.

107
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:28,910
I'll go to Qingfeng Hideout now.

108
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:30,040
Duke Su,

109
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:31,550
you don't have the transfer order,

110
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:32,750
and you want to borrow
troops out of sudden,

111
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,169
he might not agree to it.

112
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:37,340
But Mr Yuan is my
father's former subordinate.

113
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:39,020
If I go with Mr Xu,

114
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:40,450
he'll agree to it.

115
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,210
Thank you, Your Highness.

116
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:45,210
But

117
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:47,470
I need you to do two things for me.

118
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:51,260
Tell me.

119
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:53,170
First,

120
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:55,330
I want one personal item of yours.

121
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:08,490
Second,

122
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:11,640
I want you to return safe and sound.

123
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:16,210
Xu Jia,

124
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:18,110
go with the princess to borrow troops.

125
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:20,640
-I'll meet you in the bandits' hideout.
-Yes.

126
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:30,350
Those bandits of Qingfeng Hideout

127
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:32,530
came every once in a while.

128
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,570
We can't stand it anymore.

129
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:39,090
Those bandits of Qingfeng Hideout
are really nasty.

130
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:46,810
What do you think we should do?

131
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:54,100
[I saw how]

132
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,290
[you were looking at it.]

133
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,200
[So I decided to give it to you.]

134
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:02,810
Qingfeng Hideout.

135
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:06,010
-Uncle.
-It's you.

136
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:09,130
Hurry! Get them!

137
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:10,770
Brothers, quick!

138
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:12,380
Hurry up, guys!

139
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,540
Brothers, attack!

140
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:15,290
Go! Grab your weapons, quick!

141
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:39,540
Report!

142
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:41,740
Chief, Deputy Chief,

143
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:44,100
someone broke into our
place and killed our brothers.

144
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,030
What? Go and check it out!

145
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:47,580
Go now!

146
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:49,290
-Let's check it out.
-Go.

147
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:51,650
-Brother.
-Brother.

148
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:52,850
Stay here.

149
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:54,470
If something goes wrong,

150
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:55,900
do as the man told us to.

151
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:57,090
Yes.

152
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,960
[Deputy Chief of Qingfeng Hideout]

153
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:56,710
Take Rong'er with you. I'll meet
you down the mountain at the inn.

154
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:57,810
Go now!

155
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:31,020
You've got the nerve to

156
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:32,470
break into Qingfeng Hideout.

157
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:35,290
I won't let you leave here alive today.

158
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:07,360
Little Follower,

159
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:09,130
you saved me.

160
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:10,380
Are you all right?

161
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:15,050
You're injured.

162
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:17,250
I'm fine.

163
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:19,080
I'm just glad you're all right.

164
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:21,870
We need to take care of your wound first.

165
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:23,580
Come on.

166
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:47,830
Attack!

167
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:49,430
We've been fighting all night.

168
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:50,340
Just him alone.

169
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:51,530
Attack!

170
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:57,720
Crash it open.

171
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:22,890
It's the army. Retreat.

172
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:37,190
Your Highness!

173
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:38,790
Your Highness, are you all right?

174
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:39,900
Are you all right?

175
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:41,680
Xu Jia,

176
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:45,260
bring some men with you
to search the storehouse.

177
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:46,450
Yes.

178
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:17,830
[The treasures in Qingfeng Hideout]

179
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,730
[carry too many secrets.]

180
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:22,460
[If anything happens,]

181
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:23,940
[destroy everything.]

182
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:25,630
[Do not leave any evidence behind.]

183
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:26,740
[Remember,]

184
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:29,090
[destroy everything.]

185
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,060
Shut up.

186
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:03,510
Answer our questions truthfully,

187
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:04,710
and we won't hurt you.

188
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:06,070
Please show me mercy.

189
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:08,470
Did you kidnap a girl and
bring her here yesterday?

190
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:10,950
-Where is she?
-Someone else saved her.

191
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:12,450
Please spare my life.

192
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:18,510
He's probably telling the truth.

193
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:19,650
Ms Rong isn't here.

194
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:24,730
Someone is setting the
valley on fire. Retreat.

195
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,810
The wound is deep,

196
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:33,590
it goes all the way through
the bone of your right arm.

197
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:35,740
If you hadn't treated it sooner,

198
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:38,090
your right hand could've been ruined.

199
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:41,960
Thank you, doctor.

200
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:45,450
He needs to get some rest.

201
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:47,730
Replace the patch every two days.

202
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:50,730
He can't afford another injury.

203
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:53,090
I understand. Thank you, doctor.

204
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,670
Come with me to get the prescription.

205
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:55,780
Yes.

206
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:59,330
Ms Fu, I'm going
to get the prescription.

207
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:01,200
I'll leave Young Master to you.

208
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,870
Got it. Don't worry.

209
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:06,080
All right.

210
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:08,730
Please.

211
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:14,490
I'm sorry.

212
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:16,730
Why are you apologizing?

213
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:20,730
You were dragged into this because of me.

214
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,530
And you got hurt because of me.

215
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:24,810
If it wasn't because of me...

216
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,770
Don't say that.

217
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:29,690
It hurts me

218
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:31,480
to hear you say that.

219
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:33,970
Between us,

220
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:36,090
such formality is not needed.

221
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:40,540
Nong Nong,

222
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:42,290
I'm demanding reward

223
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:44,370
for saving you this time.

224
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:46,350
Sure.

225
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:47,990
What reward do you want?

226
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:50,070
I'm willing to give you everything
I have to pay you back.

227
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:51,190
No.

228
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:53,270
I don't need you to give me anything.

229
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:55,090
I just want you

230
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:01,080
to take care of me until I recover.

231
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:06,090
What?

232
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:07,720
Have you changed your mind?

233
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:10,260
No, don't worry.

234
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:12,690
I'll take care of you until you recover.

235
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:14,690
Good.

236
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:18,490
Thank goodness.

237
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:22,410
If Farmer Ju Shui's hand was
hurt and couldn't write anymore,

238
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:25,730
that would've made me the
most hated sinner in Dayu.

239
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:28,420
It's fine.

240
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,730
Besides apologising,

241
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:33,310
I'd like to thank you as well.

242
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:35,170
Thank you for coming to my rescue.

243
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:39,270
[Take Rong'er with you.]

244
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:45,170
All right, rest early.

245
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:47,250
I'll stay here until you fall asleep.

246
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:01,290
Your Highness, we're too late.

247
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:02,830
Those stuff in the storehouse,

248
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:04,490
we only managed to save these.

249
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:07,540
Two boxes of them are materials
that were stolen from the palace.

250
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:09,740
We can finally vindicate Her Highness.

251
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:11,170
Good job.

252
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:14,510
This bandits' hideout has always been
the blight on my Weiyang City.

253
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:15,610
This time,

254
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:18,030
if Duke Su hadn't
thrown them off guard,

255
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:19,390
we wouldn't be able to wipe them out.

256
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:20,490
Of course,

257
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:23,360
the princess' letter was a great help too.

258
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:27,430
She's probably waiting for us
at the foot of the mountain now.

259
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:28,850
Xu Jia,

260
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:30,380
bring a team with you

261
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:33,270
to take the chief of
Qingfeng Hideout back to the capital.

262
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:34,400
Escort the princess

263
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:36,530
back as well on your way.

264
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:38,130
Yes.

265
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:45,660
Rong'er.

266
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:10,300
Nong Nong.

267
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:12,740
Your Highness.

268
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:19,930
Little Follower, you're awake.

269
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:22,130
Nong Nong,

270
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:25,290
go back early and have some rest.

271
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:28,510
No. You need to finish the medicine.

272
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:30,450
I'll go and decoct your medicine.

273
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:54,530
Young Master.

274
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:57,050
What is it?

275
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:59,510
Ms Gu has sent someone
to bring us a message.

276
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:00,950
Saying that it's something important.

277
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:04,010
He's waiting for you in the
tea house across the street.

278
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:06,250
Let's go.

279
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,190
-But your injury...
-I'll be fine.

280
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:11,330
-We'll make a quick trip.
-Yes.

281
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:42,770
Uncle San?

282
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:45,150
Yes, Young Lady said

283
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:47,270
Uncle San is an old-timer
of Ruyi Pavilion.

284
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:49,430
He's venerable, though he
has taken an early retirement.

285
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:51,630
He had little contact with Ruyi Pavilion.

286
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:53,630
Xiao Qi and Xiao Ba are
looking for Uncle San now.

287
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:56,430
Looks like they're going
to ask him to take charge.

288
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:57,560
Young Master,

289
00:24:57,870 --> 00:25:00,510
I heard that they wanted
to revamp Ruyi Pavilion.

290
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:03,170
We need to find the token
out as soon as possible.

291
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:07,490
We've been looking for

292
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:10,240
the token of Ruyi Pavilion for so long.

293
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:14,090
Uncle San might have
some information about it.

294
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:16,450
Both of you,

295
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:18,810
based on the clues Ms Gu gave you,

296
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:20,490
hunt them down.

297
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:22,410
Yes.

298
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:34,790
What happened to him?

299
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:36,320
He's limping, look.

300
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,600
-His shirt is covered in blood.
-That's right. Is he hurt?

301
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:54,780
Sir, how may I help you?

302
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:55,970
Mr Proprietor,

303
00:25:56,950 --> 00:26:00,140
did a man and a woman come here?

304
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:02,960
The woman has an ornamental
mark on her forehead.

305
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:04,890
Sorry, I haven't seen them.

306
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:07,670
Thank you.

307
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:31,770
-She's gone?
-There were only a burnt medicine pot

308
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:34,280
and a fan lying on
the floor of the kitchen.

309
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:40,230
It's likely that Nong Nong
has been abducted.

310
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:42,230
-Most likely.
-Wen Xing,

311
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:45,260
go and deploy all possible resources.

312
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:46,810
We must find Nong Nong.

313
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:48,450
Yes.

314
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:06,820
Mr Proprietor,

315
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:10,210
did a man and woman come here last night?

316
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:12,130
Yes, they were here.

317
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:14,650
Is that man suffering from an injury too?

318
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:16,340
He is.

319
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:19,020
I think they went out just now.

320
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:20,430
I didn't really take much notice.

321
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:21,900
Mister, Mister.

322
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:23,020
A man just asked me

323
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:25,560
to give you this letter.

324
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:43,090
You have one hour

325
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:45,570
to get to East Mountain to save her.

326
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:48,210
May I know where East Mountain is?

327
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:50,910
Keep going east after
you get out of the city.

328
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:53,010
Keep walking until you see a hill.

329
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:56,240
Sir, it's raining soon.

330
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:58,120
Would you like to buy an umbrella?

331
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:37,460
It's been a while,

332
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:39,170
Concubine Rong.

333
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:45,860
Sir,

334
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:49,460
-someone was looking for you just now.
-Who was it?

335
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:50,990
A man who looks high-born,

336
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:52,060
with a capital accent.

337
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,870
He seemed to suffer from a severe injury.

338
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:56,350
-It's quite terrifying to look at.
-Xu Jin. Where is he now?

339
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:58,500
A child gave him a letter just now.

340
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:00,270
A bracelet came with the letter.

341
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:01,870
He seemed anxious
after he read the letter.

342
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:03,390
He asked how he could
get to East Mountain.

343
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:04,570
And then, he just...

344
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:07,650
Sir, it's raining soon.

345
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:09,930
Would you like to buy an umbrella?

346
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:13,890
It's been so long.

347
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:16,340
Rong,

348
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:18,690
do you miss me?

349
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:20,970
These days,

350
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:23,050
I've been missing you

351
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:25,130
and you guys

352
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:27,250
all the time.

353
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:30,240
What's wrong?

354
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:32,050
What are you afraid of?

355
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:35,290
Don't worry.

356
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:37,490
I'm not a ghost.

357
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:39,410
I'm a human.

358
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:40,850
I'm still alive.

359
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:43,650
The ones who died

360
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:45,930
are my parents.

361
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:48,140
[Father, where are we going?]

362
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:49,430
[Where are we going?]

363
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:52,530
[Father, what are you doing?]

364
00:29:57,190 --> 00:29:58,720
[This is a secret passage.]

365
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:00,520
[You can get out from here.]

366
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:03,210
[Father,]

367
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:04,650
[I'm not leaving.]

368
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:06,530
[I'm not leaving.]

369
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:09,020
[Listen to me.]

370
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:10,250
[Be strong.]

371
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:12,450
[Go now, Yan'er.]

372
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:13,820
-[Listen to your father.]
-[Mother.]

373
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:15,470
[It'll be too late if
you don't leave now.]

374
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:17,730
[Go, go now!]

375
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:19,170
[Go.]

376
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:26,450
[Take care of your mother, Yan'er!]

377
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:29,440
[Careful, Mother.]

378
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:34,450
[Mother, why do we have
a secret passage here?]

379
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:38,450
[Yan'er, there are some
clothes and jewellery here.]

380
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:40,540
[Take them with you.]

381
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:43,490
[What are you doing, Mother?]

382
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:45,810
[Live a good life.]

383
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:48,920
[Never return to the capital.]

384
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:02,850
[Yan'er!]

385
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:06,370
[Yan'er,]

386
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:09,720
[I've done you wrong.]

387
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:13,890
[I don't need you to avenge us.]

388
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:15,440
[I just want you]

389
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:18,450
[to live a good life.]

390
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:26,790
For all the suffering that you
have brought upon me,

391
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:28,470
I'm going to make it a hundred times,

392
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:30,610
a thousand times worse for you.

393
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:32,570
Rong.

394
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:37,290
Rong,

395
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:38,930
don't be afraid.

396
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:41,370
You won't be alone.

397
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:44,850
Beside you,

398
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:47,970
there are two other graves.

399
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:50,690
They'll keep you company.

400
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:53,540
What's the matter?

401
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:55,570
Are you upset?

402
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:58,360
These are my father

403
00:31:58,670 --> 00:32:01,370
and my mother's cenotaph.

404
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:03,330
Years ago,

405
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:06,610
Father started out here in Weiyang City.

406
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:08,830
And now,

407
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:12,250
I've brought them back here.

408
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:16,130
And you!

409
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:19,330
Their daughter-in-law.

410
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:28,690
Fu Rong,

411
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:30,970
let me tell you,

412
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:34,530
you and I have been engaged
since childhood.

413
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:40,450
You still belong to us
even when you're dead.

414
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:52,550
Take good care of my
parents in the underworld.

415
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:02,850
Help!

416
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:05,410
Help!

417
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:09,090
Help!

418
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:27,010
Yan'er has avenged you.

419
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,440
There is one more.

420
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:31,969
Wait for me.

421
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:49,420
Rong'er!

422
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:53,460
Rong'er!

423
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:03,500
Rong'er!

424
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:08,130
Rong'er!

425
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:12,100
Rong'er!

426
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:14,890
Rong'er!

427
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:23,910
Zhang Yan.

428
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:28,490
Where is Rong'er?

429
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:30,870
You really are something, Duke Su.

430
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:33,290
You don't look surprised
when you see me.

431
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:36,790
Aren't you afraid that the vengeful
spirit will come to claim your life?

432
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:38,810
Lord Xindu got what he deserved.

433
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:40,970
Why should I be afraid?

434
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:42,250
Xu Jin!

435
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:44,370
Say that again if you dare!

436
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:45,890
Say that again if you dare!

437
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:48,170
Tell me where Fu Rong is!

438
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:50,730
Don't worry,

439
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:53,840
you're going to see her in no time.

440
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:55,590
Only you're going see her

441
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:58,360
on the Nether Bridge.

442
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:05,150
Where is she?

443
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:07,860
Do it.

444
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:09,800
If you kill me now,

445
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:11,510
you'll only see her again

446
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:13,290
in the netherworld.

447
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:16,310
Whatever grudges you are holding,

448
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:17,690
just take it out on me.

449
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:20,090
Fu Rong has nothing to do with it.

450
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:22,390
Whether she's involved or not,

451
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:23,850
that's not up to you to say.

452
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:26,640
Do it, Xu Jin.

453
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:29,240
You really love her, don't you?

454
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:30,850
I would really like to see

455
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:33,970
how far you are willing to go for her.

456
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:35,880
Maybe

457
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:38,330
I could be touched by your love,

458
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:40,720
and I'll let you see her.

459
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:44,070
It's known that the sharpness of a blade

460
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:46,880
can cut through bone and kill instantly.

461
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:48,890
Don't worry.

462
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:51,010
This one here

463
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:53,010
is a blunt dagger.

464
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:56,020
It's hard to penetrate it into the body,

465
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:57,770
it's hard to be pulled out.

466
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:01,260
How about

467
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:02,880
you stab yourself for a bit?

468
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:04,430
Stab until I'm satisfied with it.

469
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:06,610
And I'll tell you where Fu Rong is.

470
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:24,610
Do it now.

471
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:26,190
I would really like to see how far

472
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:27,790
you are willing to go for her.

473
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:38,930
Where is she?

474
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:47,570
Do you think you're devoted?

475
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:51,250
I changed my mind.

476
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:55,770
Only one of you

477
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:58,330
can live.

478
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:02,370
If you're willing to die for Fu Rong now,

479
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:06,370
I'll let her go.

480
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:12,500
You're being evasive.

481
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:14,130
You just don't want to

482
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:15,800
tell me where Fu Rong is.

483
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:17,730
Doing this to me

484
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:20,630
do you still intend to
find out where Fu Rong is?

485
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:22,400
Tell me!

486
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:24,210
Tell me where Fu Rong is!

487
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:26,010
And I'll spare your life!

488
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:32,370
Since you love her so much,

489
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:37,090
I'll trade my life

490
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:44,130
for your pain of not being able

491
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:49,330
to see her again.

492
00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:51,370
Zhang Yan.

493
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:53,890
You can't die.

494
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:55,770
You can't die.

495
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:57,280
Worth it.

496
00:38:58,350 --> 00:38:59,300
You can't die.

497
00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:00,650
Where is Fu Rong?

498
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:02,210
Tell me now!

499
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:04,490
Where on earth is Fu Rong?

500
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:06,130
Let me tell you,

501
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:10,010
you're the one

502
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:13,270
who killed...

503
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:14,540
Where is Fu Rong?

504
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:16,060
Where is Fu Rong?

505
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:17,370
Tell me!

506
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:19,010
Fu Rong...

507
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:22,370
Where is she?

508
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:24,340
Tell me!

509
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:25,970
Tell me!

510
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:33,970
Tell me.

511
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:36,220
Tell me where Fu Rong is.

512
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:37,560
Tell me!

513
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:39,570
Fu Rong!

514
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:43,970
Wake up!

515
00:40:04,270 --> 00:40:05,370
Rong'er.

516
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:17,170
Rong'er!

517
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:20,170
Rong'er!

518
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:46,210
Nong Nong!

519
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:53,810
Help!

520
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:11,330
Rong'er!

521
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:26,630
Rong'er!

522
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:29,340
Rong'er!

523
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:36,650
Judging by his character,

524
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:39,000
he wouldn't keep Rong'er too far away.

525
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:41,350
Rong'er must still be in East Mountain.

526
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:46,200
Why would the rainwater
be intercepted here?

527
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:49,050
The soil looks like it
has been recently turned.

528
00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:50,570
Could it be...

529
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:56,300
Rong'er.

530
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:22,570
Rong'er, Rong'er.
