What is the truth?

175
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:57,730
This is a thread from a woman's clothing

176
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:00,650
Maybe it's from a maid in the residence

Why did you leave

179

Ruyi Pavilion early that day?

180
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:07,940
Did Master ask you to leave

181
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:09,960
or did someone come by to visit her?

182

I didn't mean to hide it from you

184

When Ms Liu asked me to leave

185
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:27,890
she quietly ordered me

186
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:30,330
to keep it a secret

187
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:33,290
Besides, I wasn't aware that

188
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:34,580
His Highness never

189
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:36,370
told you about this

190

Where did you get this bracelet from?

191
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:52,700
Master gave it to me

Ever since you called me "Master",

is you

Since you don't see me as your apprentice,

210

Besides, he's confined in

Remember a few days ago,

00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:07,990
when you bumped into me
outside Ruyi Pavilion

235

and I compensated you
with some money?

00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:12,050
I remember

237
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:15,270
When you were transporting goods that day,

238
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:16,500
did you see a man

239

coming out of Ruyi Pavilion?

Let me think

Yes

I don't quite remember

248
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:33,740
But he was good-looking

249
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:35,210
He looked rich

250
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:37,290
He was definitely no ordinary man

251
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:39,940
He was wearing white clothing

252
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:41,150
and seemed to be in a hurry

253
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:42,190
He nearly bumped into me

254
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:43,950
But he must knew some martial arts

255
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:45,950
as he was able to avoid crashing into me

256
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:47,260
The weirdest thing was

257
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:49,940
he had blood stains on his white clothes

258
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:51,130
Are you okay?

259
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:59,220
This is a matter of life and death

260

Do you remember anything else?

264
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:08,420
There was an air of nobility
about him

265
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:10,370
He must've been a blue blood

266
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:11,930
I was wondering

why he had blood stains on him

00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,350
Is something bothering you?

345
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:16,580
Looks like

346
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:18,560
nothing gets past you

347
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:21,010
When I came here,

348
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:23,410
I saw Duke Su kneeling at the gate

349
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,610
It was quite shocking

350
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:29,210
That fool

351
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:33,660
Was it because of Young Lady Fu Rong?

352
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:36,170
How did you know?

353
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:42,000
The things that Duke Su did for the girl

354
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:44,420
are truly unforgettable

355
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:46,610
Moreover you said

356
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,530
he is being foolish

357
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:52,210
I figured it must be because of her

358
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,530
Then can you guess

359
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:58,570
what he wants to do now?

360
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:04,610
He wants to marry her

361
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:07,260
Not just marry her

362
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:09,290
He's saving himself for her

363
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:12,040
Your Majesty

364
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:15,650
Make it quick

365
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:19,410
I heard the guards at the gate said that

366
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:22,870
the Fourth Prince has been kneeling
at the gate for one night

367
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:24,770
The day is very hot

368
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:28,520
His Highness' body is riddled with
injuries both old and new

369
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:30,570
His health is already at stake

370
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:33,330
If he keeps kneeling...

371
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:34,510
I'm afraid...

372
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:35,690
Enough

373
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:37,930
He asked for it

374
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:41,820
Duke Su is in the prime of his youth

375
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:43,010
Royal Brother

376
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:45,130
Why get mad at him?

377
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:48,210
Why don't you

378
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:50,450
fulfil his wish?

379
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,890
That could be a good thing

380
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:57,770
With her status and tendency for trouble,

381
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:00,520
if she becomes a princess consort,

382
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:03,050
this world will be in chaos

383
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:09,950
The most I can allow is

384
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:13,330
to let her become his concubine

385
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:19,890
You're right

386
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:21,770
Royal Brother

387
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:31,630
[Fu Residence]

388
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:33,910
Royal decree for Fu Rong,
daughter of Fu Pin Yan

389
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:44,620
As decreed by His Majesty,

390
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,220
the great Emperor,

391
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:48,650
"My fourth son Xu Jin,"

392
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:50,230
"a man of exceptional virtues,"

393
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:51,500
"of brains and brawn,"

394
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:53,380
"is ripe for marriage"

395
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:57,150
"Fu Rong, daughter of
Hengjing County Magistrate Fu Pin Yan,"

396
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:58,590
"is courteous and polished,"

397
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:00,230
"beautiful and intelligent"

398
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:04,220
"Hence I confer to her the title
of Duke Su's concubine"

399
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:07,060
"The wedding will be held
on an auspicious date"

400
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:09,120
End of decree

401
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:12,860
I accept the decree

402
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:14,000
Thanks to the Emperor

403
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,340
Thanks to the Emperor

404
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:24,160
Please rise, Young Lady Fu Rong

405
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:31,690
Eunuch Wang

406
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:32,970
Let me see you off

407
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:35,530
Please don't

408
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:37,260
Just stay here, Lord Fu

409
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,350
I'll take my leave

410
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:39,530
Goodbye

411
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:49,760
The rest of you, leave us

412
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:51,050
Yes

413
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:54,170
Lan Xiang

414
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:55,940
Please keep this for me

415
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:57,130
Yes, Ms Rong

416
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:01,440
I'm going to become Duke Su's concubine

417
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,420
Why aren't you happy at all?

418
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:04,920
Rong'er

419
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:07,290
I know

420
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,390
You're sad because I'm just a concubine

421
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:12,260
But at least I'm Duke Su's concubine

422
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:13,960
I nearly married Zhang Yan last time

423
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:16,390
Earl Yan's wife will have to bow
down to Duke Su's concubine

424
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:17,980
Besides, Eunuch Wang said

425
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:20,230
I'll become a part of the royal family

426
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:22,130
How can you compare the two?

427
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,580
One is a wife

428
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:24,930
The other is...

429
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:26,370
Stop talking nonsense

430
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:28,510
Why are you more naive than Rong'er?

431
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:31,130
The Emperor has made his decision

432
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:32,650
What's important is

433
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:34,870
I get to marry the man I love

434
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,370
and live happily

435
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:38,410
Rong'er

436
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:41,740
Last time, when we were talking about this,

437
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:43,350
you were hesitant

438
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:45,380
-Why are you...
-Sister

439
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:47,170
That was then, this is now

440
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:49,450
I'm not sad about it at all

441
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:52,460
except the fact that I'll be leaving you

442
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:55,350
We will still be in the capital

443
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:57,010
We can still see each other

444
00:25:57,630 --> 00:26:00,090
We are just worried you
might be mistreated

445
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:04,290
What if Duke Su marries a proper wife?

446
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:07,190
Do you think I will let myself
be mistreated?

447
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:08,430
Rather than worrying about me,

448
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:10,610
you should worry about his wife

449
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:12,410
You...

450
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:15,300
Master, Madam

451
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:16,970
Young Marquis is here

452
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:27,250
Lord Fu, the betrothal gifts
have arrived

453
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,820
This...

454
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:32,490
Rong'er is just a concubine

455
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:34,670
Why are there so many betrothal gifts?

456
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:35,670
His Highness said

457
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:36,910
though he can't defy the royal decree,

458
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:37,940
deep down,

459
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,430
Ms Fu is his one and only wife

460
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:41,570
He will treat her as best as he can

461
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:43,180
This is just the first batch of gifts

462
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,530
More are on the way

463
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,750
Did His Highness really say that?

464
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:48,220
Every word of it

465
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:49,220
It's true

466
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:50,780
If custom doesn't forbid

467
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:52,670
the groom from seeing his bride,

468
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:55,410
His Highness would be sending
the gifts himself

469
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:56,720
Little Marquis

470
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:59,660
Rong'er wants you to tell Duke Su

471
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:02,090
that she understand his excitement

472
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:05,520
But please do not draw too much attention

473
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:07,570
Rong'er is right

474
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:09,830
Alright

475
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:11,800
I'll tell His Highness then

476
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:18,610
Goodbye

477
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:43,630
You just went out the main door,

478
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:44,980
and now you are here

479
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:46,400
In broad daylight, even

480
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:48,090
You're getting more bold

481
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:58,530
Didn't you come here as quickly
as I did?

482
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:00,760
I...

483
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:05,220
I just want to ask you

484
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:07,540
if Duke Su is sincere towards Rong'er?

485
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:08,730
Of course

486
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:09,790
Other favours aside,

487
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:11,540
he broke into the prison for her

488
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:12,730
Isn't that enough?

489
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:14,440
It was the Emperor's orders

490
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:16,350
His Highness didn't mean to
disrespect your sister

491
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:18,680
He'll find a way to make
her his proper wife

492
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,180
Alright then

493
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,140
One more thing

494
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:30,550
How did the investigation

495
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:32,090
of Feng Lai Yi go?

496
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:34,910
After you left,

497
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:36,670
I studied the ledger in detail again

498
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:38,730
There are indeed many discrepancies

499
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:40,790
But the ledgers I have access to

500
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:42,230
were all written by Ji Qing Ting

501
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:44,410
I couldn't find the real ledgers

502
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:46,050
What should we do?

503
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:48,150
What else can we do?

504
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:50,090
I will confront Ji Qing Ting

505
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:51,580
That won't work

506
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:53,570
It's useless to confront him

507
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:54,980
I have an idea

508
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:57,790
that can get that cunning fellow
to come clean

509
00:28:57,870 --> 00:28:58,900
What idea?

510
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,080
Come closer

511
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:05,730
Ms Fu,

512
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:08,330
you must be the smartest woman
in the world

513
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:10,370
Stop talking nonsense

514
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,380
You should get going

-Why are you here?

Ruyi Pavilion has closed down

520
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:46,380
His Highness knew I had no place to go

521
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:48,600
and you may not be used to his residence

522
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:50,710
So he asked me
if I want to go there too

523
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:52,870
Lan Xiang and I could serve you there

524

When Ruyi Pavilion reopens,

527

you can come back

528
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:01,830
You're too kind

529
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:03,890
It's my blessing to serve you

530
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:06,230
I was worried there might be

531
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:08,710
a misunderstanding
between you and Duke Su

532
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:10,790
But when I heard you're
getting married to him,

533
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:12,450
I was relieved

534
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:15,450
No one treats you better than Duke Su

535
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:17,840
He even took me into consideration

536
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:21,130
By the way,

537
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:27,950
I wanted to send it
to Fu Residence tomorrow

538
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:29,850
But since you're here...

539
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:31,850
Every bead,

540
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:33,820
every tassel

541
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:35,410
of this Phoenix Crown

542
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,890
was handmade by Ms Liu

543
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:40,250
She wanted to give you a surprise

544
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:42,690
on your wedding day

545
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:45,650
Who knew you'd be wearing it so soon?

546
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:50,670
Too bad Ms Liu isn't around to witness it

547
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:55,730
I had the cheek to call myself
a lucky star

548
00:30:57,630 --> 00:31:00,090
But now, Master is killed

549
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:03,850
It's all my fault

550
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:06,760
How can you blame yourself
for Ms Liu's death?

551
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:08,600
Nobody wanted it to happen

552
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:12,720
Before Master died, I told her

553
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:18,970
I didn't want her as my master anymore

554
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:21,760
Since you don't see me as your apprentice,

555
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:25,810
I won't see you as my Master either

556
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:33,290
In these ten odd years,

557
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:35,290
she treated me like her kin

558
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,680
Yet my last words to her

559
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:41,490
were so hurtful

560
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:43,430
You said those things out of anger

561
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:45,090
Ms Liu wouldn't blame you

562
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:47,970
I wish she'd blame me and hate me

563
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:50,640
But even in my dreams,

564
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:53,340
she comforts me,

565
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:55,410
telling me she'd never blame me

566
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:03,130

was from her,

you've wanted to kill her

That's why you wouldn't let me know

you've met her before

up till now

609
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:41,040
was because I am the murderer?

Tell me the truth

611
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,610
If you wish to kill me,

612
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:54,490
just do it

613
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:03,090
I have indeed met Liu Ru Yi

614
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:06,850
But has it occurred to you

615
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:09,580
that if I really wanted her dead,

616
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:12,400
why would I dirty my own hands?

617
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:17,010
But on that day, someone saw

618
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:18,880
a man in white covered with blood

619
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,540

the silk thread on your sleeves

belonged to my master
when she was killed that day

00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:28,610
How do you explain that?

624
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:30,290
I did fight with her

625
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:49,210
But when I left,

626
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:52,000

This is to repay a love

If I wanted to kill her,

633
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:54,370
I would have also killed Yuan

634
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:57,690

00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:54,620
it will be a pity

684
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:58,210
So, you don't want to drink with me?

685
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:00,890
I can't drink too much today

686
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:03,290
I hope you'll forgive me

687
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:05,610
Duke Chen

688
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:06,890
Here

689
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:08,110
I'll drink to you

690
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:09,620
If that's not enough

691
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:11,240
I'll finish this jug of wine

692
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:13,490
Duke Su

693
00:42:14,310 --> 00:42:15,700
I need to talk to you

694
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:17,010
Come here

695
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,060
Xu Jin

696
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:21,710
Are you going to leave

697
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:23,610
just like that?

698
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:31,250
Why do you look so pale?

699
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:37,150
Everyone

700
00:42:37,710 --> 00:42:38,970
Thank you

701
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:41,630
for coming here to celebrate with me

702
00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:43,490
Today,

703
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:45,290
I really can't drink too much

704
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:48,440
Please excuse me for leaving early

705
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:50,810
Xu Mao

706
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:53,360
Please excuse me for leaving early

707
00:42:55,610 --> 00:42:56,710
Mr Ge

708
00:42:57,130 --> 00:42:59,270
Stay here and entertain our guests

709
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:01,120
Yes, Your Highness

710
00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:14,670
Everyone,

711
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:16,410
today is His Highness' big day

712
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:18,020
Please enjoy yourselves

713
00:43:18,110 --> 00:43:19,210
Royal Uncle

714
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:25,930
I'll take my leave now
