Are you feeling all right?

8
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:56,920
It's...

9
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,370
It's my wound.

10
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:01,320
It's painful and itchy.

11
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:03,210
That means the wound is healing.

12
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:04,300
You're recovering.

13

If you don't feel good,

14

No.

I can bear the pain.

Afraid of what?

You can sleep on the couch.

This may not be a good idea.

to rectify your mistake.

73

You don't want to lead
the Imperial Guards again?

74

It's not fair to Duke An.

75
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:33,870
You know his character.

76
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:35,850

77

to weaponry.

78
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:40,820
He spoke to me about this yesterday.

79
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,770
He even gave back the gold seal.

80
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,370
In fact,

81

Furthermore,

83

you were dismissed because of Fu Rong.

She insisted to sleep
with me last two days.

180
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:02,220
I couldn't get enough rest.

181
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,150
Thanks for helping.

182
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:38,340
Not at all.

[Flu medicine, Sanjiu]

00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,450
I know you might get a cold.

You care about me.

Don't worry, I'm strong

Anyhow,

191
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:07,940
I'm glad you're fine.

192
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,420
If what you said is true,

193
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:19,500
Consort Duan is afraid that
Ji Qing Ting might pocket

194

Feng Lai Yi.

195
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,990
That's why there are three stamps.

196

Consort Duan's stamp
governs all expenditures.

197

Feng Lai Yi's stamp
is required on all the documents.

And Ji Qing Ting's stamp...

199

Consort Duan is in the palace,

200
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,990
it's inconvenient for her.

201
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:44,110
Maybe Ji Qing Ting betrayed you

202
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:48,400
because he gained a lot from Consort Duan.

203
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,530
The benefit he got

204
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,570
could be consent from Consort Duan

205
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:56,050
to sign documents on his own.

206
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,200
You mean,

Not all dealings.

210
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,760
It's only the small transaction.

211
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:10,940
For big transaction,

212
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:13,740
Consort Duan will check carefully.

Ms Fu.

214
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,220
What does this mean?

215
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:20,930
You asked me to come,

216
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:22,690
how can I help?

217
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:29,260
If my guess is correct,

218
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:32,540
you could be

219
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,130
very useful.

Ruyi Pavilion is launching
new products soon.

223

We'll be able to get
some business from there.

224
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:56,500
When Consort Duan notices the income
is reducing,

225
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:00,260
she'll believe Ji Qing Ting
is messing with the account.

226

The two of them colluded with each other.

I'm upset and angry too.

690
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:27,700
you still head to the hill.

691
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:29,500
It shows you stay on the hilltop.

692
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:33,620
The smell on you is not from lousy wine.

693

It doesn't match your outfit.

694

Smart girl.

695
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:40,370
Tell me,

696
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:42,460
why are you looking for me?

697
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:46,020
I'm from Ruyi Pavilion.

698
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:47,340
I'm here today

699
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,570
to ask for your help.

700
00:36:48,610 --> 00:36:50,740
How did you make jewellery for the masses?

701
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:52,420
Who is Liu Ru Yi to you?

702
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:53,800
She begged me.

703
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:54,940
I didn't teach her.

704
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:58,780
She still thinks about it
after so many years?

705
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:00,930
Liu Ru Yi is my teacher.

706
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,380
She passed away.

707
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:06,560
She's dead?

708
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:09,460
I found her drawings accidentally,

709
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,160
that's why I'm here to see you.

710
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:15,980
It's a pity.

711
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:20,140
I didn't know Ruyi Pavilion

712
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:23,680
is so adamant about making
popular jewellery for the masses.

713
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:30,300
I don't mind teaching you.

714
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:35,110
But it all depends on you.

715
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:38,930
You agree to teach me?

716
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:09,340
I heard

717
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:12,580
there is an essence in the universe.

718
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,580
It glows with seven colours.

719
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:17,660
Where celestial beings live on earth,

720
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,580
not aware of their homecoming.

721
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:23,150
If you can find this item,

722
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:27,100
I'll teach you my craft.

You didn't take your dinner again?

726
00:39:12,090 --> 00:39:13,790
I forgot. I'll take it later.

727
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:16,330
You'll grow skinny if you don't eat.

728
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:17,610
You won't look good.

729
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:19,120
Eat more and get fatter.

730
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:21,420
You look cute when you grow fatter.

731

Fried chicken and fish, which do you want?

I'm not choosing, I'll eat later.

733
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,140
All right.

734
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,530
I heard from Lan Xiang.

735
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,550
You're looking for seven colours?

736
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:36,340
I never heard of it before.

737
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:39,320
If it's that easy,
Master Xu wouldn't have asked me.

738
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:43,170
Is it like this?

739
00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:47,200
It's only one colour.

I have been looking for you.

Rong'er is looking for an expert's advice.

747
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:21,340
The expert told her to find

748
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:22,960
a light with seven colours.

749
00:40:23,370 --> 00:40:24,900

Look, it glows with seven colours.

754
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:48,620
It has seven colours indeed.

755
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:49,820
But,

756
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:51,900
this is different from what he said.

757
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:54,770
That's true, but this is nice,

758
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:55,730
it can do.
