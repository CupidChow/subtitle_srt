00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:40,670
They're so cheap.

172
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:43,470
As expected from a countryside.

173
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,590
You can only deceive the bumpkins.

174
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,240
This one.

175
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:53,110
What's so special about this?

176
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:54,620
This costs 1,000 taels.

177
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:55,930
One thousand taels?

178
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:57,260
This one?

179
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:00,280
Do you think
I don't know what a good stuff is?

180
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,240
Miss, wait.

181
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:04,710
What is it?

182
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:07,830
You asked so many things
but you didn't buy anything.

183
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,580
This is against the rules.

184
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:10,900
Rules?

185
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,250
Since I was young,

186
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:14,110
I hate it when people set rules for me.

187
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:17,150
I'll buy everything that you have here.

188
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,950
Aren't you talking big?

189
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:21,500
I'm afraid

190
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:23,290
you won't be able to afford it.

191
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:24,830
I can't afford it?

192
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,650
You're ridiculous.

193
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:31,930
Count it yourself.

194
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:35,100
I'm sure it's enough for this rubbish.

195
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,780
Miss, what are you doing?

196
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:45,700
Let go of me!

197
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:47,020
Sister!

198
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:48,870
Cut it out.

199
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:55,510
I'm sorry.

200
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:57,710
My sister has been unreasonable.

201
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,840
Don't worry about it.

202
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,400
I'm sorry.

203
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:28,740
It was nothing. Please don't be angry.

204
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,580
When will you show me

205
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,860
the premium jewellery that I wanted?

206
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:35,770
It's right ahead of us.
We'll get there soon.

207
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,710
Let's go.

208
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:40,660
-Yes!
-Yes!

209
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,640
-Just ahead of us.
-Good, good!

210
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:49,670
Wait for me under this tree.

211
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,390
Don't go anywhere.

212
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:52,780
Don't make trouble.

213
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,340
Got it.

214
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,630
Come, this way please.

215
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:07,320
You have a customer.

216
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:09,690
What do you want?

217
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:12,460
Your most-treasured collection.

218
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,860
Go in.

219
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:41,450
[Cui Wan's bangle?]

220
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:44,630
[Did she come to Ghost Market as well?]

221
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,050
[Could it be...]

222
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,370
Miss, how may I help you?

223
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,490
[Any of you who wins this competition]

224
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:02,360
[will get my bangle.]

225
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:03,550
Do you like it?

226
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,540
Sir, I have a question.

227
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,480
Where did you get this bangle?

228
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:10,500
You shouldn't ask the origin of a hero

229
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,040
or the source of a treasure.

230
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:14,110
Take it if you want.

231
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,670
Put it down if you're not buying.

232
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:16,860
Don't ask too much,

233
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:19,310
you might break the taboo of Ghost Market.

234
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,360
If I buy it,

235
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:23,720
will you tell me where you got this?

236
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:24,890
No.

237
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,930
You keep avoiding my question,

238
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:29,760
is it because you got
this bangle illegally?

239
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:34,060
I guess this is your first time here.

240
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:35,890
Here in Ghost Market,

241
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:38,180
none of them have a clean background.

242
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:41,560
If you're not buying it,

243
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:43,850
please go somewhere else.

244
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:45,870
This is just a small business,

245
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:47,490
I can't afford wasting too much time.

246
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:48,370
Besides,

247
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:50,590
I'm closing the stall soon.

248
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,120
Hold on.

249
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:54,190
This way.

250
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:09,640
If you don't like it,

251
00:17:09,849 --> 00:17:11,510
there's nothing else I can do.

252
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:26,930
I guess
today is not a good day for business.

253
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:30,210
Sir, I mean no offence,

254
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,680
I just need an answer.

255
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,960
If you really want to know the answer,

256
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:36,520
are you willing to make a bet with me

257
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:38,420
using the rule of Ghost Market?

258
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,170
If you win,

259
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:42,590
I will tell you all the answers you want.

260
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,350
If you lose,

261
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:47,690
please go somewhere else

262
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,430
and leave me alone.

263
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,970
Sure. Please tell me your bet.

264
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,100
In the Ghost Market,

265
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:57,390
there is a blindfolded guessing game.

266
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,390
The buyer needs to be blindfolded,

267
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:04,070
whereas the seller will choose anything
from the stall.

268
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:06,390
Then, the buyer will remove the blindfold,

269
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:08,120
points out the object and wins.

270
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:10,220
Otherwise, you lose.

271
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,780
This rule seems unfair.

272
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:16,710
You were trying to make me do
what I refused to.

273
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,030
When you're making a bet,

274
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,720
you have to rely on your luck.

275
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:23,820
Just like

276
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,530
you're trying to find out
the source of this bangle,

277
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:28,390
you're also betting on your luck.

278
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:29,980
Since you're here in the Ghost Market,

279
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,780
you should follow its rule.

280
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,530
This is fairness.

281
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:34,810
All right.

282
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:37,760
Since you've agreed,
you can't go back on your words.

283
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,860
Sure.

284
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,580
[Don't be afraid.]

285
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,630
[I'm here with you.]

286
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:17,320
I'm ready.

287
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:21,320
To avoid unfairness and fraud,

288
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,270
both of you, please step aside.

289
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,320
Take care.

290
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:44,510
I'm done.

291
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:07,260
That one.

292
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:10,780
You're right.

293
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:14,960
All right.

294
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,720
I'll honour our bet.

295
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:18,260
Thank you, sir.

296
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:21,160
However, before answering your question,

297
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:22,480
I really want to know

298
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:25,520
how did you know
it was this porcelain pot?

299
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,770
If I tell you the truth,

300
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,850
I guess you won't accept the result.

301
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:35,910
We already knew the result,
so I won't break my promise.

302
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:42,010
It's almost impossible to get it right.

303
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:44,130
So when I took the blindfold from you,

304
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:46,060
I sprinkled fragrance powder
which I brought

305
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:47,690
on your hand.

306
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,630
When I was guessing,

307
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:52,430
I found it
by tracing the fragrance powder.

308
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:55,040
So you set a trap on me

309
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:56,670
way before me.

310
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,820
You have your own way

311
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,640
and we have ours.

312
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,140
I hope you'll keep your promise.

313
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,730
In that case,

314
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:07,450
I will honour our bet.

315
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:11,320
The owner of the bangle
ruined my business,

316
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:13,780
so I took the bangle in return,

317
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,890
I guess it's reasonable.

318
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:18,050
If you want it,

319
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:19,330
just take it.

320
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,620
How much are these?

321
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:27,990
Eight hundred?

322
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:30,150
Eight thousand.

323
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:31,560
Eight thousand?

324
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,500
That's a highway robbery.

325
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:35,120
I'll take them.

326
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,100
Sir,

327
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,870
did this lady come with someone else?

328
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:57,380
That man seems to be her cousin.

329
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,360
He was a decent man,

330
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:01,070
he even offered an apology.

331
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:02,540
[He must have come here]

332
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:05,080
[to find out the lost goods
from the palace.]

333
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:09,490
May I know where they went?

334
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,700
This will be your final question.

335
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:16,170
I saw them turning
into the intersection at the front.

336
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:19,520
That place with three lanterns.

337
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:21,800
Thank you, sir.

338
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:23,250
Take care.

339
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,540
What are you doing?

340
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:30,340
You shouldn't violate the laws
in the Ghost Market!

341
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:31,530
If you dare to rob us,

342
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:33,420
you won't get out of this market!

343
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,470
Sir,

344
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:36,590
let's talk it out.

345
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:38,680
These are from the palace,

346
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:39,800
how dare you sell them?

347
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,700
The...the palace?

348
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,690
If you have a death wish,

349
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:47,150
don't drag me in.

350
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:48,330
I...

351
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:50,180
I just borrowed them,

352
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:51,940
I wasn't planning on selling them.

353
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,830
Demon, don't let them fool you.

354
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:57,310
Even if they report to the officer,
they can't catch us.

355
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,330
When the sunlight shines upon the ghosts,

356
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:04,160
how can they survive?

357
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:06,630
Sir, how about this?

358
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:08,210
No matter what you want,

359
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,070
I'll get it for you.

360
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,740
I won't charge you even a single penny.

361
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:12,930
What are you doing there?

362
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:14,560
Beg him to spare our lives.

363
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:16,100
I...I was wrong.

364
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,350
Please,

365
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:18,930
please let us go.

366
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,700
I'm not interested in either of you.

367
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:25,250
Tell me,

368
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:28,100
where did you get these?

369
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:33,340
I stole them from Qing Feng Hideout.

370
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,560
There are many similar treasure there.

371
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:38,620
I stole some to display them in our store.

372
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,830
I was planning on returning them
after a few days.

373
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:45,620
Qing Feng Hideout.

374
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:48,230
-Take a look.
-Good!

375
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,020
One more time!

376
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,570
-Amazing!
-Good job!

377
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:54,290
Wen Xing.

378
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:55,650
One more time!

379
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,720
That vendor seems suspicious.

380
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,580
After the Ghost Market is closed,

381
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:02,210
find out where he goes.

382
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:04,360
Roger that.

383
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:11,670
Why isn't anyone here?

384
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,430
I'm here.

385
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:24,910
I can't see any jewellery
from the palace here.

386
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:30,720
Great!

387
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:32,790
Good!

388
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:35,030
Amazing!

389
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,660
Show us some more! Great!

390
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:41,500
Anyone out there?

391
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:44,970
Help!

392
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:46,210
Anyone out there?

393
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:47,970
-Help!
-Somebody!

394
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:49,900
Sir, is that you?

395
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,700
We're wrong. We won't do this again.

396
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:57,290
Who are you?

397
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,680
Stop making noise.

398
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:03,290
Who's the man you were talking about?

399
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,070
Answer her question.

400
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,180
Your Highness,

401
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:29,270
are you all right?

402
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:32,140
Xu Jia,

403
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,790
send the princess home first.

404
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:34,680
Yes.

405
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:37,450
Duke Su, are you not coming with us?

406
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:39,710
Princess.

407
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:54,400
[Why would she come here?]

408
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,840
I also want to know who he is.

409
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:03,640
He is

410
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:05,540
very tall and well-built.

411
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:07,600
He looks very wealthy.

412
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:11,150
Judging from his accent,
I think he's from the capital.

413
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:13,000
He brought a follower with him

414
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:15,920
and a beautiful cousin.

415
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:18,550
Why did he tie you up?

416
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:20,190
Say it!

417
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:21,880
You...

418
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,480
If you lie to us,

419
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:25,300
this knife won't go easy on you.

420
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:28,370
He wanted to buy jewellery from us.

421
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:30,610
We wanted to deceive him with fakes.

422
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,250
Then where did he go?

423
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:35,800
We were tied up.

424
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:38,530
We really don't know where he went.

425
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,140
Look. I told you everything.

426
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:43,640
I'm begging you,

427
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:46,010
please let us off.

428
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,990
When someone shows up,

429
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:49,580
you'll be released.

430
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:52,880
Don't make any noise.

431
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:35,500
When did you leave the capital?

432
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,040
Why didn't you contact me?

433
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:42,910
Why don't you answer me?

434
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:55,000
Uncle?

435
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:56,760
Duke Su,

436
00:27:57,730 --> 00:27:59,490
you two are no longer related.

437
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:01,820
Leave her alone.

438
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:09,210
Nong Nong,

439
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:10,770
let's get out of here.

440
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:18,040
Let me talk to him alone.

441
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:28,620
Duke Su.

442
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:30,250
Why did you

443
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:32,630
sign the divorce agreement?

444
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,470
Tell me.

445
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,760
Are you hiding something from me?

446
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:41,490
Don't you already know

447
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:43,390
what happened in the capital?

448
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,540
I don't believe it.

449
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:50,000
I can't take it any more.

450
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:53,210
Don't you get it?

451
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,560
Since the very beginning,

452
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:02,470
I just wanted to be an ordinary person.

453
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:05,400
But every single thing

454
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:08,120
was going against my will.

455
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:10,800
Being with you

456
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,140
terrified me.

457
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:16,540
There were
countless open and covert attacks.

458
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,560
If I manage to escape once,

459
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,400
what about next time?

460
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,130
What about the time after that?

461
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:23,920
I am exhausted.

462
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:27,530
I don't mind being slandered,

463
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:31,050
but Ruyi Pavilion
has also been implicated.

464
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:33,820
How do I explain it to my late master?

465
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:38,310
I was never meant

466
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:41,080
to be a duchess.

467
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:45,680
But it was too late
when I finally understood.

468
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:48,480
If we stay together,

469
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:50,810
we'll hold each other back.

470
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:54,060
Why don't we resolve this
once and for all?

471
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:56,680
After signing the divorce agreement,

472
00:29:58,420 --> 00:29:59,870
I will regain my freedom.

473
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:03,540
I will also prove
Ruyi Pavilion's innocence.

474
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:07,100
You don't have to be on the run any more.

475
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,050
To both of us,

476
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:13,760
this is a good thing.

477
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:23,150
Rong'er.

478
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,870
Look at me.

479
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,200
Say it again.

480
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:35,330
[Say it again.]

481
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:37,300
[I won't.]

482
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:38,990
[It will always be the same.]

483
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:50,060
[I can repeat it
as many times as you want.]

484
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:53,540
Being your duchess

485
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:56,280
has worn me out.

486
00:30:57,370 --> 00:30:59,300
I am tired of this feeling.

487
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,300
Set me free

488
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:05,080
and set yourself free.

489
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:12,290
I had feelings for you.

490
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,510
But compared to reality,

491
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:19,160
this relationship is vulnerable.

492
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:21,020
It breaks at the slightest touch.

493
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:26,380
No matter what,

494
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:30,630
thank you for taking care of me
in the past.

495
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:33,470
I hope that from now on,

496
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:36,680
you'll be blessed with health and peace.

497
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:40,280
Forget about me.

498
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,610
-Uncle San.
-Uncle San.

499
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:09,570
[Uncle San, Ruyi Pavilion]

500
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:17,150
I was worried sick
when I heard that you were being hunted.

501
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,530
I'm glad seeing
both of you are doing fine.

502
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:21,470
How was it?

503
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:23,580
Did you find out who was after you?

504
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,580
How do you not know?

505
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,840
Haven't you heard anything
from our brothers?

506
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:49,720
Our forces in the capital

507
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:54,650
have been wiped out?

508
00:33:54,730 --> 00:33:56,860
That's why this time we need your help.

509
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,690
Only you can handle the situation

510
00:33:58,690 --> 00:34:00,750
and bring Ruyi Pavilion back to life.

511
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:04,810
Who's there?

512
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:29,710
[Ting Yu Court]

513
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:41,639
[Peace Around the World]

514
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:39,920
Your Highness.

515
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,360
Tomorrow,

516
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,690
go to Qing Feng Hideout and find out

517
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:50,219
if those stolen goods from the palace
are still there.

518
00:34:50,699 --> 00:34:52,020
Yes, Your Highness.

519
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:14,370
Nong Nong,

520
00:35:14,770 --> 00:35:15,650
what's wrong?

521
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:17,140
I'm fine.

522
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:20,720
You've been following me,

523
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,900
but you never asked where I was going.

524
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:06,070
This is the high ground of Weiyang City.

525
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:07,610
Over here,

526
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:09,640
you can get a complete view

527
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:11,220
of Weiyang City.

528
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:26,050
[Whenever I'm feeling down,]

529
00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:28,740
[I'll take a seat here,]

530
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:32,670
[looking at a myriad of twinkling lights,]

531
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,160
[sky full of stars,]

532
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:37,120
[and the broad sky and sea.]

533
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:39,440
[In this world,]

534
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:41,990
[we're just a speck of dust.]

535
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:45,020
[Like the bacteria and cicada,]

536
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,060
[are we any different from them?]

537
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:52,200
[It's just a moment of sorrow and joy,]

538
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,330
[we don't have to take it to heart.]

539
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:00,720
Now,

540
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,650
you can't see anything.

541
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:04,980
But, look.

542
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,400
So beautiful.

543
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:23,950
So beautiful.

544
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:26,370
Thank you.

545
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:33,540
Everything is clear now.

546
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,210
The mist was covering our view.

547
00:37:39,610 --> 00:37:41,190
But just be patient,

548
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,460
and you'll see the silver lining.

549
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:00,470
Young Master.

550
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,870
Why did you come here?

551
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:07,160
Oh, right.

552
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:09,780
The inn is right in front.
I'll go there first.

553
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:15,070
What happened? Tell me.

554
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,660
As per your order,

555
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:18,010
I followed the vendor.

556
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,750
That vendor seems to be
an old employee of Ruyi Pavilion,

557
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:22,350
just like Xiao Qi and Xiao Ba.

558
00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:25,350
They are plotting
on rebuilding Ruyi Pavilion.

559
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:26,640
Where is he?

560
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:30,120
The vendor is quite a skilled fighter.

561
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:31,770
I almost...

562
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,200
You lost him?

563
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,630
He has fast footwork.

564
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:38,930
Where did you see him?

565
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:40,360
A hut outside the city.

566
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:41,960
Let's go.

567
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:47,150
-Run!
-Take all the food.

568
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,600
-Don't move!
-Why should I pay for your food?

569
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,960
Leave it here!

570
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,430
This hide looks good.

571
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:54,320
Back off!

572
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:57,840
Sir, I beg you.

573
00:38:57,970 --> 00:38:59,070
Please leave some for me!

574
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:00,130
Speak another word

575
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:01,230
and I will twist your head off

576
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:03,380
and gift it to the master
of Qing Feng Hideout.

577
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:04,400
Listen.

578
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,070
The gifts our master received today

579
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:08,440
-are from the palace...
-Shut up!

580
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:09,850
Let's go!

581
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:11,170
Shut your mouth.

582
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,980
Come! Hurry up!

583
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:55,670
-Unload them.
-You're back.

584
00:39:55,690 --> 00:39:56,930
-All right!
-Yeah.

585
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,910
I have a cart full of good food and wine,

586
00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:00,410
and also premium hides.

587
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,700
How's that?

588
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:04,100
Not bad.

589
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:05,070
Unload them!

590
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,290
They're good stuff!

591
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:24,030
Look.

592
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:29,660
This is indeed the secret code
which Ruyi Pavilion used to communicate.

593
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:30,810
As expected.

594
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:33,230
But it is hard to decode it.

595
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:35,310
Sorry that I can't figure it out.

596
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:38,380
Their secret code is complicated.

597
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:39,830
Copy it as soon as you can

598
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:41,810
and let Gu Yuan verify it.

599
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:43,130
Yes.

600
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:03,790
You know,

601
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,250
today is master's birthday,

602
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:06,760
do you think he will be in a good mood

603
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,910
and give us some gold and stuff?

604
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:10,580
Just dream on it.

605
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:11,640
How is that even possible?

606
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:12,830
Why not?

607
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:13,880
Have you forgotten?

608
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:17,340
Those boxes that were delivered
from the capital two days ago,

609
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,420
I caught sight of them in the warehouse.

610
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:21,040
There's all kinds of treasure
in those boxes,

611
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,380
including gold, agate and pearl!

612
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:24,930
There's a whole lot of treasure.

613
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:27,040
Master won't be able to spend them all.

614
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,380
He should share it with all of us.

615
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:33,900
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

616
00:41:34,210 --> 00:41:35,960
-Let's go to the warehouse again.
-You're daydreaming.
