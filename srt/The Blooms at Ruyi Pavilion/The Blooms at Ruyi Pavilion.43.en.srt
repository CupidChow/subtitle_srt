[Xu Jin]

167
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:32,940
Mr Xu, that's too casual.

168
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,770
I saw nothing.

169
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:39,440
[Is anything the matter, Ms Qiao?]

170
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,880
Well...

171
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:49,010
We might need to discuss the reparation

172
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:50,870
of Furong hairpin in detail,

173
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:54,560
as it'll be displayed. So, I thought
a video call would be better.

174
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,410
Do you know what time is it?

175
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,080
The time...

176
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:03,000
I forgot due to the excitement.

177
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,640
Are you and Mrs Xu going to bed already?

178
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:10,160
Mrs Xu?

179
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,110
I thought a capable man like you

180
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,000
would've been married already.

181
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,200
I'll go to Ruyi Pavilion tomorrow.

182
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,200
[I'm hanging up.]

183
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:27,430
[Chat time 02:11]

184
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,650
[Good night, Mr Xu.]

185
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,080
[Sorry for disturbing you.]

186
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,210
[See you tomorrow.]

187
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,730
Xiao Ping Ping.

188
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,380
I'm now sure he's single.

189
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,340
We'll stick to our plan tomorrow.

190
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,920
Done.

191
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,820
Let's call it a day.

192
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:54,870
