17
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:47,700
was to help Ruyi Pavilion

18

and to keep our men from getting hurt.

19

But things didn't turn out

Instead...

21

Instead, we got Lord Fu implicated.

in dire straits.

His Majesty has ordered Ruyi Pavilion
to be destroyed.

37
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,600
The jewellery house is ruined.

38

All of you are wanted men.

39

What you need to do now
is to protect yourselves.

If there's nothing else,

41

you should leave the capital at once.

I promise you

43
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,310
I'll prove to the imperial court

44
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:24,910
that Ruyi Pavilion is manned
by righteous people,

45
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:26,740
so as to save it from destruction

46

Take care, everyone.

50
00:04:40,909 --> 00:04:42,659
All of you should go into hiding

51
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:43,740
and be safe.

52
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:44,990
-Yes!
-Yes!

53

54

is still unknown.

60
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:12,190
We'll stay behind
and help to investigate it.

61
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:15,020
That's right.
Let's find out the truth first.

62

from the Criminal Investigation Bureau.

As you expected,

71
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:33,310
Ruyi Pavilion's members went
to the bureau to find the document.

72
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:34,550
Fortunately, we had already disposed

73
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:35,980
of Zhang Yan's body

74
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:38,870
before the Criminal Investigation Bureau
started investigating Ruyi Pavilion.

75
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:41,780
Now, no one would know

76
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:44,180
that it was Zhang Yan who set the fire.

77
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:47,909
Have you gotten rid of the
Imperial Guard impersonator?

78
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:49,020
Don't worry.

79
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,940
It has all been taken care of.

80
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:56,300
Now, there's only one person left.

81
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:00,120
Nong Nong is finally coming back to me.

82
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:01,460
I have long waited

83
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,140
for this day.

84
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:06,550
You're back.

85
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:09,210
Did you find any clues?

86
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:11,800
His Highness was right.

87
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:14,150
The document says there
was only one body found.

88
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:15,590
Did the people at the bureau

89
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:16,850
falsify the evidence?

90
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,430
This is a big case.

91
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:21,510
The bureau must have sent
a lot of people to investigate it.

92
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:23,840
I don't think the evidence was falsified.

93
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:25,710
Someone must have tampered
with the evidence.

94
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:27,460
What should we do next?

95
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,180
Little Marquis.

96
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:32,650
Did you get anything from Guo Rui?

97
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:34,340
Guo Rui remembered

98
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:36,110
that someone blatantly
impersonated as an Imperial Guard

99
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:37,630
and blocked the street that day.

100
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:39,620
That clue led them to one person.

101
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:40,860
But he's dead.

102
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:44,460
First, it was Gu Yuan.

103
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:47,150
Then, someone disguised
as an Imperial Guard.

104
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:50,100
Someone must have planned all this.

105
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,260
But what is the motive?

106
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,470
Is he trying to frame His Highness

107
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:56,780
or eliminate him altogether?

108
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:59,150
That's right.

109
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:00,990
If I weren't so faithful to His Highness,

110
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:02,900
I would've suspected him

111
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:04,840
after hearing Guo Rui's story.

112
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:07,290
From the looks of it,

113
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:10,140
Gu Yuan is the only clue left.

114
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:12,160
I'm going to find her tomorrow.

115
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:13,890
She can't be that hard to find.

116
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:15,740
Little Marquis.

117
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,380
Are you free tomorrow?

118
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:18,790
I would like to ask you

119
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:21,060
to patrol the area outside the city.

120
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,490
No problem.

121
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:25,060
But I have something to do.

122
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:26,830
I'll get Li Wei to investigate it first.

123
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:27,830
All right.

124
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:30,400
Little Marquis, what's so urgent?

125
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:33,360
It's none of your business.

126
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:40,180
It's very sunny here

127
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:41,790
and the scenery is very beautiful.

128
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,020
Why would it only be worth 300 taels?

129
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:45,380
That's right.

130
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:48,540
This is...

131
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,660
I believe

132
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:55,540
this must be Ms Fu.

133
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:57,660
Yes, you are here because...

134
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:58,740
This courtyard

135
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:00,380
is a blessed place.

136
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:03,230
The plants in the courtyard are colourful

137
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:05,670
and there are flowers
to enjoy throughout all seasons.

138
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:06,940
It's located far away from the market.

139
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,340
It's quiet and secluded.

140
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:11,180
Do you find it small?

141
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:13,060
It's a little small.

142
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:15,590
A small house is good
for gathering wealth.

143
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:17,060
Well...

144
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,300
Name your price.

145
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:26,940
How about 1,000 taels?

146
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:29,340
This is...

147
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:30,630
If you're not happy with that,

148
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,700
I can offer more.

149
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:34,070
I am happy with it. This is great.

150
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:35,390
That's good.

00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:07,180
For you,

173
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:08,800
nothing is too tough for me.

174
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:11,620
Here's a toast to you.

175
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:18,470
Ms Fu.

176
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:24,540
I'll be right back.

177
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,420
Nong Nong, you're awake.

178
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:39,710
Why am I here in Ju Shui Pavilion?

179
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:42,030
I saw you passed out on the street.

180
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:44,140
I was worried. So I brought you here.

181
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:45,220
But don't worry.

182
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:46,820
I have informed Ms Fu Xuan.

183
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:49,330
You can stay here tonight.

184
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:50,650
[It's poisoned.]

185
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:52,780
[He wants me dead?]

186
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:56,590
I'll take you somewhere.

187
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:57,600
Come.

188
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:10,180
This is for you.

189
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:20,339
I remember we used to skip class
and play with dates

190
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:21,970
at Ping Hu Pavilion.

191
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,660
Once, Father even caught us.

192
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,339
How happy we were then.

193
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:27,089
Nong Nong.

194
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:29,460
Did I ever tell you

195
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:33,010
that my mother was burned to death

196
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:35,460
in Hong Fu Temple?

197
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:38,430
How is that possible?

198
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:40,340
My mother was a kind person.

199
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:43,340
But the people disdained her

200
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:45,430
because her eyes were different.

201
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:47,690
I was separated from her
since I was a kid.

202
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:51,710
I never got the chance to see her
even in her final moments.

203
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:53,900
The dead are gone.

204
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,810
But she will always be in my heart.

205
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:04,150
Little Follower, it's all in the past now.

206
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:05,140
Young Master.

207
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:07,260
Ms Fu.

208
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:15,720
Nong Nong, go back to your room
and get some rest.

209
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,300
I've sent someone to search for her.

210
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:52,670
Send someone to keep an eye
on Duke Su's Residence.

211
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:54,020
Yes.

212
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:02,540
What's going on?

213
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:03,900
Ms Fu, it's nothing.

214
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,300
It's just a night patrol.

215
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:16,100
Yuan.

216
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:19,220
Don't talk.

217
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:23,420
Before you kill me,

218
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:25,840
tell me who you're working for.

219
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:29,420
My lady.

220
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:32,310
I'm sorry.

221
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,300
Gu Yuan? Is that you?

222
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,460
I know it's you!

223
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:14,580
Don't go!

224
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:24,530
[Ju Shui Pavilion]

Nong Nong.

226
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:25,390
Don't think too much.

227
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,390
Cheer up.

228
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:28,430
[It's Her Highness.]

229
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:31,990
Little Follower.

230
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:35,720
There is a girl named Gu Yuan

231
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:37,530
in Ruyi Pavilion.

232
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:39,430
I haven't seen her in a while.

233
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:41,420
Have you met her before?

234
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:44,190
Ms Gu?

235
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:45,890
I've never met her.

236
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:48,210
Why do you ask?

237
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:51,420
It's nothing.

238
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,180
I suddenly recalled

239
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:55,210
that she has always liked you.

240
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:58,320
She'll probably take part
in the Yuedan Commentary.

241
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:00,580
All right.

242
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:02,380
If I see Ms Gu,

243
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:03,860
I'll let you know.

[Why would Yuan show up here?]

[What's Little Follower
trying to hide from me?]

247
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:54,700
Your Highness.

248
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:57,310
What's this ruckus?
Did you run into a ghost?

249
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:59,310
It was more terrifying than ghosts.

250
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:01,790
I was on the street, inquiring
about Gu Yuan's whereabouts,

251
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:03,990
when I saw Her Highness
pass out on the street.

252
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:05,650
Farmer Ju Shui came to her aid.

253
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:07,690
I was worried, so I followed them.

254
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:09,810
Then they went into Ju Shui Pavilion.

255
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:13,140
Go on.

256
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,880
Ju Shui Pavilion was heavily guarded.

257
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:17,450
I could only wait outside.

258
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:18,830
In the middle of the night,

259
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:19,780
I saw Gu Yuan

260
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,790
leaving Ju Shui Pavilion in a hurry.

261
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:22,790
Did you get her?

262
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:25,740
Well, I hurt my back

263
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:27,650
and she managed to escape.

264
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:30,210
You let Gu Yuan

265
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:31,780
get away once.

266
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:32,990
This is the second time.

267
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:34,150
You even hurt your back?

268
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:35,140
My goodness.

269
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:38,930
I kept searching the area
but to no avail.

270
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:41,110
When I went back to Ju Shui Pavilion,

271
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:43,670
I saw Her Highness leaving
in the Fu family's carriage

272
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:45,070
and decided to come back.

273
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:48,060
Xu Jia.

274
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:52,080
Send someone to keep tabs
on Ju Shui Pavilion.

Mr Ge.

276
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:54,980
Inform Guo Rui

277
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:57,030
and ask him to search for Gu Yuan

278
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:58,160
in the nearby areas,

279
00:22:58,350 --> 00:22:59,980
especially the inn.

280
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:02,460
-Yes.
-Yes.

281
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:04,820
Farmer Ju Shui.

282
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:06,780
Duke An.

283
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:10,790
Are these the people of Xuanhan

284
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:13,890
-that the Zhenbei General defeated?
-That's right.

285
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:16,860
I heard that the new king
of Xuanhan ascended the throne

286
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,510
after the Zhenbei General
recaptured Zhangyang City.

287
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:20,740
The new king wants to
establish friendly relations.

288
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:21,890
[Second Prince of Xuanhan, Wu Ta]

289
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:22,350
So he sent the second prince
of Xuanhan

290
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:24,420
to form a marriage alliance.

291
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:38,580
Xuanhan proposed a diplomatic marriage.

292
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:41,500
What do you think?

293
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:50,750
Your Majesty.

294
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:52,290
I think

295
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:55,540
Xuanhan has been casting covetous eyes
on Dayu

296
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:57,790
and tried to attack our border
several times.

297
00:23:57,790 --> 00:23:59,940
As long as Xuanhan is there,

298
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:02,540
there'll be no peace at our border.

299
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:05,100
Our great victory over Xuanhan

300
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:06,830
has boosted the army's morale.

301
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:08,220
We should ride the wave,

302
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:09,860
conquer Xuanhan,

303
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:12,660
and put an end to their terror
once and for all.

304
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:14,550
Your Majesty.

305
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:16,220
We can't do that.

306
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:18,140
Our army might have won

307
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:19,510
the battle in Zhangyang City.

308
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:22,970
But that was only due to the
Zhenbei General's brilliant ruse.

309
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:25,580
If both countries go to war,

310
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:27,580
our people will suffer

311
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:30,230
and our military resources
will be greatly depleted.

312
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:33,330
Besides, a war of attrition
would favour Xuanhan.

313
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:35,380
In the long-run,

314
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:39,100
it will be a great loss to Dayu.

315
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:42,500
Wouldn't a peaceful coexistence

316
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:44,660
be the best outcome?

317
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:47,110
Your Majesty.

318
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:48,380
I think

319
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:50,100
years of war at the border

320
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:51,710
has brought misery on the people.

321
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:53,250
As far as I know,

322
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:56,100
the new king of Xuanhan is young

323
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:57,500
and gentle by nature.

324
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:59,020
Also, he hates war.

325
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,450
This marriage alliance

326
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:03,500
can help promote peace.

327
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:06,980
Duke An is right.

328
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:10,300
The new king of Xuanhan
is sincere in seeking peace.

329
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:15,860
If we could maintain harmony
through the marriage alliance,

330
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:17,180
then

331
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:21,060
it would be a blessing for the people

332
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:23,580
and the border.

333
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:26,780
Your Majesty is wise.

334
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:27,870
But

335
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:34,460
there is no princess of the right age
in the palace.

336
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:37,810
Convey my decree.

337
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:43,580
The daughters of the dukes
and ministers of the right age

338
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:47,490
will be conferred the title of princess

339
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:50,240
if she is willing to marry
the king of Xuanhan.

340
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:14,780
Why am I here?

341
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:20,380
Is this Lotus Village?

342
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:24,460
You passed out on the street.

343
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:28,940
So I brought you here
and treated you.

344
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:32,300
Do you know who I am?

345
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:42,930
Ru Yi always talked about you.

346
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,500
She said Yuan is very obedient

347
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:47,530
and that she's a good girl.

348
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:51,350
Master.

349
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:55,660
I...

350
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:58,060
I have done Master wrong.

351
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:04,660
Will Master

352
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:09,540
be willing to see me at the Nether Bridge?

353
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:14,420
Come with me.

354
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:08,070
Master.

355
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:12,420
I have sinned.

356
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:15,860
One mistake leads to another.

357
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:19,260
What should I do?

358
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:26,660
Life is like

359
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:30,820
sailing in a sea of bitterness.

360
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:37,540
Repent and you shall be saved.

361
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:12,100
Greetings, Your Majesty.

362
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:14,270
Rise.

363
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:15,750
Thank you, Your Majesty.

364
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,300
I know

365
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:20,910
you're here to discuss
your brother's diplomatic marriage.

366
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:22,420
This marriage

367
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:23,910
is of great significance.

368
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:25,060
May we

369
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:27,100
not have any more disputes

370
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:28,790
and maintain peace forever.

371
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:32,030
This is exactly
what the king hopes for as well.

372
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:34,980
But I'll be honest.

373
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:37,950
My brother sent me here
for the diplomatic marriage

374
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:40,820
not only for diplomatic reasons

375
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:44,020
but because he heard
that General of Zhen's daughter,

376
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:46,220
Princess of Xihe, is a great beauty

377
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:47,770
with noble character.

378
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:50,220
The king hopes to marry her

379
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:53,280
so that she may bring Dayu's culture
over to Xuanhan.

380
00:29:55,870 --> 00:30:00,450
But General of Zhen
defeated Xuanhan several times.

381
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:02,700
His daughter...

382
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:05,170
It's exactly because of that.

383
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:08,270
If the king marries
General of Zhen's only daughter,

384
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:10,820
doesn't that prove that
the past is behind us

385
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:13,770
and we can form a good relationship?

386
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:19,990
Cui Wan.

387
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:23,500
What do you think?

388
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:27,190
Your Majesty.

389
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:30,020
Is there any room for negotiation?

390
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:33,100
The new king of Xuanhan

391
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:35,260
seems completely taken with you.

392
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:37,420
I heard from his brother

393
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:40,020
that he wants to marry no one but you.

394
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:42,710
But I've never met him before.

395
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:44,570
Why does he insist on marrying me?

396
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:46,420
I never thought

397
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:49,220
that your fame has spread so far and wide.

398
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:51,980
Cui Wan.

399
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:54,420
If you're not willing to,

400
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:57,100
I can think of some other ways.

401
00:30:57,910 --> 00:30:59,020
What other ways?

402
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:02,800
If we can't reach an agreement,

403
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:05,070
we'll have to go to war with them.

404
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:11,440
Your Majesty.

405
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:14,760
Can you give me two days to consider it?

406
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,900
Sure. It's a huge matter.

407
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:19,900
You should think it through.

408
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:27,900
Eunuch Wang will send the portrait

409
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:29,750
of the new king of Xuanhan to your place.

410
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:31,080
You can take a look at it.

411
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:33,830
Thank you, Your Majesty.

412
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:56,510
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

413
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:58,500
Hurry. Get her down.

414
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:02,220
-Your Highness.
-Cui Wan.

415
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:03,900
Silly girl.

416
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:05,700
What are you doing?

417
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:07,060
Your Highness.

418
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:08,580
Please help me.

419
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:10,870
I don't want to be married off
to Xuanhan.

420
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:13,180
But I don't know what I should do.

421
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:16,890
Cui Wan, a diplomatic marriage
is a major political event.

422
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:18,580
My hands are tied too.

423
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:19,990
So I'm here today

424
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:22,660
to find out what you have in mind.

425
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:24,670
If you don't want to get married,

426
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:26,130
-then...
-Your Highness.

427
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:28,980
I don't want to be reviled
for generations.

428
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:32,220
You're exaggerating.

429
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:33,490
But I don't know why

430
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:36,210
the new king of Xuanhan
insists on marrying you.

431
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:38,740
Nevertheless,

432
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:40,860
you shouldn't do silly things.

433
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:42,260
Your Highness.

434
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:44,660
Laugh at me if you must.

435
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:45,980
The truth is,

436
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:48,730
neither being married off to Xuanhan

437
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:50,420
nor taking my own life

438
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:54,180
compares to the pain of parting

439
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:56,220
with Duke Su.

440
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:58,540
If I go to Xuanhan,

441
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:01,570
I may never see him again.

442
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:05,340
I want to see His Highness.

443
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:08,580
-Please help me.
-Rise.

444
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:12,440
All right.

445
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:13,780
I promise you.

446
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:15,460
Your Highness.

447
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:17,650
Don't cry anymore.

448
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:27,530
Your Highness. Zhi Hui.

449
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:30,020
Her Highness said

450
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:31,900
since Duke Su is here,

451
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:34,500
the Princess can pour her heart out.

452
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:36,470
Yes.

453
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:41,630
Your Highness, this way.

454
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:14,520
My mother said you wanted to see me.

455
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:20,300
Cui Wan.

456
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:26,900
Your Highness!

457
00:34:34,179 --> 00:34:36,460
Your Highness, let go of me!

458
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:37,810
Your Highness!

459
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:39,620
Let go of me!

460
00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:41,060
Your Highness!

461
00:34:41,389 --> 00:34:43,100
Let go of me!

462
00:34:43,949 --> 00:34:46,500
Your Highness, let go of me.

463
00:34:47,139 --> 00:34:48,250
Your Highness!

464
00:34:48,429 --> 00:34:50,659
I don't want to marry
the king of Xuanhan.

465
00:34:50,659 --> 00:34:51,900
I don't want to.

466
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:56,429
If you don't want to be married off
to Xuanhan,

467
00:34:56,429 --> 00:34:57,960
you can appeal to my father.

468
00:34:58,030 --> 00:34:59,540
But I can't.

469
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:00,780
His Majesty said

470
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:02,220
if this happens,

471
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:03,780
they'll have to go to war.

472
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:05,940
I'll become a villain.

473
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:09,090
Dayu and Xuanhan
have always been at war.

474
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:11,470
How does that make you a villain?

475
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:13,810
If you won't talk to my father,

476
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:15,300
I will.

477
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:18,100
Your Highness.

478
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:20,650
I knew it.

479
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:25,020
-Are you willing to marry me?
-No.

480
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:28,260
What's the point then?

481
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:29,740
If I can't marry you,

482
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:31,350
does it matter
if I marry a bandit,

483
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:32,500
the king of Xuanhan,

484
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:34,860
or an 80-year-old man?

485
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:36,180
Cui Wan.

486
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:38,150
No matter what you do,

487
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:39,860
I'll support you.

488
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:42,420
But I can't marry you.

489
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:45,040
I'm sorry.

490
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:46,820
In my entire life,

491
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:49,830
there's only one woman that I'll marry.

492
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,500
Your Highness!

493
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:54,140
Your Highness!

494
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:57,100
Even if you want to leave,

495
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:59,930
you should at least untie me first.

496
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:09,340
Don't go!

497
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:14,780
Don't leave me alone!

498
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:17,420
Your Highness!

499
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:21,580
Your Highness, don't leave me alone.

500
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:26,050
Your Highness, what happened to you?

501
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:27,740
How do I remove this?

502
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:31,780
His Highness doesn't want me.

503
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:35,340
Nobody wants me.

504
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:38,830
-Nobody wants me.
-Don't cry, Your Highness.

505
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:40,300
How do I remove this?

506
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:50,360
Remember how proud the
Princess Consort of Qingping was

507
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:52,670
when she rode Consort Duan's coattails?

508
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:55,340
Now that Consort Duan has lost her power,

509
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:56,990
the Princess Consort of Qingping

510
00:36:56,990 --> 00:36:59,940
has become the Poor Princess.

511
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:03,660
A pheasant will always be a pheasant.

512
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:06,860
Even if you fly up high,
it doesn't make you a phoenix.

513
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:08,260
Indeed.

514
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:10,060
Who's crowing?

515
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:12,900
Greetings, Princess of Xihe.

516
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:16,310
-Why did no one announce my arrival?
-Your Highness.

517
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:17,580
Yes.

518
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:18,930
Be gone.

519
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:28,710
Qi Zhu.

520
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:31,390
Aren't you thankful
that I stood up for you?

521
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:32,450
No need to thank me.

522
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:34,110
Just help me come up with an idea.

523
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:35,110
You're so crafty.

524
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:36,850
You'll figure out something.

525
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:39,580
I'm a princess only in name.

526
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:41,270
I have no power or authority.

527
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:43,820
I can't help you.

528
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:47,940
Fine.

529
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:49,950
You're not going to help me?

530
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:52,470
It's not that I'm unwilling,

531
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:53,980
I'm just powerless.

532
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:57,380
A pretty girl like you

533
00:37:57,630 --> 00:38:00,070
shouldn't let that old lady
give you a hard time

534
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:01,800
and be forced to do the laundry.

535
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:05,660
Why don't you come to Xuanhan with me?

536
00:38:05,830 --> 00:38:07,390
One day, our names
will go down in history.

537
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:09,590
Both of us will be credited for the deed.

538
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:11,180
Get yourself ready.

539
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:28,110
Your Majesty, the Princess of Xihe
would like to seek an audience.

540
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:29,860
-Send her in.
-Yes.

541
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:35,980
Princess of Xihe,
present yourself before His Majesty.

542
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:46,470
Greetings, Your Majesty.

543
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:47,480
Cui Wan.

544
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:49,020
Rise.

545
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:50,370
Your Majesty.

546
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:52,540
I've made up my mind.

547
00:38:55,430 --> 00:38:57,560
I'll accept the diplomatic marriage.

548
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:01,860
Are you certain?

549
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:05,940
I'm not of royal blood.

550
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:08,230
It was through your goodwill

551
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:10,290
that I've been made a princess

552
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:11,580
from a very young age.

553
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:13,020
Now,

554
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:16,330
it's time for me to pay my dues.

555
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:20,730
I'm glad you feel this way.

556
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:23,540
Sorry it had to be like this.

557
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:27,780
It's the least I can do to foster peace

558
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:29,570
between Dayu and Xuanhan.

559
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:31,340
I have no regrets.

560
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:33,110
However,

561
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:35,220
I do have two wishes.

562
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:37,400
I hope you can fulfill them.

563
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:39,770
Ask away.

564
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:44,830
The Princess Consort of Qingping and I
have always been close.

565
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:46,100
Xuanhan is far away.

566
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:49,390
I wish to take the Princess Consort
of Qingping with me

567
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:50,620
as a companion

568
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:53,300
to ease the pain of leaving my homeland.

569
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:55,170
That won't be an issue.

570
00:39:57,550 --> 00:40:00,570
I hope Duke Su will be put in charge

571
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:03,540
of the wedding procession.

572
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:05,550
He often fights in the borderland.

573
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:07,940
He should be familiar
with the roads there.

574
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:09,500
If Duke Su is put in charge,

575
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:11,630
it'll give me a peace of mind.

576
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:15,460
Your request is reasonable.

577
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:16,900
I agree.

578
00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:20,870
Thank you, Your Majesty.

579
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:29,470
Cui Wan.

580
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:32,850
Tomorrow, I shall confer you
the title of princess.

581
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:34,680
It's going to be a long journey.

582
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:38,660
Xuanhan is nowhere near
as hospitable as the palace.

583
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:41,420
You need to be mentally prepared.

584
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,940
If you need anything,

585
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:46,340
do let me know.

586
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:48,540
I'll surely oblige.

587
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:52,630
Thank you, Your Majesty.

588
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:08,990
Your Highness,
you shouldn't drink anymore.

589
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:10,220
How dare you?

590
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:12,740
You're in no position to control me!

591
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:14,270
You've had enough drinks.

592
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:15,540
You should stop.

593
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:18,540
Servants! Let Su Yu serve
Consort Shu instead.

594
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:19,780
She's an eyesore.

595
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:21,590
Sorry, Your Highness. Please, no.

596
00:41:21,590 --> 00:41:23,550
I'm sorry, Your Highness.

597
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:24,940
Don't disown me.

598
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:26,500
I may be going to Xuanhan,

599
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:28,430
but you have no right to disrespect me.

600
00:41:28,430 --> 00:41:30,270
Your Highness!

601
00:41:30,350 --> 00:41:31,940
I'm sorry!

602
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:36,780
Su Yu.

603
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:40,220
Although you're just a maid,

604
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:43,340
you have served me diligently

605
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:45,060
and faithfully.

606
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:47,020
And now,

607
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:50,100
I'll be married off to Xuanhan.

608
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:55,770
I may never get a chance
to come back again.

609
00:41:58,870 --> 00:42:00,020
My dear Su Yu.

610
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:03,380
Just stay by Consort Shu's side.

611
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:07,910
[Amiable as a sunny sky,
noble as an autumn moon]

612
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:09,850
This is a fine place.

613
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:11,780
If you like it,

614
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:13,900
I can give you the building plan.

615
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:15,590
You can build one in Xuanhan.

616
00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:16,660
Take a seat.

617
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:21,380
It's fine.

618
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:24,180
I'll be going back to Xuanhan
in two days.

619
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:27,180
I wonder

620
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:29,360
why Duke An asked to see me.

621
00:42:29,870 --> 00:42:33,700
I heard you weren't in a great mood

622
00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:36,700
and flew into a rage
at the courier station.

623
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:38,620
You had someone spy on me?

624
00:42:40,110 --> 00:42:41,210
What do you want?

625
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:43,160
If I had an ulterior motive,

626
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:44,850
I wouldn't have told you that.

627
00:42:45,790 --> 00:42:47,340
But I also heard

628
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:49,420
that the king is a diligent man

629
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:51,970
who is not interested in relationships.

630
00:42:52,790 --> 00:42:56,700
Why would he insist on marrying
the Princess of Xihe?

631
00:42:56,790 --> 00:42:58,980
How did you manage to find out

632
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:01,840
about the situation in Xuanhan's palace?

633
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:05,140
Even in his days as a prince,

634
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:07,480
the king was quite a celebrity.

635
00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:09,120
There's no need to find out.

636
00:43:10,470 --> 00:43:12,820
It's all just a facade.

637
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:17,620
Second Prince.

638
00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:21,020
You bought off the ministers
with vast sums of money

639
00:43:21,110 --> 00:43:23,510
and made them oppose
the marriage alliance.

640
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:25,100
Then you made up the story

641
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:29,000
of the king insisting on marrying the
Princess Consort of Xihe.

642
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:31,110
You have put painstaking effort into it.

643
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:32,220
But what a shame.

644
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:35,060
Things didn't go your way.

645
00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:39,900
I wonder what your motive is.

646
00:43:41,230 --> 00:43:42,380
Second Prince.

647
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:44,900
Actually,

648
00:43:45,630 --> 00:43:47,220
you and I are the same.

649
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:50,150
We're against the marriage alliance.

650
00:43:51,990 --> 00:43:53,420
But I heard

651
00:43:53,830 --> 00:43:55,980
it was your advice

652
00:43:56,310 --> 00:43:59,660
that made Emperor Jia He
agree to the marriage alliance.

653
00:44:00,590 --> 00:44:02,260
I have my own reasons.

654
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:04,530
The marriage alliance is a done deal.

655
00:44:05,910 --> 00:44:06,950
But

656
00:44:07,030 --> 00:44:09,500
things might bode ill

657
00:44:09,590 --> 00:44:11,980
for the wedding procession.

658
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:14,180
You want Duke Su dead?

659
00:44:14,790 --> 00:44:15,800
Why?

660
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:18,900
Aren't you his uncle?

661
00:44:19,350 --> 00:44:22,500
And aren't you his brother?

662
00:44:26,990 --> 00:44:30,180
What exactly is your plan?
