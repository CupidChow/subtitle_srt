00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,350
Take off my mask.

5
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,000
No, I won't.

6
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,870
Don't worry, although I am disobedient,

7
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:52,150
I still know that I shouldn't do that.

8
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:53,690
-So, I...
-You're afraid.

9
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,310
Sir,

10
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,890
I'm afraid of nothing in the world.

11
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,420
If you don't turn your face away, I'll...

Nong Nong.

13
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,980
Nong Nong.

14
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,329
Little follower!

15
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:36,579
It's you!

16
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,440
It's me.

17
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:44,680
No wonder you could skip stones so well.

18
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:46,300
You tricked me.

19
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:49,510
Go arrange the books.

20
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:51,270
You've been ordering me around.

21
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:53,600
Nong Nong, I wanted to tell you earlier,

22
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:56,420
but I couldn't.

23
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:58,740
Fooled you!

24
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,780
You fooled me.  So, I fooled you.

25
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,530
You're not angry?

26
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:05,400
I don't get angry that easily.

27
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,070
Moreover,

28
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,950
if I tell others that...

29
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,870
Mr Ju Shui was my little follower,

30
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:12,440
people would envy me.

31
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:15,250
However, maybe no one will believe me.

32
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:16,750
Nong Nong,

33
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,600
I was your little follower,

34
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,990
and will continue to be in the future.

35
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:22,990
The gates of the Ju Shui Pavilion...

36
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,400
will always stay open for you.

37
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:26,870
Promise?

[Fu Residence]

39
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,800
I went to Ju Shui Pavilion everyday,

40
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,260
but I didn't see my master.

41
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,460
I miss him.

42
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,220
Isn't Little Marquis coming to apologise?

43
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,540
Where is he?

44
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:56,930
Will he stand me up?

45
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,430
Young ladies,

46
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,580
Ms Gu is here.

47
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,650
Young Lady Fu Rong,

48
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:05,190
Young Lady Fu Rong.

49
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,020
What's wrong?

50
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,450
Please save our boss.

51
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,200
She is in the imperial storehouse jail.

52
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:18,170
Since the imprisonment of the boss,

53
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:20,420
we've had no business.

54
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,140
I had to send everyone home first.

55
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,990
Until now,

56
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,800
I still haven't seen the boss.

57
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:29,950
These are all ordinary jewellery pieces.

58
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,080
The storehouse arrested her...

59
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,610
for offending Consort Shu?

60
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:39,420
They could use any excuse for doing that.

61
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,480
It involves the Imperial
Wardrobe Service...

62
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,610
that sometimes hires stores
outside to make jewellery.

63
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,909
Consort Duan is Little Marquis's aunt.

64
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:53,080
So, Feng Lai Yi always got the job.

65
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:57,070
But this time,
the Wardrobe Service hired us.

66
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,620
Why did master agree?

67
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,000
She was afraid Feng Lai Yi
would retaliate.

68
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,060
She wanted to have good ties with
the Wardrobe Service.

69
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:08,300
So, she agreed to make a head ornament
for Consort Shu,

70
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:12,680
but knowing that you don't want
any contact with the palace,

71
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:16,360
she told me specifically not to tell you.

72
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,280
Was Consort Shu dissatisfied with
such fine work?

73
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,750
Ornaments Attendant Chen
of the department...

74
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:26,070
said flowers bloom in spring-summer time,

75
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:28,070
but the peony is the king of flowers.

76
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:29,590
Such good symbolism...

77
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:31,340
is not an insult to the consort.

78
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:33,590
I don't understand.

79
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,280
I was wondering why she took so long
to repair a bracelet.

80
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,640
She did the peony head ornament
a few days ago,

81
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,640
and wanted to repair the bracelet
as soon as possible.

82
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,530
This was so sudden.

83
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:53,670
In the past Feng Lai Yi got the job,

84
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,720
now Ruyi Pavilion got it. Why?

85
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:57,310
Excluding Ji Qing Ting,

86
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,470
many people in Feng Lai Yi were dismissed
by Little Marquis.

87
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:02,850
Maybe it is understaffed.

88
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,940
Sister, what do you mean?

89
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,300
I think this is too much of a coincidence.

90
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,160
After the issue of Feng Lai Yi's
plagiarism died down,

91
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,020
this major incident happened to the
Ruyi Pavilion.

92
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,640
This is indeed strange.

93
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:17,710
Let me ask Xiao Qi and Xiao Ba.

94
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,560
The Xindu household is a related
to the emperor.

95
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:22,470
Maybe Zhang Yan can help.

96
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,450
The Xindu household...

97
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,220

100
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,220
Ms Fu.

101
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:37,290
Why are you here?

102
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,760
Do you want me to offer a humble apology?

103
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,760
Don't worry. Just wait.

104
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,620
I dare not ask you for an apology.

105
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,930
I just want to ask...

106
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:55,340
It seems that Feng Lai Yi's business
is still good.

107
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,100
Of course.

108
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:59,560
Although that was an ugly incident,

109
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,720
I handled it decisively.

110
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:04,540
I changed all the staff other than
Ji Qing Ting.

111
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,030
The new jewellery is on sale again.

112
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,530
How could business be bad?

113
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:10,430
Since your business is so good,

114
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,440
do you have enough manpower?

115
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:17,870
Ms Fu , why are you concerned
about Feng Lai Yi?

116
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,080
If we are short staffed,

117
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:22,280
would you help us?

118
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:24,760
I'd like to ask you to help
with the drawing.

119
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,670
If there is enough staff,

120
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:30,680
why did the Wardrobe Service ask
Ruyi Pavilion to make jewellery?

121
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,370
When did that happen?

122
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:34,370
The Wardrobe Service asked you all?

123
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,440
Ms Liu made the jewellery.

124
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,800
Consort Shu didn't like it.

125
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,800
So Liu was jailed in the storehouse.

126
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:45,720
Young Master, you are well informed.

127
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,130
Why play dumb?

128
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:51,350
Did you come to Feng Lai Yi to condemn me?

129
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,320
Did you think that...

130
00:07:53,409 --> 00:07:56,320
I acted with Consort Duan to entrap
Ruyi Pavilion?

131
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:00,830
Okay.

132
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,810
I have nothing to say if you think so.

133
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:05,120
I'll just say this, it has nothing
to do with me.

134
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,980
I won't do such an improper thing,

135
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,080
believe it or not.

136
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:17,880
Young Master,

137
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:22,590
who irritated you?

138
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:23,910
You're frowning.

139
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,440
Stop being a glib talker!

140
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,420
Tell me,

141
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:29,110
why didn't the Wardrobe Service
hire Feng Lai Yi?

142
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:30,030
Well,

143
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,539
the department usually contacts us,

144
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:34,250
we don't contact them.

145
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:35,840
Why didn't it hire us?

146
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:37,289
How would I know.

147
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:46,880
What?

148
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,290
Because of the jewellery store owner,
you want Consort Duan...

149
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:52,070
to ask a favour from Mr Dong?

150
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,490
This is not asking a favour.

151
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:58,530
Consort Duan can give the order,

152
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:00,510
and Dong Fang Li will release her.

153
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,520
Yan'er,

154
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:04,830
how is it that Young Lady Fu Rong...

155
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:06,640
can make you so stupid?

156
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,200
Consort Duan is the younger sister
of the marquis' late wife.

157
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:11,920
She is not my own sister.

158
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:15,130
Besides, it was Consort Shu who was
offended this time.

159
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:17,860
Consort Shu hates the peony.

160
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:19,920
Mr Dong is her elder brother.

161
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:22,430
He will make people pay for it.

162
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:25,470
Fu Rong is up to no good.

163
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:28,490
She wants to drag our family
into the mire.

164
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,320
Mother, you misunderstood.

165
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:31,810
You misunderstood Rong.

166
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:33,550
She is not that kind of person.

167
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,050
Yan'er,

168
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:36,910
think harder.

169
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:39,360
Mother, it's because...

why do you have time to come to
the palace today?

187
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,330
Did you do something wrong?

188
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:26,580
Aunt, of course not.

189
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:29,570
What wrong can I do when I am
in the Imperial Guards?

190
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,030
However,

191
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,770
I don't understand one thing.

192
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,490
Why didn't the department
hire Feng Lai Yi...

193
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:43,000
instead of Ruyi Pavilion?

194
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:47,130
So, it was about this matter.

195
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:48,670
Not only that,

196
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:51,730
what did Ruyi Pavilion do to offend you...

197
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,700

Don't you know?

I thought you knew a few days ago that...

202

the two shops had a dispute,

203

why would I do this?

206
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:13,770
The jewellery is for Consort Shu.

207
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:16,730
I rarely see her.

208
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:18,720
Maybe Consort Shu...

209

specifically didn't want Feng Lai Yi.

210

to forgive Ms Liu?

215
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,610
I have already told you.

If I talk to her about this,

218
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:49,520
it would only backfire.

I can't say for sure.

the third prince can complain
to the emperor,

and Consort Shu and Duke Su...

281

Has Mr Dong given no heed to

304

This matter seems trivial,

305

306

00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,690
Do you have any evidence to submit?

340
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:16,270
No, I don't.

341
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,130
It was the first time Ruyi Pavilion
did this work.

342
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,490
It crafted carefully and did its best,

343
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,360
but acted improperly and violated a taboo.

344
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,350
Ignorance can be forgiven, Mr Dong.

345
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:28,280
To determine if Liu Ru Yi is guilty,

346
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,470
I will investigate carefully,

347
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,120
and make a decision.

348
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,760
If everyone is like you,

349
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:36,380
talking without evidence,

350
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:38,110
but asks for pardon,

351
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,440
Dayu's laws would be for nought.

352
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,390
A mistake was made.

353
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:45,330
What we can do now is...

354
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,340
not to investigate her mistake,

355
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:49,590
but let her make up for it.

356
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:51,350
Do you dismiss this as a trifle?

357
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:52,580
Mr Dong...

358
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:26,980
[Dong Residence]

359
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:31,300
Miss.

360
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,370
You should leave.

361
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:35,920
Mr Dong is not available today.

362
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:38,810
Don't waste your energy and
torture yourself.

363
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:37,000
You're awake.

364
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:39,680
Where am I?

365
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:41,260
Mr Dong's residence.

366
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:43,260
This is the Dong Residence.

367
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,730
Your Highness,

368
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,100
why are you here?

369
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:50,990
Mr Dong is his uncle.

370
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:52,780
Why can't His Highness be here?

371
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:54,310
You blocked the palanquin,

372
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:55,730
and knelt all night long.

373
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:57,500
What sheer nonsense!

374
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,870
Do you want to see Mr Dong?

375
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,980
May I?

376
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,260
No, you may not.

377
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:10,390
My master is not a careless person.

378
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,980
Had she known that Consort Shu
dislike peonies,

379
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,190
she would never have submitted
a peony ornament.

380
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,550
Someone tricked her.

381
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:18,580
If I do nothing,

382
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:21,260
I would just watch my master get framed.

383
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,380
I must see Mr Dong.

384
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,670
Even if you see him,

385
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:28,320
you can't change anything.

386
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,940
Don't underestimate me.

387
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:32,760
If you want to help your master,

388
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,250
go home first.

389
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,800
-Xu Jia.
-Your Highness.

390
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,610
-Send Ms Fu back.
-Yes.

391
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,930
Why?

392
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,480
Ms Fu, His Highness meant well.

393
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,890
Please leave with me.

394
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,650
I brought a toy for Wen'er.

395
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,590
I hope he likes it.

396
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:55,800
He has chest discomforts today.

397
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:57,690
He is resting now.

398
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,120
For years,

399
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:04,600
I've been searching for the two herbs
at the border.

400
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:06,980
Unfortunately,

401
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:09,310
most people have never heard of them.

402
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,300
Leave it to fate.

403
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:14,320
Be patient.

404
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:16,040
Wen'er is smart and cute.

405
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:17,930
He will be fine.

406
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,600
Let's not talk about Wen'er.

407
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,360
Have you come...

408
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,420
because of that Ms Fu?

409
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:32,800
She looks weak.

410
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:37,270
I was afraid she would faint at the gate
of the Dong Residence.

411
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,570
I was afraid...

412
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,560
you would be implicated, uncle.

413
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:45,560
I am Dong Fang Li.

414
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:48,160
I am upright and just.

415
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,340
Had she died kneeling in front of my gate,

416
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,130
I won't be implicated.

417
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:54,940
However,

418
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:57,180
don't you know that woman?

419
00:22:57,490 --> 00:22:58,630
Truth be told,

420
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:02,200
she saved my life,

421
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:05,580
but I've paid the debt of gratitude.

422
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,340
Uncle, don't worry about me.

423
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:11,290
Handle the matter impartially.

424
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,120
She saved your life, but...

425
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:16,230
her master offended the consort.

426
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:17,600
That is another thing.

427
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:21,590
Liu Ru Yi sent the peony head ornament
to your mother.

428
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:23,490
She violated a taboo.

429
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:25,970
Honestly,

430
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:30,180
I don't know why my mother hates peonies.

431
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,200
It is natural that she didn't tell you.

432
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,100
Speaking of which,

433
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,260
this matter has something to do with you.

434
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:42,540
Jin'er,

435
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,270
I will be your mother from now on.

436
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,820
-Jin'er.
-Your Highness.

437
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,700
Jin'er...

438
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:51,700
-Mother.
-Imperial Concubine Shu likes peonies?

439
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:51,560
[Dayu's Empress]

440
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:55,240
Yes, Your Majesty.

441
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:57,330
The world doesn't need...

442
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:59,820
people who think too highly of themselves.

443
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:02,480
Weeds and wildflowers...

444
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:05,420
hope in vain of becoming
the king of flowers.

445
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:08,060
How pathetic.

446
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:15,310
You can't even protect your loved ones.

447
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,060
Don't indulge in wishful thinking.

448
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:20,780
Your Highness!

449
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,290
Your Majesty,

450
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,180
Jin'er's feet are cold.

451
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:31,010
Please take care of him.

452
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:49,230
Although your mother is now Consort Shu,

453
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:53,340
that incident hurt her a lot.

454
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:54,920
Since then,

455
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:57,890
she doesn't want anything
that involves peonies.

456
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:02,060
No wonder my mother never mentioned this,

457
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:06,760
and it is a closely guarded secret
in Guang Yang Palace.

458
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,830
This is a hurtful event for her.

459
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:12,790
It's best to forget.

460
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:15,910
Liu Ru Yi brought back the bad memory...

461
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:17,420
that was painful to her.

462
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:19,340
How can I be merciful?

463
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:21,680
In the next two days,

464
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:23,080
I'll visit my mother.

465
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:25,770
Even with her capability as the owner,

466
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,180
Liu Ru Yi had violated this taboo.

467
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:30,080
It's really strange.

468
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:32,460
I really can't decide.

469
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:35,980
I must have missed something.

470
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:39,850
Even if that is so,

471
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:42,490
the event already happened.

472
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:48,250
It's better to let Ruyi Pavilion
make up for it,

473
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:50,630
and make mother happy.

474
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:52,770
It would make everyone happy.

475
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:54,460
So be it.

476
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:58,860
Her female apprentice is sincere.

477
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:01,850
Let her try,

478
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:03,560
but...

479
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:05,370
time is running out.

480
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:08,650
-Thank you, uncle.
-Master,

481
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:09,990
Little Marquis is here.

482
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:15,660
Ask him to come in.

483
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:24,770
Your Highness!

484
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,540
Mr Dong, Your Highness.

485
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:31,000
The case of the Ruyi Pavilion owner
is strange.

486
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,560
There are mostly women in there.

487
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,020
Everyone knows her place.

488
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:37,210
The violation is something
they wouldn't dare commit.

489
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:43,440
Mr Dong,

490
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:46,020
it's presumptuous for me
to say this suddenly.

491
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:48,420
-but...
-Since you have time to intercede,

492
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:50,750
why not send a message from me?

493
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:12,040
I'm here to see Young Lady Fu Rong.

494
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,560
You only said you wanted to see Ms Fu.

495
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:16,960
I thought...

496
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,870
Rong'er had insomnia last night.

497
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:29,060
She is asleep now.

498
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:32,220
If you have anything to say,
you can tell me.

499
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:35,040
Okay.

500
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:37,420
Someone asked me to send a message to her.

501
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:38,950
Instead of running around,

502
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:41,020
she should think of an idea.

503
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:43,050
Make jewellery to please Consort Shu.

504
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:44,780
That might resolve the crisis.

505
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:50,130
Who told you that?

506
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:51,720
Will it work?

507
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:54,050
I can't tell you.

508
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:58,400
But Ms Fu, you're so smart,

509
00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:00,220
you should be able to guess who.

510
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,070
What?

511
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,400
Do you doubt me?

512
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:11,110
Scared it's a fake message?

513
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:13,440
I didn't say that.

514
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:18,030
Think what you want.

515
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,260
You will understand...

516
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:21,500
what misjudging a gentleman means.

517
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:43,190
Is something on your mind?

518
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:47,350
You can tell me.

519
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:50,780
Today...

520
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:52,920
is my mother's death anniversary.

521
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:58,110
I see,

522
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:00,640
I've forgotten that.

523
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:03,980
I shouldn't have asked you
to come to the palace...

524
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,180
to play chess with me.

525
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:08,240
Today,

526
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:11,150
staying home makes me even more uneasy.

527
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:18,810
You don't like me mentioning my mother.

528
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:22,200
Did I spoil your fun?

529
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:28,270
It's not that I don't like you mentioning
Queen Dowager Wen.

530
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:31,660
I'm just afraid you'll miss her too much,

531
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:33,020
and feel depressed.

532
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:35,240
Forget it.

533
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:37,600
If you don't have the mood to play chess,

534
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:39,530
just take a stroll,

535
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:40,810
and relax yourself.

536
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,930
I'm here to see someone.

537
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,410
Mr Ju Shui.

538
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:16,230
-You know me?
-Who doesn't know you?

539
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:19,480
Whenever I was free, I would attend the
Yue Dan Commentary.

540
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,540
Your collected works and reviews...

541
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:23,400
have been read repeatedly by me.

542
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,810
In the next Yue Dan Commentary,

543
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,940
I will send you an invitation,

544
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:30,400
to thank you for being a fan.

545
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:32,830
Is Young Lady Fu Rong in?

546
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:33,960
Please come with me.

547
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,170
Miss Rong,

548
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:54,470
you have a visitor.

549
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:55,650
Who is it?

550
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:58,690
Little...

551
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,580
Mr Ju Shui.

552
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:03,880
Yuan, please bring us some snacks.

553
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:09,250
Ms Fu, long time no see.

554
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,850
Yuan likes you very much.

555
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:12,240
When she returns, talk to her.

556
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,700
It'll make her very happy.

557
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:17,550
I heard you are making new jewellery for
Consort Shu.

558
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,240
How is it?

559
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,740
My master used to give me tips.

560
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,680
This is the first time I'm
making it alone,

561
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:30,720
and this concerns my master's life.

562
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:34,040
How did you know?

563
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:36,660
Of course I know.

564
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:40,200
I also know that...

565
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,280
flowers are the theme this time.

566
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:44,710
Instead of racking your brain in here,

567
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:46,470
why not look at these flowers?

568
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:48,410
Why are there plum blossoms?

569
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:52,230
I asked people to pick the plum blossoms
from Tianlang Mountain.

570
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:55,470
I wanted to decorate my pavilion
with them,

571
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:59,060
but I thought they might help you.

572
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:01,170
So, I gave them to you.

573
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:04,240
[My sister said that a mysterious person
helped her.]

574
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,580
[So, my little follower was that person.]

575
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:09,120
I don't know how to thank you.

576
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:13,050
If you really want to thank me,

577
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,900
don't frown,

578
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:16,790
and smile more,

579
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,380
lest I worry.

580
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:19,560
Got it.

581
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,800
Nong Nong,

582
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,320
your candle stand...

583
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,720
is too close to the paper.

584
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:32,450
Put a lamp shade on it,

585
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:34,920
-or you'll knock it over.
-I'm not Duke Su.

586
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:42,840
Why do you mention him?

587
00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:44,160
Could it be...

588
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:46,420
that he knocked a candle stand over?

589
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:48,780
I was just talking casually.

590
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:50,320
Nong Nong,

591
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:53,750
is there really nothing between you
and Duke Su?

592
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:55,420
Don't talk nonsense.

593
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:58,100
He mentioned to me before that...

594
00:33:58,190 --> 00:34:00,310
he knocked over a candle
at Hong Fu Temple,

595
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:01,800
and caused a fire.

596
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:04,250
Hong Fu Temple.

597
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:07,220
Could it be the Hong Fu Temple
in Jichang City?

598
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:09,370
You know it too.

599
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:14,380
Of course I know.

600
00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:17,020
I'm just surprised...

601
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:21,030
that he told you he stayed...

602
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,800
in Hong Fu Temple.

603
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:45,920
Excuse me, sir.

604
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:47,409
I didn't do it on purpose.

605
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:49,230
No problem,

606
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,260
as long as you keep this a secret.

607
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:53,020
Sir, don't worry.

608
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:54,960
Thank you, Ms Yuan.

609
00:34:59,970 --> 00:35:01,860
-Mr Ju Shui.
-Here he comes.

610
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:03,310
Mr Ju Shui.

611
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:04,680
Mr Ju Shui.

612
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,860
Mr Ju Shui.

613
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:10,000
-Mr Ju Shui.
-Here he comes.

614
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:11,870
-Mr Ju Shui.
-Mr Ju Shui.

615
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:14,090
-Mr Ju Shui.
-Mr Ju Shui.

616
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:18,490
Mr Ju Shui.

617
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:21,000
Mr Ju shui.

618
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:27,100
[Ju Shui Pavilion]

619
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:34,120
After my father the emperor died,

620
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,620
my mother, who was born with anisocoria,

621
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:38,070
felt left out.

622
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:40,930
When a natural disaster struck,

623
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,880
everyone said...

624
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:45,990
my mother's anisocoria brought bad luck.

625
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:50,660
My mother had to retreat
to Hong Fu Temple.

626
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:53,080
Because of this,

627
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:56,200
I was separated from my mother
since young.

628
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:59,370
However, the court was unforgiving.

629
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:03,500
Some said that she was a witch.

630
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,750
If she lived,

631
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,270
natural disasters would come.

632
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:13,100
Do you know...

633
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,690
the real cause of her death?

634
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,110
I heard.

635
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:21,900
I heard that Hong Fu Temple
fell into disrepair,

636
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,170
and was always dry.

637
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,760
Ten years ago,

638
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:26,430
a fire...

639
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:29,240
took the life of Queen Dowager Wen.

640
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:32,620
My brother told me the same,

641
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:37,280
but today Fu Rong told me that
Xu Jin did it.

642
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:40,600
Xu Jin knocked over a candle stand,

643
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,080
and caused a fire in Hong Fu Temple.

644
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:48,270
Did it happen ten years ago?

645
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:51,290
I want to know the real cause
of her death.

646
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,120
I wonder if you have...

647
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,770
heard of an organisation among itinerant
entertainers...

648
00:36:57,770 --> 00:36:59,120
called Ruyi Pavilion?

649
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:02,360
The Ruyi Pavilion is extremely mysterious.

650
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:03,690
Legend has it that...

651
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:05,100
as long as you can give...

652
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,000
something of equal value,

653
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,680
it will give you the secret you want.

654
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:12,120
It is said that this organization...

655
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,330
knows everything.

656
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:15,710
Ruyi Pavilion.

657
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,500
Does it know what happened ten years ago?

658
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:23,750
Does it know the real cause
of my mother's death?

659
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,490
Does it know who was there at the time?

660
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:31,240
I will do my best.

661
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:51,140
Miss,

662
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:53,500
I've never seen a prettier
dangling ornament.

663
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,750
It is so pretty.

664
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:57,570
The flowers looks real.

665
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:06,520
A low branch touches the collar.

666
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,380
The jade swings amid small steps.

667
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:11,120
Rong'er, this is really lifelike.

668
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:13,140
Miss Rong,

669
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:15,350
we've really made a dangling
flower ornament.

670
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:17,880
Consort Shu will be very happy
when she knows.

671
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,460
The boss will be saved.

672
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:22,690
They look like flowers,

673
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:24,850
but they are not.

674
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,180
What do you mean?

675
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:31,250
They have no floral scent,

676
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:33,600
They are not real.

677
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:36,200
It's not easy to make them.

678
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:38,040
How can there be fragrance?

679
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:45,870
Herbs can be blended into
rouge and powder.

680
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:48,040
If we turn spices into liquid,

681
00:39:48,290 --> 00:39:50,520
and dip and seal the ornament in it,

682
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,970
we'll have floral scent.

683
00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:53,540
No one has done it before.

684
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:54,860
Why not try it?

685
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:00,220
Where can I get the scent that can
overwhelm this silver ornament?

686
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:03,990
I read in the Hengjing Annals
of Geography...

687
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:06,030
about a flower field on Yu Shan...

688
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,880
in the suburb with many flowers,

689
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,020
and many rare species.

690
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:10,890
Maybe the flowers you want are there.

691
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:12,550
I'll go back and read it again,

692
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:14,790
-and tell you the location.
-Thank you.

693
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:19,480
[Ruyi Pavilion]

694
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,240
Oh no!

695
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:33,710
Miss Rong went to Yu Shan alone.

696
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:35,290
Why did she go there?

697
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,700
-Sir.
-Sir,

698
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,560
last night she said she was going...

699
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:41,450
to look for a flower field there.

700
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,290
She went alone this morning.

701
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:44,880
She only left this letter.

702
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:46,720
Yu Shan is remote,

703
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:48,210
and has flourishing woods.

704
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:50,560
It will be dangerous for her to go alone.

705
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:55,800
Goodbye.

706
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:01,600
He is so worried about her.

707
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,890
Yes,

708
00:41:04,450 --> 00:41:07,240
he appears snobbish,

709
00:41:07,330 --> 00:41:08,510
but actually,

710
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:09,920
he is gentle,

711
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,200
and kind.

712
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:39,160
[I can't find the flower field
however hard I try.]

713
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,950
[Even if I find it,]

714
00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:44,210
[will I be able to rescue my master?]

715
00:42:07,490 --> 00:42:08,660
Nong Nong.

716
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,920
-Why are you here?
-I am looking for you.

717
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:13,720
I just went to Ruyi Pavilion.

718
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:16,400
I learned that you're looking for
a flower field.

719
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,590
So,

720
00:42:18,430 --> 00:42:19,590
I came.

721
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:21,810
I haven't found the flower field yet.

722
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,880
We should head further south
along the river.

723
00:42:25,570 --> 00:42:26,700
Follow me.
