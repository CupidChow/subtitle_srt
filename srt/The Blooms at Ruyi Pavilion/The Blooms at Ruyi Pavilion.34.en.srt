Regret what?

6
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:49,080
Marrying you.

Yes.

You want to divorce me?

-Yes.
-Alright.

17
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,100
Since you already said so,

18
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,100
I think I've troubled you
long enough.

19
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:38,270
Now, the only thing I can do for you is

20
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:41,020
to obey your command and have a divorce.

21
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:44,030
But this matter must be reported
to His Majesty first.

I don't want to disturb you anymore,
so I shall head back to Fu Residence.

Why did you come back at this time?

36

Did you have an argument with Duke Su?

37
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:07,200
Even if you did, you can't just return
to your mother's home out of anger.

That's not it, don't worry.

so he needs to leave the capital.

40
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:15,780
Duke Su's Residence is too big,
I feel lonely staying there alone.

41

Also, since I am homesick,

42
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,860
His Highness allowed me to return home.

Rules are rigid, but people are flexible.

46

Furthermore, His Highness already agreed.
What can other people say?

Even so,

48

plead for the general,

I didn't fight with him.

He's an idiot. A liar.

67

Not saying anything and
bearing all the burden.

68

He even used my trick against me.

69
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:14,410
If you drink too fast,
you'll get drunk.

00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:30,550
He's getting married soon.

75
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,180
Coincidentally,

76
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,830
his wife's surname is also Fu.

77
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,440
Those who get married are idiots.

78
00:06:39,659 --> 00:06:41,730
Then why did you get married?

79
00:06:43,909 --> 00:06:45,270
What do you mean?

80
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:50,440
The blue mountain is not at all old,
it is white-haired because of snow.

81
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:54,270
The green pond is actually care-free,

No.

84
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:58,840
When you like someone,

85
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,840
You will be happy for him
and worry for him.

86
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,570
You want the best for him,
you want him to be happy.

87
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:07,470
But you never thought about what he needs.

88
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,690
I've made this mistake before.

89
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,930
And His Highness is also
making the same mistake.

90
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:19,560
The blue mountain is not at all old,

-Why are you here?

99
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,830
I need to digest my meal,
so I took a walk.

100
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,600
I happened to pass by too.

Where are you heading?

103
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,950
To settle something.

104
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,640
Does it have anything to do with
Zhenbei General?

105
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,770
Your Highness,
I shall accompany you.

106
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,380
If you really want to help me,

107
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,670
then please take care of Fu Residence.

108
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:56,580
Understood.

109

These few days,

110
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,130
you had to stay in the palace for a while.

111
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:13,130
Thank you, Your Highness.

112
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,280
But

113
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:17,050
you secretly took us out.

114
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,850
Although the imitator

115
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:21,310
did not leave the room due to sickness

116
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:25,050
but Brother Rui is
nowhere to be found

117
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:28,600
so those guards will find out
sooner or later.

Mrs Dou.

119
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:32,430
I want to prove Master's innocence

120
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:34,570
before father discovers it.

121
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,310
Your Highness.

122
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,810
You have to believe in Master.

123
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,230
Believe in me.

124
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,230
-Your Highness.
-Your Highness.

125

The preparation outside Dou Residence
is done.

126
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,880
If there is any movement,

127
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:02,270
we will immediately get
Mrs Dou and Brother Rui to leave.

128
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:03,240
Your Highness.

129
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:05,660
You asked us to take Mrs Dou out tonight.

130
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,120
In the morning,
you drove Concubine Rong away.

131
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,440
Was that on purpose?

132
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,240
I'm just worried about
Her Highness' safety.

133
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,500
I already sent someone
to watch over her.

134
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:17,500
This way,

135
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,520
she can be safe.

136
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:46,180
That's right, as you said,

137
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,200
the previous Ms Fu was unrefined

138
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:49,470
when she had her meals.

139
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:52,390
Thinking about her position now,
this is such a...

140
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:53,660
Isn't that right?

141
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:56,510
She really got me tongue-tied.

142
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:58,060
You guys were not there.

143
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,460
If you guys were there...

144
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:00,590
I don't want to
talk about it anymore.

145
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:01,980
I really can't figure it out

146
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,300
why my parents

147
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:04,920
wanted to set me up with her.

148
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:08,010
Even though she is pretty,

149
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:09,410
but her behaviour

150
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,890
-really doesn't interest me.
-You're getting married soon.

151
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:14,650
- Don't talk about it anymore.
- That's right.

152
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:17,640
This Ms Fu is much better
that the other Ms Fu.

153
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:26,600
-Who?
-Who did that?

154
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:32,140

Such a pretty person.

161
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:10,310
That's enough, Xiao Qi
has important things to do.

162
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:11,800
Don't bother him, Dou Dou.

163
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:14,680
Come, let's play over there.

164
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:17,830
This place is...

00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,180
Concubine Rong is here.

170
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:33,850
This is Xiao Shi.

171
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:35,110
This is Uncle San.

172
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,440
Greetings, Your Highness.

173
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,570
No need to be polite.

174
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,510
Miss, you didn't touch up

175
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:44,670
before coming here?

176
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,080
To mark the occasion?

177
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,040
Do not ask where the hero came from.

178
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,640
Same applies to these items.

179
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,610
If you wish to buy it, then take it.

180
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:55,810
If not, put it down.

181
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:57,230
Don't ask too much.

182
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,650
This is to avoid
the Ghost Market's taboo.

183
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:06,540
You are the stall owner
of Ghost Market at Weiyang?

184
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:10,710
So you two already know each other.

185
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:11,630
That's good.

186
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:12,660
Uncle San.

187
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:14,420
This is Duke Su's concubine,

188
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:15,480
Young Lady Fu Rong.

189
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,060
Ms Liu's only disciple.

190
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,810
Since we've met,

191
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:20,180
means it's destiny.

192
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:22,080
I invited you here today

193
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,820
in hopes that you can assist us

194
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,910
in finding the Ruyi token.

195
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,820
I need to confirm something.

196
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:33,640
When I secretly followed
Master to Jichang City,

197
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:36,820
Mount Tai's landslide had caused
a lot of casualties.

198
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,530
Was it

199
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:41,820
caused by Master?

200
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:42,970
-My lady.
-My lady.

201
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:44,110
What are you talking about?

202
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:45,840
Ms Liu wouldn't do such a thing.

203
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:50,090
Liu Ru Yi has found
a very good disciple.

204
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:52,900
She trusted you with all her heart.

205
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:53,970
She even...

206
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,100
She even gave you the Ruyi Bracelet.

207
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:58,410
Did you know?

208
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,760
As long as you wear the Ruyi Bracelet,

209
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,730
whenever you're in danger,

210
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:05,540
the people of the Pavilion

211
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:08,660
will have to protect you
with their lives.

212
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:17,730
But you have no trust

213
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:19,870
towards your own master,

214
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,900
towards Ruyi Pavilion.

215
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:24,370
If that's how is it

216
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,170
this meeting is pointless.

217
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:30,700
My lady.

218
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,060
Did you know

219
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:33,470
that in this place,

220
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:36,550
Xiao Qi, Xiao Ba, myself

221
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,730
and others

222
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,500
all grew up here.

223
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,960
If it wasn't for Ms Liu

224
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,070
none of us would have survived.

225
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:46,570
Every child here was adopted by Ms Liu?

226
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:50,540
Mistress said when she was young,
she drifted from place to place.

227
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,000
So she hoped that she could

228
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:53,540
help the homeless children

229
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:55,200
who were suffering
from various disasters.

230
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,100
So that they didn't have to spend
a lifetime of suffering.

231
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,520
Here, not only do we have
warm clothes to wear,

232
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,850
we also have food to eat.

233
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:03,000
Mistress will also called
for some teachers

234
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,460
for those who want to study

235
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:06,830
and those who want
to learn martial arts.

236
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:09,160
Every kid is able to grow up happily here.

237
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:11,450
When you're old enough,
you may leave.

238
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:14,310
But we willingly decided
to stay by mistress' side.

239
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:19,060
Why did Master not tell me this?

240
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:23,240
Mistress knows that there are
pros and cons of information trade.

241
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,950
Even though the purpose is pure,

242
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:28,150
some things can't be controlled
with information trade.

243
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:31,030
She probably worried that
you would be skeptical,

244
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,300
so she didn't tell you.

245
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,760
I shouldn't have doubted her.

246
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:39,300
My lady.

247
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:41,410
You are not such a wary person.

248
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,660
What made you doubt Ms Liu?

249
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:46,560
Do you guys know Xiao Wu?

250
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,460
He was the one
who told me everything.

251
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,830
He was also the one
who told me

252
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:53,430
that Master was behind
Mount Tai's landslide.

253
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,020
Why did Xiao Wu say that?

254
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:59,580
Could it be that he was bribed?

255
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:14,760
It's okay.

256
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,310
Don't be scared.

257
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:18,370
Don't be afraid.

258
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,800
Uncle San.

259
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,050
Stop fighting.

260
00:16:58,980 --> 00:16:59,860
Your Highness.

261
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:00,950
You're fine?

262
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:02,010
Who are you?

263
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:05,010
Who are you guys?

264
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:07,339
They are...

265
00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:09,490
They are my friends.

266
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,490
Wait, why didn't you ask first

267
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:13,760
before attacking?

268
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:16,359
I thought you were in danger.

269
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:17,849
How would I explain to...

270
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:23,089
Still trying to cover up?

271
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:25,819
You think that I don't know
that His Highness sent you?

272
00:17:25,819 --> 00:17:28,060
Anyway, how is Zhenbei General?

273
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,750
His Highness only said that
he has matters to attend to.

274
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,200
He didn't specify on the subject.

275
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,060
He just requested for me
to look after Fu Residence.

276
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:40,940
Not saying anything

277
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,600
and carrying all the burden.

278
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,320
Little Marquis,
you've seen it, right?

279
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,510
They are all my friends.

280
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:49,270
They are good in martial arts.
So I am safe.

281
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:50,800
You can wait for me outside.

282
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,130
Understood.

283
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,920
Please take care of yourself.

284
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,740
What business did His Highness have?

285
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:05,810
Uncle San.

286
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:14,300
We went to
General Dou's residence last night.

287
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,680
Mrs Dou and the general's grandson
were not in the residence.

288
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,680
Only someone who looks like Mrs Dou.

289
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,330
Why were you guys there?

290
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:21,890
You may not know

291
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,810
but Uncle San and Zhenbei General
are sworn friends.

292
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:27,240
Uncle San came to the capital,

293
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,600
firstly, due to Ruyi Pavilion.

294
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,800
Secondly, because of Zhenbei General.

295
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:32,910
We believe that Duke Su
has something to do with this.

296
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:34,810
He was the one who took
Mrs Dou and the grandson

297
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:35,910
out of the residence.

298
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:38,190
[Is that why His Highness
pushed me away?]

299
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:39,650
[He doesn't want me to get involved.]

300
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:40,660
We received news.

301
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,420
There is a mole in Dayu

302
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,770
who provided Xuan Han with
our defense map.

303
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:47,430
That's why the enemy was able
to break our strategic pass.

304
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:49,500
But we already know
who infiltrated the capital.

305
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,590
As long as they get back to us,

306
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:52,450
we can find out about Dayu's mole.

307
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,030
I'll go with you.

308
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:58,110
I thought you believe

309
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:01,510
that Liu Ru Yi and Ruyi Pavilion
are both heinous?

310
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:07,320
I apologized for

311
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:09,390
asking so rashly.

312
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:11,850
But I am willing to lend a hand.

313
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,350
I hope Uncle San

314
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,910
is able to forgive me for my
inconsiderate behaviour.

315
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:18,140
My identity can be more or less useful

316
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,600
to investigate the mole.

317
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:21,580
Moreover,

318
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:23,810
I want to prove to His Highness

319
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:26,240
that Ruyi Pavilion is nothing
like how XIao Wu described.

320
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,150
Uncle San.

321
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,580
It seems like Xiao Wu
is the one playing tricks.

322
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,260
Why don't you let Her Highness
help us out.

323
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,970
We definitely need to lure
Xiao Wu out.

324
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:34,510
Uncle San, just agree to it.

325
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:42,960
[Duke Su's Residence]

326
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:49,200
Your Highness, the secret letter
from Duke Huai has arrived.

327
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,310
[I understand your intention.]

328
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,420
[I know this must not be revealed]

329
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:58,710
[as it may fall short.]

330
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:00,950
[So I can only relay
this secret message to you.]

331
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:03,150
[We will speed up our pace to go to Jiuli]

332
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,830
[and do as you instructed.]

333
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:06,760
[I believe in Zhenbei General]

334
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,020
[and I believe in you.]

335
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:10,890
[I will speed up to get in contact
with Zhenbei General.]

336
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:12,290
[Don't worry, brother.]

337
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:21,770
But,

338
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:23,350
even if Duke Huai believes,

339
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:24,800
the front line soldiers believe,

340
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,560
the one that needs to believe
is His Majesty.

341
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,850
Your Highness, should we go to
the palace to seek an audience?

342
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:29,730
No.

343
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:32,760
This letter

344
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:35,520
will not be able to calm
His Majesty's anger.

345
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,210
In fact, His Majesty might feel

346
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:39,670
that His Highness and Zhenbei General
are in collusion.

347
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:41,000
He will be more furious.

348
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,720
Jiuli will be breached soon.

349
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,800
I hope Hao'er can hurry up.

350
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:49,040
He has to hurry.

351
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:53,670
Under Zhenbei General...

352
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,720
No.

353
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:56,540
Under rebel Dou Yan's command,

354
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:57,620
Jiuli has been breached.

355
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:59,560
Xuan Han is now stationed in Jiuli.

356
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:00,920
He will head south any time.

357
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,870
Furthermore, Duke Huai was shot
by an arrow outside of Jiuli City.

358
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:06,120
Your Majesty, the archer was Dou Yan.

359
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,950
How is Duke Huai's condition?

360
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,240
He is undergoing
emergency treatment.

361
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:17,770
Your Majesty, you need to
take care of your body.

362
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:20,320
Zhenbei General...

363
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:22,390
Messenger.

364
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,410
Messenger!

365

Your Majesty.

366
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:27,320
Open the palace gates.

367
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,980
Let the royal guards impose a curfew

368
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:32,380
at any time.

369
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:33,350
Yes.

370
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,320
Also,

371
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:37,440
summon Duke An to the palace immediately.

372
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,890
-Understood.
-Hurry.

373
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:41,530
Your Majesty.

374
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:43,820
[Shang Yang Gate]

375
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,220
I've already heard

376
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:49,500
that Duke Huai...

377
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,900
No need to speak further.

378
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:53,520
Take the royal guards
out of the city immediately.

379
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,650
Capture rebel Dou Yan
and his whole family.

380
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,300
Behead them at noon tomorrow.

381
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:00,980
At the same time,
send the news to the frontier pass.

382
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:02,330
to serve as an example.

383
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:03,840
You want me to capture them now?

384
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,810
Right now.

385
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:08,520
I've lost three cities in a row.

386
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:11,580
I need to behead them immediately

387
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,770
to frighten the frontier pass.

388
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:16,600
But General Zhenbei
used to be a military exploit.

389
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,880
That is why

390
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,300
we cannot delay this.

391
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:21,950
The longer you wait,
more trouble will arise.

392
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,560
Yes.

393
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:27,470
Duke An.

394
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:32,530
During the arrest,

395
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,080
if there is resistance,

396
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,600
execute immediately.

397
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,210
Understood.

398
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,090
Greetings, my lord.

399
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:04,130
I'll keep watch. You head over to
Duke Su's Residence to report.

400
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:07,640
It may be a secret messenger.

401
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:10,280
-After them!
-Yes.

402
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:14,190
What's the situation in the residence?

403
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:15,070
Your Highness.

404
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,100
The family members of General Zhenbei
are inside.

405
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,500
No suspicious movement.

406
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,640
Steal a beam to replace a pillar.

407
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:52,430
So this is what you mean when you said
no suspicious movement.

408
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:53,440
My lord.

409
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:54,980
We really didn't know.

410
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:57,470
You don't even know when
they got switched!

411
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,780
-Forget it.
-Thank you, my lord.

412
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,940
Take these two away

413
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:04,440
and interrogate them thoroughly.

414
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,440
Make sure they explain everything.

415
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:18,070
Even if you die,

416
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,640
I can still find out the person
behind this.

417
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:22,130
Lieutenant.

418
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,320
Make sure she learns her lesson.

419
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,380
What?

420
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:35,530
There is no one
in the general's residence?

421
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:36,780
Correct, Royal Brother.

422
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,670
By the time I arrived
with the royal guards,

423
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:41,350
the residence is already empty.

424
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:45,890
Your Majesty.

425
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:47,600
I am useless.

426
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:50,670
Brother, please take care of your health.

427
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:52,270
I will do the best that I can

428
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:54,900
to arrest the family members
of the rebel.

429
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:02,520
Do you even have a clue

430
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:04,190
of where they are?

431
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:05,900
This family of rebels

432
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,680
may have been hidden.

433
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:13,380
Who dare to do so?

434
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:15,800
Within Dayu borders,

435
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,580
the only man willing and capable

436
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:20,750
of taking such risk for General Dou...

437
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:26,800
I believe Royal Brother
is already aware who it is.

438
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,220
Duke Su.

439
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:35,340
Though I don't dare make such accusation,

440
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:38,820
but so far,

441
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:41,270
Duke Su is the most likely suspect.

442
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:44,530
Bring the guards to
Duke Su's Residence immediately.

443
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:47,440
If you see the family of rebels there,
execute them.

444
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,210
Bring Duke Su to me.

445
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:52,810
I will ask him myself.

446
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:55,050

Duke An has been ordered
to inspect Duke Su's Residence.

Due to the disappearance
of the rebel family,

465

Royal Brother is worried that
traitors and usurpers would hide

00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:54,410
Your Highness.

503
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,500
The frontier pass is victorious.

504
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,440
[Shuang Yue Pass]

505
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:14,150
Your Highness.

506
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,940
[It's true that Duke Huai is hurt,
but only a light injury.]

507
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:18,260
[Attached to the arrow
that Zhenbei General shot]

508
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:19,790
[was a defense map of Jiuli]

509
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:22,480
[and how to coordinate
outside and inside offensives.]

510
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,760
Duke Huai pretended
to be seriously injured

511
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,780
to make sure Xuan Han people
let their guard down.

512
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:28,510
At night, Zhenbei General attacked
Xuan Han's Commander-in-Chief.

513
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:29,920
Then secretly opened
the city's small gate.

514
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,940
Dayu's army stridently entered the city.

515
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:35,600
[The people of Xuan Han fled in
all directions and were utterly defeated.]

516
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,530
[Shuang Yue Pass]

517
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:43,340
Attack!

518
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:54,890
The Commander-in-Chief is dead!

519
00:31:55,970 --> 00:31:59,490
-The Commander is dead!
-The Commander is dead!

520
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:02,830
Attack!

521
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:04,280
[Both sides assembled.]

522
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,260
[Zhenbei General and Duke Huai
took advantage to pursue and attack]

523
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:07,140
another troop.

524
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:09,520
News about the death of
Xuan Han's Commander has been spread.

525
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,370
The Xuan Han soldiers originally
stationed at Zhangyang City

526
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:12,640
heard the news of the frontline's defeat.

527
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,650
and the commander's death.

528
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:15,780
Thus, they evacuated that same night.

529
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,190
No wonder he's a master.

530
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:20,570
The people were not harmed

531
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:23,310
and the enemy were easily defeated.

532
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,090
He deserves to be respected.

533
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:26,720
If it weren't for
Your Highness' prediction

534
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,060
and the letter that you sent to Duke Huai,

535
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:30,320
I'm afraid this war would've dragged on.

536
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:33,380
Your Highness is truly wise.

537
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:38,030
All of this is thanks to Hao'er.

538
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,430
Greetings, Father.

539
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:46,040
Duke Su.

540
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:48,360
Are you aware of your mistake?

541
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:50,480
I am guilty.

542
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:54,530
I hid the suspects
without your permission.

543
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:57,230
I hope father can overlook my mistake.

544
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:12,260
Jin'er.

545
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,330
Not only are you innocent,

546
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:16,530
you have also made
a huge contribution.

547
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:19,830
I am the one who should
reflect on my action.

548
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:25,150
Zhenbei General disregarded his life
and went deep into enemy's territory,

549
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:26,680
defeated many with the few,

550
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:28,710
bringing huge victory to Dayu.

551
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:30,610
But I,

552
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:34,870
almost killed a loyal subject
and made a serious mistake.

553
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:38,040
Thankfully, you are here.

554
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,670
You delegate well, Father.

555
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:42,670
You're honest and kind-hearted.

556
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:45,060
If the soldiers at frontier pass know,

557
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:48,070
I'm sure they are willing
to pledge loyalty to Dayu.

558
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:51,020
Good.

559
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,560
Good.

560
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:54,940
Father.

561
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:56,430
Since

562
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:59,200
Zhenbei General's name has been cleared,

563
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,210
does that mean that this family

564
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:04,920
are allowed to return to their residence?

565
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:06,420
Of course.

566
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:08,060
Go and settle it fast.

567
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:10,739
Thank you, Father.

568
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:25,780
[General's Residence]

569
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:32,150
On behalf of the general,

570
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:35,150
thank you, Your Highness, for
saving our family.

571
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,840
Mrs Dou, no need to be polite.

572
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:40,480
You can rest assured about master.

573
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,510
Mrs Dou, you ought to rest early today.

574
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,159
Let's go.

575
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:50,550
Your Highness.

576
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:52,489
Mr Ge, you came at the right time.

577
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:54,770
Please accompany me to Fu Residence.

578
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,139
Your Highness.

579
00:34:57,410 --> 00:34:59,010
News from the frontier pass.

580
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,090
[Enemy received information
on taking down Zhangyang City.]

581
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,780
[This matter must be investigated.
Dou Yan, General of Zhenbei]

582
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:11,100
It seems like there's a mole in Dayu.

583
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:12,070
What?

584
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:13,740
Go investigate.

585
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:16,050
Find out who leaked the defense map.

586
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:17,260
Yes.

587
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:20,780
Your Highness.

588
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,860
Are we still going to Fu Residence?

589
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:33,540
[We have followed him for days.]

590
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:35,210
[We found that this Xuan Han's spy]

591
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:37,410
[often walked around the East Street.]

592
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:39,960
[He seems to be looking for
a suitable place for discussions.]

593
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,490
[But who is he waiting for?]

594
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:45,580
[We have made arrangements
with nearby tea houses and restaurants.]

595
00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:57,470
Hello, sir.

596
00:35:57,690 --> 00:35:58,690
How many persons?

597
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,330
Give me a private room.

598
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:01,560
Sure. This way.

599
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:30,950
Come in.

600
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:41,790
Honourable envoy.

601
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:43,050
Have a drink.

602
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:45,970
You lot have no sincerity!

603
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,470
Honourable envoy.

604
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:50,310
Tell us,

605
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,450
how should we show our sincerity?

606
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:57,190
I want to meet your lord.

607
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:00,300
This...

608
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:02,240
Rumour has it

609
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:04,870
that the lord can't
even leave the palace.

610
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:07,890
How is he going to discuss
about collaboration?

611
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,420
Honourable envoy.

612
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:15,570
Do you really want to see our lord?

613
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:21,380
This time tomorrow.

614
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,830
Right here.

615
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:25,290
I will spare my time
for only one cup of tea.

616
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:26,740
If I don't see your lord,

617
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:30,040
don't blame us Xuan Han
for turning against you.

618
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:42,670
That person just now is
Duke Cheng's personal guard.

619
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:43,870
His name is Zhong Rui.

620
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:48,520
So the person they were talking about

621
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:50,110
was Duke Cheng?

622
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,160
This person is really hopeless.

623
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:57,720
After being locked in Contemplation Hall,
he still doesn't learn.

624
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,480
He even colluded with Xuan Han's spy
for money.

625
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,500
Now what should we do?

626
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,540
Let's capture them when Duke Cheng come.

627
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,900
It's useless to capture them.

628
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:11,090
We need a more direct evidence.

629
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:28,030
The people are in good health.

630
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:29,400
Life is abundant.

631
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:31,380
Nothing is better than these.

632
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:34,850
Everything depends on
Your Majesty's wisdom.

633
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:37,400
You

634
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:39,160
used to be so quiet.

635
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:41,580
Now you can speak well.

636
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:46,580
Everything that I said
is from the bottom of my heart.

637
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:50,160
If Your Majesty didn't care
about the people,

638
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,850
why would we be making a trip in disguise

639
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:55,440
to pray for blessings at Tian Men Temple.

640
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:00,200
I've heard from Eunuch Wang.

641
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:03,980
Since you were placed
under house arrest,

642
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:06,530
you have been
writing scriptures every day.

643
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:08,560
When the frontier pass war happened,

644
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,960
you burned incense and kowtowed every day.

645
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:15,510
I think it is because your kind intention
had reached the heavens.

646
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:17,720
That's why we achieved great victory.

647
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:24,430
You are fulfilling a promise.

648
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:26,260
As the ruler of this country,

649
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:28,440
how can I not accompany you?

650
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,110
Your Majesty.

651
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:38,470
Besides, it's been a long time since
I went out in disguise.

652
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,370
Yes.

653
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,590
Master.

654
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:54,970
What happened?

655
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:56,430
Master, Madam.

656
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,100
This horse seems to be hungry.

657
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:59,110
It refuses to move.

658
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:00,170
It may need to rest.

659
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,700
I shall feed it some food.

660
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,680
Your Majesty.

661
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:10,240
Didn't you say that it's been
a long time since you went out?

662
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:14,020
Why not take this chance to walk around

663
00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:16,580
while also try out
some common folk food?

664
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:18,380
You can also have a look

665
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:20,580
at the everyday life of common folks.

666
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:25,470
Seems like a good idea.

667
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:40,070
Hot steam buns!

668
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:43,190
Your Majesty, look.

669
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:46,580
Two guests heading up.

670
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:48,390
Careful, watch the steps.

671
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:49,750
Valuable guests,

672
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:51,950
you came to our restaurant
at the right time.

673
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:54,590
Our shop just restocked a whole batch
of Baiting Tea yesterday.

674
00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:55,560
I'm not exaggerating.

675
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,580
But you can't get this tea elsewhere.

676
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,860
Watch your step.

677
00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:00,220
Over here.

678
00:41:01,850 --> 00:41:03,050
A little bit in front.

679
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:09,730
It's here.

680
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:11,050
Come.

681
00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:14,070
Please come inside.

682
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:22,660
Please sit here.

683
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:27,850
What kind of tea would you like?

684
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,140
It doesn't matter.

685
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:31,590
How can it not matter?

686
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,350
We have good tea like

687
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,820
Baiting, Chunquan, Hongqi,
and Lingshan tea.

688
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:37,220
-I wonder...
-I told you it doesn't matter.

689
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:39,640
-Are you deaf?
-Okay, I understand.

690
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:42,020
I'll bring it soon.

691
00:41:42,330 --> 00:41:43,730
Please wait for a moment.

692
00:41:45,350 --> 00:41:46,630
Why is he not here yet?

693
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,930
He should be here soon.

694
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:50,340
How dare he!

695
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:52,390
A lowly envoy

696
00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:54,690
dared to ask to see me in person?

697
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:57,380
If it wasn't a life or death situation,

698
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:58,920
I would've killed them.

699
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:04,020
That replacement
back at Contemplation Hall.

700
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:05,820
He won't be a problem, right?

701
00:42:05,910 --> 00:42:07,230
Don't worry, my lord.

702
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:09,610
The eunuch is very clever.

703
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:11,980
Okay.

704
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:13,820
Nothing's wrong, right?

705
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:18,100
What's wrong?

706
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:21,620
I'm fine.

707
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:24,570
I just feel a little thirsty.

708
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:26,720
Dear guests, would you like some tea?

709
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,880
We received a new batch of Baiting Tea
yesterday.

710
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,070
You can't get it elsewhere.

711
00:42:30,070 --> 00:42:32,200
Even the gods are envious of the taste.

712
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:34,250
Can't get it elsewhere?
