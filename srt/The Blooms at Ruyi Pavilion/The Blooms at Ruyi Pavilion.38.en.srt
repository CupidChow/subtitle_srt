Do you know that the Emperor

40
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:18,500
was mad of Duke Huai today?

41

Why?

You don't know why?

43
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,550
I have to obey the royal order
to accompany the marriage.

Nobody can help me.

45

I have a way to let you
stay in the capital.

46
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:38,770
It's a serious crime to go against
the Emperor's order.

47

Besides, I don't have a reason the stay.

Going against the Emperor's order
is a serious crime.

Do you know that if it wasn't for me,

51
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:53,670
he would still be kneeling
in front of the palace gate?

52
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:57,170
He is even willing to forgo
his royal status.

53

Hao'er does love you deeply.

54

Please don't go against the Emperor
because of me.

80

Besides, I'm in an awkward position.

173
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:18,240
He wanted to put the blame on Duke Su

174
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:20,870
and provoke enmity between you
and Duke Su.

175
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:22,670
Why did he do that?

176
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:24,930
Maybe it's because

177
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:28,430
he loves you.

178
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:31,910
No, wait.

179
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,960
This is ridiculous.

180
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:36,110
If he really loved me,

181
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:37,310
why would he lie to me?

182
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:38,750
He also killed my father.

183
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:39,780
No.

184
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:40,950
The fire in Ruyi Pavilion

185
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:42,550
was not meant to kill Lord Fu.

186
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:45,140
Zhang Yan made that decision
on his own.

187
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:48,110
When Duke An sent me to lure Duke Su
to Ruyi Pavilion,

188
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:49,540
he wanted Duke Su to die.

189
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:52,350
He hates Duke Su to the bone.

190
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,430
Why did he insist on killing Duke Su?

191
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:01,930
-I need to talk to him.
-Madam.

192
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:03,510
You must not go to Duke An.

193
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:05,590
He is ruthless.

194
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:07,190
He has gone insane because of you.

195
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:08,580
Even if you confront him now,

196
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,900
you won't get an answer.

197
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,870
You might get yourself in danger instead.

198
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:14,870
Duke Su must be on his way
to Xuan Han now.

199
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:18,230
Please wait for his return
to devise a better plan.

200
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:50,990
Your Highness.

201
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:52,190
It is noon time.

202
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:53,900
Should we depart now?

203
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:59,050
Take care, Your Highness.

204
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:05,030
Depart.

205
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:08,500
[Hengjing]

206
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,030
Your Highness.

207
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,820
What's the matter, madam?

208
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:40,070
What's the matter?

209
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,600
Did I ever tell you that

210
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:48,150
my mother was killed in a fire

211
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:50,870
in Hong Fu Temple.

212
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,770
[My mother was a kind person.]

213
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:55,710
She was cast aside

214
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:58,010
just because she has anisocoria.

215
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,120
I was separated from her since young.

216
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,530
I couldn't get to see her
for one last time.

217
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:07,720
[Uncle San and Xiao Qi, please
investigate Duke An's mother's death.]

218
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:09,150
Lan Xiang.

219
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:11,730
Send this letter to Uncle San and Xiao Qi.

220
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:14,020
Okay.

221
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:17,050
On your way back,

222
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:18,190
tell my sister not to worry about me.

223
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:19,069
Noted.

224
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:22,920
I need to find His Highness.

225
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:26,000
Madam.

226
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:27,800
You can't fight

227
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:29,350
and the journey is rough.

228
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:30,620
Let me accompany you.

229
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,510
I could be of help.

230
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:34,870
Yuan.

231
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:37,070
How am I able to trust you?

232
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:39,930
Please trust me one more time, Madam.

233
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,560
I swear

234
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,520
I will never disappoint Ms Liu

235
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:44,750
and you again.

236
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:51,330
Thank you, Madam.

237
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:09,350
[May Duke Huai be safe]

238
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:11,480
[without injuries]

239
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:13,930
[and return triumphantly soon.]

240
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:30,790
Princess.

241
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,130
Stop the cart.

242
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:47,790
Princess.

243
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:49,430
The journey is rough.

244
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,230
Please take care.

245
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:56,150
Thank you, brother.

246
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:57,430
I will.

247
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:29,560
Princess.

248
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:31,670
I don't want to go to Xuan Han.

249
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:33,390
We're now only half way there.

250
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:35,320
The journey is already killing us.

251
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:37,030
If we continue,

252
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:38,420
I'm afraid

253
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,030
we won't be able to make it
to our destination.

254
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:46,230
I want to run away.

255
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:47,710
But I need your help.

256
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:48,590
Run away?

257
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:51,400
Are you out of your mind?

258
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:54,470
Disobeying the Emperor's order
means death penalty.

259
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:56,200
We're in the middle of nowhere.

260
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:58,910
Where can we run to?

261
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,510
I've observed the route just now.

262
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:03,750
There's a little village

263
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:04,950
not far ahead.

264
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,640
When we're there,

265
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:09,030
we can conceal our identity
and live there for a while.

266
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:09,960
After some time,

267
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:11,490
we can return to Hengjing.

268
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,300
We can say that

269
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,230
we got separated with the troop.

270
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:17,110
Nobody would blame us.

271
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:18,470
This...

272
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:20,340
Will it work?

273
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:22,120
This is our only chance.

274
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:24,130
Once we reach Xuan Han,

275
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:26,780
we'll never be able to return.

276
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:28,470
But

277
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,190
if we're gone,

278
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:31,960
what will happen to Duke Su?

279
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,350
We can't do that.

280
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:35,230
The Emperor will punish him.

281
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:36,910
You're the one in deep trouble now.

282
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:38,500
Why do you care about Duke Su?

283
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,740
He doesn't even want to marry you.

284
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,000
Besides, Duke Su is the royal son.

285
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:49,620
Even if he made mistakes,

286
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,620
the Emperor will not persecute him.

287
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:53,750
He'll only receive slight punishment.

288
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,190
It's totally different for us.

289
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:56,420
If we go to Xuan Han,

290
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:57,910
we're as good as dead.

291
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:00,070
Hence we need to run away.

292
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:02,460
Everything else can be discussed later.

293
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:03,590
In that case...

294
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:05,910
What is your plan?

295
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:07,870
I'm warning you first.

296
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:09,710
If the plan goes wrong,

297
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:11,030
you'll be dead.

298
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:26,350
Stop.

299
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:29,850
It's getting dark.

300
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:33,790
We'll camp here for the night.

301
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:13,520
Assassins!

302
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:46,600
What is happening outside?

303
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:48,430
Let me have a look.

304
00:22:58,830 --> 00:22:59,710
Princess.

305
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:01,670
Assassins are attacking us.

306
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:02,870
Assassins?

307
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:04,710
Let's run away now.

308
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:06,310
This is our chance to run.

309
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:07,960
Let's go.

310
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:15,870
Let's go.

311
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:56,470
You take a rest first.

312
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:58,430
I'll go there to have a look

313
00:23:58,430 --> 00:23:59,700
and figure out the route.

314
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,930
You be careful.

315
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:02,250
I can't run anymore.

316
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:04,110
I'll be back soon.

317
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:27,190
Stop running.

318
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:16,960
Madam!

319
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:20,750
Yuan!

320
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:30,950
Yuan!

321
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,280
Yuan.

322
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:37,830
Yuan, you'll be fine.

323
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:39,670
Madam.

324
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,150
Do not be sad.

325
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:45,270
I deserve to die.

326
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:47,070
Yuan.

327
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,680
Actually Ms Liu died because of me.

328
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:53,790
I even cleared out the secret room,
without a sense of remorse.

329
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:55,260
And made it look like Ms Liu
had committed suicide.

330
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:56,190
What?

331
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:58,670
I didn't mean to kill Ms Liu.

332
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:01,540
To die today for you,

333
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:04,000
I don't know if Ms Liu wants to see me

334
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:08,030
when I go on the other side.

335
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:09,710
Yuan.

336
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:11,950
You'll be fine, Yuan.

337
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:13,070
We'll find you a physician.

338
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:13,950
Yuan.

339
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:15,510
Yuan.

340
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:26,550
Yuan!

341
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,310
Yuan.

342
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:29,650
Wake up, Yuan.

343
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:31,480
We'll go see the physician now.

344
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:48,760
Yuan.

345
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:16,600
Xu Jia.

346
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:18,780
Your Highness.

347
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:19,910
The Princess is missing.

348
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:20,870
Search the area immediately.

349
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:22,000
Yes, Your Highness.

350
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:36,790
Fu Rong.

351
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:38,070
Let go of me.

352
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:40,470
I couldn't get Duke Su to love me.

353
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:43,230
I'm even forced into marriage alliance.

354
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:45,270
I have no reason to live anymore.

355
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:47,920
What are you talking about?
Grab on tight.

356
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:50,310
Fu Rong.

357
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:53,190
Promise me one thing.

358
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:55,630
After I die,

359
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:59,550
please take good care of Duke Su.

360
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:01,190
You will not die.

361
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:04,760
You always says you love His Highness.

362
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:06,540
What would happen to him

363
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:08,550
if you die?

364
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:10,750
Besides,

365
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:13,610
don't you want to know
who wants us dead?

366
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:16,630
You're right.

367
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:19,990
I will find out who he is

368
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:21,870
and punish his entire family.

369
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:23,950
Yes. Quick, hold on to me.

370
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:33,650
Quick.

371
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:38,030
Be careful.

372
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:39,150
Quickly now.

373
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:00,350
Why is Gu Yuan here?

374
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:04,230
Cui Wan.

375
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:07,550
Princess. Princess.

376
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,520
Cui Wan.

377
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:10,860
Princess. Princess.

378
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:12,030
Duke Su.

379
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,670
-Duke Su
-Your Highness, we are down here.

380
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:15,790
We are down here.

381
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:17,470
Duke Su.

382
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,310
Your Highness, we are down here.

383
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:21,460
Duke Su.

384
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,110
We are down here.

385
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,390
Duke Su!

386
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:31,430
Quick.

387
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:48,190
-Are you alright?
-Quickly save the princess.

388
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:49,190
Duke Su.

389
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:56,990
Pull.

390
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:06,990
Give me your hand.

391
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:25,860
♫ Faint shadows and slanted lanterns
illuminate your visage ♫

392
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:26,390
Duke Su!

393
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:30,060
♫ When will I comb your hair again? ♫

394
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:28,030
Fu Rong!

395
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:32,780
♫ Old dreams come back to haunt us ♫

396
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:35,120
♫ Love and hate resurface ♫

397
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:39,080
♫ Waiting for the clouds to clear
and the moon to shine through ♫

398
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:44,270
♫ I travel across mountains and rivers
just to get a glimpse of you ♫

399
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:48,890
♫ I'll never forget
the first time we met ♫

400
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:51,480
♫ Fireflies set the skies ablaze ♫

401
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:53,770
♫ Inflamming the passion in our hearts ♫

402
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:58,130
♫ As dream and obsession coalesce ♫

403
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,640
Your Highness.

404
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:33,710
Your Highness.

405
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:36,030
Wake up, Your Highness.

406
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:36,950
Wake up!

407
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:49,710
I saw Gu Yuan's body.

408
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,550
What happened?

409
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:55,270
Yuan was protecting me all the way
till we found the Princess.

410
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:57,270
We were ambushed by the men in black.

411
00:31:57,350 --> 00:32:01,210
Princess and I slipped off the cliff
after being attacked by an arrow.

412
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:06,850
I'm sorry, Your Highness.

413
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:08,920
Yuan has confessed to me

414
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:11,700
that the incident at Ruyi Pavilion

415
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,700
was plotted by Duke An and Zhang Yan.

416
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:16,100
Duke An?

417
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:17,950
Yuan also told me that

418
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:20,520
she was the one who caused Master's death.

419
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:21,950
As for Duke An,

420
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:25,190
His mother was killed in a fire
in Hong Fu Temple.

421
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:26,190
You told me before

422
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:28,830
that you once knocked over a candlestick
in Hong Fu Temple.

423
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:30,690
I did knock over the candlestick.

424
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:32,990
But

425
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:35,450
only some scriptures were burnt.

426
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:37,530
It didn't cause any death.

427
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:39,430
Coincidentally,

428
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:41,740
the day you knocked over the candlestick

429
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:43,630
was the day his mother died.

430
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,830
Although I was very young at that time,

431
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:50,710
I still have some vague memories
of that day.

432
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:53,590
There was no death in that fire.

433
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:56,470
I had arranged for an investigation

434
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:58,110
so that I can prove to you

435
00:32:58,430 --> 00:33:01,290
that the people of Ruyi Pavilion
are not criminals.

436
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:02,390
Rong'er.

437
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:06,940
I have never ordered the killings
at Ruyi Pavilion.

438
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:09,460
During the fire at Ruyi Pavilion that day,

439
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:12,660
Imperial Guards who closed the streets
were fake guards.

440
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:18,110
It was arranged by Duke An.

441
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:23,090
Let's not think about this first.

442
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:24,830
What is important now

443
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:26,960
is that we find a way out of here.

444
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:47,670
How can we get out of here?

445
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:54,270
What if we really can't get out of here?

446
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:57,780
We'll die here then.

447
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:00,630
I'm just your concubine.

448
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:02,750
We're not allowed to be buried together
when we die.

449
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:03,750
If we really die here,

450
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,280
we'll forever be together.

451
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:08,830
But that won't do.

452
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:12,389
There are many pending problems to solve.

453
00:34:12,389 --> 00:34:15,380
I can't leave my mother, sister
and brother.

454
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:17,560
Let's not die first.

455
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:19,659
-So should we die or not?
-No, we shouldn't die yet.

456
00:34:19,659 --> 00:34:21,179
♫ I murmur as if I was dreaming ♫

457
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:21,179
Let's find a way out first.

458
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:22,060
Let's go.

459
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:24,810
♫ Before the scene is penned,
we are already parting ♫

460
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:29,190
♫ Man of my dreams, moon in my lake,
I close my eyes ♫

461
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,270
♫ My remaining desire
slipped through my fingers ♫

462
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,190
♫ The fragrant flower withers away
in the wind ♫

463
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:39,570
♫ Turning into mud, quelling my
loneliness, warming the winter ♫

464
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,389
♫ The cloud approaches, the rain lingers ♫

465
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,520
♫ Turning sentiments and laughter
into memories ♫

466
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:53,320
♫ My feelings well up in my eyes ♫

467
00:34:53,409 --> 00:34:58,100
♫ As I think about the long years
till we meet again ♫

468
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:01,900
♫ Lamenting our separation,
bemoaning our unresolved ending ♫

469
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:05,310
♫ Why should we acquiesce
if we wish to defy our destiny? ♫

470
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:08,960
♫ The vicissitudes of life is inexorable ♫

471
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:09,910
What a sight.

472
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:12,420
♫ You are willing to wither along
with the pretty flowers ♫

473
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:15,890
♫ Let the endless cold nights enshroud
our love and hatred ♫

474
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:15,710
The temperature here is higher.

475
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:19,660
♫ Let our teary eyes meet as we smile ♫

476
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:17,350
Hence the flowers

477
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:19,190
are still blooming.

478
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:21,310
♫ When it rains again ♫

479
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:26,560
♫ Bearing our long-cherished wish,
I will walk through life with you ♫

480
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:23,520
Although it is beautiful here,

481
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:25,630
but how can we get out?

482
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:29,150
We've been walking for some time.

483
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:30,070
I'm tired.

484
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:33,420
We'll stay here tonight.

485
00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:36,230
We'll start walking again

486
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:37,830
at dawn tomorrow.

487
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:55,850
Rong'er.

488
00:35:56,870 --> 00:35:58,470
-If something happens to me
-I don't want to hear this.

489
00:35:58,470 --> 00:35:59,700
-you can find Mr Ge.
-I don't want to hear this.

490
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:02,830
-He can make sure you're safe.
-I don't want to hear this.

491
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:08,430
We've not slept together
as a real married couple.

492
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:10,010
And you're still young...

493
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:18,350
What are you doing, Rong'er?

494
00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:19,950
You've now reminded me of it.

495
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:22,510
It won't be good for you
if people know this.

496
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:25,090
We can't put this off any further.

497
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:27,090
What are you doing?

498
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:30,990
Stop, it tickles.

499
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:41,750
[Duke An is so cruel.]

500
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:43,380
-Stop running.
-[He got me into this.]

501
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:44,990
[And now he wants me dead.]

502
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:47,750
Stop running.

503
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:48,990
Stop running.

504
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:51,300
-Stop!
-Stop running.

505
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:53,310
Stop running!

506
00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:54,350
Stop running.

507
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:57,430
Stop running.

508
00:36:57,910 --> 00:36:58,790
Stop running!

509
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:21,310
Your Highness.

510
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:30,750
Watch out.

511
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:46,510
Why are you here?

512
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:51,630
What about you?

513
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,500
Why are you here alone?

514
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,230
Where is the troop?

515
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:57,190
I...

516
00:37:58,010 --> 00:37:59,840
I got separated from the troop

517
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:02,350
and met with two robbers on the way.

518
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:03,630
I had to keep running.

519
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:10,710
We shouldn't stay here for too long.

520
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:11,770
Let's keep moving.

521
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:33,190
Duke Su.

522
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:34,950
Fu Rong.

523
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:37,550
When will you be back?

524
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:42,100
Princess.

525
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:46,480
Duke and Duchess Su

526
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:48,310
are not found yet.

527
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:50,430
It's all my fault.

528
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:53,270
They wanted to save me.

529
00:38:57,230 --> 00:38:58,230
What about Yuan?

530
00:38:58,610 --> 00:39:00,470
We have given her a proper burial.

531
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:02,040
Please do not worry.

532
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:05,160
I've sent some men to search for

533
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:07,060
Duke and Duchess Su.

534
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:09,180
They will be fine.

535
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:13,190
It's all my fault.

536
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:17,450
After we find a way out,

537
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:19,270
you go back to the capital first.

538
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:20,730
I'll meet you there later.

539
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:31,230
What will Duke An do to us after this?

540
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:33,790
There's no news from Ruyi Pavilion yet.

541
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:35,860
Will we be able to find the truth

542
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:37,540
about Hong Fu Temple?

543
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:41,510
If he thinks I did something,

544
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:43,120
then I'll confront him.

545
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:47,510
Duke An wanted to kill you when he set
Ruyi Pavilion on fire.

546
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:50,020
But father was the one who suffered
the consequences.

547
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:52,020
I don't know how to face him anymore.

548
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:55,510
How did you get here?

549
00:39:57,870 --> 00:39:58,840
Who are you?

550
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,800
I should be the one asking.

551
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:03,790
I've been living here.

552
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:06,530
We fell off the cliff and are looking
for a way out.

553
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:07,850
Hence we ended up here.

554
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:11,030
Do you know if there's a way out of here?

555
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:13,060
Follow me.

556
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:37,610
Go through the cave and
you'll see the way out.

557
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:39,980
Thank you.

558
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:42,750
Can I ask?

559
00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:46,450
Why do you stay here alone?

560
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:48,150
I have an eye disease.

561
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:49,910
I prefer to live a quiet life.

562
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:51,090
This place is hidden,

563
00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:52,590
peaceful and free of disturbance.

564
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:54,390
So I have continued to live here.

565
00:40:55,230 --> 00:40:57,230
We're really grateful to you today.

566
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:00,470
Farewell.

567
00:41:32,310 --> 00:41:33,250
Xuan'er.

568
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:35,070
Why are you here?

569
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,530
Why didn't you inform me first?

570
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:40,680
General.

571
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:42,150
You were badly hurt.

572
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:44,990
Yes. Right.

573
00:41:45,390 --> 00:41:46,270
Xuan'er.

574
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:49,630
I'm badly hurt.

575
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:51,390
Xuan'er.

576
00:41:51,830 --> 00:41:52,870
I'm in pain.

577
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:54,350
Xuan'er.

578
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:55,950
-Xuan'er.
-Stop acting.

579
00:41:56,870 --> 00:41:58,310
If you really want to see me,

580
00:41:58,310 --> 00:41:59,570
just tell me honestly.

581
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:01,190
You don't have to lie.

582
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:06,910
Xuan'er.

583
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:09,400
Xuan'er. I didn't do this on purpose.

584
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:10,870
Don't go, Xuan'er.

585
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:15,510
General.

586
00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:22,890
General.

587
00:42:22,990 --> 00:42:24,320
You're bleeding again.

588
00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:25,790
Li Wei.

589
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:29,750
You really have some nerve.

590
00:42:30,070 --> 00:42:33,070
How dare you bring Ms Fu here
without telling me?

591
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:35,150
Luckily someone told me

592
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:37,070
you're bringing her here.

593
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:37,950
If not, I...

594
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:40,030
General.

595
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:41,590
You kept calling her name

596
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:43,440
when you were unconscious.

597
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:46,060
So I thought you really wanted to see her.

598
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:46,940
So I...

599
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:49,090
I do want to see her.

600
00:42:49,950 --> 00:42:51,150
But not at this time.
