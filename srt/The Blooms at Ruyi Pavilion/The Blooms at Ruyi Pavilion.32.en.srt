Is this real?

13
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,040
It is real.

14
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,240
I am here to return something to you.

15
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,160
You left behind something important

16
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,100
but it wants to keep you company forever.

17
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,230
Will you keep it?

18
00:03:51,579 --> 00:03:52,460
Yes.

19

Your Highness.

20
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:38,890
I am here.

Your Highness.

24
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:04,290
Someone from the palace came.

25
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:06,440
His Majesty wants to see you.

26
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:09,140
Don't worry, Your Highness.

27
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:12,690

What happened?

30
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,880
-He is still alive.
-Inform the others.

31
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:00,610
Wake up.

32
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:21,950
Your Majesty, take a look.

33
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:31,690
As for the weapon case at Kushui Village,

34
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:34,890
I have made some assumptions.

35
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,409
However, I have not found enough evidence.

36
00:07:39,409 --> 00:07:40,670
I dare not make claims.

37
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:43,460
How did you find

38
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:45,520
the materials from the palace?

39
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:46,980
This matter

40
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:54,020
was a collusion between
Consort Duan and Feng Lai Yi.

41
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:58,330
The plunders were hidden by Duke Cheng.

42
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:00,620
What did you say?

43
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:05,240
Before this, Ornaments Attendant Chen
of the Wardrobe Service

44
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,990
told me that

45
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,920
she was bribed by Consort Duan

46
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:12,800
to amend Ruyi Pavilion's
handover document.

47
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:15,160
Then, Duke Cheng

48
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:18,560
transported the missing plunders away.

49
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:23,940
Fortunately,
not all the plunders were sold.

50
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,980
Some of the plunders were left behind.

51
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:28,920
You mean,

52
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:32,669
Duke Cheng transported the plunders
to the bandit stronghold.

53
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,230
According to Ornaments Attendant Chen,

54
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:36,159
that is the case.

55
00:08:37,429 --> 00:08:38,309
Your Majesty!

56
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:40,409
I am wrongly accused!

57
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,840
Since we know that
Duke Su will take action,

58
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:45,100
we shall get a head start.

59
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:47,040
The best defence

60
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:50,720
is to take the initiative
to gain the upper hand.

61
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,930
Duke Su,

62
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,950
once the gate to the palace was opened,

63
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:00,760
Duke Cheng came to see me

64
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:04,750
claiming that you colluded with
Ruyi Pavilion

65
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,340
and work with the bandits

66
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,580
to hide the plunders.

67
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:08,950
Now,

68
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:12,040
you make the same allegation.

69
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,600
Such love and respect

70
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,600
you two show for each other.

71
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:18,790
Your Majesty.

72
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,580
My mother and I have been
carrying out our duties with dedication.

73
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:24,310
We have kept within the bounds.

74
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:25,900
I did not expect that

75
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,520
Xu Jin would frame me

76
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:29,980
in order to get himself off.

77
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:33,190
Please clear my name, Your Majesty.

78
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:38,470
Your Majesty.

79
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:40,610
I swear that I have not done it.

80
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:46,020
Both of you claim that
you are wrongly accused.

81
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,780
Are you saying that

82
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,330
this is a mystery case without clues?

83
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,480
Your Majesty.

84
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:54,420
At Qingfeng Hideout,

85
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:56,990
not only had I found the plunders,

86
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,290
I also brought someone with me.

87
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,440
Please summon this person

88
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,530
to explain the truth to Your Majesty.

89
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:09,910
Bring the witness.

90
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,540
Greetings, Your Majesty.

91
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:22,970
This is the leader of Qingfeng Hideout.

92
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:25,340
He has explained everything to me.

93
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,290
Raise your head.

94
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:30,800
Look at both Dukes.

95
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:32,380
Tell me.

96
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,590
Which of them colluded with you?

97
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:36,690
Which of them

98
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:39,370
told you to hide the plunders?

99
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:40,890
Your Majesty is wise.

100
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:43,550
I dare not hide anything.

101
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:46,640
The person who has been liaising
with me is

102
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:54,180
Duke Su.

103
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,000
Nonsense!

104
00:10:57,810 --> 00:10:58,690
Your Majesty.

105
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,100
Duke Su is powerful and prestigious.

106
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,260
I was forced to listen to him.

107
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:04,080
When the plot fell through,

108
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:07,010
Duke Su told me to play along
with His Highness.

109
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:09,300
His Highness tried to put the blame
on Duke Cheng.

110
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,520
After I have done my part,

111
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,250
not only can I sit back and relax

112
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,480
I can also...

113
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,940
I can also gain wealth.

114
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,020
This is...

115
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:43,370
This is Duke Su's Residence.

Where is His Highness?

120
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:03,150
You came back together
with His Highness last night.

121
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:05,930
His Highness stayed by your side
and did not leave at all.

122
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:08,060
Just now, His Majesty
summoned His Highness.

123
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,720
Only then, His Highness left.

124
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,940
His Majesty summoned him?

125
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,790
Is it because of me?

126
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:18,970
I can't stay at Duke Su's Residence.

127
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:21,330
I promised His Majesty to stay away
from High Highness.

128
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:22,740
You can't leave.

129
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,160
If His Highness doesn't see you
when he is back,

130
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,560
he will go crazy for sure.

131
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:29,560
In order to save you, His Highness
had sustained a lot of injuries.

132
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:32,020
He can't suffer more torment.

133
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:34,590
I have something to tell you.

134

Just now,

135

lying at the entrance.

137
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,230
It seems that he is injured.

138
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:46,790
Hence, I instructed them to carry him
into the study.

139
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:49,120
I also told them to keep quiet about it.

140

Mr Ge said that Xiao Qi is fine.

141

However,

142

Xiao Qi

143
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:58,090
dropped this book.

Spill the beans.

157

That is because I have just learned that

158

he murdered my second brother.

159

I cannot forgive him.

161

He even tried to set up his own brother.

The more I think,
the more terrified I get.

163

I am afraid that
if I continue working with him,

00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,400
I believe that the truth
will be revealed really soon.

174
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:10,810
Duke Su.

175
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:13,550
Didn't you tell us to burn
the village down

176
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,870
and destroy all the evidence?

177
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:17,200
The village has been burnt to ashes.

178
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:18,910
No evidence could be found anymore.

179
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:20,140
The only thing left

180
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:22,980
is the evidence

181
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:24,840
that you preserve on purpose.

182
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:39,190
Your Majesty.

183
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,600
Princess of Xihe is here to see you.

184
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,030
Let her in.

185
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,100
Yes.

186
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:49,790
Summoning Princess of Xihe.

187
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,680
Greetings, Your Majesty.

188
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:00,730
Wan'er.

189
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:03,040
Why are you here?

190
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,280
Your Majesty.

191
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:06,230
After Duke Su went to Weiyang City,

192
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:07,420
I had followed him.

193
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,090
It is impossible that
he colluded with the bandits.

194
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:11,890
Furthermore, Fu...

195
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:14,060
Someone was abducted.

196
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,520
In order to save that person, Duke Su

197
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,380
went to the bandit village alone.

198
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,880
If it weren't for Mr Yuan,

199
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,000
I am afraid...

200
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,770
I am afraid that Duke Su would
have had died at Qingfeng Hideout.

201
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:24,270
How strange.

202
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:28,230
Bandits from Qingfeng are known
for being cruel and merciless.

203
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:30,420
Mr Yuan as mentioned by
Princess of Xihe

204
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,080
had not been able to beat them.

205
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:35,080
However, Duke Su had the guts
to go there.

206
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:37,800
Was that an attempt to save someone

207
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,530
or was he digging his own grave?

208
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:40,550
Unless...

209
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:42,700
Unless Duke Su was sure that

210
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:45,310
even after he had gone to
Qingfeng Hideout,

211
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,220
he could leave without getting hurt.

212
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:50,930
You are talking nonsense!

213
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:52,170
You are making an unfounded claims!

214
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:54,370
You claim that you had followed Duke Su.

215
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,990
In that case, when he went to
Qingfeng Hideout,

216
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:58,390
why didn't you tag along?

217
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:01,250
He must have ditched you
on purpose, am I right?

218
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,050
Since you were not by his side,

219
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:04,390
how do you know

220
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:06,740
what had he done when he was there?

221
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:09,080
-You!
-Enough, Wan'er.

222
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:12,800
Your Majesty.

223
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:14,960
It was really urgent.

224
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:16,650
It was an emergency situation.

225
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:18,310
That's why I went there alone.

226
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:21,390
Please give me a few days more.

227
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:23,240
I shall bring General Yuan here

228
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:24,440
for confrontation.

229
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,950
I believe that the truth
will come to light.

230
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:29,280
You have the audacity to ask
for more time!

231
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:33,940
You were given seven days.

232
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:38,510
You should have been
guarding the royal grave.

233
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:40,020
Are you planning to

234
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,860
continue messing around just because

235
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:44,920
I have mercy for you?

236
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:47,680
I don't dare to do so.

237
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:49,340
Your Majesty,

238
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:51,130
if he is given more time,

239
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:53,550
he would make something out of nothing

240
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,490
by gathering witness or evidence

241
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:57,600
to put the blame on me.

242
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:00,320
You are the one who
make something out of nothing!

243
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,530
Princess of Xihe keeps defending Duke Su.

244
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:06,470
Is it because you are involved
in the matter?

245
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:08,530
It is possible that General Yuan

246
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:10,599
has been bribed by someone
since the beginning

247
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:13,000
and has stopped listening to Your Majesty.

248
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:14,660
Keep quiet!

249
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:15,930
Shut up, all of you.

250
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:20,829
Duke Su.

251
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:24,660
Do you still remember
why you are back in the capital?

252
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,730
Now, you not only keep creating messes,

253
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:31,280
you also can't even prove your innocence.

254
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,130
How ridiculous!

255
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,140
-Your Majesty, I...
-Stop talking.

256
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,310
Men.

257
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,390
-Arrest Duke Su.
-Yes!

258
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:46,790
Your Majesty.

259
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,990
Duke Huai has something
important to report.

260
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:50,000
Hao'er?

261
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:53,320
Bring him in.

262
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,400
Yes.

263
00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:00,320
Summoning Duke Huai.

264
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:14,960
Greetings, Your Majesty.

265
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:16,540
Greetings, Your Majesty.

266
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:18,940
Fu Rong.

267
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:20,830
You are not summoned.

268
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,190
Why did you barge in?

269
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:25,030
Please pardon her, Your Majesty.

270
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:28,160
I brought her in.

271
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,040
Your Majesty,

272
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:33,000
I begged Duke Huai to bring me here

273
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:34,570
as I have something vital to inform.

274
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:36,620
It better be important.

275
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:37,910
Otherwise,

276
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,550
I shall punish you for barging in.

277
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,700
Duke Su left behind an important evidence.

278
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,130
I took the effort to send it here.

279
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:48,190
The evidence can prove that
Ruyi Pavilion is innocent.

280
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:57,690
Your Majesty.

281
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:59,420
This is the list of plunders

282
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:01,260
found by Duke Su at Qingfeng Hideout.

283
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:03,390
The list included all the particulars

284
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:04,740
and

285
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,650
the correspondences
between bandits and Duke Cheng.

286
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:10,310
I believe that Your Majesty
will decide wisely.

287
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:13,840
In the hideout, His Highness

288
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,300
not only found the missing
jewellery pieces

289
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,140
but also the weapons
that came from Huxiao Camp.

290
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,810
The culprit of the Kushui Village case

291
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:22,440
is Duke Cheng.

292
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:24,890
All the lost properties in the palace

293
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,930
[Duke Cheng rewarded agate and pearls]

294
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:27,670
were transported out by
Consort Duan or Marquis Xindu.

295
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:30,950
Qingfeng Hideout made profit out of
the properties through Kushui Village.

296
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:33,550
Everything is clearly stated
in the document.

297
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:38,600
Duke Cheng,

298
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:42,370
you are such a good prince.

299
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:44,590
Take a look for yourself!

300
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:47,110
I have been wrongly accused!

301
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,250
This must be the fake evidence

302
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:53,670
produced by both of husband and wife!

303
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:56,030
They are trying to deceive Your Majesty!

304
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,860
Whenever you write the word "reward",

305
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,240
you always miss out a dot.

306
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,350
I tried to correct you when you
were young but it was to no avail.

307
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,270
[Duke Cheng rewarded agate and pearls]

308
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,060
Surprisingly,

309
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:09,830
this word

310
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:14,020
helped me recognise your handwriting!

311
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:15,820
No, Your Majesty.

312
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,460
They must have forged my handwriting.

313
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,990
I have never seen

314
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,840
these correspondences.

315
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:27,250
Your Majesty,

316
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,450
we sneaked into Duke Cheng's Residence

317
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:31,800
and found the dead body of
Qingfeng Hideout's vice leader.

318
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,870
I guess the second leader
tried to tip them off

319
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:36,170
but they murdered him right after
they received the news.

320
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:37,450
He is still alive!

321
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:41,250
You exposed yourself.

322
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:45,530
How dare you say that you are
not colluding with Qingfeng bandits?

323
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:48,570
Your Majesty...

324
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,910
I...

325
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,440
Shut up!

326
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,960
You, raise your head!

327
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,410
Tell me the truth.

328
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,060
Who has colluded with you?

329
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:01,920
Is it Duke Su or Duke Cheng?

330
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:03,210
Your Majesty,

331
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,170
it's Duke Cheng!

332
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,370
Please spare my life, Your Majesty.

333
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,790
How dare you betray me?

334
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,120
Your Majesty!

335
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:21,580
I must put an end to this case today.

336
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,390
Bring Consort Duan here.

337
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:30,880
Flowers can't bloom for a hundred days

338
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:33,490
but human's life can
get better and  better.

339
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:35,130
Huan Yun.

340
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:36,980
Do you know why?

341
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:40,220
That's because Your Highness
is a fortunate person.

342
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,870
Greetings, Your Highness.

343
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:45,470
His Majesty wants to see you.

344
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,500
His Majesty wants to see me?

345
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,840
Did His Majesty say why?

346
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:50,950
No.

347
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:53,150
However, His Majesty demanded
Your Highness to move now.

348
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:54,950
His Majesty wants to see you now.

349
00:21:57,670 --> 00:21:59,390
Please reply to His Majesty that

350
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:01,150
I will depart now.

351
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,120
Yes.

352
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:28,940
Greetings, Your Majesty.

353
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:31,510
Consort Duan.

354
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:33,030
I have a question.

355
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:35,920
With regard to the jewellery case,

356
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:40,090
did you instruct Ornaments Attendant Chen

357
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:42,640
to amend the handover document?

358
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:44,090
Your Majesty,

359
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,420
Ruyi Pavilion embezzled the public fund.

360
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:50,960
What does it have to do with me?

361
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:54,850
I have been wrongly accused.
Please make a wise decision, Your Majesty.

362
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:56,130
Does that mean

363
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:59,260
Ornaments Attendant Chen's death

364
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,070
has nothing to do with you?

365
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,380
Well...

366
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,140
Of course it has nothing to do with me.

367
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:11,220
Look into my eyes

368
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:14,980
and answer one last question.

369
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,610
Duke Cheng colluded with bandits

370
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,900
to hide away materials from the palace.

371
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:24,600
Do you really know nothing about it?

372
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,780
Your Majesty.

373
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:29,690
What are you talking about?

374
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,530
Mao'er has always been
an obedient and sensible child.

375
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:33,980
No way would he do that.

376
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:35,040
This...

377
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:38,840
Someone is trying to set Mao'er up.

378
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:41,400
Consort Duan.

379
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:44,780
As we have been husband
and wife for a long time,

380
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:46,540
I gave you a chance

381
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:50,890
hoping that you would
come clean voluntarily.

382
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:52,380
I didn't expect that

383
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:56,850
you would try to talk your way out
without remorse.

384
00:23:57,450 --> 00:24:00,000
Not only have you committed treason,

385
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:03,680
you have also disappointed me bitterly.

386
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:05,990
Your Majesty.

387
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:18,260
Your Majesty!

388
00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:21,240
Your Majesty, please pardon me!

389
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:23,180
It is not true. It is...

390
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:24,630
Your Majesty!

391
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:26,700
-Your Majesty!
-Men.

392
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:31,460
Arrest Consort Duan and Duke Cheng.

393
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:33,340
Your Majesty!

394
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:36,110
-Your Majesty!
-Father!

395
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:38,130
I am wrongly accused!

396
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:41,800
Your Majesty, I am wrongly accused!

397
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:45,030
Your Majesty!

398
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:48,530
Your Majesty!

399
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:53,370
[Guang Yang Palace]

400
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:56,590
I don't get it.

401
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:01,820
Why are there so many
greedy people in the world?

402
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:03,630
Your Majesty.

403
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,420
Please take care.

404
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,420
All right.

405
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,040
Since the case has come to an end,

406
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:17,340
you may leave if there is nothing else.

407
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,040
Your Majesty.

408
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,080
Since the case has come to an end,

409
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:31,590
I have a request.

410
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,740
You have cleared your name.

411
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:38,640
What else do you want?

412
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:42,690
I beg Your Majesty

413
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:45,500
to take back the decree
to separate me and Duke Su.

414
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:46,820
Your Majesty.

415
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:48,800
Rong'er and I

416
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:50,890
love each other very much.

417
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,900
Please give us a chance.

418
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:05,200
If you ask me,

419
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:08,290
the conflict happened
because of Rong'er willfulness.

420
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:09,610
However,

421
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:11,540
Jin'er is at fault too.

422
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:15,510
Honesty is the foundation of a marriage.

423
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:17,320
If you communicate more with each other,

424
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,980
misunderstandings and gossips
can be avoided.

425
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:21,710
Jin'er,

426
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,620
since you have created a mess,

427
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,770
you should apologize to Rong'er.

428
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,180
Rong'er, same goes to you.

429
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:31,020
You should apologise to Jin'er.

430
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,950
It's my fault.

431
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,980
-I am at fault too.
-It's my fault.

432
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:41,510
-Please don't be mad at me.
-No, it's my fault.

433
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:44,500
-It is really my fault.
-Enough.

434
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:49,100
It's between the two of you.

435
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:51,030
You should solve it by yourselves.

436
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,090
I am tired.

437
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:03,010
Safe journey, Your Majesty.

438
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:09,150
Does that mean His Majesty
will not hold us to account?

439
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:11,080
Though His Majesty is the emperor,

440
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,740
he is a father at the same time.

441
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:14,360
Just like me, His Majesty

442
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:17,460
wishes to see his children
live a safe and happy life.

443
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,780
Since the truth has come to light,

444
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:21,980
no one has the heart
to separate both of you.

445
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:24,510
However, His Majesty
has to honour his words.

446
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:27,570
Since he had made the decree
to separate both of you,

447
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:30,280
His Majesty can't simply
take back his words.

448
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:32,450
Since he doesn't object to it,

449
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,760
just take it as an acquiescence.

450
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:39,800
-Thank you, Mother.
-Thank you, Mother.

451
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:56,650
I am sorry.

452
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:01,190
I know that you wrote the divorce paper

453
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:02,340
because of me.

454
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:06,200
No matter what,

455
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:09,630
you got upset because of me.

456
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:11,590
You were badly injured too.

457
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,270
Do you still remember?

458
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,280
Once, we promised each other

459
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:21,390
no matter what happens,

460
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,910
we must not hide it from each other.

461
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:28,100
You have violated the promise.

462
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,380
Please don't do it again, okay?

463
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:34,320
Sure.

464
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:40,190
By the way, Your Highness,

465
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:43,660
Zhang Yan...

466
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:48,120
He is dead.

467
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:52,310
How did you find the evidence?

468
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:55,430
It is a long story.

469
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,760
I shall tell you in detail later.

470
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,410
You are playing victim.

471
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:07,910
My heart is aching.

472
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,640
Young Master.

473
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:36,190
His Majesty has pronounced a decree.

474
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:39,410
Due to Duke Cheng's unethical misconduct,

475
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:41,120
His Majesty is bitterly disappointed.

476
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,370
[Hence, from today onward,]

477
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:44,590
[Duke Cheng will be stripped
of all his roles]

478
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:46,620
[and locked away in Contemplation Hall]

479
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,150
[to reflect upon himself.]

480
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:50,360
[Cold Palace]

481
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,080
[Consort Duan is demoted too.]

482
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:53,580
[She has been banished
to the Cold Palace.]

483
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:55,840
[She will be served by only one servant.]

484
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:04,360
His Majesty did not push them
into a corner.

485
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:07,140
How about Xu Jin?

486
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:10,040
It seems that His Majesty

487
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,730
did not separate Xu Jin and Ms Fu.

488
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:17,360
Therefore, Ms Fu has once again
moved back to Duke Su's Residence.

489
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:20,150
The Imperial Guards Stamp

490
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:22,920
is back in Xu Jin's hands.

491
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:39,930
Your Highness,

492
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:42,830
Xiao Qi risked his life
to send the evidence to me.

493
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,020
How is his injury?

494
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,320
Don't worry.

495
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:48,670
I treated him with golden needles.

496
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:50,500
As long as he gets some nourishment,

497
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:53,270
I believe that he will recover soon.

498
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:55,450
Sorry for the trouble, Mr Ge.

499
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:58,150
Don't forget about
His Highness's injuries.

500
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:01,150
I told you before,
it's just some minor injuries.

501
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:03,870
Mr Ge.

502
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:06,500
Don't try to deceive me with His Highness.

503
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:10,170
His Highness keeps claiming that
it is just some minor injuries.

504
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,740
I wouldn't deceive you.

505
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:14,210
Look at His Highness.

506
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:15,870
He is strong.

507
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:18,460
He is different from ordinary people.

508
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:19,560
Don't worry.

509
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:28,910
I have fully recovered.

510
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,490
Fine.

511
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:41,830
By the way,

512
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,430
I wish to go back to Fu Residence.

513
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:45,490
I have sent someone to inform Lord Fu.

514
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:48,410
However, it would be the best
if you could go home

515
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:50,070
and apologise to your family.

516
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,050
Many things took place lately.

517
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,250
My parents and my sister
must be really worried about me.

518
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,020
I shall come along with you.

519
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:00,410
I appreciate that

520
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,300
but you better stay back
and nurse your injuries.

521
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:03,670
I will explain to them.

522
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:08,430
[Fu Residence]

523
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,620
What is wrong?

524
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:16,300
I am still alive, am I not?

525
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:17,350
Still alive?

526
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:19,130
What is so good about that?

527
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:20,770
You were imprisoned

528
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,210
and divorced.

529
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:23,630
My heart...

530
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:24,940
Enough.

531
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:27,070
She has come back, hasn't she?

532
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,900
She did not get divorced too.

533
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,130
Stop crying.

534
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,460
It brings bad luck.

535
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,420
You reacted differently now.

536
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,800
Previously, you were busy wiping away
tears at night.

537
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:38,280
Don't talk nonsense.

538
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:43,740
I am sorry for making you worried.

539
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:46,140
But don't worry,

540
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:47,720
I am really doing fine.

541
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:51,000
Ruyi Pavilion will be reopened soon.

542
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:53,610
I am not leaving His Highness either.

543
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,040
By the way, His Highness

544
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,780
intended to come back with me.

545
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,340
However, as he was injured,

546
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:01,010
I told him to stay home
and nurse his injuries.

547
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:02,200
Duke Su is injured?

548
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:04,220
How is he doing?

549
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:06,830
He is okay

550
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,320
but he needs to rest well.

551
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,500
Take good care of him.

552
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:14,700
Rong'er.

553
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:16,860
You should never act alone again.

554
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,340
Look at our parents...

555
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:19,890
I got it.

556
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:21,900
You.

557
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:24,810
Rong, I miss you so much.

558
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:28,240
I only get to see you
once in a long time now.

559
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:32,110
I shall come home more frequently
to keep you company.

560
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,050
Xuan is still the best.

561
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:37,120
She keeps me company all the time.

562
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:39,360
Don't talk nonsense.

563
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,710
Xuan will get married eventually.

564
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,190
Stop saying.

565
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:46,680
Let's eat.

566
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,160
Guan Ge'er, time to eat.

567
00:33:56,490 --> 00:33:58,020
Keep this person properly.

568
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,650
I need him in the future.

569
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:00,750
Yes.

570
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:03,600
By the way,

571
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:06,830
when I met up with you
at the official path yesterday,

572
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:08,630
I bumped into Xiao Qi and Xiao Ba.

573
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:11,600
Initially, I had planned to catch
both of them.

574
00:34:12,469 --> 00:34:14,570
However, Uncle San suddenly
came out of nowhere.

575
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:16,699
I only had the chance to murder Xiao Ba.

576
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,020
Xiao Qi...

577
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:21,010
He was saved by Uncle San.

578
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:22,770
You failed to kill both of them

579
00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:26,060
and you failed to bring him back alive!

580
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:31,190
Spread the mark.

581
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,949
We must lure everyone else

582
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:34,820
to show up.

583
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:36,510
Yes.

584
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,020
Your Highness.

585
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:49,949
You should be taking a rest.

586
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:52,820
You made this kite?

587
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:59,230
Today, I planned to fly the kite.

588
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:02,230
Too bad, the weather is not good.

589
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:03,680
It's raining.

590
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:05,690
We can do it next time.

591
00:35:09,570 --> 00:35:11,300
Have you ever thought about it?

592
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:13,640
If

593
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:15,740
we had never met each other,

594
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:17,990
what would have happened to us?

595
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:22,280
As for me,

596
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,090
I think I would still be single.

597
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:27,840
Your Highness might have married Cui Wan.

598
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:30,320
You would still be
Chief Commander of the Imperial Guards

599
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,290
who punishes corrupted officials.

600
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:34,970
I would be creating jewellery
at Ruyi Pavilion.

601
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:38,710
Most likely we would
never meet each other.

602
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,770
Don't get upset. You asked the question.

603
00:35:42,770 --> 00:35:43,870
I am not mad.

604
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,790
I feel scared after knowing it.

605
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:48,080
Scared?

606
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,580
What makes you scared?

607
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,550
Why are you holding a pair of
embroidered shoes?

608
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:03,910
I have just got the shoes done.

609
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:05,270
I wish to show them to you.

610
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:06,530
Are they good looking?

611
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,250
We met each other anyway.

612
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:13,130
Even if we travel back in time,

613
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:14,530
or a thousand years pass,

614
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,840
as long as we meet each other,

615
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,570
we will still fall in love
with each other, right?

616
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:50,820
Rong'er, look.

617
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:52,100
When you were not around,

618
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,990
I redesigned the ledger.

619
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:56,420
I added a column for materials.

620
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:58,040
It is clearer now, isn't it?

621
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,830
It is easier to comprehend.

622
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:02,920
Look at this.

623
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:05,080
His Majesty permitted Ruyi Pavilion

624
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:06,560
to provide jewellery again.

625
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:09,470
Look, I created a ledger specially
for jewellery sold to the palace.

I am here to congratulate
the reopening of Ruyi Pavilion.

00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:46,670
Thank you for the thoughtful present,
Little Marquis.

637
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:47,860
Am I right, sister?

638

What is going on?

650
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,880
Why are you alone? Where is Xiao Ba?

651
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:01,140
Where did you get it?

652
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,790
We have been struggling.

653
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:04,500
No harm earning some money

from the bandits.

655
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:11,230
I thought it is some precious treasure.

656
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:12,900
Turns out it is just a book.

657
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:16,090
Why do the bandits study like scholars?

[Duke Cheng rewarded five carts
of weapons, jade and pearl]

This if proof of the collusion
between Duke Cheng and the bandits.

660
00:39:24,890 --> 00:39:26,280
However, Duke Su has left

It is okay. We can wait for him
at the main path.

00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:30,820
Who were those people?

680
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:32,310
Why did they go after you?

681
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:38,730
Xiao Qi.

682
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,560
His Highness is my husband.

683
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,750
I trust him the most.

684
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:43,800
In the future,

685
00:41:43,930 --> 00:41:45,190
we might need his help.

686
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:46,510
You can be honest to us.

687
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,660
Your Highness.

688
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:52,790
Do you know the real identity

689
00:41:53,450 --> 00:41:54,690
of Ruyi Pavilion?

690
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,060
Ruyi Pavilion

691
00:41:58,150 --> 00:42:00,350
is the place that produces jewellery
for every woman in the world.

692
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:02,210
That is just part of its identity.

693
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:05,700
Ruyi Pavilion conducts
another type of business.

694
00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:10,480
It gathers and sells
all kinds of information.

695
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:15,170
People who work for Ruyi Pavilion
are all over the world.

696
00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:16,700
Be it corrupted officials,

697
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,030
or business competitors,

698
00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:22,540
all the news would go to
the owner of Ruyi Pavilion

699
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:24,300
and she would sell it

700
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:26,540
or trade it.

701
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:30,510
Xiao Ba and I might appear to be
fooling around in the capital,

702
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,370
but we are actually gathering secrets.

703
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:38,170
What does this pattern mean?
