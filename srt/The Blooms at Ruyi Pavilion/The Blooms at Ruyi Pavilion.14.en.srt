5
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,550
A fight happened here

6
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,110
What are you doing?

7
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:49,070
Your Highness

8
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,130
It smells of sulphur powder inside

9
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,710
It's faint

10
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:57,020
Someone must've cleaned it

11
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:23,730
This is the cloth of Mr Dong's garment

12
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,190
And the sulphur powder

13
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:27,060
Here is where the trap was laid

14
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,340
Mr Dong was here

15
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:31,350
If he wanted to attack you,

16
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:33,340
why did he stop after one hit?

17
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:35,550
If he wasn't attacking you,

18
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,750
then why...

19
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:40,370
Look

20
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,390
This blood stain on the rock

21
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,020
This explains that

22
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:45,890
Mr Dong was not alone

23
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:47,150
Perhaps...

24
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,560
He wanted to rescue you

25
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,620
But he was injured instead

26
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:04,270
So he might have been threatened too

27
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:06,730
Aside from the cloth,

28
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,550
I heard that

31
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,170
was also kidnapped before

32
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:18,190
Did you find out who did it?

33
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:20,149

I'm not defending uncle

36

I just wanted to

37
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,760
find the truth of the case

38
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,560
Dong Fang Li killed himself
for his own greed

39
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:39,980
I reminded you before

40
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,300
When you were assigned as the Commander
of the Imperial Guards,

41
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:48,200
you must obtain every evidence for
the cases you're investigating

42
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,510
Have you forgotten?

43
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:53,620
No, I didn't

44
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:55,850
Logically,

45
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,260
you should be the first
to discover this case

46
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:01,270
But Mao'er got ahead of you

47

If not,

48
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:05,640
Dong Fang Li wouldn't have to die

49
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:09,230
The culprit would also be found

50

You

51
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:13,910

But there's concrete evidence and
he killed himself too

00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,800
Sure

174
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,300
I shall leave for now

175
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,030
Fu Rong

176
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,060
Why are you here?

177
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:38,320
How's your injury?

178
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,010
I'm fine

179
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:01,810
I promised to give you an explanation

180
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:05,150
But the bangle was given to me
from my close ones

181
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:07,050
I can't tell you directly

182
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,200
I hope you can give me some time

183
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:11,890
Fu Rong

184
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:14,590
Things are not as simple as you think

185
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,490
I worry that you'll be involved

186
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:19,110
It would be dangerous

187
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,490
How can it be when I said
it's from my close ones?

188
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:25,450
A person's heart is unfathomable

189
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,400
Do you know how important she is to me?

190
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:33,490
More than your life?

191
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,430
What is it?

192
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:58,260
Why is it turning dark?

193
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:00,420
This...

194
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,380
What's happening?

195
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,620
Why did the sky turn dark?
It's weird

196
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:07,990
Oh no

197
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:13,390
Why did the sky turn dark suddenly?

198
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,770
Run

199
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:21,930
Run

200
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,680
-Miss Xuan
-Bao Zhu

201
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:29,630
Bao Zhu

202
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,370
The Heavenly Dog is eating the sun.
You should hurry back

203
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:35,090
You might get eaten by it

204
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,630
Solar eclipse is normal

205
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:38,650
The one who eats humans

206
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:40,320
is human himself

207
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:42,870
There's something in your words

208
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:45,760
I know well about the people around me

209
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,730
I don't think so

210
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:54,710
Bao Zhu

211
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:57,840
Run

212
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,040
I'm sorry

213
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:19,880
How dare you steal at this hour?

214
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:22,740
-You want money over your life?
-Please hear me out

215
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:23,940
-Hear me out?
-Mister

216
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,610
Go away

217
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:33,650
Yes, mister. I'll go away

218
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:40,120
Ms Fu

219
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:42,850
We meet again

220
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:45,310
Which one is yours?

221
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:54,180
I can't see clearly in the dark

222
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:57,100
There's a lotus on mine

223
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:00,890
This one?

224
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:03,500
I'll send the others to the magistrate

225
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,380
Thank you, Little Marquis

226
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,359
But,

227
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:09,599
can you not appear suddenly everytime

228
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,260
and end things with violence?

229
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,190
-Little Marquis
-Ms Fu

230
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:34,680
If I didn't kick him harder just now,

231
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:37,340
could I have found so many purses?
That time as well

232
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:38,870
That bully looked so fierce

233
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,140
Would he listen to me
if I was soft with him?

234
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:42,020
Should I

235
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:45,240
beg with them nicely then?

236
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,610
That's not what I meant

237
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:48,840
Really?

238
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,030
The Heavenly Dog is eating the sun

239
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,890
The Heavenly Dog is eating the sun

240
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,380
Don't be scared

241
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:03,600
They're chasing the Heavenly Dog away

242
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:13,700
Ms Fu

243
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,320
If I hold you like this,

244
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:16,990
you won't be afraid, right?

245
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:30,560
-You're a pig
-Heavenly Dog eating the sun

246
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,920
Hurry and hide, hurry home

247
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,780
-What did you say?
-Hurry and hide

248
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:37,460
-I said you're a pig
-Hurry home

249
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:42,050
You couple are still bickering?
Look at what's happening now

250
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:43,980
The Heavenly Dog will eat you up.
Hide

251
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,520
What couple? Say it clearly

252
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,230
Heavenly Dog eats human?
It's the Heavenly Dog

253
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:48,240
How can it eat mortals?

254
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,120
Knock?

255
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:51,190
Serves you right for knocking

256
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,640
You think you're the only one who can hit
the gong?

257
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,930
It's brightening up, it's finally bright

258
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:20,800
What hands do I have?

259
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:22,580
I've made the sky bright

260
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,380
Not even Nuwa can do this

261
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:29,730
-The Heavenly Dog is gone
-Our Corporal

262
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:31,490
is indeed young and romantic

263
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:33,250
The Heavenly Dog eats the sun

264
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:34,750
Everyone is in a panic

265
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:37,080
But our Corporal is not panicked,

266
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:39,110
instead he's flirting with a pretty girl

267
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:40,560
-Formidable
-I'll punish you

268
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,090
if you speak nonsense again

269
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:45,050
Let's run

270
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:54,070
I'm sorry

271
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,390
I'm too lenient

272
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:57,070
They're not even afraid of me

273
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,530
They like to joke around with me

274
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:03,090
Thank you for taking back my purse,
Little Marquis

275
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:05,150
Please give it to me

276
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:06,930
I have to return home quickly

277
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,360
When did I say I'm returning
it back to you?

278
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:15,480
This purse belongs to me now

279
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:19,720
Give it back

280
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:22,440
Are you okay, miss?

281
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:25,430
The people are panicking

282
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,160
I must enter the palace now

283
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,380
Don't be afraid

284
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:31,160
This is a natural phenomenon

285
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,920
It won't happen again

286
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:35,510
Who's afraid?

287
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:38,640
Even if the Heavenly Dog
eats the sun again,

288
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:40,480
I have ways to deal with it

289
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,430
Didn't I tell you before

290
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:45,780
that this Ruyi emblem

291
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,540
was found in Qi Ce's letter?

292
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,530
A few days ago,

293
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:53,730
I found this emblem

294
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,400
inside  a box

295
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:57,980
in my uncle's study room

296
00:20:58,660 --> 00:20:59,800
Even Mr Dong?

297
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:04,630
They were being used by someone
before their deaths

298
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:06,970
This emblem

299
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:10,110
might be the clue to solve this mystery

300
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:15,990
I don't know who you're keeping things for

301
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:17,750
But I believe that

302
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:19,800
if you're suspicious,

303
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:23,910
you won't wear this bangle openly
in front of me

304
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,420
You didn't pursue me on the matter

305
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:31,570
because of this coincidence

306
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:33,450
Didn't you say

307
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,180
you're giving half of your luck to me?

308
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:39,980
I don't want your luck

309
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:43,710
I'll wait for you to tell me the truth

310
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,160
Most importantly,

311
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:51,700
I trust you

312
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:56,690
I'm leaving now

313
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:00,170
Wait

314
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:04,150
Thank you for trusting me

315
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:15,170
[Master]

316
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:17,810
[What is exactly happening?]

317
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:25,950
Long live Your Majesty

318
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:27,930
Rise

319
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,870
Thank you, Your Majesty

320
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:35,280
For phenomena happened today.

321
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,170
What do you all suggest?

322
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:41,170
How can a solar eclipse happen suddenly?

323
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:44,340
What do you all have to say about this?

324
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,220
Report

325
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:46,960
Emergency from Jichang City

326
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:48,920
Go

327
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,150
Mount Tai collapsed

328
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,180
Huge boulders caused casualties

329
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:55,340
Yu Hua Pavilion and Hong Fu Temple
were destroyed

330
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:56,970
What?

331
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,200
Your Majesty

332
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:00,930
Could it be that there's injustice
and unfairness

333
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:02,160
in Jichang City?

334
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:04,320
Therefore such phenomenon happened

335
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:06,250
Stop

336
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,580
Session adjourned

337
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,210
Session adjourned

338
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,740
Seeing Your Majesty off

339
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,100
Your Majesty

340
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,790
Duke An is here

341
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:41,940
Please, Duke An

342
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:44,670
Respects to Royal Brother

343
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:46,030
My brother

344
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:47,390
Have a seat

345
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:58,870
I see you look troubled

346
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:02,390
Are you worried about the solar eclipse?

347
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,370
This is a great evil omen

348
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,310
How can I not be worried?

349
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:11,920
I don't think so

350
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:13,470
Since the ancient times,

351
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:15,570
solar eclipses have been happening

352
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,620
In my opinion,

353
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,960
how can the moon have plenty of looks

354
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:24,130
but not the sun?

355
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:28,170
Besides,

356
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:31,300
Dayu is getting even more prosperous

357
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:32,850
with your wise management

358
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,480
Where is the danger?

359
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,950
But Jichang City was alright all the while

360
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:44,990
Why did Mount Tai suddenly collapse?

361
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:58,320
Astronomer Hu may be right

362
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:01,530
There's injustice in Jichang City

363
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,200
What injustice can there be?

364
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:12,000
Did the people suffer from building
the Yu Hua Pavilion?

365
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,640
But I didn't approve any construction

366
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:15,700
Brother

367
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:18,190
It may not be a present incident

368
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,720
but something that happened in the past

369
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:25,950
Not only Yu Hua Pavilion
was destroyed,

370
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:30,520
but Hong Fu Temple as well

371
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:40,010
What could have happened
at Hong Fu Temple?

372
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:42,270
I think

373
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:46,630
Astronomer Hu is getting senile

374
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:19,710
Rong'er

375
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,690
Master

376
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:30,710
Rong'er

377
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:33,210
If you're curious,

378
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,320
you can ask me directly

379
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,080
I'll ask you then

380
00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:43,830
The emblem on this bangle

381
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,190
What does it mean?

382
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,040
Didn't I tell you personally?

383
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,390
I designed it myself

384
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:49,890
It doesn't mean anything

385
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:53,090
But why did the emblem appear
with Qi Ce and Mr Dong?

386
00:26:57,930 --> 00:26:59,460
It may be a coincidence

387
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:00,850
Coincidence?

388
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,980
Didn't you say this emblem
is one and only?

389
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,950
Mr Dong went to Hong Village

390
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,070
The woman I saw there was you

391
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,920
Master

392
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:11,500
I want you to tell me yourself

393
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,300
What exactly is happening here?

394
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,440
Rong'er

395
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:21,800
From the first time you called me master,

396
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,660
you're my only disciple

397
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:30,070
The person I want to protect is you

398
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:33,070
This bangle

399
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:34,950
Keep it properly

400
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,970
I'll never harm you

401
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:43,000
You always wanted me to keep
this bangle safely

402
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,510
I just want to know what is it being used

403
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,240
Master

404
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:54,920
I never thought about suspecting you

405
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:58,140
But you're not telling me anything
or explaining to me

406
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:59,720
I don't know what I should do

407
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:02,850
Rong'er

408
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:04,300
I don't wish that one day

409
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:07,730
I will not lose my trust in you

410
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,220
Rong'er

411
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,380
Wen Xing

412
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:34,750
Have a seat

413
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:41,880
Young Master

414
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:43,420
In such a short time,

415
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:45,400
the people are all in a panic

416
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:49,270
If we use Mr Ju Shui's name

417
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:50,760
and make a slight push,

418
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:53,380
everyone would think that

419
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:56,970
the solar eclipse happened
because of an injustice

420
00:28:57,050 --> 00:28:57,930
There's no need

421
00:28:58,810 --> 00:28:59,830
All these years,

422
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:02,990
brother has been hiding the true cause of

423
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:05,800
mother's death from the world

424
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:10,470
Mother was forced to be buried
outside Jichang City

425
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:13,070
I just want the truth

426
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,890
I just want him to tell me he was wrong

427
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:20,810
But he insisted to cover up for his son

428
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:25,080
He can't blame me for it

429
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:29,640
What ulterior motives is
Duke An planning now?

430
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:32,950
You came uninvited, Mistress

431
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:34,320
What's the matter?

432
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,800
Duke An

433
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:40,310
You told me previously that

434
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:43,570
you'll blow up a small piece
of the inscription

435
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:44,880
But now,

436
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,990
Mount Tai collapsed

437
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:49,500
The pavilions were almost destroyed

438
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:54,800
There were so many innocent
people in Jichang City

439
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:56,630
So many monks in Hong Fu Temple

440
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,980
They're now dead under the boulders

441
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:06,840
The collapse of Mount Tai

442
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,420
and the destruction of the pavilions

443
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,910
Will I earn anything from them?

444
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:13,790
This matter

445
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:18,360
must've been done by the Prefect of
Jichang City, Shang Kai Yang

446
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:24,700
You nurtured him too

447
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,330
But why, Mistress,

448
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:29,190
did you push the blame onto me?

449
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:31,400
What will Shang Kai Yang obtain

450
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,370
from doing this?

451
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,170
I want to know as well

452
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:36,930
If it was me,

453
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,420
I'd rather keep the firepower nicely

454
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:42,200
I'll use it another way

455
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:45,860
I won't be like that useless person

456
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:47,630
who created a mess

457
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,670
About Shang Kai Yang,

458
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:52,770
I really hope that you're ignorant

459
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:01,740
Young Master, This Liu Ru Yi...

460
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:04,130
She won't collaborate with me again

461
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:07,510
Wen Xing

462
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:10,400
Keep in contact with Shang Kai Yang

463
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,130
with Mr Liu's alias

464
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:13,140
Another thing

465
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:16,050
Handle this carefully

466
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:19,260
Don't leave any tracks for Liu Ru Yi

467
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:21,640
We have to step things up

468
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:23,700
with the token too

469
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:25,110
Yes, sir

470
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:31,090
After pondering for a whole night,

471
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:34,040
I've made my decision

472
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:38,750
No matter what caused the solar eclipse,

473
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:42,310
we have to solve the crisis
before our eyes

474
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:44,380
Duke Cheng

475
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:45,690
Yes, Royal Father

476
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,200
Go to the royal mausoleum

477
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,370
Have a detailed check on the structures

478
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:51,910
Yes, Father

479
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:53,580
Duke Su

480
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:54,720
Yes, Father

481
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,530
Go to Jichang City

482
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:58,290
Investigate the collapse

483
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:01,660
Quickly refurbish Hong Fu Temple
and Yu Hua Pavilion

484
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,600
Yes, Father

485
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:03,920
Duke Huai

486
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,280
Yes, Father

487
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,270
Pray at the ancestral hall

488
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:10,300
Pray to our ancestors

489
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:13,110
for blessings to Dayu's prosperity

490
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,570
Yes, Father

491
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:21,340
[Ruyi Pavilion]

492
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:26,580
[Master avoided my question
about the bangle]

493
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:28,560
[There must be a secret about it]

494
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:32,300
[But how should I ask her this time?]

495
00:32:53,860 --> 00:33:01,340
[Ruyi Pavilion]

496
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,620
[Where is Master going with her baggage?]

497
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,740
To Jichang City

498
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,600
Going out of town?

499
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:41,270
Where are you going?

500
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:43,130
I don't... Follow that carriage

501
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:44,540
No problem

502
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,620
-But for the price...
-I'm fine with any price

503
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,250
Hurry, the gates are closing

504
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:50,510
-Sure
-Young Lady Rong

505
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:55,670
Young Lady Rong

506
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:57,580
You're leaving town?

507
00:33:58,050 --> 00:34:00,910
I'm going to the Yun Luo Temple
with my master

508
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:02,670
Since you're here,

509
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:03,990
can you inform my family?

510
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:06,120
I didn't notify them that I'm going out

511
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:09,139
Sure

512
00:34:10,909 --> 00:34:12,750
Take care on the way

513
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:14,159
If anything happens...

514
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:16,270
Don't worry

515
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:18,630
I'll send this young lady safely there

516
00:34:18,949 --> 00:34:20,409
Thank you, Little Marquis

517
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,620
Your Highness

518
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,210
You're not returning to your
residence at this hour?

519
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:49,050
Her Highness requested everyone to fast

520
00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:50,980
We're taking turns to chant sutras

521
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:58,240
You're leaving the palace tomorrow?

522
00:34:58,460 --> 00:34:59,340
Yes

523
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:01,100
Please take care

524
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:03,390
Sure

525
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:05,160
You must rest as well

526
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:07,080
Don't get tired

527
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:25,340
Go to him if you can't take it

528
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:30,450
Princess of Xihe

529
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:33,510
How audacious, Princess Consort
of Qingping

530
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,770
Everyone is being cautious

531
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:37,050
for the fasting

532
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:39,010
You're doing well here

533
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:41,710
Openly flirting with Duke Huai?

534
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:45,980
Seems like you're not listening
to His Majesty

535
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:49,150
It's fine for you to vent your anger on me

536
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:52,320
But Duke Huai is Duke Su's younger brother

537
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:55,970
If this goes into Duke Su's ears,

538
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:58,560
how will he think of you?

539
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:02,240
You dare to threaten me?

540
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:03,840
I don't dare

541
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:07,430
I know you're frustrated

542
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:10,220
But rather than waiting in the palace,

543
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:11,820
why don't you take the chance

544
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:14,580
and volunteer to visit Jichang City

545
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:16,560
Volunteer?

546
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:18,980
How can I volunteer?

547
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:21,830
As we all know,

548
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,640
your family is full of loyalty

549
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,840
After your father and brother deceased

550
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:29,010
His Majesty took you into the palace

551
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:30,870
under the Empress Dowager's care

552
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:32,490
after you became an orphan

553
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:33,750
Qi Zhu

554
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,270
How dare you

555
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:38,680
speak about my background like this?

556
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:39,800
Princess

557
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,850
Many of our warriors lost their lives
from Mount Tai's collapse

558
00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:45,470
As a princess,

559
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,180
it's only right for you

560
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:49,950
to pray for them and
console their families

561
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:52,950
From what I know,

562
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:54,880
Jichang City is not large

563
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:58,380
you'll stay in the magistrate
when you're there

564
00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:00,070
That means

565
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:02,490
you can see Duke Su

566
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:04,740
every day and night

567
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:07,320
Su Yu, I'm going to see His Majesty

568
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:10,060
But it's late now, Your Highness

569
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:11,340
There's no buts

570
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:12,750
His Majesty is busy everyday

571
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:14,110
He won't rest at this hour

572
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:14,990
Hurry

573
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:28,850
[West City]

574
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:45,040
Respects to Duke Su from Shang Kai Yang

575
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:45,660
[Shang Kai Yang, Prefect of Jichang City]

576
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:46,840
Respects to Duke Su

577
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:48,340
Rise

578
00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:54,470
You don't have to pay courtesy after this

579
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:57,320
I'm here on behalf of His Majesty today

580
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,840
to investigate the collapse of Mount Tai

581
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:05,630
You must be tired from all the travelling

582
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:07,920
I've sent men to prepare hot water

583
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:09,910
and some warm wine and food

584
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:14,120
You can have a bath and some rest

585
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,130
There's no need for wine

586
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:20,070
The whole of Dayu is fasting now

587
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:22,120
HIs Majesty forbids drinking

588
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,170
Didn't Jichang City receive the order?

589
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:29,550
Yes, I spoke wrongly

590
00:38:29,830 --> 00:38:31,490
There's warm tea and porridge

591
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:32,960
but no warm wine

592
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:36,390
Go and have some rest first

593
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,880
I'll ask Lord Shang to accompany
me in the afternoon

594
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:42,680
-Yes
-Yes

595
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:49,810
How can this be?

596
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:51,180
He doesn't drink

597
00:38:52,010 --> 00:38:53,540
He doesn't even want a woman

598
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:54,780
Lord Shang

599
00:38:55,090 --> 00:38:56,580
What if Duke Su

600
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:58,600
is not interested in wine and lust?

601
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:01,290
Impossible

602
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:03,800
Mr Liu said so

603
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:09,430
Duke Su is alcoholic and lecherous

604
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,070
If we served him well,

605
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:13,210
[Duke Su is alchoholic and lecherous
save yourself by this]

606
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,430
everything will be fine

607
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:15,150
Duke Su is in a high position

608
00:39:15,370 --> 00:39:17,370
He must've seen plenty of nice women

609
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:19,240
Common prostitutes

610
00:39:19,330 --> 00:39:20,730
may not be his preference

611
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:23,470
Why don't we find him some commoners?

612
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:26,330
Perhaps it'll suit his taste

613
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,880
Good

614
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,210
Good

615
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:38,740
Little Marquis

616
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:39,970
Little Marquis

617
00:39:40,270 --> 00:39:41,770
I've waited for a whole night

618
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:43,270
and told Ms Fu once I saw her

619
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:44,760
Who knew after I told her,

620
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:46,870
Ms Fu said she's coming here

621
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,420
with something to discuss

622
00:39:57,610 --> 00:40:02,180
[Imperial Guards]

623
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:04,740
Thank you for informing me,
Little Marquis

624
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:06,980
My sister left Hengjing to Luo Yun Temple

625
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:09,620
Did you see her leave town
with your own eyes?

626
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,530
What do you mean by that?

627
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:13,800
Of course I saw her

628
00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:15,420
Would I lie to you with this?

629
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,120
Please don't misunderstand

630
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,950
I'm not suspecting you

631
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:20,400
It's just that

632
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:21,680
I don't understand

633
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,290
Why did Rong'er go to Yun Luo
Temple in a hurry?

634
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:27,420
You said she was with Ms Liu

635
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:29,550
Did you see Ms Liu?

636
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:32,460
No

637
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:35,210
Maybe they scheduled to
meet outside of town

638
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,410
No way

639
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,640
Thank you, Little Marquis. I'm leaving now

640
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:44,810
Where are you going?

641
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:45,790
Yun Luo Temple?

642
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:48,650
You're in luck

643
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:50,850
I'm on my way to light a holy lamp there

644
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:51,820
Why don't

645
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:54,320
I take you with me in kindness?

646
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:56,440
This...

647
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,570
Sure

648
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,220
If you're really going to Yun Luo Temple,

649
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:07,000
I'll accept your offer

650
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,940
Sure, give me a moment

651
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:25,520
Lord Shang

652
00:41:25,610 --> 00:41:27,980
I've sent men to look for nice
women and nice wine

653
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:29,650
But to ensure no failure,

654
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:32,540
you should send some men to
clean Yu Hua Pavilion up

655
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:36,030
Mr Liu never makes a mistake
with his information

656
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:37,530
Lord Shang

657
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,640
You never met Mr Liu

658
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,620
Is that important?

659
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:44,120
Since coming to Jichang City,

660
00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:46,330
from receiving Mr Liu's first letter,

661
00:41:46,330 --> 00:41:47,910
he has been providing information to me

662
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:49,890
I was guided to the position I'm in now

663
00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:52,450
Mr Liu's ability is extraordinary

664
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:54,460
He knows everything

665
00:41:54,650 --> 00:41:55,980
He's not an ordinary man

666
00:41:56,450 --> 00:41:57,590
In his first letter,

667
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,410
he requested a minor explosion

668
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:02,040
But then wanted us to blow up the
whole Yu Hua Pavilion

669
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,620
and Hong Fu Temple

670
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:06,170
it's really redundant

671
00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:08,740
He's doing this for our own good

672
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:12,110
Mr Liu wanted us to blow up the mountain
during solar eclipse

673
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:15,680
to cover the change of construction
materials for Yu Hua Pavilion

674
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:16,910
If not for Mr Liu,

675
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:19,370
can we think of such a way?

676

[What a pretentious Duke An
with the fake letters]
