00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:42,850
One

Two

7
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:49,009
How did the investigation go?

8
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,700
Your Highness,

9
00:01:50,789 --> 00:01:53,150
those who were just here

10
00:01:53,229 --> 00:01:55,090
to waste time have been kicked out

11
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:57,210
Even the retired General Hu

12
00:01:57,289 --> 00:01:58,650
has been checked

13
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:01,070
Besides the fact that he had
accomplished nothing,

14
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:03,000
he is clean

15
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:05,910
While most of the marquis and
young men that stayed

16
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:07,830
are dedicated to serve the country

17
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:09,830
We'll just train and cultivate them

18
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,490
As long as they keep practicing hard,

19
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,050
soon,

20
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,329
the Imperial Guards

21
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,410
will be seen in a different light

22
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:26,300
Stop! That's it for today

23
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:27,910
Alright

24
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,600
One hundred forty-six,

25
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:33,530
one hundred forty-seven,

26
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:38,420
one hundred forty-eight,
one hundred forty-nine,

27
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:40,270
one hundred fifty.

28
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,110
Little Marquis, that's enough

29
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:43,700
Your punishment is over for today

30
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,460
It's time to rest

31
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:47,660
Only 150

32
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,900
I can do 1,500 more

33
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,380
Little Marquis,

34
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:52,730
I know you can

35
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,230
But you've run for two hours

36
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:55,800
with rock on your back

37
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:59,060
I was the one who let
Young Lady Fu Rong go

38
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,730
I should be punished

39
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:03,870
The Chief Commander is gone

40
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:06,540
Why don't we go have a drink?

41
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,990
I'll beat him one day

42
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:14,890
Little Marquis, where are you going?

43
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:21,070
Western Hill

44
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,990
I want to go outside and play

45
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,060
Master,

46
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:28,010
I've prepared the ink

47
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:31,930
But we're out of paper

48
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:34,670
As your assistant, I'm obliged to go
out and buy some paper

49
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:35,770
Never mind

50
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:38,180
Wen Xing, there's some in the storage room.

51
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,160
Go get it

52
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,510
But they're so stale. I'll get fresh ones

53
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:43,390
Fine

54
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:44,880
Wen Xing, give her some money

55
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,630
-Let her go
-No, I have money

56
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,210
But paper isn't roasted duck

57
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,610
Does freshness count?

58
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:59,550
Let her have her way

59
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,070
But I think

60
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,460
Lu Gong's handwriting

61
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:09,320
is refined but lacks boldness

62
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:11,650
While Xun Gong's handwriting

63
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:15,090
is forceful but lacks finesse

64
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:17,980
That's true

65
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,180
That being said,

66
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:20,940
only Wang Gong's handwriting

67
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,920
combine both qualities,

68
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:26,260
-but it is difficult to imitate
-Are we there yet?

69
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:30,040
The inscriptions are at the mountain top

70
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,640
We're not even halfway there

71
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:34,970
I just wanted to sit at the foot

72
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,220
and eat some floral plum cakes

73
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:40,690
But now, I haven't had any fun
or eaten any cakes

74
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,420
It's so boring

75
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:44,770
If I wanted to see inscriptions,

76
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,500
I could've done so at Ju Shui Pavilion

77
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,580
Rong is still young

78
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:49,200
Her feet aren't that strong

79
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:50,580
In that case,

80
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:53,630
why don't you go back first?

81
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,180
Look, her face has gone pale

82
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:01,150
We're in the middle of nowhere

83
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,660
I can't let you go back alone

84
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,490
Why don't I go with Rong'er?

85
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,100
No

86
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,810
Don't ruin your day because of me

87
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:15,320
There are just roads.
Don't worry about me

88
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,540
That's good

89
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:19,680
Rong, go back
to Ju Shui Pavilion first

90
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,560
I wouldn't have sneaked out
if I knew this would happen

91
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,630
Sister

92
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,550
how about we meet at Ruyi Pavilion later?

93
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:30,980
Master needs your help with his new works

94
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:33,470
All right then. I'll see you at
Ruyi Pavilion

95
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:34,460
Okay

96
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:35,870
See you

97
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,630
Be careful

98
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,900
I know

99
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,320
Let's go

100
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,960
You owe me your life

101
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,340
I've paid you back

102
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,630
Those assassins got some nerve

103
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:57,970
trying to assassinate you
near your camp

104
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:00,440
All thanks to me

105
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,320
You guys go ahead

106
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,830
Stop right there

107
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:20,160
He got away again

108
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:37,800
[Order]

109
00:07:43,659 --> 00:07:45,390
Xiao Ba, you liar

110
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,390
You said the jungle in Western Hill
is full of hunting traps

111
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:51,090
And they could catch anything
that flies or walks

112
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:53,550
But I haven't seen any so far

113
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,450
Little rabbit

114
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:06,790
Stop right there

115
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:34,000
So you're the one who
sent those assassins

116
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,610
What assassins?

117
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:39,470
Wait, do we have to go through
this every time we meet?

118
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:04,920
It really does catch anything
that flies or walks

119
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,950
Duke Su,

120
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,980
this is a misunderstanding

121
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,400
I was hiking with my sister,

122
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,810
but got tired and decided to go back

123
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:13,470
I didn't expect to see you here

124
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:15,810
And I didn't intend to offend you

125
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,300
You can ask my sister
if you don't believe me

126
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,680
And also Lord Qi, he's a witness too

127
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:27,950
You're being trapped

128
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:31,170
If you scream long enough,
someone will come eventually

129
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:33,600
Your Highness,

130
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:37,120
why don't we work something out?

131
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,200
Go on

132
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:41,710
You see,

133
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,000
bad things always happen to you
when we meet

134
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,190
The same goes for me

135
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,420
It's better to put an end to our enmity

136
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,630
Why don't you

137
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,200
give me your clothes? I'll burn it

138
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,620
It may be a little far fetched,

139
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,240
but it's better than doing nothing

140
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,530
What do you say?

141
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:03,000
You want me to take off my
undergarment and give it to you?

142
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,820
If you don't mind,

143
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,350
that would be...

144
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:57,950
Your Highness, have mercy

145
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,630
It was the hunters, not me

146
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,850
Boatman, hurry up. Row away

147
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,190
You can't run away from me forever

148
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,830
Be sensible

149
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,850
Would I run if you hadn't chased me?

150
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,950
Would I chase you if you hadn't run?

151
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,070
I...

152
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,440
Faster, boatman

153
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:50,130
There is an unreasonable man on shore

154
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:51,990
I'm afraid he might swim over here

155
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,240
Thank you, boatman

156
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:22,080
Master

157
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:26,080
Since when did the stationery
store move to Western Hill?

158
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:31,180
I sneaked out to go hiking with my sister

159
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:33,780
I just wanted to take a walk
and look at some scenery

160
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:36,190
Unfortunately, I bumped into Duke Su

161
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:39,190
He kept accusing me of sending
assassins after him

162
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,940
If it weren't for my quick thinking,

163
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:43,590
I would have been dead

164
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,100
There must be a misunderstanding

165
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:48,900
By right, you are his saviour

166
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:50,410
He should thank you instead

167
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:51,910
Exactly

168
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:55,250
Maybe some people are born ungrateful

169
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,210
No. From what I see,
he's a brilliant general

170
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,900

I have loved you
ever since I was little

All I cared about

185
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,790
was to marry you when I grow up

186
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,960
But my father was taken before his time

187
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:57,690
And things weren't well in my family

188
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,770
That's why I have kept
my feelings to myself

189
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,660
But it's different now

190

we should not be talking about this
without my family's consent

196

You're right, Xuan

197

00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,850
Okay

340
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,200
[Duke Su sure has a lot of free time]

341
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,630
[I keep seeing him]

342
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,400
[He's everywhere]

343
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,550
Running away?

344
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,630
Who's running away?
I have nothing to hide

345
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:05,910
Your Highness,

346
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:10,570
may I know what my assistant
has done to offend you?

347
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,920
That day when the beam
of Ju Shui Pavilion fell,

348
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,640
Ms Fu was there too

349
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:21,570
I need to borrow her

350
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,800
Your people have already

351
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:31,210
conducted a thorough inspection here

352
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,690
And I've always been obliging

353
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:37,150
Yet you keep suspecting my assistant

354
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:39,150
Your Highness,

355
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,200
please leave now

356
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,350
Thank you, Master

357
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,990
You're my assistant

358
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,600
Of course I'm on your side

359
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:09,440
Your Highness, after you left that day,

360
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,640
Mr Wu had been a great help

361
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,280
He noticed something
unusual about the flag

362
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,560
used by the assassins

363
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:17,500
It's made of fine fabric

364
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:23,880
Zhi Yun Textiles

365
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:27,180
No ordinary man can afford fabric
from Zhi Yun Textiles

366
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:30,390
Let alone make flags with it

367
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:33,360
Liang Tong

368
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:34,710
Are you saying

369
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,600
Liang Tong and the assassins
are working for the same man?

370
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,590
That's right

371
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,510
Liang Tong may be a Deputy Commander,

372
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:43,280
but the Liangs aren't a prominent family

373
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:46,770
Your Highness, that day when you were
appointed as Chief Commander,

374
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:48,780
he had the nerve to give us a hard time

375
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,770
It means he must have
someone to back him up

376
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,130
Now that you've got it figured out,

377
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:57,010
start looking into Zhi Yun Textiles

378
00:24:57,710 --> 00:24:58,950
Zhi Yun Textiles?

379
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,810
That's where women buy clothes

380
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,430
Your Highness, I don't want to go

381
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:09,550
Why don't you go instead?

382
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:13,640
You are wise, Your Highness

383
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,380
Look at her

384
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:25,300
-Why does she look like that?
-Exactly

385
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:32,600
Look at her

386
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:45,140
Please take a look

387
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:46,980
How much is it?

388
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:50,520
Excellent taste. This four-ends
Leno fabric just came in

389
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:52,170
Check out that floral pattern

390
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:53,630
It'll look fabulous on you

391
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:56,800
Excuse me for a moment

392
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:05,820
-The bird pattern looks nice
-This is crane fabric

393
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:08,680
What a coincidence.
You've come at the right time

394
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:10,560
These just arrived at the store

395
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,160
They are ten taels per piece

396
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,280
What?

397
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:15,800
Commoners spend
less than ten taels a year

398
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:18,450
A piece of fabric here
actually costs ten taels?

399
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:20,080
Zhi Yun Textiles

400
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:23,380
caters specifically to wealthy families

401
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:25,110
and bureaucrats

402
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,160
Commoners can't afford this

403
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:28,880
Bureaucrats?

404
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,370
Look at this

405
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,680
Look at this. Look

406
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:33,850
There is a hole

407
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:36,180
This is obviously a rip-off

408
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:41,940
I knew that there was
something fishy about you

409
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:49,420
-What's going on?
-Scram

410
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:52,500
I'll break your leg
if you come here again

411
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:07,240
Sir, a bowl of noodles, please

412
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:08,650
Coming up

413
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,850
Ms Xu,

414
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,440
you've been there for a while

415
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:19,340
Have you got anything?

416
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:24,530
Your Highness,

417
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:28,270
Ms Xu made a great contribution today

418
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:32,540
If he hadn't distracted the worker,

419
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:35,540
I wouldn't be able to steal
the list of orders so easily

420
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:47,470
As expected of the prosecutor of
the Criminal Investigation Bureau

421
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:50,710
Zhi Yun Textiles' largest orders
for the past year

422
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:52,740
were all made by him

423
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:55,170
The Criminal Investigation Bureau

424
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:57,970
took on the case
at Ju Shui Pavilion last time

425
00:27:58,130 --> 00:27:59,290
I've looked into him

426
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:02,330
He was promoted to general of
Xiyuan before his tenure ended

427
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:05,880
After that, he bounced between
seventh and eighth rank official

428
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,520
He was then appointed as
Superintendent of the Guards

429
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,040
He met Marquis Xindu, Zhang Yao Cheng

430
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:13,210
He made several great contributions,

431
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:15,210
and was granted special promotions

432
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:17,380
That's how he became

433
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:20,550
the prosecutor of the
Criminal Investigation Bureau

434
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:23,890
Qi Ce.

435
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:26,790
Marquis Xindu

436
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:37,480
[Qin Qing, Owner of Drunken Spring Court]

437
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,580
Xiao Ba said he saw Qi Ce in
Drunken Spring Court last night

438
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:59,260
He said he loves my sister,

439
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:01,460
yet he hung out in a brothel

440
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:04,570
What a hypocrite

441
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:06,920
He certainly won't be loyal to my sister

442
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:12,420
This won't do.

443
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:14,920
I can't let her marry Qi Ce

444
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,560
I need to go home

445
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,490
Then what should I...

446
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:20,050
Stay here and pretend to be me

447
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:22,450
Master won't come until these letters
have been distributed

448
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:23,820
See you

449
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:46,250
Young Master,

450
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:49,510
Ms Fu climbed over the
wall and sneaked out again

451
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:56,550
Let her be

452
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:59,010
By the way, Wen Xing,

453
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:02,920
the red date tree in the backyard
is getting out of hand

454
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:04,560
Put a ladder beside it

455
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:07,420
so that I can use it
when I trim the branches

456
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:08,960
Yes

457
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,080
Sister,

458
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:23,610
you can't marry Qi Ce

459
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:26,000
Shouldn't you be at Ju Shui Pavilion?

460
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,090
What?

461
00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:28,830
Did you sneak back home again?

462
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:31,180
I said you can't marry Qi Ce

463
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,960
Stop acting like a child

464
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:36,110
I'm serious. You mustn't marry him

465
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:38,830
Tell me then, why can't I marry him?

466
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:40,780
Just look at him

467
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:43,490
He's no husband material.
You'll be mistreated

468
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:44,620
That's nonsense

469
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:45,600
I...

470
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:47,480
If Zhu'er hears about this

471
00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:49,950
and finds out you're badmouthing
her brother,

472
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:51,320
she'll get angry at you

473
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:53,700
Zhu'er and her brother are not the same

474
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,550
Rong'er,

475
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:01,090
why are you messing about here

476
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:02,500
instead of studying?

477
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:04,620
I'm not messing about

478
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,170
Sister can't marry Qi Ce

479
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:08,170
He won't treat her well

480
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:09,240
Master,

481
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,940
Rong'er is here because
she's worried about Xuan'er

482
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,720
Don't blame her

483
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:15,910
Rong'er,

484
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,830
I know you're worried about your sister

485
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:20,590
But you two are going to
get married eventually

486
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:23,720
I've watched Ce'er grow up

487
00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:25,090
He's reliable,

488
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:26,560
and has a bright future

489
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:29,780
Among other things,
he loves Xuan'er deeply

490
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:31,640
It's such a great marriage

491
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:33,390
Don't ruin it

492
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:36,050
You don't know what
kind of person Qi Ce is

493
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:38,370
And you don't know what will
happen after she marries him

494
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:41,280
The point is he's not
a good person. He's bad

495
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:42,470
Rong'er,

496
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:43,990
we didn't raise you

497
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:46,500
to defame other people like this

498
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:53,680
-Rong'er
-She's being difficult

499
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,720
If Qi Ce is really like
how Xiao Ba said he is,

500
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:01,920
there must be proof

501
00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:03,090
If they don't believe me,

502
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:05,510
-I'll convince them with proof
-Miss, you're back

503
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:07,370
What proof are you talking about?

504
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:09,380
Nothing

505
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,190
Rong,

506
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:14,620
[Second son of Marquis Xindu, Zhang Yan]

507
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:13,800
it's been a while

508
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:15,810
Are you mad at me, Rong?

509
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:18,520
I haven't been able to come back

510
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:20,030
as I was busy in the south

511
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:22,050
I heard you're injured,

512
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,210
so I brought you some fine medicine

513
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:25,750
And this jade pendant

514
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:27,940
I prayed for it with all my heart

515
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:29,750
It means "double happiness"

516
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:31,090
It's very auspicious

517
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:33,630
Rong, do you like it?

518
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:35,960
Thank you for thinking of me

519
00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:37,980
I can't accept this

520
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:40,160
It's fine, Rong

521
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:41,930
I brought gifts for Mr Fu, Mrs Fu

522
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:44,270
and Xuan as well

523
00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:47,090
Thank you

524
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:49,170
Just leave them inside

525
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:51,490
I mustn't accept gifts in private

526
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:57,350
By the way, Rong,

527
00:32:57,430 --> 00:33:00,630
do you know Zhu is having
an engagement banquet tomorrow?

528
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,410
Which reminds me,

529
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,310
I need to prepare a gift for her

530
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,730
Would you like to come in?

531
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:09,130
I'll inform Mr and Mrs Fu

532
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:10,890
Never mind

533
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:12,550
Rong is so kind

534
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,370
I'll help her pick a gift

535
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,320
Rong,

536
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:23,170
is something bothering you?

537
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:26,280
My sister is getting married

538
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:27,790
I'm upset

539
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,280
Isn't that a good thing?

540
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,780
Once your sister's marriage is settled,

541
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:36,190
I'll be able to propose

542
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:38,480
Wouldn't want mother

543
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:41,840
to object to our marriage
on account of the custom

544
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:44,180
that the elder sister should marry first

545
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,580
Don't you think that's just
Lady Xindu's excuse

546
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:51,120
to stop me from
marrying into the Xindu family?

547
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,120
Rong,

548
00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:53,530
why would you think that?

549
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:55,190
Mother would never think that

550
00:33:56,710 --> 00:34:00,570
Besides, I don't think parents
should make the call on marriage

551
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:02,990
What I want is more important

552
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:18,350
You still don't get what I mean

553
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,489
I...

554
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:22,210
I just want you to be happy

555
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:26,000
I'll say it again

556
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:27,150
First of all,

557
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:30,770
I believe that there's nothing more
important than my own feelings

558
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:32,170
Second,

559
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:33,780
I don't want your jade pendant

560
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,020
Do you get it now?

561
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:38,320
You don't want my jade pendant?

562
00:34:39,989 --> 00:34:43,420
Rong, I'll give it to you again
when you're in a better mood

563
00:34:47,449 --> 00:34:49,100
-So pretty
-Zhu'er

564
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:51,250
Rong'er

565
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,320
It's been a while

566
00:34:53,409 --> 00:34:54,909
Long time no see

567
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:57,600
-Earl Yan
-Zhu

568
00:34:57,690 --> 00:34:59,830
It feels like ages since I last saw you

569
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,140
When will I see you again
if you're married?

570
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:04,230
I'll miss you terribly

571
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,920
Aren't you sweet?

572
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:09,470
Rong,

573
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,890
you seem very close with Qi Zhu

574
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:13,120
Yet you seem

575
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:14,930
to keep your distance from me

576
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:16,270
If you're Countess Yan

577
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:18,860
instead of Earl Yan,
I would be close to you too

578
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:23,460
See anything you like?

579
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,090
I'm still looking

580
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:32,440
This looks nice

581
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:37,500
It's too extravagant, Rong'er

582
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,780
I like those

583
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:43,520
That's your dowry.
It should be extravagant

584
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:45,450
That's what I told her

585
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:47,880
Zhu'er tends to dress plainly

586
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,680
You could wear silver jewelry

587
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:52,980
But you must certainly wear red
on your wedding day

588
00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:55,720
And silver wouldn't match it

589
00:35:55,810 --> 00:35:58,130
That's right. Gold goes
really well with red

590
00:35:58,130 --> 00:35:59,530
Like this gold hairpin

591
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:03,420
Not to brag, but other than my master,
no one in Hengjing can make this

592
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:05,330
It's too ostentatious

593
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:07,020
I'm not used to it

594
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:08,480
Besides,

595
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:11,010
I'm worried that my future in-laws
would be unhappy with it

596
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:12,880
Since you like it simple,

597
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:14,520
take this one then

598
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:16,090
Pearl is radiant and modest

599
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:17,840
It matches your character

600
00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:20,450
Although the leaf is made of gold,

601
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:22,060
with its hollow-out design,

602
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:23,070
it's very light

603
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:26,340
It isn't too fancy for daily wear, either

604
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,250
It's gorgeous

605
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:31,260
Gorgeous. We'll take it.
Yuan, wrap it up

606
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:33,850
No, how can I let you pay?

607
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:35,210
I can't let you pay

608
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,290
-You pay for it then
-I...

609
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:42,350
-My money is with my mother
-Why are you talking then?

610
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:45,770
Just kidding. Of course
you're not going to pay

611
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:48,130
That's the maiden family's duty

612
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:49,520
Yuan, wrap it up

613
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:53,530
Master,

614
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:56,540
I'm young and I don't have
much money. Make it cheaper

615
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:01,230
-Sir, two bowls of noodles, please
-Coming up

616
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:04,750
Have some tea

617
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:09,280
Excuse me, we're having a chat

618
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:14,470
Here you go

619
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,410
Thank you

620
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:23,090
Look at you,

621
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:24,460
you're just like my sister

622
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:25,490
You're both nice girls,

623
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:27,410
just a little too obedient

624
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:29,210
Letting others dictate your marriage

625
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:31,720
You even held back when buying jewelry

626
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:35,140
Your brother is the prosecutor of the
Criminal Investigation Bureau

627
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:37,350
He doesn't need you to save money for him

628
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:39,130
Rong'er,

629
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:41,010
my father passed away very early

630
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:43,030
My mother is always ill

631
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:47,380
First Madam never treated us
with kindness

632
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:50,490
It wasn't easy for my brother
to get to where he is today

633
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:51,940
But when it comes to my wedding,

634
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:54,860
he pulled out all the stops

635
00:37:56,090 --> 00:37:57,530
All these little things

636
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:59,440
must add up to a fortune

637
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:02,290
I'll try to be as frugal as I can

638
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:04,500
All right, I get it

639
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:07,650
Remember when we picked red dates
in the suburbs

640
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:09,200
and my sister dragged us back home
by our ears?

641
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,960
It seems like only yesterday

642
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:15,060
Suddenly, you and my sister
are getting married

643
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:19,900
I'm very happy that
Xuan's getting married

644
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,460
After all, she's marrying the
most eligible man around

645
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:25,030
By the way,

646
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,690
Brother told me that

647
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:29,380
you've become an assistant
at Ju Shui Pavilion

648
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,960
That means you are seeing
Mr Ju Shui everyday?

649
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:35,340
Don't remind me

650
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:37,940
I'm being scolded everyday.
It's tiresome

651
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:39,350
Rong,

652
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:42,490
why don't we get married soon?

653
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:44,050
Then you won't be tired

654
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:50,340
You

655
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:52,430
I think you're the one torturing him

656
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,370
Zhu'er,

657
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:57,780
I need to ask you something

658
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:58,700
Go ahead

659
00:38:58,790 --> 00:39:00,240
Don't be offended

660
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,210
Does your brother

661
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:04,470
really like my sister?

662
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:06,070
Will he really treat her well?

663
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:07,680
Of course

664
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:10,090
Rong'er,

665
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:12,360
my brother has loved your
sister since he was a child

666
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,660
You know that

667
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:14,810
All these years,

668
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:16,420
he's been working his way up

669
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:18,810
so he could propose to your sister

670
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:21,600
Plus, we all grew up together

671
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:23,300
You shouldn't be worried

672
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:26,160
Well,

673
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:30,340
you stayed at my home when
we were children. I know you well

674
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:33,810
But Brother Qi had spent
most of his time in the academy

675
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:35,750
I don't know him well

676
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:39,090
You worry too much

677
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:40,890
I guarantee that

678
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:43,800
my brother will take
good care of your sister

679
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:18,300
Are we having guests?
Why is there light in Ju Shui Pavilion?

680
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:31,980
Lucky me

681
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:07,310
That's very clever of her

682
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:11,710
I haven't eaten anything all day

683
00:41:29,330 --> 00:41:30,650
Master,

684
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:33,140
what are you doing
in the kitchen this late?

685
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:36,090
I should be asking you this question

686
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:40,450
I... I'm just on my way to the outhouse

687
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:42,580
That's... that's how I got here

688
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:45,150
It's windy out there. You should turn in

689
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:51,930
Is it hot?

690
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:02,270
See you

691
00:42:02,350 --> 00:42:03,760
Hold on
