[Duke Su's Residence]

5
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,320
Your Highness.

6
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:55,200
That lady has not been caught...

7
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,600
but I heard that...

8
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:00,200
a prosecutor of the Criminal
Investigation Bureau, Qi Ce...

9
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,760
has taken the guest list.

10
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,590
There are no casualties...

11
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:08,940
yet the Bureau decided to get involved.

12
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:12,000
Hengjing County Magistrate
should've been in charge.

13
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:13,060
Furthermore, I heard that...

14
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:15,860
the prosecutor volunteered
to deal with the case.

15
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:16,740
Your Highness.

16
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:18,520
Could the attempt to murder...

17
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,980
be done by the same gang who
stole army rations at Guanyan Town?

[A month ago]

19
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:34,050
Why are the soldiers given terrible food?

20
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:37,650
We received fifteen carts of
fine grains from the capital, haven't we?

21
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:38,530
Your Highness.

22
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,480
Something is wrong with the food.

23
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,030
I have long heard about Duke Su.

24
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:45,980
When His Highness was 12 years old,

25
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,230
[Qiu Gao Yi, Superintendent,
Imperial Guards of Hezhou]

26
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:49,120
he was exiled to
Zhang Yang City by the Emperor.

27
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,190
[Huo Xing, Grain transportation officer
of Hezhou]

28
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:51,740
He's been following General Zhen Bei
since then.

29
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:54,780
The Emperor said that since High Highness
is doomed to face calamity in his life,

30
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,930
he is destined to resist
the invasion of the foreign enemies.

31
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:58,579
The most pathetic thing is...

32
00:02:58,579 --> 00:03:00,180
so many years have passed,

33
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:04,070
High Highness has never been summoned
to go back to the Capital.

34
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:08,810
Who would take him seriously?

35
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:21,390
Duke Su.

36
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:33,460
Duke Su!

37
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,980
If you kill the superintendent
of Imperial Guards,

38
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,690
it is considered
punishment without approval.

39
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:39,130
When we are back to the Capital,

40
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:40,650
I will lodge a complaint against you!

41
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:41,710
You better behave.

42
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:43,370
We counted the stock.

43
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:45,460
the military rations secretly released
by the Superintendent...

44
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:47,940
is only one tenth of the portion
that you skimmed!

45
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:50,000
From who do you get the instructions?

46
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:55,290
Who is the culprit behind all these?

47
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:57,790
From Guanyan Town to Hengjing City,

48
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:59,500
the culprit...

49
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,450
is vicious and merciless.

50
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:05,990
Qiu Gao Yi, the Superintendent
of Imperial Guards of Hezhou...

51
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:08,810
and Huo Xing, the grain transportation
officer have passed away.

52
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:11,450
Any slip-ups you commit now...

53
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:15,060
would mean the case of military rations
remain unsolved.

54
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:21,779
They are dead...

55
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,000
but I am still here.

56
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:24,580
If I die,

57
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:25,940
you guys will be here.

58
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:27,690
The emperor will be here.

59
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,580
The government officials will be here.

60
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:32,190
While the general and the soldiers are
fighting at the border,

61
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:34,920
those corrupt officials
are having a jolly time.

62
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,510
I am not finding out the truth for myself.

63
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,340
It is the truth needed by Dayu.

64
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,540
Your Highness is right.

65
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:44,690
Your Highness,

66
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,570
be that as it may,

67
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:49,140
you still have to be more cautious.

68
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:00,930
My lady,

69
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,120
did you have fun at Yue Dan Commentary?

70
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,000
My lady.

71
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:09,300
You seem to be absent-minded
after coming back.

72
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,640
Is it because you met your lover?

73
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:14,730
No way!

74
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:16,650
That guy is a jinx!

75
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:19,070
I met him twice and
I was jinxed every time.

76
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,350
I think our birth dates are not in line.

77
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:22,820
How strange.

78
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:25,220
How can I marry him?

79
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,140
What are you murmuring about?

80
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:28,610
Since he is a jinx,

81
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,630
you just have to stay away from him.

82
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,000
You are right.

83
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:38,190
It is not impossible
to alter the content of my dream.

84
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:41,590
At least this time,
there are no casualties.

85

Lan Xiang!

86
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,760
Prepare some herbs that help
to calm the nerves.

87
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:48,260
I want to have a good sleep tonight!

88
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:50,140
Are you going to bed so early today?

89
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,080
Go now!

Bring me Ophiogon, Chinese asparagus,
Spine Date Seed,

If all the herbs don't work,

93
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:00,820
just bring me the almighty ganoderma.
I will turn it into juice and drink it.

168
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:38,480
We have talismans to form ties
of affection.

169
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:40,780
I want to untie the relationship
with a petty man!

170
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,050
Don't try to cheat me
with these useless talismans.

171
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:45,440
Young Lady Rong, what have you done?

172
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:46,500
Who is that person?

173
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,100
You need to be more specific.

174
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:49,970
I mean...

175
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:54,860
I fear that I am going to have
a terrible relationship with a person.

176
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,030
I just want to stay away from him.

177
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:57,430
The further, the better.

178
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,180
It is not difficult.

179
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:01,820
You just have to steal his underwear
and burn it to ashes.

180
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:02,810
Underwear?

181
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:07,940
How can I get it?

182
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:08,980
That's why...

183
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:11,720
you need to steal it.

184
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:14,590
Actually,

185
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:16,050
there is another way.

186
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,620
You can stay at home forever.

187
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,540
Even if you are out, you can avoid
going places that he might go.

188
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:20,890
There are so many people on the street.

189
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:23,490
It's unlikely you'd bump into him
all the time.

190
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:38,370
Let's go!

191
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,210
The new Commander of
Imperial Guards is here.

192
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:46,330
How imposing.

193
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:48,370
A new broom sweeps clean.

194
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:51,740
I am faking someone's attendance
at the barracks later.

195
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:54,470
I hope I won't be put into trouble
because of this.

196
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:57,330
Imperial Guards?

197
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:06,180
The new Commander of
Imperial Guards is here!

198
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:11,140
The new Commander of
Imperial Guards is here!

199
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:17,490
The new Commander of
Imperial Guards is here!

200
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:17,230
[Imperial Guards]

201
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:21,290
Alright! I am going to bet on even!

202
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:22,290
Again.

203
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:27,690
Big! Small!

204
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,600
Deputy Commander,
the new Commander is here.

205
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,330
[Guo Rui, soldier of Imperial Guards]

206
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,160
He is demanding us to go out.

207
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:32,270
[Liang Tong, Imperial Guards
Deputy Commander]

208
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:36,400
What is the rush?

209
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:38,850
It is totally fine to make him wait.

210
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:39,990
-He should wait for us.
-Let him wait outside.

211
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:42,990
He has been waiting for a long time,
Deputy Commander.

212
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:44,850
Fine.

213
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,660
Let's go out.

214
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:47,850
Let's go.

215
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,860
Let's check out that lad. Let's go.

216
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:50,740
Your Highness.

217
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:54,500
It seems that they are trying
to put the fear of God in you.

218
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:59,250
The new Commander of
Imperial Guards is here!

219
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,670
Let's go and have a look.

220
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,300
Let's take a look.

221
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:13,450
I am Liang Tong, the Deputy Commander
of Imperial Guards.

222
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:15,210
Greetings, Duke Su.

223
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:18,810
-Greetings, Duke Su.
-Greetings, Duke Su.

224
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,880
Remove the barrier of spikes.

225
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:25,010
Your Highness, for your information,

226
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:27,410
the military camp
is not an ordinary place.

227
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,090
Within two miles,

228
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:30,970
-no horses are allowed.
-You Highness need to get down from the horse.

229
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:31,850
How dare you!

230
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,250
Since such rule exists,

231
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:40,650
I shall dismount.

232
00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:00,130
Please don't take offense, Your Highness.

233
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:03,820
I am just doing my duty
according to the rule.

234
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:06,580
You abide by the strict rules.

235
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:07,580
It is a good thing.

236
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:11,300
I had been guarding the border
year in year out.

237
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:14,360
I don't know much about
the rules of the Imperial Guard.

238
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:16,150
If I miss anything,

239
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:18,780
please remind me, Lord Liang.

240
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:22,810
No worries.

241
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:27,410
Your attire is imposing, Lord Liang.

242
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:31,050
Your Highness, you have good taste.

243
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:35,470
It is tailored made by the best tailor
in town, Zhi Yun Workshop.

244
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:37,210
Since you are at the camp,

245
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,750
why are you not in military attire?

246
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:45,420
No alcohol is allowed
in the military camp.

247
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:48,060
Why do Lord Liang
and everyone else here...

248
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,020
smell of alcohol?

249
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:57,010
You placed the barrier of spikes
at the entrance for no reason.

250
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:59,530
Should any urgent military situation arise,

251
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:03,130
how do soldiers and horses in the camp
exit at the first instance?

252
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,270
Well...

253
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,950
As the Deputy Commander of Imperial Guards,

254
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:10,730
you didn't train nor examine the soldiers.

255
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:13,330
Even the second son of the Wang family
who is lame...

256
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:16,130
has been registered as one
of the Imperial Guards.

257
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:19,070
The money given to you
by the Wang family...

258
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,800
is enough for you to get a few pieces
of clothes from Zhi Yun Workshop, right?

259
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,020
Your Highness!

260
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:32,340
Imperial Guards investigate
any suspect for the Emperor...

261
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:35,140
yet you do the opposite
by committing corruption.

262
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:40,140
Your Highness!

263
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:41,290
Your Highness...

264
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:43,490
please don't falsely accuse me
without a basis.

265
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:46,130
I don't dare to do so.

266
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:49,340
The general and soldiers at the border
are fighting really hard.

267
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:51,460
On the other hand, all of you do\nwhat you wish without restraint.

268
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,520
If I don't kill you,

269
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:55,130
it would be a great injustice for those
who risk their lives.

270
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:56,250
Your Highness!

271
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:58,180
-Please don't do that!
-Please spare my life, Your Highness!

272
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:01,040
Punish Lord Liang according to
the military rules!

273
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,560
It is said that Imperial Guards
are on heavy watch.

274
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,860
We just entered the camp as per our wish.

275
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,210
If it is really on heavy watch,

276
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:24,520
a highborn wouldn't have asked me
to attend the roll call.

277
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,050
Honestly, I'm doing it
for multiple persons.

278
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:28,230
Let's go.

279
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,420
Loose military discipline,

280
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,560
the equipment in the camp is in a mess.

281
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:57,200
After the inspection,

282
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,360
nothing is acceptable.

283
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,580
Please forgive us, Your Highness.

284
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:03,980
The Imperial Guards are meant to
investigate those corrupted officials.

285
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:04,860
Ridiculous!

286
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:06,500
The Imperial Guards
have the responsibility,

287
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,610
but they still considered military.

288
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:10,170
Though the duties are different,

289
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:12,500
the military discipline should be there!

290
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,600
Duke Su has just got appointed.

291
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,070
A new broom sweeps clean.

292
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,380
Are you really going to fake attendance?

293
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:20,720
I can't afford to mess with Duke Su,

294
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,700
but I can't afford to mess around
the highborn too.

295
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:23,700
Wu Bai Qi.

296
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:25,940
Wait for me while I do the job.

297
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:27,250
Wu Bai Qi!

298
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,280
-Wu Bai Qi!
-I am here!

299
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:36,460
Wu Bai Qi?

300
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,480
Your Highness.

301
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,170
Don't be afraid.

302
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,100
We met before.

303
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,930
Have you forgotten?

304
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:47,690
I still remember.

305
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,130
Do you?

306
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,540
Please pardon me, Your Highness.

307
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,020
Young Master Bai Qi
is not feeling well today.

308
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,910
That's why he sent me here
to attend the roll call.

309
00:16:58,910 --> 00:16:59,830
Ridiculous.

310
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:02,480
Among the Imperial Guards,

311
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:06,450
people are categorised into
young masters and servants.

312
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,440
Xu Jia.

313
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:08,920
Yes.

314
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,780
Take him away and cane him 20 times.

315
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:13,730
Then, bring Wu Bai Qi back!

316
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:15,130
Bring him away!

317
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,359
Your Highness.

318
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:17,990
-Let's go.
-Your Highness!

319
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:19,630
-Your Highness!
-How merciless.

320
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:21,380
-Please don't do it, Your Highness!
-Crude! Jinx!

321
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:23,660
Duke Su is so imposing.

322
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:30,830
[Wu Bai Qi, Imperial Guards Lieutenant,
the eldest son of Lord Xindu]

323
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,030
You are Wu Bai Qi?

324
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,000
Yes, I am.

325
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:52,170
You faked attendance.

326
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:55,880
People!

327
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,070
Hold on!

328
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,900
Young Master Bai Qi,

329
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,630
don't mess around with Duke Su.

330
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:04,090
In only a few days time,

331
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,640
you have become Duke Su's lackey, Guo Rui,

332
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:07,630
How dare you!

333
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,710
The military rules
are strict and impartial.

334
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:11,770
The subordinates
must listen to the superior.

335
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:14,180
To you, it means lackey.

336
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:16,540
Duke Su is interesting.

337
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:18,340
After giving in the military power
of the border,

338
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:21,600
now His Highness is ranting out on...
the Imperial Guards.

339
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,010
The Imperial Guards...

340
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,380
assist the Emperor...

341
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:27,520
and protect the people
at the same time.

342
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,580
It carries heavy responsibilities.

343
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,710
I believe that all of you know about...

344
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,640
the corruption case of military rations.

345
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,000
However, none of you abides by the rule.

346
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:38,390
All of you are in a state of disorder.

347
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:41,970
I tried to put
the military discipline straight...

348
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,880
but you claim that
I am showing off my power.

349
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:48,220
How is the corruption case related to us?

350
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:49,960
Just because of Qiu Gao Yi?

351
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:51,190
Wu Bai Qi.

352
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,320
The Imperial Guards stole
what is entrusted to its care.

353
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,250
Self-inspections are necessary.

354
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:01,250
I have long heard that...

355
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,930
the Imperial Guards...

356
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:05,050
consist of profligate sons of the rich...

357
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:07,710
who are protected
by the seniors in the capital.

358
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,840
Today, I shall see for myself...

359
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:12,650
if that is true.

360
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,050
[Imperial Guards]

361
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:30,970
-Sure!
-Sure!

362
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:34,310
-Go!
-Go!

363
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,820
-Beat him up!
-Beat him up!

364
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:38,410
-Beat him up!
-Beat him up!

365
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,290
-Beat him up!
-Beat him up!

366
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,400
Stay away!

367
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:26,340
-Beat him up!
-Beat him up!

368
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:34,210
-Beat him up!
-Beat him up!

369
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,290
Do you admit defeat?

370
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,130
You are injured.

371
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,400
I am strong enough to defeat you!

372
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:51,020
Do you admit defeat?

373
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:53,200
Yes, I admit defeat!

374
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:35,490
It is you again!

375
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:38,170
This is a misunderstanding.

376
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:39,510
Please let go of me.

377
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,600
Your Highness, is that an assassin?

378
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:49,200
I am not an assassin. Let me go!

379
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:50,200
Your Highness,

380
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:51,820
she was at Yue Dan Commentary too.

381
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:53,590
She took a glance at the crossbeam
numerous times.

382
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:56,020
It seemed that she already knew
something was wrong with the crossbeam.

383
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:58,000
She could be the accomplice
of the culprit.

384
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,320
Nonsense!

385
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:00,700
If it weren't for me,

386
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:02,450
His Highness would have died.

387
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:05,210
I stared at the crossbeam
because it was the only clean spot.

388
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:07,920
The rest of the crossbeams were dirty.
I was curious. That's it.

389
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,240
I saved him out of goodwill.

390
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,390
How could you suspect me?

391
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:11,790
What a heartless person.

392
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,360
Who are you?

393
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:17,740
I am the daughter of
Hengjing County Magistrate.

394
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:20,820
You impersonated as someone else
on a few occasions.

395
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:21,880
Why did you do that?

396
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,180
Do you want to know the truth?

397
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,860
Are you going to lie to my face?

398
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,640
No, I'm not.

399
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,670
As you saw just now,

400
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:32,600
I am here to steal your underwear.

401
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,210
Such a shameless person!

402
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,480
What shameless?

403
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:40,070
After saving His Highness,

404
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,630
we had a row.

405
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:44,200
I consulted a master and
he told me that...

406
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,330
I need to get his underwear
and burn it.

407
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:48,410
I can only get rid of the resentment
between us that way.

408
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:49,870
That's why I took the risk.

409
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:52,870
You are already a great word twister.

410
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:55,000
You don't need to consult anyone else.

411
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,240
You are the masked person?

412
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:01,100
You knew that long time ago, right?

413
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,030
You don't have to pretend anymore.

414
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:08,230
I know that my behaviour
looks very suspicious.

415
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:09,240
However,

416
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,160
let God be my witness.

417
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,040
It is just a coincidence.

418
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,520
Furthermore, I am the second daughter
of Hengjing County Magistrate.]

419
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,580
We are not even on bad terms.
Why are you doing this to me?

420
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:20,700
Inform Lord Fu...

421
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:22,070
to pick her up.

422
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:24,990
Don't...

423
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,360
Don't inform my family.

424
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:33,670
Bring her away.

425
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:36,370
Something bad happened!

426
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:37,870
Something bad happened!

427
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,620
Why are you screaming and shouting?

428
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:40,850
Miss Fu Xuan is reading.

429
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:42,350
Miss Rong went
to the Imperial Guards camp...

430
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:43,560
and got into a big trouble.

431
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,430
What?

432
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,840
Someone from Imperial Guard came...

433
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,640
and told the master to pick her up.

434
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,840
Are you sure?

435
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,680
She is indeed capable of doing so.

436
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,850
Lan Xiang, Bao Zhu,
I am going to pick her up.

437
00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:57,030
Both of you stay at home.

438
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:58,880
Don't let my parents know.

439
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:11,840
Why couldn't I defeat him?

440
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,560
Nowadays,

441
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:24,300
nothing is too strange.

442
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:25,710
A lady...

443
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:29,000
came to the military camp just
to steal a man's underwear.

444
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:30,260
You are a brave lady.

445
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:31,530
I respect you for that.

446
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,290
Little Marquis,

447
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:35,070
I don't deserve your respect.

448
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:39,500
Young Lady Fu Xuan is here.

449
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:41,030
Sister!

450
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,240
Sister!

451
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:47,960
Young ladies of the Fu family
sure love the military camp.

452
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:50,230
I fear that they are...

453
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:04,840
-Sister!
-Rong'er!

454
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:06,330
Rong'er!

455
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:08,330
-Rong'er!
-Look at them!

456
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:09,400
Are you okay?

457
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:11,190
I am fine.

458
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:13,070
Father doesn't know about this, right?

459
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:14,470
Now only you are worried.

460
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:17,280
We shall talk later. Behave and wait here.

461
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:19,310
Why are your hands tied up?

462
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,400
It's their fault!

463
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:28,310
If you don't mind,

464
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,070
what did she do...

465
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,690
that deserves to be tied up?

466
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:38,760
Your sister is bold and reckless.

467
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,940
She disguised into a man
and barged into the military camp.

468
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:41,900
This is a great crime.

469
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:44,030
Do you know what the Imperial Guard is?

470
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:45,240
Little Marquis,

471
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:47,550
do you know?

472
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:51,110
You know me?

473
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,880
You are Little Marquis
from  Xindu Residence.

474
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,880
You are also the owner of Feng Lai Yi.

475
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:58,710
You are so well known.

476
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:00,400
Everyone knows about you.

477
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,040
I also know that...

478
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,590
you disregard the law...

479
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:05,160
and behave like a spoiled son.

480
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,140
You have been...

481
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:08,190
treating the Imperial Guard
as a place for fun.

482
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:09,510
Relying on your family background,

483
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:11,690
you are here to kill your time
with an unimportant role.

484
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:12,570
How dare...

485
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,360
Holding back your sister is my duty.

486
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,930
Imperial Guards are tasked to investigate
corrupted and crafty officials.

487
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:22,030
What is wrong? You can't even find out
the real identity of an ordinary lady.

488
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:24,190
She is just a helpless lady.

489
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,790
How can you tie her up...

490
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:27,320
without finding out the truth?

491
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,400
-You...
-That is right!

492
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,860
I didn't do anything yet they tied me up.

493
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:30,990
They hurt my hands.

494
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:33,000
Don't try to talk your way out.

495
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,930
All right, my sister
has been punished accordingly.

496
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,590
I also brought along my father's token.

497
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:40,280
Can I bring her back?

498
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,630
The commander has instructed that...

499
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:44,480
Lord Fu has to be here to pick her up.

500
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,280
The token represents my father.

501
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:48,370
Are you going to investigate...

502
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:50,130
the  genuineness of the token?

503
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,300
Is it safe to assume that...

504
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,580
today, you are...

505
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:55,800
making things difficult on purpose
for both of us?

506
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,340
Nonsense! I fear nothing.

507
00:27:58,430 --> 00:28:00,240
I have never made things difficult
for women.

508
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,720
You may leave now. If anything happens,
I shall bear the responsibility.

509
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,670
Are you serious?

510
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:08,780
Thank you, Little Marquis.

511
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:13,490
Let's go!

512
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:16,390
Hold on.

513
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,920
Anything, Little Marquis?

514
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:25,830
It is not fair.

515
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,050
You know everything about me...

516
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:29,780
but I don't even know your name.

517
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:32,950
My surname is Fu.

518
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:34,350
My first name is Xuan.

519
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,280
Goodbye.

520
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:38,500
Let's go.

521
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,850
Thank goodness you came to save me.

522
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:47,810
Fu Xuan.

523
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:01,570
Your Highness.

524
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:03,160
As expected,

525
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,630
the person who came talked a bit...

526
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:06,430
and Wu Bai Qi released that lady.

527
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:07,890
However, that lady...

528
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:10,080
is indeed the daughter of
Hengjing County Magistrate.

529
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,230
Her name is...

530
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:13,220
Fu Rong.

531
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,120
Since we know her identity,

532
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:18,480
we can take our time to observe her.

533
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,360
Your Highness.

534
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,040
However, His Majesty...

535
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:22,890
has only given you three months.

536
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,490
One month ago,

537
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:30,440
Xuan Han made a surprise attack
on Guanyan Town.

538
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:33,650
General Zhen Bei and I
fought against them.

539
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:36,360
The soldiers risked their lives...

540
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,160
and drove the enemy back.

541
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,170
However, in the end,

542
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:43,530
they didn't have food
to fill their stomach.

543
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,570
The food sent by the government...

544
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:48,910
were nothing but pebbles,

545
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:50,620
husks,

546
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,160
and chaffs.

547
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:56,400
[I killed Qiu Gao Yi...]

548
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,640
because he...

549
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:00,330
had committed the offense
of embezzlement,

550
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:01,410
mendacity to the Emperor,

551
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:03,870
and stealing what was entrusted
to his care.

552
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:05,640
Therefore, I executed him.

553
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:10,550
When I was on my way escorting the grain
transportation officer to the capital,

554
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:11,830
we were ambushed.

555
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,560
It clearly shows that...

556
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:16,150
some people hope that this incident...

557
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,460
could be hidden from the capital.

558
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,210
I volunteered to be
the Commander of Imperial Guards...

559
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:24,720
and investigate this case thoroughly...

560
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,260
to do the general and soldiers
at the border a justice.

561
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:28,920
I don't think it is a good idea.

562
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:33,090
Duke Su took it upon himself
and executed someone.

563
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:36,470
He should be removed from the position of
the Deputy General Zhen Bei.

564
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:37,560
From today onward,

565
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,960
he will be the Commander
of Imperial Guards...

566
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:42,570
for three months.

567
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:46,700
Brother.

568
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:48,300
In my view,

569
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,340
Duke Su has just returned to the capital.

570
00:30:51,770 --> 00:30:53,470
He is not familiar with
the people and the place.

571
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:55,160
I fear that three months...

572
00:30:57,410 --> 00:30:58,480
Thank you, Father.

573
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:02,110
You may leave now.

574
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:04,420
Yes.

575
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:27,960
Here.

576
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,730
Sister told me that...

577
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:32,420
in order to ensure
the date tree grows well,

578
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:34,150
plant ash should be used.

579
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:35,390
Really?

580
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:38,320
Yes, we shall add more plant ash.

581
00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:39,660
Sure.

582
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:40,960
Here.

583
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:43,720
Come on.

584
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:48,790
Young Master.

585
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:52,730
The lady who saved Duke Su under
the crossbeam has been found.

586
00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:55,990
She is the second daughter of
Hengjing County Magistrate.

587
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,200
Her name is Fu Rong.

588
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,270
Fu Pin Yan has been promoted
to Hengjing County from Jizhou.

589
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:04,620
Fu Rong?

590
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:06,710
Fu Pin Yan?

591
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:08,640
Jizhou?

592
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:12,150
Is she really Nong Nong?

593
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,660
Get the horse cart ready.

594
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:16,840
Come with me to the Fu Residence.

595
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:17,720
Yes.

596
00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:20,530
Sister.

597
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:22,050
A night has passed.

598
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,680
Are you still mad at me?

599
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:29,930
Sister.

600
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:32,580
Fragrant pear cake from Xishan,

601
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:34,030
or crystal-like persimmon cake
from Dong Street?

602
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:35,360
Which one do you prefer?

603
00:32:36,170 --> 00:32:37,050
Or...

604
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:39,860
Or I can make you some plain noodles?

605
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:43,350
Sister!

606
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:45,360
I have learned from my mistake.

607
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:48,140
I shouldn't have had...

608
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:50,030
gone to the military camp alone.

609
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:52,060
I know that you feel sorry for me.

610
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:53,730
I swear,

611
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:55,180
I won't do it again.

612
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:00,160
Look at you.

613
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,390
Now only you realise that
you are at fault.

614
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:04,430
I don't mind when you mess around at home.

615
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:06,830
How could you barge into
the military camp?

616
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,090
What if Duke Su decided to punish you?

617
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:10,160
What would you do?

618
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:18,550
Where had both of you been yesterday?

619
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,460
Father.

620
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:23,630
I heard that...

621
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:26,450
the Hengjing County theatre
has a new performance.

622
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:29,620
We watched the same performance
over and over when we were in Jizhou.

623
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:31,220
Those performance bored us.

624
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:35,070
So, I brought along Rong'er
to check out the performance.

625
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:36,120
Yes.

626
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:38,810
The female role in Hengjing County
is so much better than those in Jizhou.

627
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:40,460
They are all exquisite beauties.

628
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:41,670
Father, you should know that.

629
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:43,130
How dare you lie to my face!

630
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:45,830
Both of you are unmarried ladies...

631
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,500
yet you barged in the military camp!

632
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:48,630
That is out of order!

633
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:51,540
Father,

634
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:52,650
it is all my fault.

635
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:54,470
She went there to rescue me.

636
00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:56,610
It is no one’s fault but your own!

637
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:00,780
Xuan'er.

638
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:02,810
Rong'er always gets into troubles...

639
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:04,140
and yet you let it slide.

640
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:06,710
You have spoiled her.

641
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:08,170
Father,

642
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:09,989
I have learned from my mistake.

643
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:13,230
I promise I won't do it again.

644
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,199
Promise?

645
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:17,449
You have made countless promise
since young.

646
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:19,380
Have you honoured your words?

647
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:23,000
I shall teach you a lesson
with this ruler...

648
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,130
so you could grow up!

649
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:25,199
Please calm down.

650
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,310
She has grown up.

651
00:34:27,429 --> 00:34:28,940
She has learned from her mistake.

652
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:30,659
Forget about the ruler.

653
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:32,560
Are you going to spoil her too?

654
00:34:32,989 --> 00:34:34,100
-I...
-Go away!

655
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,600
-Master!
-You brought along...

656
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,620
this broken ruler with you
all the way from Jizhou!

657
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:39,500
Stand there!

658
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:42,010
-Don't you think that you can escape!
-Father!

659
00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:43,250
-Master!
-Don't stand in my way!

660
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:44,300
Master!

661
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:47,659
-Master!
-Father, please don't...

662
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:49,090
Rong'er, run!

663
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,110
You rascal! You are killing me!

664
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:55,820
I am going to beat you to death!

665
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:57,090
-Master!
-Stop interfering!

666
00:34:57,090 --> 00:34:58,350
-I am going to teach her a lesson!
-Don't beat her!

667
00:34:58,350 --> 00:34:59,390
-I am going to teach her a lesson!
-Father!

668
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:01,720
-Master!
-I am going to teach her a lesson!

669
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,140
This...

670
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:17,730
[It's really Lord Fu.]

671
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:18,880
Master Ju Shui.

672
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:22,180
Bao Zhu, I am surprised to see
Master Ju Shui here.

673
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,190
Are you okay?

674
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:26,500
I am fine.

675
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:28,440
Lord Fu.

676
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:30,750
I wonder what your daughter did?

677
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:33,020
Since I have been punished,

678
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,720
can we put an end to it?

679
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:39,150
Master Ju Shui, I am so sorry.

680
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:45,040
May I know why you've suddenly
paid me a visit?

681
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,630
To be honest,

682
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:48,800
on Yue Dan Commentary,

683
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:52,320
your daughter and I
met each other at Ju Shui Pavilion.

684
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:55,670
Your daughter broke my jade pendant.

685
00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:02,740
How much does the jade pendant cost?

686
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:03,710
I shall pay for it.

687
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:04,590
Keep quiet!

688
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:06,780
My daughter is reckless.

689
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:09,710
How much does the jade cost? I...

690
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,070
Lord Fu, you have misunderstood.

691
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:13,590
I am not here to ask for money.

692
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:15,590
You mean...

693
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:18,800
Ju Shui Pavilion is still in need of...

694
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:20,190
a study aide.

695
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:23,270
Can you please send your daughter
to be an aide for a month...

696
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:24,800
to offset the jade pendant?

697
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:25,880
Well...

698
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:28,930
My daughter is naughty.

699
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,290
She might get you into trouble...

700
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,760
if she goes to Ju Shui Pavilion.

701
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,090
It will be troublesome.

702
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:35,960
No doubt your daughter is naughty...

703
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,220
but she is quite smart.

704
00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:40,150
Rong'er is a girl after all.

705
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:42,420
I don't think it is proper...

706
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:44,050
for her to be a study aide.

707
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:46,130
Master.

708
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,000
Can we talk in private?

709
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:55,520
Marquis Xindu has never given a thought
on the marriage agreement ...

710
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,180
between Rong'er and Earl Yan.

711
00:36:57,290 --> 00:36:59,430
They think that they are too good for us.

712
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:01,430
If Rong'er becomes an aide,

713
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:04,520
she will be considered as the unofficial
disciple of Master Ju Shui.

714
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:07,560
Her status will be different.

715
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:14,640
Lord Fu, please don't worry.

716
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,320
If you hand your daughter to me,

717
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,760
I will teach her well.

718
00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:19,150
Everyone says that...

719
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:21,360
Master Ju Shui is talented.

720
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,880
If she can be guided by you,

721
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:26,770
it is her honour.

722
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,360
Thank you for the compliment, Lord Fu.

723
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:31,420
I shall send someone to
pick up your daughter tomorrow.

724
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:34,980
Thank you for the help, Master Ju Shui.

725
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:36,110
I am leaving.bye bye

726
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:49,790
Miss  Rong, I feel happy for you!

727
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:51,030
I feel happy for you!

728
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:53,270
-I wish I could go together.
-I wish I could go too.

729
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:54,760
-Fine, I shall get his signature for you.
-Miss Rong!

730
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:57,360
Because of you,
I can go to Ju Shui Pavilion too!

731
00:37:58,830 --> 00:37:59,710
Rong'er.

732
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,670
When you are at Ju Shui Pavilion,

733
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:03,550
you must take care of yourself.

734
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:06,320
Don't put yourself
in a great inconvenience.

735
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:08,280
Enough.

736
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:10,540
She is there to serve her teacher.

737
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:12,690
Judging from her temperament,

738
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:14,790
she will never put herself
in great inconvenience.

739
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:16,280
I won't put myself in great inconvenience.

740
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:19,140
I will slack as much as I can.
I won't exhaust myself.

741
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:21,310
Let's go.

742
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:23,470
Lord Fu. Madam Fu.

743
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:25,650
-Qi Shi?
-Qi Shi?

744
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:27,050
You are...

745
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:29,200
It's like this.

746
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:31,720
Rong'er is going to Ju Shui Pavilion...

747
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:34,160
and be Master Ju Shui's aide.

748
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,440
Master Ju Shui?

749
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:36,680
In Hengjing County,

750
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:38,600
he is a well-known book reviewer.

751
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:40,910
It is a great opportunity.

752
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:44,830
I invited three friends of mine...

753
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:47,400
to appreciate cliff carvings at Mount Xi.

754
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:51,060
I heard that Fu Xuan
is interested in cliff carvings.

755
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:54,060
Hence, I would like to invite
both of you to come along.

756
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:56,350
However, it seems...

757
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,850
Fu Rong...

758
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:01,220
Lately, the weather is really good.

759
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,220
It is the best timing for a trip.

760
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:04,410
Am I right, master?

761
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:06,830
However, Rong'er can't make it.

762
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,600
Xuan'er can go with you.

763
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:13,210
-Sure.
-Cliff carvings?

764
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:14,430
At Mount Xi?

765
00:39:15,290 --> 00:39:16,150
I want to go.

766
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,790
-You can dream about it.
-Mother, I want to go.

767
00:39:17,790 --> 00:39:19,930
You shall keep Master Ju Shui company.

768
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:22,720
It's an opportunity to change
your behaviour.

769
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:23,720
All right.

770
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:28,790
Lord Fu.

771
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:30,630
Madam Fu.

772
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:34,990
Young Lady Fu Rong, we should go.

773
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:36,390
Let's go.

774
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,610
I shall send you off.

775
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:46,820
[Ju Shui Pavilion]

776
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:01,630
This house is such a luxury.

777
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:03,050
The work...

778
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:04,180
The design...

779
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:06,630
I am in luck because of you.

780
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,200
Now I get to see...

781
00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:11,230
the interior design of Ju Shui Pavilion.

782
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:12,730
Don't just look at it.

783
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:14,220
You should smell the air.

784
00:40:21,970 --> 00:40:22,850
Lan Xiang,

785
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:24,410
do you smell anything?

786
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,680
There is nothing special.

787
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:27,760
Are you serious?

788
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:29,990
Didn't my dad say it?

789
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:32,320
He wished that I could be more cultural.

790
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:33,610
Don't you realise that...

791
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:36,270
the air is filled with
the fragrance of culture?

792
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:40,990
When I leave this place,

793
00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:43,840
will my mind be full of knowledge?

794
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:46,710
Will I become erudite and well informed?

795
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:49,580
Forget it.

796
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,720
No need to answer.

797
00:40:59,020 --> 00:40:59,950
Master Wen.

798
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,440
The room is ready.

799
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:05,420
This is your room from now on.

800
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:06,770
Bear it in mind.

801
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:08,830
When you are at Ju Shui Pavilion,

802
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:11,350
don't go to places that
you are not supposed to go.

803
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:14,080
Don't ask things that
you are not supposed to ask.

804
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:24,990
Master Wen...

805
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,280
looks so strict and fierce.

806
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:28,950
I don't like his look.

807
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:31,890
We are doomed.
We will live in misery moving forward.
