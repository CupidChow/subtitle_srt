My lord.

6
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:50,200
How are things at the copperware shop?

7
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,680
How is he not contactable?

8
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:54,380
The copperware shop was
suddenly closed early today.

9
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,360
Mr He who has been in contact with us

10
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:57,750
has gone missing.

11
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,970
I've gone to all the places he frequents

12
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:01,570
but he's nowhere to be found.

13
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:04,100
How come?

14
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:05,330
However,

15
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,750
I found a letter that was

16
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:09,190
burnt to ashes at Mr He's house.

17
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,320
This is what's left of it.

[Duke Su's stamp]

19
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,710
It's Duke Su's stamp.

20
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,980
Duke Su must be investigating.

21
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,000
Besides,

22
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:22,400
I also saw

23
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:24,590
Little Marquis' subordinates.

24
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,700
It seems Duke Su has found out about

25
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,820
the assassination at the hunting ground.

26
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,450
My lord,

27
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,920
this is serious.

28
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,530
What should we do?

29
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,880
Starting tonight,

30
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:52,440
you are to demobilize
all the people from Kushui Village.

31
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,520
It looks like we have to
act first to gain an advantage.

32
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:00,940
Your Highness.

33
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:04,730
Your Highness, the copperware shop
has suddenly closed its doors.

34
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:06,880
We've lost contact from our spy.

35
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:11,240
You sent men to gather Intel
at Xindu Residence?

36
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,080
This can't go uninvestigated.

37
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,380
I'm afraid we have alerted the enemy.

38
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,329

His Majesty immediately.

Xu Jia,

43
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:30,380
get the men and horses.
You're coming with me to Kushui Village.

44
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,600
This time,

45
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,740
we have to catch the thief
and find the stolen goods.

46
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:38,920
Remember,

47
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,760
tell the Imperial Guards
to move out immediately.

48
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,520

49

-Kushui Village is...
-Eunuch Wang!

50

What happened?

51
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,650
You said, Duke Su is in great danger?

52
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,470
And what about Kushui Village?

53
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:53,660
Princess of Xihe,

54
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,060
it's confidential.

55
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,470
I can't say anything.

56
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,400
Once everything's settled,

57
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,770
it will be known to you.

58
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:04,740
What's the use of telling me
after everything's settled?

59
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,270
Can't you just tell me now?

60
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,240
Let me put it this way.

61
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,280
Duke Su is in great danger.

62
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:14,600
It's a life-and-death situation.

63
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,740
So, I need you to give way.

64
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:19,480
Or else, I can't get the
men and horses in time

65
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:20,930
and Duke Su might be...

66
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:22,170
Then, go!

-Okay.

-Where's Duke Su?

74

Isn't he at the palace?

75
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:46,280
He went out long ago

76

and hasn't been back since.

77

Why is Her Highness so jumpy?

Duke Su, why would you want
to open this can of worms?

98
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,280
This thing at Huxiao Camp

99
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,570
has nothing to do with you at all.

100
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:01,300
You're so brazen, Lord Xindu.

101
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:04,710
Having the audacity to smuggle weapons.

102
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,060
I suggest

103
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:08,280
that you come clean about everything.

104
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:10,050
So that your subordinates

105
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:12,030
and your family

106
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:14,060
might have an opportunity to live.

107
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:16,830
It looks like

108
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:21,230
Duke Su is leaving me no choice.

109
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:39,270
Enough.

110
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,350
You're no match for him.

111
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,980
Duke Su,

112
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,880
if you can guarantee the
safety of my family today,

113
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:54,500
I'll confess to anything and everything.

Your Highness,

122
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:47,430
the toxin has been eliminated.

123

The condition of the wound has improved.

However,

125

please don't leave me.

132

I won't.

133
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,820
I'll keep you company.

134
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,520
This is the first time since
coming back to the capital

135
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,770
you've treated me so kindly.

136
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,720
But I don't understand

137
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:25,520
why you are so cold

138
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:28,250
and so mean

139
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:30,100
to me now.

140
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:32,470
When I first joined the palace

141
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:33,980
at a young age,

142
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:35,860
Duke Cheng bullied me.

143
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,190
You fought them and drove them away.

144
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,080
And you told me

145
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:44,440
that my father was a great hero.

146
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:48,180
In my heart,

147
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:51,790
Father is my great hero.

148
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:55,310
You are also my great hero.

149
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,600
Cui Wan,

150
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,480
you need to rest well.

151
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,850
Don't worry,

152
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:08,010
I'll watch over you tonight.

153
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:10,790
Don't go.

154
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,230
Lord Xindu,

155
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:41,690
you look well.

156
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,000
Qi,

157
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,860
you came just as I expected.

158
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:47,970
I'm glad.

159
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:51,450
Your life

160
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:54,040
was given by me.

161
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:56,460
Now my life

162
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,160
will be taken by you.

163
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,450
I'm not interested in taking your life.

164
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,800
Once you're beheaded after autumn,

165
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,280
your body will be displayed

166
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:09,220
in the market for thousands to scorn at.

167
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,680
By the look of things,

168
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:21,190
I'm dead meat.

169
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:23,260
So, Qi,

170
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:27,440
would you come forth

171
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:29,260
and hear my final words?

172
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,430
General!

173
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:49,220
Speak.

174
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,930
What else do you have to say?

175
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,130
Today's your last chance.

176
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,250
In this life...

177
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,020
No.

178
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,580
Even in the next life,

179
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,450
we won't speak to each other ever again.

180
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:08,530
Qi.

181
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:13,150
Do you think I'll let you go

182
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:15,440
because of your little charade?

183
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:18,430
Save it.

184
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,620
I know.

185
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:27,230
I've wronged you and your mother

186
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:30,270
all this while.

187
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:32,430
You caused Mother's death
with your womanising ways

188
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:34,360
and bent the truth.

189
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:37,790
What right do you have to talk about her?

190
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:39,200
You're right.

191
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:41,710
I have no right to bring her up.

192
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:45,090
Throughout my life,

193
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,700
I've done her too much wrong.

194
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,320
I know it's too late

195
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,710
to make amends now.

196
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,000
But, Qi,

197
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,300
I just want you to know

198
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:03,310
that before she died, your mother told me

199
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:06,790
she did not regret marrying me.

200
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:08,510
And, if there's a next life,

201
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,320
-she'd marry me...
-You're lying!

202
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,150
I know that you blame me

203
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,260
and hate me.

204
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,450
But the truth is,

205
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:29,660
I hate myself too.

206
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,810
Qi,

207
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,990
at my birthday banquet,

208
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:42,600
you showed up and kicked up a ruckus.

209
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,890
But, you might not have noticed

210
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:48,280
that I've been keeping the little puppet

211
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:52,990
that you so often played with
when you're little.

212
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:54,350
It's always been there.

213
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:56,990
Because

214
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:59,630
I couldn't throw it away.

215
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,690
You were a willful little boy.

216
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:07,190
You would skip and climb around
in the courtyard.

217
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:10,450
Yelling at the top of your lungs,

218
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,520
"When I'm a big boy,"

219
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:14,980
"I want to be a general."

220
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:17,060
"I want to lead soldiers to war!"

221
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:18,850
So,

222
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:21,450
every time I see the puppet,

223
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:24,050
it reminds me of you at that age.

224
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,480
It reminds me of you, me and your mother,

225
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,340
all three of us in the courtyard.

226
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:35,000
All the happiness we felt.

227
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:38,130
All the laughter and chatter.

228
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:40,630
Enough!

229
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:43,050
At this stage,

230
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,240
what's the use in saying all this?

231
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:07,790
What are you doing?

232
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:08,930
Qi,

233
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:11,260
I'll never be able to compensate

234
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,650
for the things I've done to you
and your mother.

235
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:16,190
If there's a next life,

236
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,170
and fate brings us together again,

237
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:20,670
I'll make it up to you and your mother.

238
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:33,870
General!

239
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:39,900
Stand right there!

240
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:42,760
Stand right there!

241
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,090
If you want your general alive,

242
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,890
then back off!

243
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,090
Back off!

244
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,750
-Back off!
-Don't move!

245
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,990
Get me to the horse. Move!

246
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,230
Back off!

247
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,420
What are you standing there for?

248
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:03,140
Get Lord Xindu!

249
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:05,470
Nobody move.
We don't want the general harmed!

250
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:06,830
Now!

251
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:11,400
After him!

252
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:22,750
Concubine Rong.

253
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:31,070
Concubine Rong.

254
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:33,760
I heard your conversation.

255
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:36,050
I waited outside so as not to
disturb the treatment.

256
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:37,800
She's in critical condition.

257
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:39,750
Why don't you take her back
to the palace?

258
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,590
There are more servants
and medicines there.

259
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:43,210
You're right.

260
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,950
It must be the acute pain

261
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,840
and severe blood loss that caused her
to black out.

262
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:49,950
Your Highness,

263
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,890
why don't you go after Lord Xindu?

264
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:53,200
We'll look after her.

265
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:55,010
I'm worried Little Marquis...

266
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:56,690
Yes. You'd better go now.

267
00:16:56,770 --> 00:17:00,030
Don't worry. She'll be fine
after returning to the palace.

268
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:02,310
Thank you, Rong'er.

269
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:10,040
My lady, I'll prepare
the horse and carriage.

270
00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:24,530
Quick, close the door!

271
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:30,860
Servants!

272
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,710
Servants!

273
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,600
-Master!
-Servants!

274
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:36,270
Master.

275
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:39,350
Shut all the doors and windows, quick!

276
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,560
-Now!
-Yes, yes!

277
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:43,180
-Hurry.
-Hurry.

278
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,080
-Dear!
-Father!

279
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:47,240
-Dear!
-Father!

280
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:49,090
-What happened to you, Father?
-What happened?

281
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:50,480
-Dear.
-Father.

282
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:54,100
-Come, get over here.
-Father!

283
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:56,450
-Come with me.
-Father, what's going on?

284
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:05,940
Take care of your mother.
It's time to toughen up.

285
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:08,840
Don't be weak and useless any more,
you hear me?

286
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:09,940
Father,

287
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:11,610
what's going on?

288
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,510
Can you please tell me?

289
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:15,000
Promise me.

290
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:16,710
You have to promise me,

291
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,230
in the days to come,

292
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:21,290
you'll take good care of our son.

293
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:22,390
Mother.

294
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,290
-Father.
-Promise me!

295
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:25,560
Dear,

296
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:27,710
no matter what happens,

297
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:29,570
we will pull through.

298
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:33,570
-Yeah.
-We have Duke Cheng and Consort Duan.

299
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,540
Dear, you have no idea

300
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:38,660
what terrible things

301
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,450
I've done.

302
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,040
If the investigation continues,

303
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,030
we'll lose our lives.

304
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:51,290
Duke Su and his men are after us.

305
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,930
Even if we're lucky enough to escape,

306
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,960
Duke Cheng, for fear of being exposed,

307
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:59,840
would not spare any single one of us.

308
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,280
By then,

309
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:04,000
none of you would survive.

310
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,430
Those in there, listen up!

311
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:17,520
Lord Xindu has committed
a capital offence!

312
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:19,360
But only he is accountable.

313
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:22,220
Open the doors now,

314
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:24,290
and we'll release you

315
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:27,250
if you're found innocent
after the investigation.

316
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:29,260
But if you don't open up,

317
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:32,700
all of you will be treated as accomplices.

318
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:45,140
Rise.

319
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:03,580
Search the place!

320
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:04,770
-Yes.
-Yes.

321
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,390
This way.

322
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:12,420
Your Highness.

323
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:14,220
We'll take it from here.

324
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:19,550
I think

325
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,060
he's in the study room.

326
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,950
When I was little,

327
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:27,490
he would go to the study room
whenever he was troubled.

328
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,500
To him,

329
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:31,880
it's a haven where
all problems are solved

330
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,800
and all greed is satisfied.

331
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:36,440
The study room

332
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:38,600
is his last way out.

333
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,190
Duke Su.

334
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:29,110
There's no escaping you.

335
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,660
You pursued me with such ferocity.

336
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,560
Yet when it came time
to kill me, you hesitated.

337
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,410
I know.

338
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:39,010
You want to know where the
weapons are headed

339
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:43,290
as well as the truth behind Guanyan Town's
army ration corruption case.

340
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:44,680
Am I right?

341
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,900
I knew you had something to do with it.

342
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,340
Yes.

343
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:56,210
I know a thing or two about the case.

344
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,290
Duke Su,

345
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:03,710
if you could guarantee
my son and wife's safety

346
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:07,340
by means of an oath,

347
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:09,900
I promise

348
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:14,290
I'll tell you everything I know.

349
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:18,030
Are you trying to trick us again?

350
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:21,390
You unfilial mongrel.

351
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,190
At this point,

352
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,340
what choice do I have?

353
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:34,010
Duke Su,

354
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:36,730
all the details of the case

355
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,990
are in this study room.

356
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,970
Duke Su,

357
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,690
if you don't believe me,

358
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,770
you may ask your men to search the room.

359
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:58,560
But this rascal,

360
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,800
he's not allowed to go in.

361
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:02,920
He's a disloyal, unfilial son.

362
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,680
He framed his own father.

363
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:07,280
Just seeing him make me nauseous

364
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:09,070
-You...
-and speechless!

365
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,710
Get him out of my sight.

366
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:22,450
Duke Su,

367
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,140
after you.

368
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,980
Duke Su,

369
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:39,310
have a seat.

370
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,330
Let's have a nice talk.

371
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,640
No.

372
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:44,780
I'm not good at chit-chatting.

373
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:52,060
I thought we could talk

374
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:54,230
about life

375
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:56,240
and love.

376
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,760
But, since you're in a rush

377
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,590
to cut to the chase,

378
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,700
then we shall continue our conversation

379
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,310
in another place.

380
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,340
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

381
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:54,140
The case of Lord Xindu smuggling weapons

382
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:56,820
is indeed appalling.

383
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:59,240
To think an official

384
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:03,880
would neglected the lives of
the peasants and the soldiers

385
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,060
for his own selfish benefit!

386
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:10,450
It makes me wonder
how many other parasites

387
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:13,100
are hiding in this very court!

388
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,270
Send my orders!

389
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,720
All officials with close ties
to Zhang Yao Cheng

390
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,560
shall be suspended and investigated.

391
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,320
Huxiao Camp is to be restructured.

392
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,130
All the shipping documents

393
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:31,060
are to be re-investigated!

394
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:32,550
Yes!

395
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,290
Rise.

396
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:37,430
Thank you, Your Majesty!

397
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:42,930
Duke Su.

398
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:47,460
Yes!

399
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:48,750
For this case,

400
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:52,050
the Valiant General and you
have worked very hard.

401
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:53,540
You two will be rewarded.

402
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:56,980
But the case in Kushui Village
is yet to be solved.

403
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:59,270
We have to know where the stolen weapons

404
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:00,750
are headed.

405
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:03,440
You will be fully in-charge of that.

406
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,420
Yes, Your Majesty.

407
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:08,650
If the Imperial Guards
had arrived earlier,

408
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:11,140
things might have turned out differently.

409
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,930
Since Zhang Yao Cheng had decided to

410
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:17,470
take his secret to his grave,

411
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:21,250
it wouldn't have made any difference
when they arrive.

412
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:24,100
There's no need to blame yourself.

413
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:25,430
Besides,

414
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,690
it wasn't easy for a scholar like you

415
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:29,790
to lead an army.

416
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:38,590
You are right, brother.

417
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,290
My military powers

418
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:41,890
will pass to Duke Su.

419
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:45,760
What did you say?

420
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,670
I am but a scholar.

421
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:49,990
Relinquishing control

422
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:52,190
of the military will lighten my burden.

423
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:53,690
I assure you,

424
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:54,800
tomorrow,

425
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:58,390
I'll hand the Imperial Guards
over to Duke Su.

426
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:01,910
However...

427
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:04,660
Just say it.

428
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:07,540
Back then, Duke Su almost forsook
the Imperial Guards

429
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:09,960
for the sake of a woman.

430
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:14,100
The soldiers are still unhappy about it.

431
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:17,180
And now, of all times,

432
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:20,660
there's talk that Duke Su
had a falling out with his wife.

433
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:24,590
People might think Concubine Rong
is behind the change in leadership.

434
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:28,840
It's only natural that
the officials and soldiers

435
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:30,900
would think that.

436
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:36,400
Yes.

437
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:39,530
Everybody knows how fond Duke Su is

438
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:41,150
of Concubine Rong.

439
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:44,010
However,

440
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:46,360
if he takes over the Imperial Guards now,

441
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,290
people might take it the wrong way,

442
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:51,100
though they might not say it out loud.

443
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:55,940
You understand me well, brother.

444
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:01,170
This is indeed a big issue.

General, you haven't ate or slept
for the past few days.

447
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,880
If you keep training,

448
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:17,830

there are still small amounts
of toxin remaining in the body.

Bring me some food.

513
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:34,810
Yes.

514
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:43,420
You don't need to do it yourself.

515
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:44,900
With that attitude,

516
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:46,790
no servant will be able to deal with her.

517
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:48,050
It's best that I do it.

518
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:51,550
Cui Wan has been spoiled
since she was little.

519
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,060
Sorry to trouble you.

520
00:33:58,170 --> 00:34:00,430
Mr Ge diagnosed her just now.

521
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,780
It's nothing serious.

522
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:04,230
-She's just...
-I know she's pretending.

523
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,980
She wants to stay here longer.

524
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:08,250
Just let her. It's no big deal.

525
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:10,710
Since you knew,

526
00:34:10,929 --> 00:34:12,530
why are you still doing this?

527
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:16,120
For the sake of my dear
Duke Su, of course.

528
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:19,639
So, you knew.

529
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:22,940
And you're not upset?

530
00:34:23,139 --> 00:34:24,750
Why would I be upset?

531
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,730
After hearing what she said the other day,

532
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:31,170
I was touched.

533
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:34,510
Before this, I didn't know

534
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:36,850
why she went to such extremes.

535
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:39,540
But after hearing what she said...

536
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:45,650
Were you moved?

537
00:34:48,969 --> 00:34:51,100
How could you?

538
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:53,730
Didn't you say you weren't upset?

539
00:34:54,739 --> 00:34:56,690
Who said I wasn't upset?

540
00:34:58,490 --> 00:35:00,080
If it weren't for me,

541
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:03,330
she would have become your wife.

542
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:07,820
That's impossible.

543
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:13,760
Actually,

544
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:15,820
her feelings for you are true.

545
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:18,130
She's just expressing them the wrong way.

546
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:19,540
If she carries on like this,

547
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:21,070
who knows what will happen?

548
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:22,700
I'd rather use this opportunity

549
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,500
to see if I could change her.

550
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,800
Don't trouble yourself.

551
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,240
It's no trouble.

552
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:32,280
She's even willing to feign blindness
for your sake.

553
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:35,100
Isn't she cute?

554
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:37,260
Cute?

555
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:40,640
But not as cute as you.

556
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:39,120
Thank you.

557
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,640
I really need someone

558
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,230
to listen to my rant.

559
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,620
If he ever becomes a ghost,

560
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:52,590
he'd surely seek vengeance against me.

561
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:57,950
I'd ask him if he applied tranquilizers

562
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:01,820
instead of poison to the tip of his arrow.

563
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:09,160
And, if he drove me far away from the
study room right before the explosion.

564
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:11,410
Did he do all that

565
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,950
so he'd feel less indebted to me?

566
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,830
Perhaps

567
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:27,690
he never felt indebted to you.

568
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,000
He wanted many wives.

569
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:32,790
He coveted Feng Lai Yi.

570
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:34,450
To him,

571
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:36,530
those things were rightfully his.

572
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,060
You betrayed him

573
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:41,410
and ran away from home.

574
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:43,440
Why would he feel indebted to you?

575
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:50,000
But life is complicated.

576
00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:52,660
In that life-or-death moment,

577
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:54,570
he chose to save you.

578
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:59,060
He probably did it out of fatherly love.

579
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,940
Fatherly love?

580
00:38:28,330 --> 00:38:30,430
Your deed of begetting me

581
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:34,300
and your sin of killing my mother

582
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:38,610
seep into the soil like rain.

583
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,320
Gone

584
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:47,330
forever.

585
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:45,320
Rong'er.

586
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:47,340
Your Highness.

587
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,230
What's wrong?

588
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,590
Ruyi Pavilion will be launching
new products.

589
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:54,430
I'm going through my master's ledger.

590
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:55,490
It's really complicated.

591
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:57,020
I don't understand a thing.

592
00:39:56,590 --> 00:40:00,420
[Ruyi Pavilion Ledger]

593
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,170
Don't worry.

594
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:06,520
Do it one step at a time.

595
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,810
I can go through it with you

596
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:11,050
if you need my help.

597
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:15,990
Have a Ruyi Date.

598
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,390
It's sweet.

599
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:31,590
Your Highness, the princess
is not feeling well again.

600
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:44,770
When you go back,

601
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:46,560
remember to drink some ginger soup.

602
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,850
I'll have to bear the blame

603
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:49,550
if you get sick.

604
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:53,290
You too.

605
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:00,070
You...

606
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:04,790
How did you know I've been training
at Huxiao Camp every day?

607
00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:12,360
Did you come looking for me?

608
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:14,230
More than once, even?

609
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:16,260
I...

610
00:41:17,530 --> 00:41:19,730
I didn't come to console you.

611
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:28,840
You haven't been to Feng Lai Yi

612
00:41:28,850 --> 00:41:31,000
in a while, have you?

613
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:34,610
Who cares about that anyway?

614
00:41:35,770 --> 00:41:36,980
Since last month,

615
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:38,750
Ji Qing Ting has been trying his best

616
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:40,480
to keep me away from the ledger.

617
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:43,320
Plus, with you holding yourself up

618
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,900
in Huxiao Camp as of late,

619
00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:49,120
Feng Lai Yi has been more
reluctant than ever to let me in.

620
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:56,380
What if something bad happened
to Feng Lai Yi?
