the Princess Consort of Qingping...

18
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,290
can look decent.

19
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:07,930
Thank you, Your Highness.

20

You are welcome.

21
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,620
However, a chicken...

22
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:15,060
will still be a mere chicken even after...

I thought you ceremony would
be too dreary,

29
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:38,410
so I sent my men to ask around.

30
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:41,840
I brought your only peasant friend here.

31
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:43,290

32
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:46,410
it was the right decision.

33

You sent me the invitation?

34

Thank you, Your Highness.

35
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:54,720
But Ms Fu and I
are merely acquaintances.

36
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:56,690
We are barely friends.

37
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:58,610
See? Ms Fu?

38
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:01,540
Once someone got a taste of fame,

39
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:03,690
they forget all about their friends.

40
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:05,520
I knew she wouldn't invite you.

41
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:07,410
So I did it instead.

42
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:09,590
But don't be too upset.

43
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:11,200
Once you are at her level...

44

46

Zhu'er, why are you putting up with her?

47
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:21,430
It was an honour to have...

48
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:23,050
her presence in this manor.

49
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:24,900
You are a guest.

50
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:26,180
I won't chase you out.

51

cause any more trouble...

56

Yes.

I gave you?

-I like it.
-Thank you, Your Highness.

60

61
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:55,370
I have plenty of them.

62

69
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:11,730

we consolidated the results.

you wish to tell me?

When people found out who I am,

85

they couldn't wait to fawn over me.

88

I took you as my little follower,

89
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,530
that was disrespectful of me.

90

if I am King An or a peasant.

When I am with you,

93
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,800
I am just your little follower.

94
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:22,490
I can't accept that.

95
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:24,290
Perhaps...

96
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:26,930
it's better that I bow to you instead.

97
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:29,610
I was just kidding.

98
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:30,980
When you are with me,

99
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:33,030
you will always be my little sidekick.

100
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:34,550
I am glad you see it that way.

101
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:37,550
But why do you choose not to
reveal your true identity?

102
00:06:40,659 --> 00:06:41,850
If I had a choice,

103
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:44,490
I would rather be a fish in the water.

104
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:48,800
But unfortunately I was
born into the royal family.

105
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,510
I travelled across the land
with my alias.

106
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:53,240
I know the people's hardships.

107
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:55,870
So I took up the name of Farmer Ju Shui...

108
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:57,520
to express my frustration.

109
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:00,360
Truth be told,

110
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:01,820
I once thought...

111
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:04,740
your articles are meant to
be the people's voice,

112
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:07,030
but it didn't solve the problems
at their cores.

113
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:08,020
So I thought...

114
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:10,350
you were just after the fame and praises.

115
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:13,010
That was very shallow of me.

116
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,300
No.

117
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:16,320
You are completely right about me.

118
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:18,660
Every time I write,

119
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:21,350
I fear someone would eventually
find out who I am.

120
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:22,920
The title of King An...

121
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,090
is just like a disguise.

122
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:29,010
It's a shackle that binds me
even after my death.

00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:01,110
I won't allow anyone to bully you.

174
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:03,360
Not even the dates. Here you go.

175
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:11,360
Was there wind just now?

176
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:18,050
You are rising to power
overnight this time.

177
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:22,670
His Majesty is giving you the title
of Princess Consort of Qingping.

178
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:25,150
With all the noble guests,

179
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:27,290
the Qi family is really honoured.

180
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:29,440
If you could employ some tricks...

181
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:31,720
to get yourself a noble as husband,

182
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:33,650
even if you are the mistress,

183
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:37,910
the Qi family will be part of
the royal family.

184
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:39,370
Do you get it?

185
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:41,050
Madam,

186
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:44,450
have you ever treated me as family?

187
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:46,900
When my brother and I needed help,

188
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,490
you pushed us away.

189
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:52,080
My mother's burial was haphazard at best.

190
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:55,190
If it wasn't for Consort Duan...

191
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:57,070
who showed her the last respect,

192
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,450
my mother's soul...

193
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:01,760
-would have become a wandering ghost!
-Qi Zhu!

194
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:05,210
Just because you're the
Princess Consort of Qingping,

195
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:07,390
doesn't mean you can disrespect me.

196
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:10,730
I am the First Madam of the Qi family.

197
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:14,970
You must listen to me no matter
what I tell you!

198
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:19,810
Stay away from her.

199
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:21,160
You shameless peasant,

200
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:22,740
you got yourself a guard?

201
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:24,580
Your smirk won't last long.

202
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:27,010
You will end up just like your brother.

203
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:29,070
You were born a peasant.

204
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:30,310
Stop acting so high and mighty.

205
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:32,110
Don't you dare bring up his name!

206
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:36,070
From now on, Zhu'er is
Princess Consort of Qingping.

207
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:37,270
Disrespect her again...

208
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:38,470
and His Majesty will punish you.

209
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:39,460
Fine.

210
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,190
You think you're above me now?

211
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:42,450
What's the big deal?

212
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,530
Zhu'er, are you all right?

213
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:50,540
Fu Rong.

214
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:51,770
Why are you here?

215
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:55,810
Look at this. Do you remember when we...

216
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:56,780
use to beat the dates down.

217
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:58,610
You were in such bad luck, you...

218
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,410
Miss, the guests
are waiting for you.

219
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:13,330
Le Dan, send someone here...

220
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,450
and chop down this date tree.

221
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:20,740
Zhu'er.

222
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:22,490
Fu Rong, that's enough.

223
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:46,010
[You are rising to power
overnight this time.]

224
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:50,520
[His Majesty is giving you the title
of Princess Consort of Qingping.]

225
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:54,250
Watch out.

226
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,010
Duke Huai.

227
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,380
You are here.

228
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:58,990
Princess Consort of Qingping.

229
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:01,010
I am sorry for startling you.

230
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:04,110
How very conceited of you,
Princess Consort of Qingping.

231
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,990
It's your inauguration ceremony.

232
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:08,090
Yet you never bother to show up.

233
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:11,460
What? Are you up to no good again?

234
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,170
I almost knocked her down.

235
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:15,860
Fine, I was just making a joke.

236
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:17,680
Why are you giving me that look?

237
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:20,820
Duke Huai.

238
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:22,650
Where is Duke Su?

239
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,920
I lost sight of him.

240
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:28,050
He might be over there.

241
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:29,810
There?

242
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:35,650
That's just the way she is.

243
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:37,250
She speaks as she pleases.

244
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:40,010
Much obliged, Your Highness.

245
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:41,730
I should go inside now.

246
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:43,180
Sure.

247
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:57,050
Ms Fu.

248
00:14:58,820 --> 00:14:59,940
Your Highness.

249
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:03,610
Your leg...

250
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,100
I am fine.

251
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,250
With that injury,

252
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:34,670
you won't be able to leave the manor.

253
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:43,820
Does it hurt?

254
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:46,390
Not at all.

255
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:55,870
I thought it didn't hurt.

256
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:58,290
Of course it hurts!

257
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:01,410
Just yell if it does.

258
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:09,710
You should be glad there is no fracture.

259
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:11,110
Your leg was dislocated.

260
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:14,530
A few days of rest should heal you.

261
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:27,490
Much obliged, Your Highness.

262
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:06,930
No problem.

263
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:21,380
Lan Xiang.

264
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:25,060
Have you looked into
Princess of Xihe's background?

265
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:27,460
I was told her father
is the General of Zhen.

266
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:28,860
When she was young,

267
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:30,670
the general fell on the battlefield.

268
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:31,870
His Majesty took pity on her,

269
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:34,910
so she was brought into the palace
and raised as a princess.

270
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:36,010
By the way,

271
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,210
while you were washing up,

272
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:39,740
two coachmen came by.

273
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:41,770
They each brought a gift.

274
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:45,840
They said you left these
at the princess's manor.

275
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:47,530
I left these behind?

276
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:59,190
Could it be medicinal ointment?
The smell is intense.

277
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:11,500
Right.

278
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:12,820
When you came back,

279
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:14,190
you had only one of your earrings.

280
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:16,030
The Princess Consort of Qingping
is thoughtful.

281
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:18,050
She even knows this belongs to you.

282
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:31,780
"It's a pleasure to meet you again."

283
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,010
"My question has been answered."

284
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:43,020
"Back to the owner."

285
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:45,650
"May we meet again on the river bank..."

286
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:48,570
"and continue our conversation."

287
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:15,610
Master, you are amazing.

288
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:18,090
It looks brand new.

289
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:19,260
Next time,

290
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:20,380
if you ever break it again,

291
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:21,820
I won't be helping you.

292
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,780
Yes. Thank you, Master.

293
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:25,730
I will keep it safe from now on.

294
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:28,250
I should get going.

295
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:29,580
Go on.

296
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:55,980
I am done with the fishing.
I don't have the talent.

297
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:58,730
It's never about getting the fish,

298
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:00,260
but the heart.

299
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:02,940
It's a honing of will and patience.

300
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:06,530
No, what matters is
we get to eat the fish.

301
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:12,150
Didn't you ask me to come here
so we could have fish?

302
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:14,220
No.

303
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:17,610
We parted ways in a rush
that day after the ceremony.

304
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:19,630
I've been wanting to ask you out.

305
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:21,060
I was told...

306
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:23,310
you're going to marry into
Marquis Xindu's family?

307
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:24,830
I was just fooling around with Zhang Yan,

308
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:25,970
I didn't agree.

309
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:28,750
Sure,

310
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:30,890
it's not like they can keep you there.

311
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:33,540
You know me the best.

312
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:35,960
I don't feel like
getting married anyway.

313
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:37,450
Why is that?

314
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:41,030
Pretty and talented girls can marry up.

315
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:43,800
Those who are less desirable
can only marry down.

316
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:45,050
As a woman,

317
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:46,660
it was as though everything...

318
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:49,520
was only for the sake of finding
a good husband.

319
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:51,030
But we are all born equal.

320
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:53,010
We all have our goals and desires.

321
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:54,770
Such as me.

322
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:59,200
What is your goal?

323
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:01,970
I haven't decided yet.

324
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:04,770
But that is not how I want to get married.

325
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:06,380
It's not a marriage,

326
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:07,930
but living in a cage.

327
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:09,530
True love...

328
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:12,250
is about freedom and understanding.

329
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:14,460
Well said.

330
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:15,660
You have a point.

331
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,650
You agree with me?

332
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:20,690
Keep this secret for me.

333
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:23,300
Sure, we know each other's secret.

334
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:24,670
Your secret is more serious.

335
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:26,510
You are both King An and Farmer Ju Shui.

336
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:27,710
You have two secrets.

337
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:29,660
Fine.

338
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:37,750
[Have you ever heard about...]

339
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,620
[an organisation known as...]

340

00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:52,890
Your Highness.

509
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:55,850
Please, follow me inside.

510
00:29:58,110 --> 00:29:59,210
This way.

511
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:01,520
[Xindu Residence]

512
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:04,680
Please, come in.

513
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:08,990
Come in.

514
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:11,220
Mother, look.

515
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:12,410
They are here.

516
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:15,440
-Greetings, Lady Xindu.
-Lady Xindu.

517
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:17,980
Lady Xindu, my father is ill.

518
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:19,230
My mother must look after him,

519
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:20,890
so they couldn't make it here.

520
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:22,820
But they did ask me...

521
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:24,870
to send Marquis Xindu his
favourite Jade Corals.

522
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:26,650
Please accept the gift.

523
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:33,150
Marquis Xindu is attending
to the important guests.

524
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:34,450
He is busy.

525
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:37,930
I shall thank Lord Fu on his behalf.

526
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:39,780
Speaking of which,

527
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:42,330
if it weren't for
Marquis Xindu's birthday,

528
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:45,570
I don't think I'd ever get the chance
to see you, Ms Fu.

529
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:52,900
Lady Xindu, Rong'er caught a cold.

530
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:54,350
She's been coughing all day.

531
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:55,810
I hope you wouldn't mind.

532
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:00,730
Princess of Xihe.

533
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:03,820
Princess,

534
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:05,640
this is merely a banquet.

535
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:08,260
There is no need for so many gifts.

536
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:11,280
This is only adequate
for Marquis Xindu's birthday.

537
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:14,880
-Are you all right?
-Princess of Xihe.

538
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:16,310
Ms Fu.

539
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:18,840
What sickness do you actually have?

540
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:21,020
All the guests are here.

541
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:22,640
Isn't all that coughing...

542
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,170
rather unbecoming?

543
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:25,340
Lady Xindu.

544
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:27,250
Rong'er merely caught a cold.

545
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:29,650
If you are worried,

546
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:31,420
since we've sent our regards,

547
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:34,330
perhaps Rong'er and I should go home.

548
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:36,210
Please, no!

549
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:38,030
The banquet hasn't started yet.

550
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:39,770
I can't let Rong go.

551
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:44,290
If...

552
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:47,490
If Rong is not feeling so well...

553
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:49,730
Earl Yan is right.

554
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:51,860
If I am to leave now,

555
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:53,610
it would be disrespectful.

556
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:56,170
Perhaps we should get a doctor.

557
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:58,390
If it turns out to be contagious,

558
00:31:58,460 --> 00:31:59,920
I won't hesitate to leave.

559
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:03,130
Fine, get Ninth Uncle here.

560
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:05,770
Let him tend to Ms Fu.

561
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:07,310
Princess of Xihe.

562
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:08,490
Please come in.

563
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:21,570
Rong.

564
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:23,000
Please come with me.

565
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:24,990
I need to tell you something.

566
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:28,140
Go on without me.

567
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:29,630
I'll have a word with him.

568
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:31,610
-Xuan.
-I'll leave her to you.

569
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:34,930
Rong, please come with me.

570
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:41,020
Rong.

571
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:42,510
Are you really all right?

572
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:44,900
What rotten luck.

573
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:46,050
Of all the times...

574
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:47,140
to catch a cold,

575
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:48,640
it had to be today.

576
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:53,450
Rong, please hang in there.

577
00:32:53,790 --> 00:32:56,090
There are many guests here.

578
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:57,260
I know.

579
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,950
My mother has been giving you
the cold shoulder lately.

580
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:01,700
But she only did it for my sake.

581
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:02,930
Right?

582
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:06,380
It's hard for me being caught
between you two.

583
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:07,690
But Rong,

584
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:11,970
I know you'll understand, right?

585
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:16,130
Duke Su.

586
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:18,410
Bow. It's Duke Su.

587
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:19,850
Duke Su.

588
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:21,230
Ms Fu.

589
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:22,890
How is your leg?

590
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:27,040
Rong, you two know each other?

591
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:29,230
When did you know each other?

592
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:30,450
Your leg is injured?

593
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:32,960
When did it happen?
Why didn't you tell me?

594
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:35,400
We only met once at the princess' manor.

595
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:36,980
It's nothing. I am fine.

596
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:38,160
Duke Su!

597
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:40,450
You are finally back.

598
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:43,170
Princess of Xihe.

599
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:44,860
Duke Su.

600
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:47,070
Earl Yan and Ms Fu are having
a tender moment.

601
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:48,530
Let's not interrupt them.

602
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:50,460
Ms Fu caught a cold.

603
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:52,110
We should keep our distance from her.

604
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:53,730
Ms Fu caught a cold?

605
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:58,350
Duke Su, the banquet is about to start.

606
00:33:58,350 --> 00:33:59,490
Let's go inside.

607
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:04,230
Take good care of yourself.

608
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:05,770
I know.

609
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:09,130
Little Marquis.

610
00:34:09,219 --> 00:34:11,020
-Why are you here?
-Stand aside.

611
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:12,370
Little Marquis.

612
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:13,659
Get lost.

613
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:16,560
Marquis Xindu.

614
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:21,250
-Why are you here?
-Why?

615
00:34:22,389 --> 00:34:24,610
Marquis Xindu doesn't want me here?

616
00:34:31,179 --> 00:34:32,540
You once said...

617
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:33,989
no matter how much of a disgrace I am,

618
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:36,770
I will always be welcomed here.

619
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:40,219
Get out!

620
00:34:46,429 --> 00:34:47,650
Wu Bai Qi.

621
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:51,210
You must think very highly of yourself.

622
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:54,810
I'll be honest with you.

623
00:34:55,389 --> 00:34:58,370
I pulled strings for you
to join the Imperial Guards.

624
00:34:58,550 --> 00:34:59,460
But look at you.

625
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:02,850
You are still a lowly
lieutenant after so long.

626
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:04,320
The whole city...

627
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:06,660
calls you "Little Marquis".

628
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:07,750
Do you know why?

629
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:10,170
They are being respectful to me, not you!

630
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:13,150
You wanted to leave home.

631
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:16,330
You wanted to forge your own path.

632
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:17,940
But look at you.

633
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:19,580
What do you live on?

634
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:22,870
You survive thanks to the Feng Lai Yi
your mother left you.

635
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:26,410
Look.

636
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:28,330
What did I tell you?

637
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:31,100
All you care about...

638
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:32,650
is Feng Lai Yi.

639
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:36,090
You can have it if you want.

640
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:39,410
Provided you change your surname to "Wu".

641
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:40,730
Then you can have it.

642
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:42,120
How does that sound?

643
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:52,730
Get out of my sight.

644
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:56,210
Get out of my sight!

645
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:00,730
Get him out of here.

646
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:02,610
Don't bother.

647
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:05,010
This filthy place...

648
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:08,170
is not worthy of my time.

649
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:30,580
Stop standing there.

650
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:31,860
Serve the food.

651
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:33,150
-I'll have a look.
-Come on.

652
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:34,140
It's nothing.

653
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:35,420
Let's drink. Come on.

654
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:36,590
-Get back to your seats.
-Get ready.

655
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:37,700
Serve the wine.

656
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:43,390
-Watch where you are going!
-I am so sorry.

657
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:44,500
I...

658
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:48,860
Little Marquis.

659
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:50,770
So it's the housekeeper.

660
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:52,550
Is this how Marquis Xindu...

661
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:54,410
educates his servants?

662
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:56,080
They ran into the guests...

663
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:58,380
and don't bother to apologize.

664
00:36:58,470 --> 00:37:00,740
Little Marquis, I...

665
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:02,410
Bow and apologize.

666
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:03,460
Kneel.

667
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:05,010
-But...
-Kneel.

668
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:11,130
Kowtow to me.

669
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:13,400
Kowtow to me!

670
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:18,650
Little Marquis.

671
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:23,590
Ms Fu.

672
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:27,570
Get up.

673
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:32,490
My thanks, Ms Fu.

674
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:35,400
-Leave us be.
-I thank you, Little Marquis.

675
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:40,010
Ms Fu.

676
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:42,120
Don't take this the wrong way.

677
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:44,950
You can do whatever you please.

678
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:47,230
You've offended everyone here anyway.

679
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:48,870
I am merely an outsider.

680
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:50,470
It's not my place to comment.

681
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:54,270
If anyone were offended,

682
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:55,950
it would be you on Mount Yunluo...

683
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:57,950
-a few days ago...
-Little Marquis!

684
00:37:57,990 --> 00:38:00,530
We agreed it was an accident.

685
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:02,420
Don't bring it up again.

686
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:03,730
It may be an accident,

687
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:05,030
but as the man,

688
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:06,710
I must take responsibility.

689
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:08,420
I only found out after coming here...

690
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:10,070
that Zhang Yan and your sister
are engaged.

691
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:11,150
Since childhood, even.

692
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:12,540
If I hadn't left,

693
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:14,800
you and I would be engaged instead.

694
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:19,450
Listen closely.

695
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:21,460
We fell into the river,

696
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:22,670
but you didn't see anything...

697
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:24,370
you weren't supposed to see.

698
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:26,530
So you are responsible for nothing.

699
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:28,940
From this moment on,

700
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:30,430
take it as it never happened.

701
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:31,550
Otherwise...

702
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:34,630
Otherwise...

703
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:36,090
I will make you pay.

704
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:46,300
That's all?

705
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:59,060
Wu Bai Qi.

706
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:02,330
Are you proud of your mischief?

707
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:05,020
That's right. Marquis Xindu was right.

708
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:06,900
Besides your parents' legacy,

709
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:09,470
have you earned anything
with your own hands?

710
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:10,870
Your engagement with me...

711
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:12,290
is simply a bad joke.

712
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:14,370
Listen. I would rather be a nun...

713
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:17,050
than marrying a spoiled child like you.

714
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:20,090
Spoiled child.

715
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:31,530
Please.

716
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:48,630
It's Marquis Xindu's birthday.

717
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:49,870
With so many guests here,

718
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:52,670
why not have a game of
pitch-pot to make it merrier?

719
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:56,920
Princess, that was...

720
00:39:57,070 --> 00:39:59,120
a great suggestion. Very well.

721
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:02,300
Qu Hong. Get it ready.

722
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:03,570
Yes.

723
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:07,250
A game of pitch-pot needs a wager.

724
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:08,930
Princess.

725
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:10,950
Any idea what should be wagered?

726
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:14,570
The winner who comes out on top...

727
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:18,070
will have my jade bracelet as the prize.

728
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:20,000
How generous of you, Princess.

729
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:22,870
That jade bracelet is made
from premium material.

730
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:30,850
What?

731
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:33,540
I was told Ms Fu is skilled
at this game.

732
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:35,580
Why don't we start the round off?

733
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:38,400
We'll each wager a bracelet.
It's only adequate.

734
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:39,660
Princess.

735
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:41,590
That bracelet is dear to Rong'er.

736
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:43,550
Using it as wager seems inappropriate.

737
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:45,100
It's just a wager.

738
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:46,220
If you want to keep it,

739
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:47,740
just win it back.

740
00:40:47,830 --> 00:40:49,550
That's a harsh demand, Princess.

741
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:50,790
That doesn't seem appropriate.

742
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:52,210
How is it inappropriate?

743
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:54,770
Is Ms Fu afraid?

744
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:56,700
Rong...

745
00:40:58,430 --> 00:41:01,030
-You should...
-The Princess asked for a game,

746
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:02,850
then so be it.

747
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:04,260
Ms Fu.

748
00:41:04,350 --> 00:41:06,380
If this is against your will...

749
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:07,610
In that case,

750
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:09,530
I shall gladly participate.

751
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:12,260
Good.

752
00:41:12,350 --> 00:41:13,900
Let's all...

753
00:41:13,990 --> 00:41:15,690
watch the game.

754
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:19,810
Ten points to Princess of Xihe.

755
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:31,380
Double five-point for Princess of Xihe.

756
00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:34,330
-A total of 15 points to the Princess.
-What now?

757
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:36,690
Next, Ms Fu Rong.

758
00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:41,890
Rong, good luck.

759
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:50,220
Ms Fu Rong hits the mark.

760
00:41:50,310 --> 00:41:51,690
20 points to her.

761
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:05,380
Ms Fu Rong hits the mark again.

762
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:06,580
20 points to her.

763
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:09,080
She gets a total of 40 points!

764
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:10,290
You...

765
00:42:10,790 --> 00:42:11,820
It's your turn.

766
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:14,890
Ms Fu, this game is becoming
boring at this rate.

767
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:16,290
Why don't we...

768
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:18,210
put on blindfolds?

769
00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:25,740
Double points for Princess of Xihe.

770
00:42:25,830 --> 00:42:26,900
40 points to her!

771
00:42:26,990 --> 00:42:29,610
She gets a total of 55 points!
