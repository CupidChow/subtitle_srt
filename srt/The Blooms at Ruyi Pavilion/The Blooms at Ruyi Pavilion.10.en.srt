Did Ms Fu give up because

It was just a hobby. It's nothing.

But I found out that...

37

Ms Fu has another illness.

40

This illness is not harmful to her.

41
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:33,480
But,

42
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,810
her body is too cold.

43
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:36,909
It's very rare.

44

But if she has this illness,

45
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:40,690

46

No.

48

Do you know what you did wrong?

53

You were arrogant and defied Her Highness.

54

And you were so intimate with
Duke Su in public.

55

There's a marriage proposal between
the Fu family and Xindu Residence.

was set by Lord Xindu...

are no longer of the same status.

So, we never mentioned about
this marriage proposal.

91

Xindu Residence is the one
that brought up this matter...

92
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,760

by Xindu Residence.

Now, I don't need to keep it
a secret anymore.

00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,190
But no need to be bothered by this.

172
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,800
I'll have to trouble you
after this as well.

173
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:43,590
If you continue to...

174
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:45,670
falter while you speak like before,

175
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,850
I'll pull out all of your plantlets.

176
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:50,360
I won't do that anymore.

177
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,470
Don't hurt my babies.

178
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:54,060
I won't.

179
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:56,270
Let me get some water for you.

180
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:01,230
This Ms Fu Rong is
really ruthless towards herself.

181
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:06,910
[Fu Residence]

182
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:14,360
Father, you are still ill. Don't be mad.

183
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:17,600
Then, don't make me mad!

184
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:20,660
You are getting
more and more outrageous now!

185
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:23,050
You didn't even discuss it with us...

186
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:24,200
and you just went to...

187
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,710
Xindu Residence by yourself
to get back your age card!

188
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:29,260
This is marriage, not child's play!

189
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:33,000
If they really want this marriage,

190
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:35,680
I won't be able to get back
my age card so easily.

191
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,660
Besides, Lady Xindu hates me so much.

192
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,790
I'll be bullied to no end if I marry him.

193
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:40,950
You...

194
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:43,630
You are still so unrepentant.

195
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:46,810
Looks like I was too lenient towards you.

196
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:49,580
Today, I'm going to teach you a lesson!

197
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:53,730
Enough, my dear.
She knows her mistake now.

198
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,960
She's not that young anymore.

199
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:58,380
Let her be.

200
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:02,260
Sister?

201
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:03,880
Xuan'er.

202
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:05,390
Why are you kneeling?

203
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:08,420
I'm the one who went to
Xindu Residence with Rong'er.

204
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:10,880
It's my fault for letting
Rong'er run amuck.

205
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:12,190
Moreover,

206
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,130
I saw everything.

207
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:17,570
With Rong'er personality,
if she really marries that man,

208
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,680
she'll really be bullied.

209
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:23,900
Sister.

210
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,820
Look at you.

211
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:36,530
I'll bring Rong'er to Yun Luo Temple
tomorrow to meditate...

212
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:38,660
so that she can reflect on her mistake.

213
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:40,270
Yun Luo Temple?

214
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:42,030
That place is cold and dreary.

215
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:43,440
And I can only eat vegetables and tofu.
I don't want to go there.

216
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,320
You!

217
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:45,900
-I'll go.
-Okay, enough.

218
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:47,180
I'll go.

219
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:48,810
Enough. Just go.

220
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:50,960
Don't worry, Father.
Yun Luo Temple is a serene place.

221
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,960
I'll be there too.

222
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,730
It'll be a good place for
Rong'er to cultivate herself.

223
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:55,930
Yes. Don't worry.

224
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:59,150
Dear...

225
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:01,300
You deserve it.

226
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:03,900
Dear!

227
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:05,040
Stop looking.

228
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:09,220
Your Highness.

229
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:16,990
Someone put this in front
of the residence.

230
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:48,250
Everyone knows that Mr Dong
is an honest man.

231
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:51,680
Accusing him of using power
for personal gain must be a slander.

232
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,040
I think the sender...

233
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:56,490
is not trying to impeach my uncle.

234
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:58,280
He's trying to...

235
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:00,830
drag me and my uncle into this.

236
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:03,600
[Qin Qing]

237
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:25,470
Looks like the sender is not related to
Qi Ce's case.

238
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:28,860
Mr Ge.

239
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:31,820
Today, I saw the Ruyi emblem...

240
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,800
on another person.

241
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:40,960
That person must be someone you trust.

242
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:44,650
Why did you say that?

243
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:47,460
If you really suspect that person,

244
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:50,900
you'll either send someone
to investigate that person...

245
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:53,580
or have that person detained
for interrogation.

246
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:55,120
You wouldn't be sitting here...

247
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,020
to discuss about it so calmly.

248
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,380
Qi Ce's case just happened recently.

249
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,680
Even the most stupid person
in this world...

250
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,570
would not reveal the Ruyi Emblem...

251
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,200
so rashly in front of you.

252
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,360
I don't mean anything else.

253
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:11,010
I just want you to ask yourself about...

254
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:13,340
why you don't suspect this person.

255
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,510
You can leave now.

256
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:19,220
Yes, Your Highness.

257
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:31,420
[Dong Residence]

258
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:33,450
If his illness is left untreated,

259
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:35,650
his life will be in danger.

260
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,930
We can still keep him alive for now.

261
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:39,830
But if his illness attacks again,

262
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:41,010
I'm afraid that...

263
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,770
I know.

264
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:45,240
I've been looking for...

265
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,440
those two ingredients all these years.

266
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:48,630
But...

267
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:51,350
I understand.

268
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:54,350
Ford nervilia leaf and
live lumbricus rubellus...

269
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:56,810
are rare medicinal ingredients.

270
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:59,450
I've only seen one
in many years of my career.

271
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:01,670
And it's a dead lumbricus rubellus.

272
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:03,360
No matter what,

273
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,500
I'll have to trouble you from now on.

274
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,460
You are welcome.

275
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:09,390
See him out.

276
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,370
Yes, Master. This way please.

277
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,720
-Thank you.
-You are welcome.

278
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:19,560
Father.

279
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,240
Wen'er.

280
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,030
Wen'er.

281
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,730
Father.

282
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:32,140
Am I going to die soon?

283
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:33,640
Nonsense.

284
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:35,700
The physician said that...

285
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:38,210
as long as you have a good rest
and eat well,

286
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:41,250
you'll grow up healthily like others.

287
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:44,060
Others can run...

288
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:45,300
and jump.

289
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:47,980
I can't even stand.

290
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:49,650
You'll get better.

291
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,270
Believe me.

292
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,800
Sleep now.

293
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:19,530
Your son is asleep?

294
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:28,770
Don't mention him.

295
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,490
Why are you here?

296
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,050
We had a deal.

297
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,260
You said that you won't mention about
the fan case anymore...

298
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,260
after I approve that letter for you.

299
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,340
Don't worry.

300
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:43,060
I won't mention about the fan this time.

301
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,220
Why are you here then?

302
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:49,660
The one who hired you wants to meet you.

303
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:50,630
Meet me?

304
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,540
For what?

305
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,180
For me to follow his order...

306
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:57,510
and become your puppet?

307
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:03,700
My lord.

308
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,420
After three days,

309
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,380
take a trip to Duke Cheng's Residence.

310
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:10,120
Duke Cheng?

311
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:11,750
Why is he doing this?

312
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:14,920
Instead of asking me,
you should ask him instead.

313
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,320
I can't go and meet him.

314
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:22,840
If this batch of sulphur...

315
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,650
explodes inside the most
populated area in the capital city,

316
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:27,410
many people will die.

317
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:30,580
And you who approved
the letter for this sulphur...

318
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:32,340
will become a target of scorn.

319
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:33,310
You!

320
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,620
Since the beginning,

321
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,900
you've never planned to let me go!

322
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:40,970
You are wrong.

323
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:44,350
The one who is doing business with you
since the beginning...

324
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:45,320
is not me.

325
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:46,910
It's Duke Cheng.

326
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:49,150
For me,

327
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:52,270
this is just a business transaction.

328
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:01,650
What is Duke Cheng planning?

329
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:05,250
I can't work for him.

330
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:09,320
I can't commit the same mistake again.

331
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,130
My lord.

332
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,280
My suggestion is,

333
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:17,750
continue to cooperate with Duke Cheng.

334
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:20,560
There might be hope yet.

335
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:23,600
If I have to become someone's weapon,

336
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:27,180
how is it different from being dead?

337
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,530
If you die,

338
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:30,510
what about your son?

339
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:33,720
If the sulphur explodes,

340
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:35,830
what about the people?

341
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,100
After three days,

342
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:43,650
someone will come and
escort you to the residence.

343
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,300
From now on,

344
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:48,900
we won't ever meet again.

345
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:30,520
Little cat, I'll leave this to you.

346
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:51,590
I came to Yun Luo Temple today to pray.

347
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,240
I never thought that
I'll meet you again, Ms Fu.

348
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,120
Little cat.

349
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,310
You look so hungry.

350
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,670
Do you want to eat this fish?

351
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:09,550
Look.

352
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:12,580
Little Marquis!

353
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:15,000
This is a sacred place of Buddhism.

354
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,130
How can you kill a fish to feed your cat?

355
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:20,640
Little cat.

356
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,400
It's not that I don't want to feed you.

357
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,000
This lady over here
doesn't allow you to eat it.

358
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:29,650
Go and play then.

359
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:36,740
I thought that...

360
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:38,960
you are not going to talk to me forever.

361
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,280
I have no grudge against you.

362
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,760
Excuse me.

363
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:47,340
Venerable sir.

364
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:48,570
What is it?

365
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,470
Did you see a cat?

366
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:51,930
It is white in colour.

367
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,720
Our abbot just brought it here recently.

368
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,050
It's very intelligent.

369
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:59,440
So, the cat was brought here by the abbot.

370
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:01,510
I thought it was a wild cat.

371
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,730
The cat is just here.

372
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:05,960
Where's the cat?

373
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,190
Where did it go?

374
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:09,300
What should we do now?

375
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:10,970
Don't panic, sir.

376
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:12,330
We'll find it for you.

377
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:14,970
We?

378
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:19,420
Yes. If it wasn't because
you stopped me from feeding it,

379
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:20,910
it wouldn't have run off.

380
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:22,490
Don't you want to find it?

381
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,390
Of course I want to find it.

382
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:26,630
But I don't want to do it with you.

383
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:29,820
When did I say that
I want to find it with you?

384
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:47,710
Your Highness.

385
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,370
Mr Dong.

386
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,090
Don't be so ill at ease.

387
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,230
Come.

388
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:01,570
Let's drink some tea...

389
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:03,190
and have a chat.

390
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:09,970
You are always upright and outspoken.

391
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:12,300
I really respect you.

392
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:16,670
When I think that
I'll be able to cooperate with you,

393
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:18,510
I feel so relieved.

394
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:20,400
Duke Cheng.

395
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:22,820
What do I have to do...

396
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:24,750
for you to let me go?

397
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:29,460
This question sounds too aloof.

398
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:31,150
What do you mean by let you go?

399
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:33,110
When have I ever forced you before?

400
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:37,120
If you are not willing, you can leave now.

401
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,330
Actually, it's not something difficult.

402
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,920
A few days ago,

403
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:15,530
the sulphur that you transported out...

404
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:18,780
has already been escorted to
somewhere safe by me.

405
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:20,540
Unfortunately,

406
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:22,790
I still need something.

407
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,550
What?

408
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:29,170
Nitre.

409
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:30,130
What...

410
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:33,210
You just smuggled away the sulphur...

411
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:34,670
and now you want the nitre?

412
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:41,770
We cannot simply transport nitre
within the capital city.

413
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,550
And recently,

414
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:47,240
I've travelled too frequently
to and from the capital city.

415
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:49,760
That's why I have to trouble you...

416
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:51,300
to do this for me.

417
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:54,060
Sulphur plus nitre.

418
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,230
What are you trying to do?

419
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:57,190
Mr Dong!

420
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:00,580
My advice for you is,

421
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,660
do more and talk less.

422
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:12,420
Unless you really want to
work for me forever.

423
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:18,800
Drink some tea.

424
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:39,340
[The rare ford nervilia leaf and
live lumbricus rubellus as medicine]

425
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,690
Take this box...

426
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:56,220
to Master Luo in Lotus Village.

427
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:59,980
Ask him to go to Dong Residence for me.

428
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:03,540
There's ford nervilia leaf
inside this box.

429
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:06,000
We still need lumbricus rubellus.

430
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:08,910
Find it and send them to Dong Residence.

431
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:09,920
Understood.

432
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:40,550
The wall of Yun Luo Temple is easier to
climb over than the wall of Fu Residence.

433
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:41,910
It's not hard at all.

434
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:01,440
Take a look.

435
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,180
Which one do you like?

436
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:05,400
Let me try this on.

437
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:13,540
Why are you here?

438
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:16,540
I am your little follower.

439
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:18,750
Of course I'll follow you everywhere.

440
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,190
Be honest with me.

441
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:24,940
I was just nearby to study.

442
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:26,960
I heard that you and Ms Fu Xuan
are here at the temple.

443
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,490
So, I came here to visit you.

444
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,950
I see.

445
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:38,400
There is a shadow play over there.
Let's take a look.

446
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,570
Sir, look at this red thread.

447
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:44,120
It's a magical thing from the cupid.

448
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,660
If you put it on the woman you like,

449
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:48,040
you'll be able to marry her.

450
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:54,420
The daughter of the royal physician,
Han Yun Xi,

451
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:56,170
marries the Qin Emperor,

452
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:59,160
Long Fei Ye,
under unexpected circumstances.

453
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:02,950
After their marriage,
they get to know each other better...

454
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:04,980
and love each other even more deeply.

455
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:08,890
They rule together and
bring peace to the country.

456
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:11,970
In the end,

457
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:15,230
Han Yun Xi uses the blood of her heart...

458
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:18,310
to save her lover.

459
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,680
And we don't know what happened to her.

460
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:25,480
Is Han Yun Xi still alive or is she dead?

461
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:28,280
Somebody said that...

462
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:31,070
they once saw them at Dayu.

463
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:36,300
And they live
a happily ever after life together.

464
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:40,920
-Great!
-Great!

465
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:44,180
Do you envy this kind of love?

466
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,330
This is my only wish...

467
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,670
to find the one I love.

468
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,850
It's quite late already.

469
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:53,870
I have to go back.

470
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,970
Or else, my sister will worry about me.

471
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:57,540
Let's watch this again tomorrow.

472
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:58,640
Sure!

473
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:02,700
I'll send someone to pick you up from
the back door of the temple tomorrow.

474
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:03,710
Then,

475
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,170
I'll wait for you behind the wall...

476
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:06,900
at six in the evening tomorrow.

477
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:27,120
Little cat.

478
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,420
Who is it?

479
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:37,200
Ms Fu.

480
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:40,680
I'm still worried about that little cat.

481
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,570
So, I came here to find it.

482
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:11,190
Finally, I caught you.

483
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,620
Xiao Bai.

484
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,240
Don't run away again.

485
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,440
How do you know that its name is Xiao Bai?

486
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:17,980
I just simply call it that.

487
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:20,540
Xiao Bai is better than Xiao Hei, right?

488
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:26,520
Alright. I won't make fun of you again.

489
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:28,940
Come, Xiao Bai.

490
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,170
Xiao Bai.

491
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:31,840
Is your name Xiao Bai?

492
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,560
Its name is Xiao Bai too.

493
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,700
What a coincidence.

494
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:37,780
-Venerable sir.
-Hello.

495
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:39,710
Finally, you found the little cat.

496
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:43,370
Thank you.

497
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:47,860
Sir, keep an eye on it.
Don't let it run away again.

498
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:48,960
Of course.

499

500
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:07,930
Hello.

501
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:09,280
Talk about this today.

502
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:17,220
This will cost you more.

503
00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:23,090
Sure. Just enjoy the show.

504
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:24,340
Thank you.

00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:55,350
The monks from Yun Luo Temple said that...

508
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:57,750
the two ladies left
in a hurry this morning.

509
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,180
Do they know why?

510
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:00,950
They don't know about it.

511
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,020
Sir.

512
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,510
I'm sorry.

513
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:20,360
I never thought that I'd actually
believe in the red thread from cupid.

514
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,560
So ridiculous.

515
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,780
She couldn't reflect at Yun Luo Temple?

516
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:34,150
Why does she have to go to Hong Village?

517
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:38,400
Ju Shui Pavilion couldn't change her.

518
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,530
Yun Luo Temple can't change her too?

519
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:44,830
Su Niang.

520
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,110
How could you allow Rong'er...

521
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:49,650
to go to Hong Village
together with Guan Ge?

522
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:53,090
Dear.

523
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,490
Miao Ling is with her. She will be fine.

524
00:32:56,570 --> 00:32:57,750
Don't worry.

525
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,100
That's right, father.

526
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:01,240
With Guan Ge there,

527
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:03,680
Rong'er will act like an older sister.

528
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:04,850
Don't worry.

529
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,850
-That's right.

[Ju Shui Pavilion]

531
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,360
You are indeed amazing, Master.

532
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:39,460
You made no sound.

533
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:43,420
There aren't many guards here.

534
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,340
I think you are going easy on me.

535
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,680
Since you are willing to come here,

536
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:54,110
of course I have to welcome you.

537
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:58,470
The famous Farmer Ju Shui
wants to meet me.

538
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,010
Can I say no?

539
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:03,400
I have the thing that you want.

540
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:07,100
But this thing is something extraordinary.

541
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:12,370
Before this, you took
two Twelve Folding Fans of Shu from me.

542
00:34:12,370 --> 00:34:14,699
You must have given them
to Mr Dong, right?

543
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:19,510
Are you threatening me?

544
00:34:21,219 --> 00:34:23,060
What are you talking about?

545
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:28,210
I just want to show you
my capability and sincerity.

546
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:46,380
You are a fine-looking man.

547
00:34:46,909 --> 00:34:50,080
No wonder my subordinate
fell in love with you.

548
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:52,060
No need to put on an act.

549
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:54,179
If Ruyi Pavilion wants it,

550
00:34:54,699 --> 00:34:58,480
you'll become even more powerful
by knowing that...

551
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,780
Farmer Ju Shui is actually Duke An.

552
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:04,330
You are indeed very sincere.

553
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:07,850
Ruyi Pavilion is not that petty.

554
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:10,550
Wait for my good news.

555
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:12,760
There's another thing.

What is it?

557
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:18,300
Recently, I've fallen in love with a lady.

558
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:21,270
Do you know who she is?

559
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:26,920
Ruyi Pavilion is not
a match-making agency.

560
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:30,160
-If you want to find a girl...
-Her name is Fu Rong.

561
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:34,520
What is it?

562
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:36,670
You know this person?

563
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:41,250
I've never heard of her.

Yes.

568
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,330
Mr Dong has been
acting strangely recently.

569
00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:00,830
He often goes to Hong Village.

570
00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:02,940
But he doesn't have any lands...

571
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:04,440
or friends over there.

572
00:36:05,890 --> 00:36:07,160
We'll go to Hong Village tomorrow.

573
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,440
We'll split up...

574
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:11,080
and gather at Yue Lai Inn at night.

Black ginseng?

577
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:41,720
Why did you want to come to
Hong Village suddenly?

578
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:43,980
You don't go out and you don't rest well.

579
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:46,670
You just ask us to prepare
all kinds of medicinal ingredients.

580
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:48,080
The kitchen is already full.

581
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,530
Are you studying medicine?

582
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:50,770
You don't understand.

583
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:53,490
I'm getting ready for rainy days.

584
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:56,310
You didn't sleep well
last night too, right?

585
00:36:56,490 --> 00:36:58,600
You don't look too well.

586
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,110
Enough. Such a bad luck.

587
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,390
I dream every day after I reach here.

588

So annoying.

I'm very bored and I want to go out?

598
00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:29,260
You can't go out now because of
some special circumstances.

599

Don't lie to me.

Alright then.

00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:47,960
You can go out for a while.

with too many people.

My brother is still too young.

625

Don't think of him as someone
with an ulterior motive.

626

He can change his face so fast.

But...

630
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:46,800
you are a busy person.

631
00:39:46,890 --> 00:39:49,890
Where did you find the time
to come to this rural place?

632
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:52,070
This is such a coincidence.

633

There is no such thing as coincidence.

634
00:39:56,350 --> 00:39:57,670
I just never thought that...

635
00:39:57,670 --> 00:40:00,970
you'll personally investigate such
an unimportant person like me.

636

Such an honour.

637
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:04,550
I haven't even interrogated you.

638
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:06,240
But you already accused me.

639
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:07,660
Fine.

640
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:09,570
Deny it all you want.

641
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:11,720
Just think of it as a coincidence.

642
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,180
Please wait!

643
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,380
What is it?

644
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:21,740
Since you suspect me,

645
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,850
you should come back with me...

646
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:26,050
to check if I'm really
on a vacation here or not.

647
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:27,760
I came here all of a sudden...

648
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:29,700
and I don't have a place to stay yet.

649
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,700
Since you've invited me sincerely.

650
00:40:31,810 --> 00:40:34,800
I'll take you up on your offer then.

651
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:43,600
I'll bring you out again tomorrow, okay?

652
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,240

654
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:50,820
Let him rest.

655
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:52,800
But not too long.

656
00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:54,070
Or else, he can't sleep at night.

657
00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:54,950
Okay.

658
00:40:55,130 --> 00:40:56,490
Do you know that...

659
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:59,090
we went to see the geese just now.

660
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:01,250
But I don't know why those geese...

661
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:02,700
kept on chasing us.

662
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:04,090
Are you satisfied now?

663
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:06,740
You can always tip them off.

664
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:11,320
Tip them off? Don't simply accuse me.

665
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:15,010
You are afraid that I'll tip them off?

666
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:16,620
I'll follow you around then.

667
00:41:18,090 --> 00:41:19,160
Sure.

668
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:26,350
Are you feeling guilty?
