The warden said

10
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:32,110
His Majesty had decreed that

no one is allowed to visit
the Concubine Rong.

12

I've spent some money

to have the clothes you handed me
sent to her.

I guess there'll be some news.

You're looking distracted today, brother.

20

Although

21
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:25,190
I don't like Duke Su's concubine,

22
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:27,390
but I can see

23
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,670
she's not so foolish

24
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:33,400
to set her eyes on the palace's things.

25
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,880
Besides, the crime was sloppily done.

26
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:39,829
If someone plans to set Duke Su's
concubine up

27
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:41,910
on purpose,

28
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:45,400
what could their motives be?

29
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:47,430
Jin'er has been investigating

30
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:50,800
the corrupted officials after he
returned to the palace.

31
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:53,760
Someone may have a grudge against him.

32
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:55,579
You mean

33
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:58,350
they had it in for Duke Su?

34
00:03:58,430 --> 00:03:59,800
Unfortunately,

35
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:03,550
Fu Rong is only the daughter of the
Hengjing County Magistrate.

36
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:05,150
She isn't powerful.

37
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:08,660
That's why they used her to get to Jin'er

38
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:11,270
I understand your dilemma.

39
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:13,950
If she's from a noble family,

40
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:16,320
even if they wanted to harm her,

41
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:19,399
they would have to think twice.

42
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:24,560
It's just that Duke Su is affectionate
to his concubine.

43
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:28,390
And your effort to find him a wife

44
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:30,280
has been fruitless.

45
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:33,430
It's been a huge headache for me.

46
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:36,310
As long as Fu Rong and
Jin'er are together,

47
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:38,960
Jin'er will never want to find a wife

48
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:41,960
It seems

49
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,750
she's becoming Jin'er's weakness.

50
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,350
In my opinion,

51
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:52,720
why don't you take the opportunity

52
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:55,560
and let them both, divorce?

53
00:04:58,470 --> 00:04:59,760
Do you think

54
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:02,350
Jin'er will agree to a divorce?

55
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:04,430
I think

56
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,830
Duke Su will never agree.

57
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:10,760
But you can try his concubine.

58
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:14,400

I heard Rong'er pocketed the
materials from the palace.

70

of embezzlement

76

Attendant Chen,

173
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:31,190
Duke Su is here.

174
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:41,480
Greetings, Your Highness.

175
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:46,030
What brings you here today, Your Highness?

176
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:49,600
I hear you're the one

177
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:52,430
who accused Fu Rong of embezzlement.

178
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:54,760
You even had written proof.

179
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:57,120
Your Highness,

180
00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:59,670
I was only telling the truth.

181
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:04,600
Telling the truth?

182
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:07,470
That's strange.

183
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,860
Fu Rong insisted that

184
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:13,810
the figures on the handover document
were dubious.

185
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:20,840
Shouldn't you ask her about it instead?

186
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:26,190
Do you have the handover document?

187
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:28,150
Your Highness,

188
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:29,660
the evidence

189
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:33,080
has been handed over to the
Criminal Investigation Bureau.

190
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:41,200
Fu Rong is my concubine.

191
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:45,720
If I find out anyone had lied,

192
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,630
I won't forgive him or her.

193
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:51,760
I wouldn't dare.

194
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:13,830
Thanks to my quick thinking

195
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:15,270
and tight lips,

196
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:17,590
nothing was revealed.

197
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:19,350
Your Highness,

198
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:20,820
aren't I

199
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,950
loyal to you?

200
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:25,760
But why did Duke Su

201
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:28,710
suspect you out of the blue?

202
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:32,230
About that, I have no idea.

203
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,580
By his tone of voice,

204
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:36,470
he was set on interrogating me.

205
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:38,020
But nothing came of it,

206
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:39,640
so he left disappointed.

207
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:44,360
Attendant Chen,

208
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:46,440
you've handled it well.

209
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:50,150
If Duke Su comes to see you again...

210
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:51,950
Don't worry, Your Highness.

211
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:53,630
Even if he comes a thousand times,

212
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:55,360
he wouldn't get a word out of me.

213
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,400
When it comes to your loyalty,

214
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:02,670
I have no doubts.

215
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,280
Huan Yun.

216
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:08,160
Take Attendant Chen downstairs.

217
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:12,310
Give her my Linglong Jade Pendant

218
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:15,020
-as a reward.
-Yes.

219
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:16,230
Thank you, Your Highness.

220
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,630
Long live Your Highness.

221
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:31,120
Duke Su is something else.

222
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:34,410
To think he actually came
to Attendant Chen.

223
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,470
I don't think

224
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:39,330
she'd dare say anything foolish.

225
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:42,960
Zhu'er.

226
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:45,200
What do you think?

227
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:52,390
Even so,

228
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:54,860
Duke Su has taken the investigation

229
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,320
to Attendant Chen.

230
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,550
She's a risk.

231
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:04,600
You have a point.

232
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:09,150
It's better to be safe than sorry.

233
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:13,720
After all, only the dead
can keep a secret.

234
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:19,960
A few days from now,

235
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:22,640
I will send Attendant Chen out

236
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:25,280
on an errand.

237
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:28,480
Once she's out of the palace...

238
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:31,000
Mao'er,

239
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:33,960
the rest of it...

240
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:35,600
You can count on me.

241
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:55,790
Don't kill me.

242
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,060
Don't kill me.

243
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:58,950
Please, I beg you. Don't kill me.

244
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:38,210
Thank god you came in the nick of time.

245
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:40,110
Or I'd have been...

246
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:45,880
You're just a little ornament attendant.

247
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:48,470
Who could've wanted you dead?

248
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:54,160
This address was written by Consort Duan.

249
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:59,270
Why would she do this?

250
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:01,500
I was so devoted to her.

251
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:02,910
At this point,

252
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:05,079
if you don't tell us the truth,

253
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,040
not even His Highness can protect you.

254
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:10,450
Your Highness,

255
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:13,640
my life is in your hands.

256
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:16,230
I'll tell you everything I know.

257
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:19,560
The handover document.

258
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:22,990
What did you people do to it?

259
00:17:25,099 --> 00:17:27,869
As soon as the materials had left
the palace's storehouse,

260
00:17:27,869 --> 00:17:30,480
Consort Duan seized it.

261
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:31,870
Afterward,

262
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:34,790
I used an ink made of citrus

263
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:37,910
and amended the figures
on both documents,

264
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:41,090
making it impossible for Concubine Rong

265
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,640
to detect the discrepancy.

266
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:45,240
Once she had verified it,

267
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:48,260
I brought the documents

268
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:49,400
back to the palace

269
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:51,030
heated them over a flame,

270
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:53,430
causing the citrus ink to fade.

271
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:58,790
Then, I wrote the correct figures
back on the document.

272
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:00,450
What about Ruyi Pavilion?

273
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:03,530
Since it was a public case,

274
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:06,030
and it involved your concubine,

275
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:09,320
the Emperor would certainly send his men

276
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:12,850
to Ruyi Pavilion to retrieve the document
as evidence.

277
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:18,120
That was when Duke Cheng's lackeys
at the bureau made the switch.

278
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:24,110
And where are the materials

279
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,190
that were seized?

280
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:31,030
I don't know the exact location.

281
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:33,960
But I vaguely heard that the materials

282
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:36,280
was transported by Duke Cheng

283
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:38,310
to Weiyang City in Linzhou.

284
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:42,390
And?

285
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:47,340
Your Highness, I've told you
everything I know.

286
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:48,750
There's nothing more.

287
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:55,990
Your Highness, what do
you intend to do with me?

288
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:15,390
Attendant Chen, you stay here for now.

289
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:19,030
We've posted our men outside
to protect you.

290
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:20,990
You're an important witness.

291
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:24,190
Remember, don't ever go out by yourself.

292
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:26,760
Thank you, Mr Ge.

293
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,750
Protect me?

294
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:49,120
I'm guilty of perjury.

295
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:53,790
On top of that, Consort Duan and
Duke Cheng are waiting to kill me.

296
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,190
How can a mere duke

297
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:59,630
protect me?

298
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:19,820
Good thing

299
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:21,440
you acted quickly, Mao'er.

300
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:24,380
Or the consequences would be unimaginable.

301
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:25,460
Nevertheless,

302
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:28,430
Attendant Chen had crossed paths
with Xu Jin.

303
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:34,070
Xu Jin must know a thing or two
about our secret.

304
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:38,160
Even if Attendant Chen
told Duke Su the truth,

305
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:40,070
she's dead now.

306
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:42,560
Duke Su has no proof.

307
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:44,240
He can't close the case.

308
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:46,900
As long as Duke Cheng

309
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:49,230
takes good care of the materials,

310
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:51,950
no matter how capable Duke Su is,

311
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:54,560
he can't do anything.

312
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:57,090
Mao'er.

313
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:59,820
Have you kept the palace's
materials well hidden?

314
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:00,990
Rest assured, Mother.

315
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:03,500
I have stashed them away properly.

316
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:05,240
Nothing will go wrong.

317
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:09,060
I have yet to settle the score Xu Jin

318
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,030
for what happened to Uncle.

319
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:12,550
Well, then.

320
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:16,150
I'll square it with him once and for all.

321
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:30,390
Your Highness, this body
was found this morning.

322
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:32,790
Take a look. Is this the
one you're looking for?

323
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:34,990
Attendant Chen is dead now.

324
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:37,770
We have no one to
corroborate the documents.

325
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:39,820
The only way

326
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:41,880
is to find the palace's materials.

327
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:43,670
Mr Ge.

328
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:45,750
Stay back at the capital.

329
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,950
-Report anything important to me.
-You got it.

330
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:50,480
Xu Jia, come to Weiyang City with me.

331
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:51,950
Yes, Your Highness.

332
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:55,300
[From the Criminal Investigation Bureau]

333
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:09,920
Attendant Chen is dead?

334
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:14,830
Now it's even harder to acquit

335
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:17,080
Concubine Rong of her crime.

336
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:21,440
Maybe it's for the best.

337
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:24,870
Are you thinking

338
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:26,590
of using this as an excuse

339
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:29,580
to break Duke Su and Concubine Rong apart?

340
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:30,910
Duke Su.

341
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:35,120
If only he could have a capable wife like Wan’er,

342
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:37,000
then it’d be good.

343
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:42,030
Where is Duke Su now?

344
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:45,310
I heard he went to Weiyang City.

345
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:47,950
Weiyang City?

346
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:51,000
Isn't that Yuan Bin's jurisdiction?

347
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:52,470
Precisely.

348
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:55,720
Wang Xin.

349
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:57,100
At your service.

350
00:22:57,190 --> 00:23:00,120
If Wan'er asks you about
Duke Su's whereabouts,

351
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:03,800
feel free to point her
in the right direction.

352
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,400
You mean...

353
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:11,030
I understand.

354
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:18,510
Come. Let's take a trip to the
Criminal Investigation Bureau.

355
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:19,570
Yes.

356
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:23,420
[Criminal Investigation Bureau]

357
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:29,040
[The stamp on the document
did belong to Ruyi Pavilion.]

358
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:32,950
[There were no signs that its contents
have been amended.]

359
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:34,120
[What if]

360
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:36,230
[it was the ink?]

361
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:39,990
[But how do I go about investigating it?]

362
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:52,920
Greetings, Your Majesty.

363
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:55,680
Get up.

364
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:06,390
Duke Su came to see me two days ago.

365
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:09,470
He asked for a grace period of seven days

366
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:11,990
to prove your innocence.

367
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:13,870
If he fails,

368
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:17,120
he'll remain by the late Empress' grave,

369
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:19,040
never to return to the capital.

370
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:24,850
His Highness was probably confused.

371
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:28,250
One does not break his word
with the Emperor.

372
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:30,220
Even so,

373
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,430
God is merciful.

374
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:33,310
I'm sure allowances can be made.

375
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:35,960
Although I'm innocent,

376
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:40,480
seven days is too close for comfort.

377
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:43,670
Too close?

378
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:47,960
Did you know

379
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:50,630
Attendant Chen died?

380
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:54,390
It's almost impossible
to prove your innocence now.

381
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:57,980
If no proof is found

382
00:24:58,070 --> 00:24:59,430
after seven days,

383
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:03,040
I'd have no choice but to
send him to his mother's grave.

384
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,200
Please no, Your Majesty.

385
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:11,510
Fu Rong.

386
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:13,750
Did you ever think

387
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:18,080
why misfortune kept following you?

388
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:20,960
Is it your misfortune?

389
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:23,040
Or Jin'er's?

390
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:26,660
Jin'er had nothing in the capital.

391
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:28,340
Yet he rolled up his sleeves

392
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:31,840
to help me root out corruption
in the court.

393
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:33,540
But because of you,

394
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:35,560
he acted foolishly time and again.

395
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:38,910
His enemies

396
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:41,470
used this to their advantage.

397
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:47,750
Eventually,

398
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:51,150
you will be his demise.

399
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:56,280
I understand.

400
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:58,830
Everything you're doing

401
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:00,490
is in His Highness' interest.

402
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:03,150
I suppose you're here today

403
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:05,850
because you have figured out a solution.

404
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:07,670
Please enlighten me.

405
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:14,960
You may not be able to save Ruyi Pavilion.

406
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:18,480
But you can save Duke Su.

407
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:24,640
It's very simple.

408
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:28,430
Just divorce him.

409
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:41,070
You have the night to think about it.

Duke Su risked his life for her.

509
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:38,190
To think she'd divorce him

510
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:39,590
to save her own skin.

511

Everyone's talking about it.

You can't simply believe in gossip.

No, I must get hear it straight
from Eunuch Wang.

517

Eunuch Wang!

518

-Princess.
-Eunuch Wang.

519

Tell me,

520
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:11,640
did Fu Rong really sign
the divorce letter?

521
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:13,430
That's right.

522
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:15,420
Stupid Fu Rong.

523
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:17,390
Duke Su must've been blind...

524

What seems to be the problem?

525
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:21,620
Now that she's free,

526
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:24,070
what if she tries to gain
Duke Su's sympathy?

527
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:25,710
What if Duke Su runs away with her

528
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:27,430
in the heat of the moment?

529
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:30,710
Princess, listen to you.

530
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:33,670
Duke Su is miles away in Weiyang City.

531
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:36,470
How could he run away with Ms Fu?

532
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:40,800
Thanks, Eunuch Wang.

533
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:42,220
That's all.

00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:43,360
You may go now.

Have a good day, Princess.

536
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:48,680
Since Fu Rong doesn't cherish her man,

537
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:50,410
then I'll move in for the kill.

Aren't I smart?

540
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:57,790
I found out about Duke Su's

541
00:36:57,790 --> 00:36:59,390

I ran into the Princess of Xihe just now.

She has found out

about Duke Su and
Concubine Rong's divorce.

549
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:33,550
What was her reaction?

550
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:35,700
I clued her in on the fact

551
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:37,390
that Duke Su is in Weiyang City.

552
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:38,790
Judging by her expression,

553
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:42,470
I'd say she's well on her way
to find him by now.

554
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:46,430

Ms Fu is off to Weiyang City.

Apparently, Xiao Qi and Xiao Ba
paid a visit to Ruyi Pavilion.
