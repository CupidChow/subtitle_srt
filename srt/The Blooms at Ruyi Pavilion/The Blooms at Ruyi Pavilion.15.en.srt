Where's the carriage?

5
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,259
Miss, I'm really sorry

6
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:50,870
After we entered Jichang City

7
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:52,270
it got really crowded

8
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:54,350
The carriage went into the crowd

9
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:56,560
There's... There's nothing I could do

10
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:59,240

Why would Master go to those places?

15
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:36,579
Silver

16
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:37,710
So much silver

17
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:39,000
We have silver

18
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:41,760
This is great

in a broad daylight

What's it to you?

24
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:54,260
Go away

25
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:58,320
Miss, they want me to
serve His Highness, Duke Su

26
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:02,930
Both of you are spouting nonsense

27
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:04,620
Duke Su is in Hengjing City

28
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:07,390
Why would he come to Jichang City
for such a shady business?

29
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:08,700
What do you know?

30
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:10,390
Duke Su arrived in Jichang City
this morning

31
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,790
Cut the nonsense.
Take her away now

32
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:13,000
-Let's go
-Wait

33
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:14,990
How about this?

34
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:15,980
Let her go

35
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,220
Take me instead

36
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,430
She refuses to go and keeps making a scene

37
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:21,300
What if she upsets Duke Su?

38
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:22,600
I will go

39
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,620
She's prettier than this performer

40
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:26,620

41
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:27,880
thank you

Hold on

What is your name?

45
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,100
My surname is Fu

46
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,560
As for the rest,
I will tell Duke Su myself

The ten li long pavilion
and Hong Fu Temple...

50
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:58,520
Have they been destroyed?

51
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:00,680
Yes

52
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:03,390
Since the Emperor sent his
order last year,

53
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:06,280
construction has been ongoing

54
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:08,150
Starting from the foot of Mount Tai,

55
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:10,660
winding all the way up the mountain road

56
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,950
The pavilion roof, beams and pillars
are made of white jade stone

57
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:15,750
We've hired numerous craftsmen

58
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:16,740
We even

59
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:17,790
received a tablet

60
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,990
from the capital written by the Emperor

61
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:21,700
Unfortunately,

62
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:24,880
in the middle of the construction...

63
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:29,720
Most parts of Hong Fu Temple
had been destroyed

64
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,000
They're now buried under the rocks

65
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:33,890
We're still cleaning the place up

66
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:35,909

67
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,240
Watch your step

68
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:07,000
How is it?

69
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:09,630
You're brilliant, Your Majesty

70
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,110
You knew Shang Kai Yang

71
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:13,420
would send many men
to Yu Hua Summer House

72
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:15,840
and his residence would be left unguarded

73
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:18,840
Hence, Xu Jia could steal the ledger
with ease

74
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,230
But

75
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:22,230
I've gone through it the entire afternoon

76
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:25,040
There's nothing wrong with this ledger

77
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:30,600
Maybe I'm careless

78
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:33,960
I couldn't find where the problem lies

79
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:37,230
When there's no problem,

80
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:38,880
that's the biggest problem

81
00:05:40,909 --> 00:05:43,200
I find it suspicious as well

82
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,680
We've searched other places

83
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:48,190
but we didn't find any other ledgers

84
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:54,530
Today, at Yu Hua Summer House,

85
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,480
I found sulphur powder

86
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:01,360
Sulphur powder again?

87
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:04,800
Shang Kai Yang

88
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:08,430
didn't hesitate to blow up the
mountain just to hide the truth

89
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:09,920
I believe

90
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:12,910
there must be some secret
in Yu Hua Summer House

91
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:14,400
Xu Jia,

92
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:17,550
send some men to keep an eye
on Shang Kai Yang's residence

93
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:19,480
If they're indeed hiding a ledger,

94
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:23,280
they will give the game away at some point

[Da Xiong Hall]

96
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:26,310
Since no one has seen Ms Rong and Ms Liu
in the temple

97
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:29,180
maybe they changed their mind halfway

98
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,600
and went somewhere else

99
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:33,159
Ms Liu wasn't in the carriage

100
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:35,380
and neither of them are here

101
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,880
Rong'er must have lied

102
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:41,440
Where on earth is she?

103
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:43,060
But when she left,

104
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:45,180
she was alone and wasn't kidnapped

105
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,909
She even told me
to convey a message to you

106
00:06:46,909 --> 00:06:48,980
I believe she has something to do

107

What should I do
if something really happened to her?

109

will have God's blessing

Since she's not in Yun Luo Temple,

let me send you back to the capital first

113

It's too far to walk back

131

00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:05,760
Stop

173
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:08,730
Master, what's wrong?

174
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:09,960
Nothing

175
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:11,720
Let's go

176
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:25,450
I guess many things were going on
in that room

177
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,430
You couldn't even put on your shoes

178
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:30,300
Forget it

179
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:32,990
I'll buy you new shoes
when we get to the capital

180
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:34,760
Don't worry about it

181
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:37,230
I came to inspect Jichang City

182
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:39,060
on the Emperor's orders

183
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,870
Little did I expect
that as soon as I arrived,

184
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:43,630
I would be told that there's a girl
in Duke Su's room

185
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:46,880
And even more unexpectedly,
that girl would be you

186
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:47,940
No, no

187
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,480
It's a misunderstanding

188
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:51,730
Someone must be using this opportunity

189
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:53,280
to trap Duke Su

190
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:56,160
Never mind

191
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:57,650
Of course I believe you

192
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:59,370
I won't misunderstand either

193
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,150
Thank you

194
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,720
Otherwise,
I wouldn't be able to explain...

195
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:14,120
Take a rest

196
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:39,990
Little Marquis

197
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:49,110
I know there are strict norms
between men and women

198
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:50,540
But I'm soaking wet now

199
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:52,060
What am I supposed to do?

200
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,260
Besides,

201
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:54,680
you're not looking at me

202
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:56,510
Does it make any difference whether

203
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:57,570
I'm clothed or not?

204
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:58,800
You...

205
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:04,280
You're shameless

206
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:12,660
Yes, I am a shameless man

207
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,599
It's not like you didn't know

208
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:17,599
I didn't really mean it

209
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:21,869
You don't want me to take off my clothes

210
00:17:21,869 --> 00:17:23,670
That's why you're flattering me

211
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:28,660
Did you think I'd fall for it?

212
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:39,120
I wasn't flattering you

213
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:43,040
You said it yourself

214
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:47,600
You said you've held countless women
in your arms

215
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:50,830
I didn't slander you without reason

216
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:52,310
Okay, okay

217
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:53,560
It is all my fault

218
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:58,400
That's not what I meant

219
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:12,140
Why are you sitting so far away?

220
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:13,580
If you catch a cold,

221
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:14,910
it'll be a pain in the neck

222
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:16,120
Sit closer

223
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,150
Don't worry

224
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:21,490
I won't even look at you

225
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:22,920
let alone disrespect you

226
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:53,440
Do you

227
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:56,600
come to Yun Luo Temple very often?

228
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:58,550
You saw it too

229
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:01,030
I go to Yun Luo Temple
almost every month to light up lamps

230
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:02,720
The place my late mother
frequented the most

231
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,010
was Yun Luo Temple

232
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,940
So that ever-shining lamp

233
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:08,270
was lit for Lady Xindu?

234
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:09,480
No

235
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:11,390
Don't call her Lady Xindu

236
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:13,240
That's a great humiliation

237
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:15,020
Marquis Xindu

238
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:18,030
doesn't deserve to be in the
same category as my mother

239
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:20,360
What exactly happened between you two?

240
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:23,000
Why is there such a big grudge?

241
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:34,470
My grandfather gave Feng Lai Yi

242
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:36,200
to my mother as a dowry

243
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:39,320
Xindu Residence looks glamorous
on the outside

244
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:42,840
but there are many things
to be taken care of

245
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,780
Not only did my mother have to feed us,

246
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:48,400
she also had to run and expand Feng Lai Yi

247
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:50,000
It was tiring

248
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:51,760
She was already weak

249
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:53,360
All that work

250
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:55,360
made her very sick

251
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:57,710
It was painful to watch,

252
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:59,570
so I offered to run errands for her

253
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:00,830
I went to other towns

254
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:02,960
to oversee Feng Lai Yi's expansion

255
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:05,060
Feng Lai Yi has branches

256
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:06,760
in other towns

257
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:08,760
So

258
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:10,830
it's you who's been running them

259
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:13,760
Yes

260
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:16,720
I was young

261
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:18,600
I didn't know any better

262
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:21,590
I just relied on my martial skills

263
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:24,480
to keep embezzlement in check

264
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:26,790
I remember my last trip

265
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:28,280
was to Huizhou

266
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:30,160
I spent a few days there

267
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:33,640
However, when I came back...

268
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:46,340
[In memory of Lady Xindu, Wu]

269
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,030
[Has that scoundrel returned?]

270
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:51,370
[Where is he?]

271
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:57,290
[You have the audacity to come back?]

272
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:59,520
[Kneel down and bow to your mother]

273
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:02,840
[How did mother die?]

274
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:04,760
[Tell me honestly]

275
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:05,990
[Where is Physician Xiao?]

276
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:08,080
[I want to know the cause of her death]

277
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:10,470
[You want to know the cause?]

278
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:11,920
[Give me the stick]

279
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:16,600
[I will kill you]

280
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:20,720
[She still talked about you
before she died]

281
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,410
[She still thought about you]

282
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:23,670
[Scoundrel]

283
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,240
[Scoundrel]

284
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,120
[I'll kill you]

285
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,340
[In memory of Lady Xindu, Wu]

286
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:38,940
[Young Master, take a seat]

287
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:41,760
[It's time to do the two things
I told you to do]

288
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,830
[Hand the title deed to Feng Lai Yi]

289
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,480
[and the seal over to me]

290
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,030
[Before your mother passed away,]

291
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:51,420
[she was most worried
about you and Feng Lai Yi,]

292
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:52,720
[do you know that?]

293
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:59,080
[You wanted to kill Mother]

294
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:01,970
[because you realised Feng Lai Yi]

295
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:03,700
[had been making so much money]

296
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:06,520
[But Mother wanted to run it herself]

297
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:09,200
[and refused to hand it over to you]

298
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:18,440
[You are really unfilial]

299
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:21,310
[How dare you point your sword
at your father?]

300
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:24,420
[You're a disloyal and unfilial son]

301
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:27,960
[Father]

302
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:32,720
[Are you worthy to be my father?]

303
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:35,630
[Back then, you promised mother]

304
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:37,310
[you wouldn't marry another woman]

305
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:38,870
[But you broke your promise]

306
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:40,490
[You knew Mother was ill]

307
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:43,350
[yet you took them in while I was away]

308
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:44,380
[Young Zhang Yan]

309
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:45,950
[Mother was so upset,
she threw up blood]

310
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:48,800
[And you have the cheek
to ask for the title deed?]

311
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:52,180
[If Mother really wanted you
to have Feng Lai Yi,]

312
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,430
[why didn't she tell you]

313
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:55,440
[that the title deed to Feng Lai Yi]

314
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:58,240
[was in this house all along?]

315
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:03,270
[Mother's corpse has barely cooled down,]

316
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:06,110
[yet you can't wait]

317
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:08,510
[to take them into our house]

318
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:11,340
[You even took in her relatives]

319
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:13,460
[and hired them as a housekeepers]

320
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:14,790
[Young Master]

321
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:16,200
[Young Master]

322
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:19,080
[If you're so resentful of me and Yan'er,]

323
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:20,950
[we will leave this instant]

324
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:22,990
[Shut up.]
[It's none of your business]

325
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:25,250
[Where are you going?]
[Sit down and eat]

326
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:29,560
[Now,]

327
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:32,560
[you've become a happy family]

328
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:35,240
[Someone has to leave]

329
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:38,360
[But it's not you]

330
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:42,440
[It's me and Mother]

331
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:01,000
[Zhang Yao Cheng...]

332
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:04,670
[Doting on his concubine
and killed his wife]

333
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:06,480
[A man without virtue]

334
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:13,200
[I hereby renounce our relationship
as father and son]

335

[Henceforth,]

336
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:19,770
[I shall adopt my mother's last name]

337

[and be named as Wu Bai Qi]

338
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:25,040
I'm sorry

339
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:29,160
For what?

340
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:34,600
For the things I said to you
in Xindu Residence

341
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:37,680
I was being self-righteous

342
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:40,120
I'm sorry

343
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:43,670
You didn't know any better

344
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:45,200
You shouldn't be sorry

345
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:46,760
Besides,

346
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:48,590
if it weren't for your scolding,

347
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:50,590
I wouldn't have tried out for Corporal

348
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:53,000
In fact, I should be thanking you

349
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:55,600
It has nothing to do with me

350
00:24:57,870 --> 00:24:59,290
In any case,

351
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:01,520
I need to apologise to you

352
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:06,660
In the future, just don't misunderstand me

353
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:08,550
I will be more than happy for that

354
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:15,800
But, between you and Marquis Xindu,

355
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:21,160
there's a huge gap in status

356
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:22,730
If

357
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:25,530
you continue to act
the way you did to him,

358
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:28,790
not only will you not have your revenge,

359
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:30,000
you will...

360
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:34,800
ruin your own reputation

361

Ms Fu

362
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,950
I used to call you old-fashioned
and dogmatic

363
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:45,860
You were more of a pain in the neck

364
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:47,400
than the geeks at school

365
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:50,080
But in truth,

366
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:51,580
I really think

367
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:54,470
you're completely different
from the other girls

369

Your Highness, I didn't expect
you'd be so hasty

370
00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:00,070
as to show up in the middle of the night

371
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:01,750
I'm worried about the soldiers

372
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:03,610
Of course I'd travel day and night

373
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:04,900
Let me ask you

374
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:07,580
Does Duke Su live here as well?

375
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:08,880
Yes

376
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:12,040
All right.
Take me to see him now

377
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:14,260
But it's already late

378
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:16,140
Just do as Her Highness said

379
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:17,260

The door is locked too

384
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:01,110
This is ridiculous

If anything happens to Duke Su,

386
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:05,080

Duke Su, are you all right?

391
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:01,920
Why are you here?

392
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:08,170
Why are you holding
a pair of embroidered shoes?

393
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:10,140
I just made these

394
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:11,550
I wanted to show them to you

395

Aren't they pretty?

Yes, it's me

398
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:31,920
What's the matter?

Duke Su, what are you looking for?

402
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:49,720
Duke Su

403
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:54,280
So it was sleeping smoke

404
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:55,520
Sleeping smoke?

405
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:58,680
After I entered the room,

406
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:00,960
someone filled it with sleeping smoke

407
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:03,400
to entrap me with a girl

408
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:06,480
But this girl...

409
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:08,820
What?

410
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:10,190

I will look into it myself

414
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:24,300
All right then

415
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:25,270
In that case...

416
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:26,380
Duke Su,

417
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:27,990
take care

418
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:47,380
Your Highness

Burn them

420
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:49,540
Yes

421
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:51,360
But these shoes are...

422
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:54,160
That girl must have left them behind

423
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:57,520
Somehow she managed to escape

424
00:30:57,990 --> 00:31:01,360
Duke Su doesn't seem
to know what exactly happened

425
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:04,220
Burn them quick

426
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:05,700
Don't talk about it again

427
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:07,560
Yes, I got it

428
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:22,100
As expected,

429
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:23,990
they were cautious enough

430
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:27,310
But there are still traces of the study
being ransacked

431
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:30,480
We've long prepared the ledger
just for them

432
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:34,670
They couldn't find anything
in Yu Hua Summer House and Hong Fu Temple

433
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:36,670
nor could they find any fault
with the ledger

434
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:40,320
I guess Duke Su is going back
empty-handed

435
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:41,510
However,

436
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:43,320
until they leave,

437
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:46,440
we mustn't let our guard down

438
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:51,260
As for the real ledger,

439
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:53,150
are you sure it's kept properly?

440
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:54,740
My lord, don't worry

441
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:57,030
They'd never guess it
even if they racked their brains

442
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:59,640
The real ledger is hidden
in the basement

443
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:05,020
My lord, calm down

444
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:06,550
To make it absolutely foolproof,

445
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:09,550
there's even a secret to the ledger itself

446
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:12,340
Once Duke Su leaves this place,

447
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:15,560
we will be able to rest properly

448
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:17,280
Good

449
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:25,540

452
00:34:32,659 --> 00:34:34,020
Block all the exits

far away at the imperial mausoleum?

00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:08,710
as a prince,

459
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:10,360
you have a royal duty

460
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:14,680
Instead, you disregard
the well-being of the people,

You've totally

464
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:23,590
ignored what Father said

465
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:27,340
I'm afraid you've offended the gods

466

Now,

467
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:30,340
I have no choice

but to take you back to the capital

469

Start searching already

481

Duke Cheng travelled all the way

00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:29,600
to Jichang City with you lackeys

483

to set Duke Su up?

485
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:34,550
To frame your brother,

486
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,170
you disregarded the Emperor's order

487
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:39,710
and left the imperial mausoleum
without permission

488
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:41,310
I'm going to tell the Emperor

489
00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:43,040
everything that I saw today

490

492
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:48,520
go ahead and search

If you manage to find anything,

494
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,940
I will make amends to Father

495
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:56,000
But if you can't find anything,

496
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:59,470
the fact that you left the imperial
mausoleum without permission

497
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:01,200
and slandered your brother...

498

I'm afraid I have to tell Father
all about it

Yes, tea...

505
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:25,520

509
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:41,680
What tea party?

510
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:43,580
Return to the capital now

511
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:52,190
Shameless

512
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:54,040
He's absolutely shameless

513
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:56,740
Duke Cheng is so far away,

514
00:37:56,830 --> 00:37:58,390
yet he still tried to frame you

515
00:37:58,390 --> 00:37:59,670
with such a dirty trick

516
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:02,140
But the strange thing is

517
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:04,280
when Shang Kai Yang met Duke Cheng,

518
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:06,240
he was more surprised than us

519
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:08,690
The person who conspired with Duke Cheng

520
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:10,740
probably wasn't Shang Kai Yang

521
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:13,840
My thinking exactly

522
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:17,010
If Shang Kai Yang
had conspired with Duke Cheng,

523
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:20,250
his plan might have just worked

524
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:22,200
Regarding Duke Cheng,

525
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:25,890
we'll deal with it slowly
after we return to the capital

526
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:27,450
The most crucial thing now

527
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,360
is to solve the landslide issue

528
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,400
We found their secret ledger

529
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:36,180
But

530
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:38,330
we didn't find anything wrong with it

531
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:42,590
It's your fault

532
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:44,780
If you hadn't let her go...

533
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:46,430
I was powerless against her

534
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,310
Your Highness,

535
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:49,920
if you want to punish me,

536
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,410
just do it

537
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,110
Your Highness

538
00:38:56,590 --> 00:38:58,940
I've checked the ledger carefully

539
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:01,640
The account is perfectly fine

540
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:06,120
[Ledger]

541
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:03,880
The only thing suspicious about it

542
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:06,970
is that the carpenters who built
Yu Hua Summer House

543
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:08,850
were replaced over and over again

544
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:11,220
The reason given was fair

545
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:13,430
Supposedly, due to the heavy
workload and tight deadline,

546
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:15,430
if the carpenters weren't changed
from time to time,

547
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:17,520
they would've died from overwork

548
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,920
The cost they spent on this

549
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:21,640
seems to be in order

550
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:34,560
The issue with this ledger

551
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:37,040
isn't the figures

552
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:41,080
It's the words

553
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:58,880
Candied hawthorn

554
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:06,560
We're finally home

555
00:40:06,830 --> 00:40:08,870
Go in and take a hot bath

556
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:10,160
Drink some ginger tea

557
00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:11,960
Don't catch a cold

558
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:13,400
You too

559
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:19,190
I wonder if Ms Rong has returned

560
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:21,750
[Fu Residence]

561
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:22,080
The house seems quiet

562
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:25,510
I'm sure she hasn't returned yet

563
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:28,160
Don't worry.
I'll send someone to find her

564
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:30,530
Thank you, Little Marquis

565
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,340
If you really want to thank me,

566
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:36,110
book-keep for me at Feng Lai Yi

567
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:38,540
Sure

568
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:41,670
Are you sure?

569
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:42,880
Didn't you say

570
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,070
you'd rather work at Ruyi Pavilion?

571
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:46,260
Don't worry

572
00:40:46,350 --> 00:40:47,750
I won't put you in a tough spot

573
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:49,150
You don't have to thank me

574
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:51,580
Just keep the secret for me

575
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:53,440
Don't tell anyone else

576
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:55,320
about what I told you last night

577
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:56,630
Don't worry

578
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:58,440
I won't tell a single soul

579
00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:02,680
Pinky swear

580
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:05,480
Little Marquis,

581
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:08,320
this is so...

582
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:29,320
What's the matter?

583
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:31,090
Am I being too childish again?

584
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:38,880
Go in

585
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:50,840
Ms Fu

586
00:41:59,830 --> 00:42:01,310
What is it?

587
00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:02,920
Nothing

588
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:05,840
I just wanted to call your name

589
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:08,780
All right

590
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:10,280
You should get going
