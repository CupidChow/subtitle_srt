Didn't your father tell you?

Here's the thing

21
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,780
One of his colleagues, Lord Yao,

will assume his duty
in the capital today

23

Lord Yao has done your
father a great deal of favours

24
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:13,970
So your father

25

is hosting a banquet today
for him and his family

26

Father didn't tell me anything

27
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:21,579
Besides, I don't really fit in

28

What's wrong?

Think about it

38
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:57,260
There is a banquet in our house

39
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:58,800
Father didn't tell Sister

40
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,000
He didn't stop her from
going to the art studio either

41
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,630
But he asked for me to attend the banquet

42

that Mr Dong would...

174
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,340
Don't you find it strange?

175
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:21,730
What's strange?

176
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,850
We heard a loud bang

177
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:25,730
before the rocks started to fall

178
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,700
But once we entered the canyon

179
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,230
the noise stopped

180
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,650
Could it be because he
was out of explosives?

181
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:35,480
Let's find a way out first

182
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,480
In case something happens again

183
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:53,700
Looks like this isn't the way out

184
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:59,040
It seems the only way out
is through the narrow entrance

185
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,400
But that entrance has been sealed

186
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,640
Either that

187
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,290
or we grow a pair of wings

188
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:27,970
Anyone there?

189
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:36,660
What...

190
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,220
What is that?

191
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:54,500
You know what this is?

192
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,360
It's a gold mine

193
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:05,870
This is just the surface of the rock

194
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:09,550
There must be a gold mine
inside Mount Meng

195
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:25,060
These Ruyi Dates are such a blessing

196
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:27,680
I would've starved
to death now if not for them

197
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:38,700
You're still thinking about the gold mine

198
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,490
Looks like my uncle was right

199
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,040
He said I would understand
once I come here

200
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:46,180
Who would've thought

201
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:48,870
a gold mine would exist
in such a desolate place

202
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,410
But since he found it,

203
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,530
why didn't he just excavate it openly?

204
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:54,780
Why would he do this?

205
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:58,040
This gold mine belongs to the country

206
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,980
No one is allowed excavate
it without permission

207
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:07,720
People will do anything for money

208
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,270
No wonder

209
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:13,480
It's hard to resist such a
huge gold mine indeed

210
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,900
Uncle isn't a greedy man

211
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:17,660
There must be a reason

212
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:19,900
that he did that

213
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,740
Forget it

214
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,970
Let's just think about

215
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:28,660
how to get out of here

216
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,350
Rong'er?

217
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,410
She didn't come here today

218
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:39,150
Young Lady Xuan,

219
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,450
how...

220
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,300
Where else could she have been to?

221
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:56,800
-Princess of Xihe
-Princess of Xihe

222
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,940
Save the formality

223
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:00,290
I'm here to see Duke Su

224
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,640
Are you out here to greet me?

225
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:06,960
Yes

226
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:10,130
But His Highness went out today

227
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:11,280
That's impossible

228
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,490
He invited me here

229
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:17,470
Is he's mad at me for taking

230
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,970
too much time to dress up

231
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,530
and coming late?

232
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:21,980
This is all your fault

233
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:25,240
But the messenger was late too

234
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:32,650
[Duke Su's Residence]

235
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,390
His Highness has some work to do today

236
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:29,930
He's not in the residence

237
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:31,620
Why would he invite you?

238
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,070
I don't care. I'm here now

239
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,050
I have to see him today

240
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,860
Even if he has some work to do,

241
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:40,400
he will still come home to rest, won't he?

242
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,150
Stop. I assure you he's not in

243
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,130
Very well

244
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,920
Could it be that Duke Su has been

245
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:49,590
tricked by some disreputable girl?

246
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:50,780
-No
-Your Highness,

247
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:52,150
stop talking nonsense

248
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:53,820
His Highness has gone missing

249
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,090
-Little Marquis
-He's gone missing?

250
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:56,420
What do you mean by that?

251
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,610
Where is Duke Su? What's going on?

252
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,280
What did you do with him?

253
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:01,910
Bring me to Duke Su now

254
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,060
Your Highness,

255
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:04,770
we have to keep it discreet

256
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,580
Please come with me

257
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:08,800
Little Marquis, keep looking

258
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:12,520
Where has Duke Su gone?

259
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:11,860
[Duke Su's Residence]

260
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,810
You people...

261
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,180
I have no doubts

262
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:20,870
about Uncle's character

263
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,630
But somehow,

264
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,660
I feel a little uneasy

265
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,830
Just like my master said,

266
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,660
I would be surrounded by enemies

267
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,020
once I return to the capital

268
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:39,360
Why did you come back then?

269
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,970
Aren't you afraid of death?

270
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:43,430
Death is nothing to fear

271
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,680
I'm more afraid of living dishonourably

272
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:50,460
Besides, didn't a certain
fortune teller tell me

273
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:52,090
that I would die young?

274
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:54,840
Don't slander me

275
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:56,510
I clearly said that
you would live a long life

276
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:58,640
When did I ever say you would die young?

277
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:03,440
When you were drunk

278
00:17:04,869 --> 00:17:06,460
What a strange man you are

279
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:08,000
You don't believe me when I'm sober

280
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,849
and chose to believe my drunk talk instead

281
00:17:09,849 --> 00:17:11,119
Why can't you

282
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:12,220
live honourably, and at the same time,

283
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:14,329
live a safe and long life?

284
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:16,030
You're too greedy

285
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:19,720
Greed drives us forward in life

286
00:17:20,849 --> 00:17:23,109
Allow me to enlighten you about your fate

287
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:25,050
Young Master,

288
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,970
you have a unique bone structure
and exceptional temperament

289
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:29,470
You were a deity from heaven

290
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:31,980
You're destined to do
great things in this life

291
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,380
As long as you're careful enough,

292
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:36,050
you'll stay safe and live long

293
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,130
You were right

294
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,630
about one thing though

295
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,760
I'm indeed a jinx

296
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:52,150
Did I say that when I was drunk?

297
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:55,450
When I was three years old,

298
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:59,150
I was adopted by the late empress

299
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:02,620
After that,

300
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:06,050
mother became seriously ill

301
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:08,250
She was bedridden

302
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:14,110
The Imperial Astronomer
said I was born to be a jinx

303
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:21,940
Father sent me to a temple
to copy sutras and pray

304
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:26,160
To pray for mother

305
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:28,030
But I knocked over a candle holder

306
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:29,680
by accident

307
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,250
All our efforts went down the drain

308
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:34,830
Father said,

309
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:37,200
since the jinx can't be removed,

310
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:41,150
maybe he could be used to fight
against the enemy in the frontier

311
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:47,520
Being separated from your
mother at the age of three

312
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,460
and being sent to the frontier

313
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:52,030
must've been rough on you

314
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,010
They were right

315
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:58,060
I was born to be a jinx

316
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:01,540
Look at mother

317
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:05,540
And look at you now

318
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:14,560
I shouldn't touch anyone

319
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,960
with my hands

320
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:26,330
Not long after I was born,
my father was promoted

321
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:28,090
Mother was blessed with a son later

322
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:30,490
Everyone around me
are safe and healthy

323
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,420
I even got myself a master

324
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:35,110
So, am I a lucky star or what?

325
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:42,470
I'll share my good fortune with you

326
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,140
Master, I got a lead

327
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:07,950
A man bought a carriage
from a family

328
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,270
in the east district

329
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,890
Ms Rong got on the
carriage and left the city

330
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:14,730
Who was that man?

331
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:16,350
That man dressed plainly

332
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,980
He should be a young man

333
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:19,630
That's all I got

334
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,110
But

335
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:22,730
we came up with a sketch
of the carriage

336
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:24,450
based on the family's description

337
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:26,800
We might get some new leads with this

338
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:31,200
Keep searching

339
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:35,200
Look around Mount Meng and
Mount Zhe that located in the suburbs

340
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,610

00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:16,360
Is everything going well
with the explosives?

680
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:19,990
Now that the gold mine in
Mount Meng has been discovered,

681
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:23,090
in order to dissociate
himself from the matter,

682
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:26,760
Duke Cheng has entrusted all
the explosives to Ruyi Pavilion

683
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:30,460
I can pass it over to you anytime

684
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:32,830
Very well

685
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,710
There is only one thing

686
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:43,880
I couldn't figure out

687
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:48,230
Why did Mr Dong die so suddenly?

688
00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:50,540
You're not the only one

689
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:52,360
I couldn't figure it out either

690
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,520
But

691
00:40:57,890 --> 00:40:59,410
it doesn't matter

692
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:02,360
It's just that Mr Dong
was a decent official

693
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:06,840
If I find out who's behind it,

694
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:09,350
I won't let him get away with it

695
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,770
As for those explosives,

696
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:14,850
may I know what
you are going to do with it?

697
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,560
I thought Ruyi Pavilion is only
interested in doing business

698
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,380
and not asking questions?

699
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:23,180
It's true that I made you that promise

700
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:26,560
But Ruyi Pavilion has
been keeping a low profile

701
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:29,370
I wouldn't want to stir up any trouble

702
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:33,330
Fine, I'll tell you this

703
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,700
Once I get what I want,

704
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:38,590
I'll let you know what I'm up to

705
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:41,740
So right now, you just need
keep your end of the bargain

706
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:43,760
And of course,

707
00:41:44,530 --> 00:41:47,940
I'll still need your help afterward

708
00:41:57,110 --> 00:41:59,440
You overestimated Liu Ru Yi, Young Master

709
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,710
She's just a woman after all

710
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,760
She made such a fuss

711
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,560
over the death of Dong Fang Li

712
00:42:05,650 --> 00:42:06,790
That's good

713
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:09,760
We'll use Ruyi Pavilion to our advantage

714
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:11,810
Based on what I know,

715
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:15,480
the entire Ruyi Pavilion
answers to a token

716
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:19,180
And Liu Ru Yi is the
current owner of that token

717
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:23,490
If we can get our hands on that token,

718
00:42:24,130 --> 00:42:27,270
we'll be able to take
control of Ruyi Pavilion

719
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:32,320
This is good news indeed
