Rong'er

5
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,860
-Rong'er
-Stop right there

6
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:50,110
This is an investigation

7
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,470
Those who are irrelevant, please leave

8
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:52,460
Investigation?

9
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:53,759
What investigation?

10
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,090
This girl murdered
Ruyi Pavilion's Ms Liu

11
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:58,340
She'll be punished according to the law

12
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:00,690
Ms Liu is dead?

13
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,220
You'd better back off

14
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:04,830
Rong'er

15
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:09,780
I asked you to back off,
didn't you hear me?

16
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:12,770
My lord,

17
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:14,970
may I know what's your rank
in the bureau?

18
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:16,690
My father is the magistrate
of Hengjing County

19
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:18,860
My family has always abided by the law

20
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:22,380
My sister Fu Rong is Ms Liu's pupil

21
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:24,320
She would never kill Ms Liu

22
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,500
So you're the daughter of Lord Fu

23
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:32,650
I'm Ding Peng, prosecutor of
the Criminal Investigation Bureau

24
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:35,560
Speaking of which, that unlucky
former colleague of mine

25
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,690
had almost become your husband

26
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:40,910
All right

27
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:43,170
You'd better go home now to inform Lord Fu

28
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:46,210
Perhaps he'll still get a chance
to see your sister one last time

29
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:47,860
One last time?

30
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,050
Lord Ding, are you
convicting my sister?

31
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:52,500
It's too hasty, don't you think?

32
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,750
Hasty?

33
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:56,790
So many eyes saw it

34
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:58,700
Liu Ru Yi was lying on the ground

35
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,310
with a dagger on her chest

36
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,100
While Fu Rong was standing
beside her with blood on her hands

37
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,640
Right in front of everyone's eyes

38
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,260
It's indisputable that she's the killer

39
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,370
Fine

40
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,320
According to the laws of Dayu,

41
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:12,610
eyewitness and physical
evidence are required

42
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:15,530
to convict a person, isn't that right?

43
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,930
Lord Ding,

44
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:21,340
which one of these two
requirements have been met?

45
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,800
Exactly

46
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,200
Greetings, Duke Su

47
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,790
Are you all right?

48
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:31,670
I heard there is a murder here

49
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:33,329
So I stopped by to take a look

50
00:03:33,329 --> 00:03:34,360
Your Highness,

51
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:37,160
I heard a high profile transaction
was taking place in Ruyi Pavilion

52
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,480
So I came here to investigate

53
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,750
But upon my arrival,

54
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,570
I found Ruyi Pavilion's Ms Liu
being murdered by Fu Rong

55
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:43,690
What?

56
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,630
This lady said

57
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,570
you have neither eyewitnesses

58
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:49,990
nor physical evidence

59
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:53,130
How do you determine
that she's the guilty one?

60
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:55,329
The Criminal Investigation Bureau

61
00:03:55,329 --> 00:03:57,390
has its own methods of investigation

62
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,260
It's better if you don't
interfere, Your Highness

63
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:02,460
You mean the Criminal Investigation Bureau

64
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:04,970
can disregard Dayu's laws during
an investigation?

65
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:06,530
That's not what I meant

66
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:09,500
It's just that when we arrived, there
wasn't anyone else in Ruyi Pavilion

67
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,000
Fu Rong was the only one at
the scene, with blood on her hands

68
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,310
Who could be the murderer if not her?

69
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,200
Since the case is still open,

70
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,500
she should be treated as a suspect

71
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,310
not a criminal

72
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:23,040
And the place for detention

73
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:25,820
shouldn't be the
Criminal Investigation Bureau's jail

74
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,160
but detention cell

75
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,440
You're right, Your Highness

76
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:31,220
Since she's not a criminal,

77
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,320
she shouldn't be restrained

78
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,180
Let go of her

79
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,640
Are you all right?

80
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:54,220
Your Highness,

81
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:56,730
please excuse me

82
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,150
Rong'er

83
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,820
Ms Fu

84
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,870
Ms Fu,

85
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,770
go home now to inform
Lord Fu and Lady Fu about this

86
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,970
Wu Bai Qi, send her home

87
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:16,040
Yes

88
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,170
Ms Fu

89
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,680
Thank you, Your Highness

90
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,670
Ms Fu,

91
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:37,340
don't worry

92
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:40,310
Duke Su will find out who
the real murderer is

93
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,960
and vindicate your sister

94
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:44,350
By the way, I discover
a new side of you

95
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:46,230
every time I see you

96
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,670
It was really brave of you
to stand up

97
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:50,210
to the bureau all by yourself

98
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:52,140
You even brought up the laws of Dayu

99
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:54,020
At such critical moment,

100
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,140
you were still able to...

101
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:59,450
Ms Fu

102
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,790
Ms Fu

103
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:06,990
Ms Fu,

104
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,360
are you all right?

105
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,560
You're shaking

106
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:21,070
You're having cold sweats on your palm

107
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:23,670
I'm fine

108
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,710
There's no need to put up
a tough front

109
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,530
Ms Fu,

110
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:32,890
please have faith in me and His Highness

111
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:34,420
Young Lady Rong will be fine

112
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:45,630
Will Rong'er

113
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:48,270
get through this?

114
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,690
I believe Young Lady Rong

115
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:51,300
would never kill Ms Liu

116
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:53,130
Nothing will happen to her

117
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:54,909
since she's innocent

118
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:57,900
You're right

119
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:01,290
Rong'er will be fine

120
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,270
She's innocent

121
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:06,960
Can you stand?

122
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:09,520
Why don't you let me carry you home?

123
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:04,760
Why isn't the coroner here yet?

124
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,090
Coroner Hu has just left

125
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,770
Maybe he'll come back later

126
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:14,330
Greetings, Duke Su. I'm Coroner Jiang

127
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,570
I'll perform the autopsy for this case

128
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,360
Mr Wen, you finally came out

129
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,809
Young Lady is in trouble

130
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:36,480
I'm not sure how to help her

131
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:37,750
Is your master here?

132
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,220
The bureau is accusing Nong Nong
of murdering Liu Ru Yi?

133
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,740
I have confirmed it

134
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:44,270
That's what the officers at the
Criminal Investigation Bureau said

135
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:46,690
Ms Fu has been put into a detention cell

136
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:48,300
for further investigation

137
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:49,590
Let's pay the bureau a visit

138
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:50,580
Yes

139
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:55,460
No

140
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,220
You track down the token

141
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,010
Liu Ru Yi is dead

142
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:01,420
Ruyi Pavilion is now left without a leader

143
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:02,830
Find the token as soon as possible

144
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:04,760
So that I can control Ruyi Pavilion

145
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:05,940
Yes

146
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:16,100
There, there

147
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,380
Stop kneeling

148
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:19,400
Tell me what happened

149
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:22,110
What do you mean
Fu Rong murdered Liu Ru Yi?

150
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:23,870
And Xu Jin stopped you?

151
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:25,210
It was most unexpected

152
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:27,740
We were looking to cause
some trouble at Ruyi Pavilion

153
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,970
But we didn't expect

154
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,510
to find Liu Ru Yi dead

155
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,180
and Fu Rong with her bloodied hands

156
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,370
Your Highness, tell me,

157
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:34,780
who else could the murderer be

158
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:35,940
if not her?

159
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,710
It has to be her

160
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:43,090
It's a pity that Duke Su
appeared out of nowhere

161
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:45,020
and made us put Fu Rong in detention

162
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:46,550
instead of the jail

163
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:50,150
Well, according to the law of Dayu,

164
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:51,720
it was the right thing to do

165
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,540
To hell with that!

166
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,730
A murderer should pay life for life

167
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:58,800
Fu Rong ought to be put on the death row,

168
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,410
not some detention cell

169
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,710
Zhong Rui

170
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:05,010
Yes, Your Highness

171
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,190
Go to Xindu Residence now

172
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:12,040
Have Lord Xindu announce to the public

173
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:15,060
how Duke Su is abusing his power
to protect a murderer

174
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:17,210
This is simply intolerable

175
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:22,820
We must let the people know
Duke Su's true colours

176
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:23,900
Yes

177
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:29,640
When the time comes,

178
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:31,730
one will get one's dues

179
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:36,660
You know what to do

180
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:40,000
I got it

181
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:53,580
[Criminal Investigation Bureau]

182
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,630
Greetings, Duke Su

183
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,600
Lord Fu

184
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:03,570
Ms Fu

185
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:06,360
How is my daughter now?

186
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:08,580
Lord Fu, because of your identity,

187
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:09,990
you need to avoid arousing suspicion

188
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:11,590
You're right, Your Highness

189
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:14,520
I was really worried

190
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:15,580
What about me?

191
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,670
Rong'er must be terrified right now

192
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:19,510
Can I visit Rong'er?

193
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,740
I know it's going to
be rough night for her

194
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,650
The bureau arrived at the scene so quickly

195
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:30,980
They said someone reported it

196
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,540
It seems really odd to me

197
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:35,550
Could someone be
trying to frame Rong'er?

198
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:38,410
We all believe that Fu Rong
is definitely not the murderer

199
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:40,610
I won't let her be wrongfully convicted

200
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,760
Thank you, Your Highness

201
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:44,930
Think nothing of it

202
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:46,930
I can't bear to see...

203
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,260
Duke Su,

204
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,590
have you found any clues?

205
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,260
Ms Fu, do you know

206
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:56,720
where the people who tended
Ruyi Pavilion

207
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,880
for Ms Liu live?

208
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,560
I know only of her most trusted worker,

209
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:05,180
named Gu Yuan

210
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:08,220
I don't know about the rest

211
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:10,670
It's getting late now

212
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:12,750
Lord Fu, Ms Fu,

213
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:14,180
go home first

214
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:15,550
I'll let you know immediately

215
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:17,110
if I hear anything about her

216
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,880
Thank you, Your Highness

217
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:22,120
I don't know how to thank you enough

218
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:23,970
I'm counting on you

219
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,630
to save my daughter, Your Highness

220
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:31,280
Rest assured

221
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:44,760
[Criminal Investigation Bureau]

222
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,070
What? Duke Su is that kind of man?

223
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,040
Exactly

224
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:51,600
I'm as shocked as you are

225
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:54,020
To think a highly decorated war hero

226
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:57,260
and leader of the ever-rising
Imperial Guards would...

227
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:00,030
Didn't he just place justice above family

228
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,960
by exposing Dong Fang Li the other day?

229
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,450
I've always thought
he's a man of integrity

230
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,170
Who knew?

231
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,950
I mean

232
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,180
how beautiful is

233
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:11,330
the second daughter of the Fu family?

234
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:15,120
Even Duke Su would obstruct
the bureau's investigation

235
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,180
just to protect her

236
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,410
If Young Lady Rong

237
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,360
gets off Scot-free due to Duke Su,

238
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:21,920
then what's the point of the law anymore?

239
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,400
Even a murderer can escape justice

240
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,640
Nothing we can do about it

241
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,040
She was born into the right family

242
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,120
Now Duke Su's...

243
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,230
What are you doing?

244
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,920
What nonsense are you talking about?

245
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,300
Duke Su never abused his power
to protect Young Lady Rong

246
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,690
Young Lady Rong didn't murder anyone

247
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:43,410
You all are talking behind Duke Su's back

248
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,490
Are you trying to get yourselves killed?

249
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:47,280
-No
-We heard it from other people

250
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,210
Who?

251
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,900
Everyone is talking about it

252
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,690
-How would we know?
-Yeah. It's the talk of the town

253
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:54,740
Is he working for Duke Su?

254
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:02,600
Waiter, keep the change

255
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,050
-for the bowls and chopsticks
-Who is this guy?

256
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:05,980
-Who is he?
-He gave me such a fright

257
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:09,130
Anything else to report, officials?

258
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:11,590
If not,

259
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:15,240
I do have one question for Duke Su

260
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,830
Yes, Father?

261
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:23,580
Rumours of you abusing
your power to protect a girl

262
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:25,230
is spreading like wildfire

263
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:27,830
The words even reached my ears

264
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:31,740
I happened to pass by
Ruyi Pavilion that day

265
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:35,920
I saw the Criminal Investigation Bureau

266
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:38,300
convicting a girl of murder on the spot

267
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:41,890
The Criminal Investigation Bureau
had just arrived at the crime scene

268
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:43,860
There wasn't any testimony or evidence

269
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:46,830
That's why I stopped them

270
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:49,450
Since it's a homicide case in the capital,

271
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:52,910
the Criminal Investigation Bureau
has full authority over it

272
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,840
You should stay out of it

273
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:58,010
to avoid any more scandal

274
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,870
Father,

275
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:04,260
but the bureau...

276
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:08,770
The Criminal Investigation Bureau's
action was improper

277
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,730
To ensure fairness,

278
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,890
I'll only investigate the case

279
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:15,710
and present the evidence

280
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,380
I won't interfere with the trial

281
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,300
The Criminal Investigation Bureau

282
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:23,310
certainly won't stop you
from submitting evidence

283
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,070
But you must be tactful

284
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:28,720
God forbid the people
flare up the rumours,

285
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:33,210
thinking that a member of the
royal family is protecting a criminal

286
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,990
Thank you, Father. I understand

287
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,230
Master

288
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:48,610

I'm sorry, Master

[I'll get you out of here]

299
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,750
Your Highness,

300
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,020
the men from the bureau
have left Ruyi Pavilion

301
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,680
We can inspect the scene again

302
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,390
Let's go

303
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:11,190
Lord Ding,

304
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,880
the trial will be held
three days from now,

305
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:15,220
right?

306
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:16,300
Yes

307
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,840
Keep in mind that

308
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,760
if Duke Su's men are here to visit,

309
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,030
there's no way we can stop them

310
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:41,200
So just let them in

311
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,830
As for the others,

312
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,960
do not let them in. Understood?

313
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:46,040
-Yes
-Yes

314
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:52,510
Greetings, Duke An

315
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,870
I'm here to visit a friend

316
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:02,080
Your friend is?

317
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:03,240
Fu Rong

318
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,250
What?

319
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,320
Duke Su can visit her

320
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:10,900
but I can't?

321
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:12,620
Of course not

322
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:14,980
This way, Your Highness

323
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:41,520
Nong Nong

324
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:45,150
Nong Nong

325
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,540
Little Follower,

326
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:50,630
what are you doing here?

327
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,680
I'm here to visit you of course

328
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:55,380
What?

329
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:56,710
You had a nightmare?

330
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,740
I had a dream just now

331
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:02,330
I dreamed of my master

332
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,020
And

333
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:11,100
I heard someone was consoling me
in the waking world. So it was you

334
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:16,320
Are those from you too?

335
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,790
Thank you

336
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:20,990
Don't worry about it

337
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,800
The environment here is so terrible

338
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,730
I'm concerned about you

339
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:26,880
Why don't I

340
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,340
talk to my brother?

341
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:30,490
I'm now a suspect

342
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:34,250
I don't want to implicate you,
even though you're not afraid of it

343
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:38,920
Rest assured

344
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:40,480
I'll get you out of here

345
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,530
Instead of getting out,

346
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,920
I'd rather know who killed master

347
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:50,460
I want to catch the real culprit

348
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:52,020
Little Follower,

349
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:54,710
can you look into this case for me?

350
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,880
Yes

351
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:59,050
Rest well. I'm here for you

352
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:06,480
Young Master

353
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:10,570
Wen Xing,

354
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:14,980
get someone to send food
and clothes here every day

355
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,190
Make sure Nong Nong's needs are met

356
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:19,590
Also, find out

357
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:21,980
how the trial will be held

358
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,680
Find a scapegoat as soon as possible

359
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,010
I don't want anything
to happen to Nong Nong

360
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:28,000
Yes

361
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:29,230
But Young Master,

362
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:30,570
does Ms Fu

363
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:33,260
know anything about
the token's whereabouts?

364
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:34,380
How dare you

365
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,880
How would Nong Nong know about it?

366
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:41,660
Liu Ru Yi had been
keeping her well protected

367
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,860
She doesn't know
Ruyi Pavilion's real business

368
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,950
How would she know about the token?

369
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:50,150
[Ruyi Pavilion]

370
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,740
Your Highness,

371
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:57,390
the evidence we've
collected isn't sufficient

372
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:02,470
Your Highness,

373
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,660
have you got anything?

374
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:04,710
Very wise, Your Highness

375
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:07,020
I've snooped around the bureau

376
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:08,760
When they went to Ruyi Pavilion,

377
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,570
they brought a coroner named Hu with them

378
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:11,830
His full name is Hu Ming

379
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:14,420
Hu Ming left in a hurry

380
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:16,790
after performing a preliminary autopsy

381
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:19,780
The report presently used by the bureau

382
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:22,230
was written by Coroner Jiang
who came later

383
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:23,960
If your prediction is correct,

384
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:26,630
the reports written by the two corners
might look similar

385
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:29,160
The only difference is
the time of the autopsy

386
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:30,830
When the bureau arrived,

387
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:33,640
Coroner Hu performed
the autopsy at 5:10 p.m.

388
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:35,860
While Coroner Jiang, who was late,

389
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:36,970
did the autopsy at 5:40 p.m.

390
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:38,290
A 15 minute difference

391
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:40,880
plus the time of death
indicated by Liu Ru Yi's body

392
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,130
should be able to
prove Fu Rong's innocence

393
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:44,200
Any information on

394
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,730
Coroner Hu's current whereabouts?

395
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:48,050
The bureau said

396
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,500
Hu Ming has gone home

397
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:50,650
to visit his family

398
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:53,420
His home is located in Hu Village,
nearby the capital

399
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:55,350
We have three days before the trial

400
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:57,070
We should be able to make it in time

401
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:58,060
Xu Jia,

402
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,380
bring a team with you

403
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:01,540
to bring Coroner Hu back

404
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,300
Yes

405
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,490
Wu Bai Qi,

406
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:09,390
any moves from the
Criminal Investigation Bureau?

407
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:10,670
You just came back from there

408
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:13,130
They won't dare to do
anything out in the open

409
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,240
Lord Ding

410
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,620
-Open the door
-Yes

411
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:49,720
Ms Fu,

412
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,960
once you sign this paper,

413
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:53,240
I guarantee

414
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:55,700
you'll have your freedom
and your life

415
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,330
Don't look at me like that

416
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:04,680
You know it

417
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:07,120
It's a high-profile case

418
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:08,970
We could be blamed

419
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:11,110
if we couldn't close the case, right?

420
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:15,460
Lord Ding, are you taking
me for a three-year-old?

421
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:17,570
The moment I sign the confession,

422
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:19,770
I'll be as good as dead

423
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,840
Suit yourself then

424
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,390
Criminal Fu Rong has attempted to escape

425
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:33,960
Drag her out and behead her

426
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,170
Yes

427
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,860
Ding Peng, you...

428
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,430
Breaking into the bureau
is a serious offence

429
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:46,140
Are you sure Ding Peng
is going to kill her tonight?

430
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,350
I'm sure of it

431
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:06,350
Ding Peng, you're trying
every possible way to kill me

432
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,140
With all eyes as my witnesses,

433
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:09,600
karma will take its course

434
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:11,330
Your action today

435
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,780
will become the very blade
that slays you in the future

436
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:15,070
It is time

437
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,190
Execute her

438
00:24:58,210 --> 00:24:59,340
Who are you?

439
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,360
This is an execution

440
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:19,330
Fu Rong has attempted to escape.
The proof is rock solid

441
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:21,440
Yet Your Highness, you
injured the executioner

442
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,430
What?

443
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:24,570
Are you trying to break her
out of here, Your Highness?

444
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:26,170
If I hadn't come,

445
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,510
wouldn't you be disappointed?

446
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,870
I don't understand
what you're talking about

447
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:34,530
All I know is, according to laws of Dayu,

448
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,590
an attempt to escape prison
warrants an immediate death sentence

449
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:40,100
Tonight, unless the Emperor
says otherwise,

450
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:41,970
Fu Rong must be executed

451
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,590
Your Highness,

452
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:53,260
this has nothing to do with you.
I don't want to implicate you

453
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:57,320
Prison break is a serious offence. Once
you do it, there is no turning back

454
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,250
I've made up my mind

455
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,840
I'll never regret it

456
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:15,890
Your Highness

457
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:24,930
Your Highness, are you
really going to break her out?

458
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:27,820
Don't blame me for
being disrespectful then

459
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:35,870
Do you have any
strength left in your hands?

460
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:47,260
Seize them

461
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:16,820
Your Highness, get on the horse

462
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,090
Right now, we can only
prove your innocence

463
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:38,320
if we find Coroner Hu

464
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:39,510
But what about you?

465
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,510
You shouldn't have come tonight

466
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:43,270
If I hadn't come...

467
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,540
But this is a prison break

468
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:49,520
What about my family?

469
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:52,120
Hold on tight

470
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,060
Duke Su broke into the prison?

471
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:03,780
Lord Liu,

472
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:05,100
are you certain?

473
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:06,770
Your Majesty,

474
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:09,670
it is all true

475
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:12,690
Last night, I received an urgent message

476
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:16,010
that Duke Su has taken away
the suspect, Fu Rong

477
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:17,920
When I arrived,

478
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:20,870
the Criminal Investigation Bureau
was in disarray

479
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:24,610
Fortunately, Duke Su's men were tactful

480
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:28,590
The jailers suffered only minor injuries

481
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:31,830
As the Chief Commander of Imperial Guards,

482
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:33,370
he broke into the prison at night,

483
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:35,100
and you call that tactful?

484
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:38,980
Is Fu Rong

485
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:40,780
that murderer

486
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:44,170
who made Duke Su the talk of the city?

487
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:46,190
About that...

488
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,540
Father,

489
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:50,110
she's the one

490
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:54,950
Dismiss Duke Su from all his duties

491
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:57,600
Lock down the city gate
and carry out a search

492
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:59,430
You must find Duke Su

493
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:01,280
and that female inmate

494
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,090
Yes

495
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,550
Check what's inside

496
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:08,870
You may go

497
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,260
Next one

498
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:14,830
Please hold on. We need to search

499
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:16,810
Let me take a look

500
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:18,880
Put your hands up

501
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,570
All right, you may go

502
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:25,830
Stop

503
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,210
What's inside the carriage?

504
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:32,130
Just some iced fruits. Please let us pass

505
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,220
-Search it

511

512

His Majesty summons
Consort Shu and Duke Huai

521
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:11,530
Greetings, Your Majesty

522
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:13,010
Greetings, Father

523
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:17,110
You're here to plead
for Duke Su, aren't you?

524
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:19,130
Father,

525
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:20,560
as a prince,

526
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:22,740
Xu Jin has made a horrible mistake

527
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:24,870
He's disgraced the royal family

528
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,920
No punishment would be

529
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:28,260
too much for him

530
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:29,600
Hao'er

531
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:32,590
And?

532
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,790
But

533
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:42,590
I hope you can forgive him
on account that he made the mistake

534
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:44,780
in a moment of weakness

535
00:31:50,170 --> 00:31:51,510
Your Majesty

536
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:54,640
I met Fu Rong once before

537
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,650
I saw how she risked everything

538
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:59,410
including her own life to
clear her master's name

539
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:01,940
How is it possible that
she would kill her now?

540
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:05,860
He could've said so during the trial

541
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:08,170
Why did he have to break into the prison?

542
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:09,970
Maybe he was compelled to do so

543
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:11,030
Maybe...

544
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:12,410
Compelled?

545
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:15,090
He could've told me if that's the case

546
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:18,170
Instead of disappearing without a trace

547
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,010
Father, please give your order

548
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:26,670
So that I can lead a team to
look for brother outside the capital

549
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:28,950
and bring him back

550
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:30,510
After that, it's up to you

551
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:32,820
to decide on his punishment, Father

552
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:35,420
No

553
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:39,180
If you fail to find him,

554
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:40,990
people would think

555
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,810
that you're protecting Duke Su

556
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:46,290
I know what to do

557
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,710
You may go now

558
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:54,690
Thank you, Your Majesty

559
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:57,310
Thank you for your mercy, Father

Forgive me

Hang in there

00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:22,630

569
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,440
we'll be able to find Coroner Hu

570
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:41,530
Your Highness, we're safe

571

What do you make

573
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:48,940
of this matter?

574
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,950
He's a reckless young man

575

Even a hero is powerless
against a beauty

576
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:57,850
From what I see,

577
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:00,560
it isn't so hard for you to understand

578
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:04,080
Are you mocking me?

But Duke Su...

584
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:37,389
Do you really think Duke Su
is still worthy of it?

585
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:40,710
Besides, I have dismissed
him from his duties

586
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,860
An Emperor doesn't go back
on his word

587
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,719
Please think it over, Brother

588
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,560
It's still too early to tell

589
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:52,630
Let's wait until Duke Su comes back

590
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:53,840
Wait?

591
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,900
How much longer do we have to wait?

592
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:57,840
Besides,

593
00:34:58,170 --> 00:34:59,300
the Imperial Guards

594
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:02,600
can't have a reckless Chief Commander

595
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:08,160
I used to think this son of mine was just

596
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:09,770
rebellious

597
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:11,880
I didn't know

598
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:14,260
he is actually a hopeless romantic

599
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:19,210
Thank you for

600
00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:21,430
putting your trust in me, Brother

601
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:24,710
But I haven't paid attention
to state affairs for years

602
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:26,580
Not to mention I'm just a scholar

603
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:28,120
I believe that

604
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:30,120
Duke Cheng, Duke Huai

605
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:33,530
or even Lord Xindu is more
suited for this position than me

606
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,830
On the contrary

607
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:44,950
The position of Chief Commander
is crucially important

608
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:48,530
Only one without distractions can hold it

609
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:51,610
If you don't know how to use

610
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,660
the blade on your hand wisely,

611
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:56,320
you risk harming yourself
and others with it

612
00:35:57,220 --> 00:36:00,760
I know you don't like
to dabble in politics

613
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:05,470
But for now, I can't think of anyone

614
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,960
better suited for the position than you

615
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:11,150
You have to help me

616
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:17,060
But the majority of the Imperial Guards
follow only Duke Su's command

617
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:18,660
I'm afraid they won't obey me

618
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:20,350
if I simply take over like this

619
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:22,230
That's not an issue

620
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,830
Duke Su has committed a misdeed

621
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:28,330
It's perfectly justifiable for
you to lead a team to catch him

We won't be able to bear
the responsibility

675
00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:56,620
You're right, my lord

676
00:38:57,750 --> 00:38:58,820
Mother,

677
00:38:59,810 --> 00:39:01,660
take Guan Ge inside and treat him

678
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:03,050
Yes

679
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:07,070
Let's go

680
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:10,260
What is all this about, my lord?

681
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:12,270
Don't ask

682
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,590
Young Lady Rong is not here anyway

683
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:15,080
No harm in letting us search

684
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:18,200
But why are you the
one leading the search?

685
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:20,470
I volunteered for it

686
00:39:27,090 --> 00:39:28,350
Here you are

687
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,460
Lord Ding

688
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:34,130
Corporal

689
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:35,740
What are you doing here?

690
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,240
I'm hunting down Duke Su and Fu Rong
on Duke An's orders

691
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,120
Naturally,

692
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,690
the first place to look
is the Fu Residence

693
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,140
But of course

694
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,100
Have you found anything?

695
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:47,450
We're still searching

696
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:51,010
That's odd

697
00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:54,460
You get along famously with Duke Su
and the Fus, Little Marquis

698
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:55,820
Why do you all suddenly

699
00:39:55,910 --> 00:39:57,870
act like strangers today?

700
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,530
As the saying goes, man struggles upwards,

701
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:01,980
water flows downwards

702
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:04,780
What a funny question, Lord Ding

703
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:08,470
Are you saying that I should
run away with Duke Su instead?

704
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:11,240
You have a point

705
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:13,800
Lord Fu,

706
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:16,830
what do you have to say

707
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,450
about the prison break?

708
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:19,910
Lord Ding,

709
00:40:20,370 --> 00:40:22,550
we know nothing about it

710
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:24,330
And we don't believe

711
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:26,280
Rong'er would break out of prison

712
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:27,940
Whether you know it or not,

713
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:31,370
we'll find out once we interrogate
you in the Criminal Investigation Bureau

714
00:40:31,370 --> 00:40:32,360
Take him away

715
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:34,120
Lord Ding

716
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,620
I'm an official of the imperial court

717
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:38,880
Don't you think

718
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:42,330
-this is uncalled for?
-But your daughter broke out of prison

719
00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:43,910
Do you think you're beyond questioning

720
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:45,770
just because you're an official?

721
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:46,930
Lord Fu,

722
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:49,350
how dare you flaunt your authority

723
00:40:55,130 --> 00:40:56,230
Lord Ding

724
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:59,030
what you're trying to do seems wrong

725
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:00,920
What?

726
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:03,800
Are you going to stop me
from questioning him too?

727
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,370
According to the law,

728
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:09,210
the family should be spared
if they're uninformed of the crime

729
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:10,750
We've been searching for hours,

730
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:13,000
yet there are no signs
of Fu Rong or Duke Su

731
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,890
It's certain that they're
not in Fu Residence

732
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:16,020
That being the case,

733
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:19,640
there is no reason to bring him
to the Criminal Investigation Bureau

734
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,490
So in your opinion,

735
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:24,040
where is the right place
to interrogate him?

736
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,480
Here

737
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:29,940
Isn't the environment here much better
than the bureau's?

738
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:36,650
Fine, we'll interrogate him here

739
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:41,180
However, since we won't be able
to find Duke Su and Fu Rong here,

740
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:43,530
you should stop wasting
your time, Little Marquis

741
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:46,150
Assemble a team now
to search outside the city

742
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:49,630
Little Marquis, here's a kind reminder

743
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:51,410
To avoid suspicion,

744
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:53,850
you'd better not go yourself

745
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:54,970
Of course

746
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:58,270
I have no intention of venturing
into the bug-infested wilderness

747
00:41:58,270 --> 00:41:59,520
Guo Rui

748
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:01,900
Yes

749
00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:04,190
Bring a team with you

750
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:06,670
Arrest Duke Su and Fu Rong
immediately when you see them

751
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:07,970
Do not show them mercy

752
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:11,880
Yes
