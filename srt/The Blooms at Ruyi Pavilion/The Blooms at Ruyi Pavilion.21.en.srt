It moved.

170
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,370
Come here.

171
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:00,000
I'll help you get down.

172
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:40,390
Your... Your hand.

173
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,850
Does it hurt?

174
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,890
It's all my fault.

175
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:44,800
I stabbed you on the wedding night.

176
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:47,750
If it weren't for me,

177
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,480
your injury wouldn't have gotten worse.

178
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:52,770
Look what I've done.

179
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,290
What are you doing here
so late at night?

180
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:33,890
Did you really take this place
as your own home?

181
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:41,600
Ms Fu.

182
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:47,460
May I have a drink

183
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:49,450
and a quick chat with you?

184
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:21,990
Do you...

185
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,240
have the result already?

186
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,270
You know what?

187
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,440
I once thought

188
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:43,450
I had someone in this world

189
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:45,840
I could count on.

190
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,430
But when personal interest was involved,

191
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:53,150
none of that mattered.

192
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:56,310
Duke Cheng and Marquis Xindu are close.

193
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,400
I don't blame him

194
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:00,690
because we seldom keep in touch anyway.

195
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:02,690
But I never thought...

196
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,830
I never thought that my aunt...

197
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:17,740
Forget it.

198
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:21,610
I was too naive.

199
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:24,030
Perhaps all along,

200
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,310
it was I who was wrong.

201
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,980
Stop drinking.

202
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:38,420
I won't ask if you don't want
to talk about it.

203
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:40,930
But don't run away from your problems.

204
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,950
When there's a problem,
you have to solve it, isn't that right?

205
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:47,530
If you keep drinking,

206
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:50,340
you'll only put off
dealing with the problem.

207
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:55,670
What should I do then?

208
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,600
You should think about it.

209
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:00,860
Figure out

210
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:03,500
if you're going to stand by
this kinship

211
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,000
or

212
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:07,810
quickly put an end to it
and sort everything out.

213
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,170
Ms Fu.

214
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:19,340
Do you know what you are to me right now?

215
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:22,020
What?

216
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:27,700
That.

217
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,270
All right.

218
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:38,220
Since you told me not to drink,
I'll stop then.

219
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,930
But

220
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,450
I bet you have never drunk alcohol.

221
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,340
Why don't you give it a try?

222
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,620
This is ridiculous. You're ridiculous.

223
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:09,480
You always make me do things
I've never done before.

224
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,570
Really?

225
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,690
Then thank you for obliging.

226
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:39,590
I hope in the future,

227
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:41,930
you'll still be willing

228
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,870
to try new things with me.

229
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,600
Miss.

230
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:02,250
Where are you?

231
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,430
Bao Zhu is coming.

232
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,660
You should leave at once.

233
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:07,310
It's not good if she sees you.

234
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:10,520
Do you think

235
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,060
we are like...

236
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:13,910
Like what?

237
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:17,650
Forget it. It's nothing.

238
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:19,730
Well, I'll get going now.

239
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:22,320
See you.

[Guangyang Palace]

241
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,880
Father, Mother.

242
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:47,420
The talk about Fu Rong assassinating me
is complete nonsense.

243
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,740
There was no such thing.

244
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:51,270
You think I wouldn't know?

245
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,160
Father.

246
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,680
Who's the one telling tales to you?

247
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:58,440
Don't bother how I found out about this.

248
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:01,870
I knew you would defend Fu Rong.

249
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:03,890
Let me ask you this.

250
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:06,010
Concubine Rong went out by herself

251
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:09,880
and left the whole residence in disarray.

252
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:12,890
Are you going to tell me
there was no such thing either?

253
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:14,060
Father.

254
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:16,080
These are two different things.

Jin'er.

256
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:22,090
Your father and I are worried about you.

257
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:24,770
Right now, Fu Rong
is the only concubine you have

258
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:26,770
and she keeps getting into trouble.

259
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:29,610
Yet, you're still defending her.

260
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,310
If this goes on,

261
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:34,170
there'll be no peace in your residence.

262
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:36,980
Looks like you need

263
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:40,240
a woman who can manage the household.

264
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:43,490
Father, you want me
to take a wife?

265
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,790
I know you're not willing to do it.

266
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:48,690
But it's only a matter of time.

267
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:53,480
Father, since that's your wish,

268
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,520
how could I refuse?

269
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,590
But I hope

270
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:02,190
I can choose her myself.

271
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,880
Are you really willing to do that?

272
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,480
All right.

273
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:10,110
You're dismissed.

274
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:11,650
Later on,

275
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:14,910
someone will send the portraits
to your residence.

276
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:17,240
Yes, Father.

Your Majesty.

278
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:30,680
In the past,
whenever we brought up this topic,

279
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,860
Jin'er would just brush it off.

280
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,760
Why did he happily agree to it today?

281
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:39,570
Perhaps Fu Rong really did stab him

282
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:40,980
and break his heart?

283
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:42,800
If his heart is really broken,

284
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:45,620
why did he bother defending Fu Rong?

285
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:51,080
I hope Jin'er is just going
through a phase.

286
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,760
What matters is that he gets over it.

Well.

290
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:04,280
Is it a bird?

291
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,530
Bird? It's a mandarin duck.

292

Never mind. They're pretty much
the same thing.

293

My lady, is it for His Highness?

294
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,740
My lady, bad news.

295
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:17,230
They have sent many portraits

Really?

311
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:50,270
I have someone in mind already.

No, I don't. Don't ever tell me.

she's quite a sophisticated girl.

322

Is that so?

she's the perfect candidate for my wife?

00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:11,830
and marry her the proper way?

505
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:13,400
Sir.

506
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:15,090
I don't know who you are.

507
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:17,010
Zhang Sheng wants to marry me.

508
00:43:17,010 --> 00:43:19,160
But my father is disdainful
of his lowly status

509
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:20,840
and wants me to marry Duke Su instead.

510
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:21,960
We have no choice

511
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,810
but to do this.

512
00:43:24,970 --> 00:43:27,520
I may be a commoner now,

513
00:43:27,610 --> 00:43:30,670
but I'll take the autumn exam
and make a name for myself.

514
00:43:30,730 --> 00:43:31,920
I won't let you suffer.

515
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,450
Glory and wealth mean nothing to me.

516
00:43:35,130 --> 00:43:36,430
All I want in this life

517
00:43:36,670 --> 00:43:38,280
is to grow old with you.

518
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:41,370
Sir, please let us through.

519
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:49,700
[To Official Fang]

520
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,350
I've read some of your discourse.

521
00:43:49,350 --> 00:43:50,640
Take this letter

522
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:52,840
to Huizhou and find Official Fang.

523
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:55,480
He'll give you a suitable position.

524
00:43:55,770 --> 00:43:56,890
Then,

525
00:43:57,270 --> 00:43:58,560
study hard

526
00:43:58,670 --> 00:44:00,270
and make a name for yourself.

527
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:03,980
Don't forget the promise
that you made to Ms Yao today.

528
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:05,520
You're Duke...

529
00:44:06,990 --> 00:44:08,520
There's not much time left.

530
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:10,120
If you don't go now,

531
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:11,440
it will be too late.

532
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,860
Thank you, Your Highness.

533
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:15,000
I hope to one day

534
00:44:15,090 --> 00:44:16,320
repay your kindness.

535
00:44:16,410 --> 00:44:18,010
Thank you for your blessing.

536
00:44:27,990 --> 00:44:29,120
Are you happy now?
