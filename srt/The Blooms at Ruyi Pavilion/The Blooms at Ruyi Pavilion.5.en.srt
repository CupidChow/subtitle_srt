00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:29,360
-Miss!
-Come out!

173
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,820
-Which one of them is Qi Ce?
-Miss!

174
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:31,950
Qi Ce!

175
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:33,350
She's looking for Qi Ce!

176
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:34,550
She's looking for me!

177
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:35,870
Yes!

178
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,170
Come out!

179
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,690
Come out!

180
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:40,400
Qi Ce!

181
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:43,080
She's knocking on the door.

182
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:07,240
Duke Su?

183
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:10,760
What are you doing here?

184
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:13,710
Rong'er,

185
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,160
what are you doing here?

186
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:20,570
What did you call me?

187
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,250
If you don't trust me,

188
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:23,960
you could've asked me.

189
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,420
Why did you come here?

190
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:27,310
You shouldn't be here.

191
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:39,550
Qi Ce,

192
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,090
you've deceived my parents.
They betrothed my sister to you,

193
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:44,070
thinking you're an honest, reliable man.

194
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,330
Little did they know you're a hypocrite.

195
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:47,920
You frequent the brothel,

196
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:49,350
even in broad daylight.

197
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,460
Xuan,

198
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:53,000
I was planning to...

199
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:56,480
Ms Fu, this is a misunderstanding.

200
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:06,200
Misunderstanding or not,
I'll make the judgement myself.

201
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:09,980
Qi Ce, my family has misjudged you.

202
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:11,380
From now on,

203
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:13,060
I, Fu Xuan,

204
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,970
will cut off all ties with you.

205
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:20,980
-Xuan!
-Don't follow us.

206
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:22,230
Lord Qi,

207
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:24,190
lust will lead you astray.

208
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:26,170
Xuan...

209
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:35,990
Your Highness.

210
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:41,830
Qi Ce didn't go
to Drunken Spring Court...

211
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:43,600
to have fun.

212
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:45,310
Judging by what we heard on the roof...

213
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:46,700
and what we saw today,

214
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:49,140
it's obvious that this is his lair.

215
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:51,960
Someone...

216
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:54,640
is getting wiser.

217
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,100
I noticed the pimps were hiding daggers
behind their backs.

218
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:02,310
If it's indeed a place for entertainment,

219
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:03,660
why would they do that?

220
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:06,340
You sisters are warriors among women.

221
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:07,590
It was such a dangerous place,

222
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:09,390
but you didn't hesitate to go in.

223
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,940
Rong'er, what else do you know?

224
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:15,630
I heard...

225
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:18,440
his intention is to murder the prince.

226
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:24,340
Why didn't you tell me
such an important thing?

227
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,720
Sister,

228
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:28,830
you always think that I'm childish.

229
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,470
You wouldn't believe me anyway.

230
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:33,470
If you hadn't seen it,
you never would have believed it.

231
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:36,700
Though I admit we stumbled upon his lair
only by mistake.

232
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:39,340
Ms Fu Xuan,

233
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:41,150
now that you know everything,

234
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:42,300
you won't think...

235
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:44,320
that I was being jealous, will you?

236
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:48,490
Your Highness,

237
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:51,660
they wanted to fight us to the bitter end.

238
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:52,900
Little did they know...

239
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,970
Ms Fu would give them a surprise attack.

240
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,630
Now, we can only wait for them
to walk into the trap.

241
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,610
They will find a chance to escape.

242
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:02,940
By that time,

243
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:04,820
we have to catch them all at once.

244
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:06,970
Yes.
Yes.

245
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:14,940
Wu Bai Qi.

246
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:16,380
Yes.

247
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,020
Send them home.

248
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:23,820
Ms Fu,

249
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,630
please.

250
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,940
If it weren't for my quick thinking,

251
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:36,590
you'd still be fighting a long war
with Qi Ce.

252
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:40,980
You seem to be...

253
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:43,330
very confident with your kung fu skills.

254
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:46,040
You think you could've dodged
Qi Ce's sword.

255
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:52,690
Then, let's call it even.

256
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:00,470
I need your help with something.

257
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:05,050
Qi Ce's sister and aging mother
are both innocent.

258
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:09,050
I will get to the bottom of it.

259
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:10,820
The innocent ones...

260
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,490
will not be implicated.

261
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,050
Were you begging me?

262
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,610
Anything else?

263
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,030
Qi Ce...

264
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:31,540
Is it possible to...

265
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:35,450
You want me to spare him?

266
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:38,970
You shouldn't be too greedy.

267
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,150
If we repay resentment with kindness,
with what do we repay kindness?

268
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:47,340
His intention is murdering the prince.

269
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:48,940
According to the law of Dayu,

270
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:51,030
it's a capital crime.

271
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,230
Besides, you're his target.
If I appeal to you,

272
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:56,490
I'm just being generous at your expense.

273
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:59,280
Just do as you like.
It's none of my business.

274
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:10,820
Duke Su,

275
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,720
why would he be here?

276
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:16,590
As for Fu Xuan and Fu Rong,

277
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:18,530
how did they end up here?

278
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:20,340
Regarding this,

279
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:22,290
I've sent some men to look into it.

280
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:24,100
I've asked around.

281
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,790
The vendors are not here because
there's a bazaar on East Street.

282
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:29,350
They've all gone there to set up stalls.

283
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:34,190
-You may leave now.
-Yes.

284
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,860
Call up some men.

285
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:39,550
We'll leave the city tonight.

286
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:40,660
Yes.

287
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:50,160
Xuan.

288
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,490
Never mind.

289
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:55,840
We'll get our chance.

290
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:58,060
That's all for now.

291
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,180
Yes, miss.

292
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:09,740
Little Marquis,
just tell us your thoughts.

293
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:13,220
It's about Qi Ce.

294
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:15,550
Although you've chosen the wrong man,

295
00:17:15,579 --> 00:17:18,720
it's better to find out now
than to regret later.

296
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,520
Anyway,

297
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:24,760
I'm sorry for your loss.

298
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:26,630
Yes, I'm sorry for your loss.

299
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:32,800
Thank you, Little Marquis.

300
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:41,120
Little Marquis, what were you saying?

301
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:43,140
She only called off an engagement.
She's not widowed.

302
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:44,670
"I'm sorry for your loss?"

303
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,310
Ms Fu!

304
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:55,760
I normally don't comfort people.

305
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,020
Sister.

306
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:23,350
Sister!

307
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:34,300
Regarding Qi Ce...

308
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:36,460
Rong'er.

309
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:40,080
Let me ask you something.

310
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,680
Don't hide anything from me.

311
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:43,760
I will never hide anything.

312
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:45,940
Let me ask you,

313
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:48,100
what's the history...

314
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:49,700
between you and Duke Su?

315
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:51,370
History?

316
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:55,300
He thought I wanted to murder him.

317
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:56,990
Is this considered history?

318
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,340
Is that it?

319
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:01,140
That's it.

320
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:04,790
Why did you ask?

321
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:06,220
Nothing.

322
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:08,110
I get the feeling that Duke Su...

323
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:09,590
treats you differently.

324
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:11,750
Differently?

325
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:15,470
He's rather hard on me, isn't he?

326
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,020
Forget it.

327
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,720
Maybe I think too much.

328
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:32,070
As for Qi Ce...

329
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:34,320
I'm fine.

330
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:55,750
[Drunken Spring Court]

331
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:20,430
Going somewhere?

332
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:27,160
Lord Qi, it's a bit late for a walk.

333
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:31,730
Anything urgent?

334
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:40,050
What a great cover-up.

335
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:42,200
Get him!

336
00:20:57,810 --> 00:20:59,580
Father, I've interrupted your rest.

337
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:00,990
Please forgive me.

338
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,340
Must be something urgent...

339
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:05,830
for you to be waking me up.

340
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:07,020
Say it.

341
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:10,850

there have been three attempts on my life.

The first time happened
on my trip back to the capital.

345
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:20,370
Then, it happened again
in Ju Shui Pavilion.

346
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:22,550
As for the last time,

347
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,950
it happened at the foot of Western Hill.

348

The case in Ju Shui Pavilion
has been closed.

349

deceive his colleagues...

361

Father,

363
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,160
I think...

364
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:15,530
the cause is the corruption
of field ration in Guanyan Town.

365

The problem runs deep.

366

It's beyond the power of a prosecutor.

367

00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,560
Thank you, Mother.

511
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,820
How's the tea?

512
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,210
It's great.

513
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:41,630
Glad to hear that.

514
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,140
You're...

515
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:46,730
grown up now.

516
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:52,320
When I was back a month ago,

517
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:54,790
I should've visited you.

518
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:57,470
But because of all the work,

519
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,140
I was held up for a few days.

520
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:01,820
I'm unfilial.

521
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:03,930
No, you're not.

522
00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:05,340
Work is more important.

523
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,720
You should protect yourself.

524
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:10,540
I will.

525
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:16,430
Try it.

526
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:20,130
I specifically asked the chef
to make lotus pastry.

527
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:23,090
I remember this was your favourite
when you were young.

528
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:24,230
Try it.

529
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,980
See if it tastes the same.

530
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,680
Mother,

531
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:32,700
Mother!

532
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:34,320
-Hao'er.
-I heard Xu Jin...

533
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:40,940
Hao'er.

534
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:43,310
Xu Jin.

535
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:44,780
Hao'er,

536
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:46,540
Xu Jin is here too.

537
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:47,980
You came just in time.

538
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:51,540
Let's have lunch together.

539
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:53,740
Mother,

540
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,380
the Criminal Investigation Bureau
has a trial tomorrow.

541
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:58,580
I have to be there.

542
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:02,460
Sure,

543
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:03,950
work is more important.

544
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,820
What could be so urgent?

545
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:10,340
You can't even spare some time
to eat with Mother?

546
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:11,960
Hao'er.

547
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:15,800
Work is more important.

548
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,460
You should go now.

549
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,050
Yes, Mother.

550
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:22,700
Are you leaving just like that?

551
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:25,470
That's Mengding Tea
from Zhangyang City.

552
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:27,370
When Mother knew you were coming back,

553
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:29,880
she had the servants get it
a month in advance.

554
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,470
She knows you've lived there,

555
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:33,170
and has acquired a taste for it.

556
00:32:33,170 --> 00:32:34,780
And the lotus pastry.

557
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:37,270
Mother would ask the chef
to prepare it everyday,

558
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:39,800
so there'll always be some
when you come home.

559
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:42,350
But now you're leaving
without taking a single bite.

560
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:43,590
Hao'er.

561
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,840
Not eating? Fine.

562
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:54,720
More for me.

563
00:32:58,460 --> 00:32:59,580
Mother,

564
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:01,310
you've waited for so many years.

565
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:03,520
Yet he's waited one month to visit you.

566
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:05,460
And he only stayed for a while...

567
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,690
before he left.

568
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:08,670
Last night,

569
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:11,210
did you not sleep
because you were worried?

570
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:21,080
Hao'er,

571
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:24,330
don't be angry at your brother.

572
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:26,890
You have no idea.

573
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:30,450
Since the Empress died of illness,

574
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:32,520
your brother...

575
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:35,550
has been destined
for a life of loneliness.

576
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:38,720
At a tender age,

577
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:41,540
he was sent out of the palace
to guard the borders.

578
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:52,760
Madam.

579
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:55,480
Madam.

580
00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:57,200
Please, I beg you.

581
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,560
Could you give me back my two dowries?

582
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:02,390
My brother has been imprisoned.

583
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:03,780
We need money to save him.

584
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:05,260
Your engagement has been called off.

585
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:06,880
How dare you ask for dowry?

586
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,420
Madam,

587
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:11,940
I've never asked anything from you
my whole life.

588
00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:15,679
But this time, I have no choice.

589
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:18,679
My brother...

590
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:20,530
You never asked for anything,

591
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:22,260
but when you do,
it's certainly startling.

592
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,929
Attempting to murder a prince is a serious crime.

593
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:26,730
We can't wait to wash our hands off...

594
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:28,730
and you're still trying to help him?

595
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,570
Are you trying to get us all into trouble?

596
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:35,429
Please, madam.

597
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:37,469
Please.

598
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,570
Please, I beg you, madam.

599
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,040
Madam.

600
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:43,360
-Get up!
-I beg you!

601
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:45,850
-Stop groveling. Get up.
-Rong'er.

602
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:48,139
Rong'er, when Mother
learned that Brother is in jail,

603
00:34:48,139 --> 00:34:49,780
she fell into a coma.

604
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,230
I'm terrified.

605
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,210
I want to see my brother.

606
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:55,030
Sure,

607
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,420
I will find a way.

608
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,570
Forgive my bluntness,

609
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:02,590
but it was her brother
who bought the dowries.

610
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:04,120
How could you take them?

611
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:05,850
By tonight,

612
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:07,180
give them all back to her.

613
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:08,880
Or else I'll see you in court.

614
00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:09,930
You...

615
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:11,820
You're such a jinx!

616
00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:50,800
Brother.

617
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:03,910
Zhu'er.

618
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:05,890
Brother.

619
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:11,660
Zhu'er.

620
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,960
-Why did you come here?
-Brother.

621
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,770
I'm fine.

622
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:27,670
Brother.

623
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:31,370
What exactly has happened?

624
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,830
It's only been one night...

625
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:36,620
and our world has been turned upside down.

626
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:38,410
What's going on?

627
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:39,780
Zhu'er.

628
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:42,680
Don't... Don't worry about me.

629
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,450
Why did you come here?

630
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:47,660
You should be in a cabin
in the countryside,

631
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:49,190
waiting to get married.

632
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:51,650
Brother,

633
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:56,090
they've called off the engagement.

634
00:36:56,570 --> 00:36:57,810
What?

635
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:01,480
Shameless.

636
00:37:01,570 --> 00:37:03,180
Shameless scoundrel!

637
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:05,640
Calm down.

638
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:07,010
Calm down.

639
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,370
You said it yourself.

640
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:09,380
He is sick.

641
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:10,890
He won't live long.

642
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:13,330
-Why should I marry him and suffer?
-I was just...

643
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:14,440
Brother,

644
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:16,290
whether he is sick or not,

645
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,840
he's not the kind of man...

646
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,370
I should marry.

647
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:25,620
Don't worry.

648
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,440
How about Mother?

649
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,030
Mother.

650
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,920
Mother is very worried about you.

651
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,660
But she is doing fine.

652
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:44,570
As long as both of you are fine,

653
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:45,900
I can rest easy.

654
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:49,970
Zhu'er,

655
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:51,800
how did you get here?

656
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:55,890
Thanks to Rong'er.

657
00:37:56,430 --> 00:37:57,760
If it weren't for her...

658
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:02,310
Fu Rong.

659
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:09,090
Nice one, Fu Rong.

660
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:10,630
Brother,

661
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:12,830
-you...
-Zhu'er.

662
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:15,770
Actually, both of us...

663
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:18,270
shouldn't have ended up like this.

664
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:20,890
It was Fu Rong...

665
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:23,740
who used the engagement
to cover up for Xu Jin.

666
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:26,030
This is how...

667
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:29,150
This is how I got into this mess.

668
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:32,320
What?

669
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:34,170
Brother,

670
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:37,630
-so you got caught because Rong'er...
-Zhu'er!

671
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:38,950
Remember this.

672
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,320
Fu Rong...

673
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:43,320
and her entire family are hypocrites.

674
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:47,720
Step by step,

675
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:50,660
they'll lead you to your demise.

676
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:52,910
You hear me?

677
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:07,610
[Criminal Investigation Bureau Jail]

678
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:12,580
Zhu'er.

679
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,790
Are you all right?

680
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,520
Miss, bad news! Your mother is...

681
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:31,410
How is she?

682
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,630
Madam has been suffering
from a chronic disease.

683
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:36,830
She's been under a lot of stress lately.

684
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,290
Not to mention all the travel.

685
00:39:38,290 --> 00:39:39,550
I'm afraid...

686
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:43,270
Ms Qi, please make arrangements
for her funeral.

687
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:47,730
Doctor, I beg you. Please.

688
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:50,240
-Doctor.
-Doctor!

689
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,810
Zhu'er.

690
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:53,140
Mother.

691
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:55,120
Mother.

692
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:58,020
Ce'er...

693
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:00,580
Ce'er...

694
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:03,170
Brother is doing fine.

695
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:05,810
It was a false charge.

696
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:08,580
After two days,

697
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:10,920
he will be released.

698
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:13,160
Once he gets out,

699
00:40:13,810 --> 00:40:15,620
you and Brother...

700
00:40:17,310 --> 00:40:18,970
will be able to marry me off.

701
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:22,840
Sure.

702
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:38,810
Mother.

703
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:48,620
Mother.

704
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:51,170
Mother.

705
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:54,030
Zhu'er.

706
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:01,510
Please don't leave me alone.

707
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:04,070
Mother.

708
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:08,730
Don't leave me alone.

709
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:10,270
Zhu'er.

710
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,670
Fu Rong,

711
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:20,830
just leave.

712
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:22,640
Zhu'er.

713
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:25,140
Drop the act already.

714
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:27,380
I know everything.

715
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:32,220
Fu Xuan and you...

716
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:37,240
have been deceiving me and my brother.

717
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:39,530
Zhu'er,

718
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:42,040
what happened to your brother...

719
00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:44,020
has nothing to do with my sister.

720
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:45,730
Blame me instead.

721
00:41:45,810 --> 00:41:47,370
You don't get it!

722
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:49,470
You just don't get it!

723
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:53,530
Having to depend on someone's charity
to survive as children.

724
00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:55,390
You'll never know what it's like.

725
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:58,150
My brother has gone through so much...

726
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:00,250
for me and Mother.

727
00:42:01,890 --> 00:42:03,290
Just go.

728
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:07,380
I don't want anything
to do with you again.

729
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,250
Zhu'er, I'm sorry.

730
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:14,370
I never meant to hurt you.

731
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:16,930
I just wanted to protect my sister.

732
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:20,450
Please, I beg you.

733
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:22,780
Just leave.

734
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:27,750
Don't ever let me see you again.
