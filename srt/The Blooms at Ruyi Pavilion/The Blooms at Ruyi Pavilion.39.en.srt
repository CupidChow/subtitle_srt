[Episode 39]

4
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:46,700
General, your wound has reopened.

5
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,240
Li Wei.

6
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:52,130
You have gotten bolder.

7
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:55,500
How dare you invite Ms Fu
behind my back?

8
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,729
If others hadn't told me

9
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:59,360
that you brought Ms Fu here,

10
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,390
I would've...

11
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:02,340
General.

12
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,960
When you were unconscious,

13
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:05,950
you kept on calling Ms Fu's name.

14
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:07,100
I thought

15
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:09,020
you wanted to see her,
so I...

16
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:11,610
I do want to see her.

17
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,400
But not now.

18
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:17,390
Forget it.

19
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:19,200
Someone like you

20
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:21,590
probably never held
a girl's hand before.

21
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:22,890
So how would you know?

22
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,540
Get someone

23
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,850
to escort Ms Fu back to the residence.

24
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,350
-Yes.
-Wait.

25
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:33,660
Bring the wheelchair to me.

26
00:02:33,829 --> 00:02:34,829
Sure.

27
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,120
Careful, General.

28
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:45,670
You don't have to.

29
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,910
You don't have to. I can manage.

30
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:02,730
Careful.

31
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:04,930
No.

32
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,160
I can manage.

33
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,300
General.

34
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:39,579
What do you want to do?

35
00:03:39,579 --> 00:03:40,650
Let me help.

36
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:45,780
You want to help me

37
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:47,630
urinate?

38
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:53,920
Lieutenant Li.

39
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:55,440
Tell me the truth.

40
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,070
What is the condition

41
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:59,370
of the general's injury?

42
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:01,030
Ms Fu.

43
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:03,970
His Majesty has sent
a doctor to examine him.

44
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:06,870
The general's left leg is better now.
Nothing serious.

45
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:08,230
But his right leg
was stabbed.

46
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:09,560
The wound is quite deep.

47
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,320
If he wants to fully recover,

48
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:13,720
it might not be easy.

49
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,490
Also,

50
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,180
even if it is healed later on,

51
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:18,920
he'd still feel some pain

52
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,480
in his knee every now and then.

53
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,750
Greetings, Your Highness..

54
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:48,110
-Respects to Duke Su.
-Your Highness. Concubine Rong.

55
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,390
Respects to the Princess.

56
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:00,060
This is great.

57
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:01,410
You're still alive.

58
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,290
I knew you were still alive.

59
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:04,710
Okay, no need to feel sad.

60
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:06,120
I'm okay.

61
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:07,370
Don't be sad.

62
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:08,690
Who's sad?

63
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:10,210
Even if I'm sad,

64
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,040
it would be because of Duke Su.

65
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,510
Sure. You're not sad.

66
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,740
Yuan.

67
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:21,410
Don't worry, Your Highness.

68
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:22,710
I've taken care

69
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,270
of Yuan's tombstone.

70
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:25,670
It's by the hill, overlooking the sea.

71
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:27,980
She will be missed.

72
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,550
Thank you.

73
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:33,600
But most importantly,

74
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,250
what are we going to do next?

75
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,120
Princess.

76
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:42,460
If you're really reluctant to get married,

77
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:44,560
I can declare to the public

78
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,940
that you have fallen off
the cliff and died.

79
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,659
Then,

80
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:51,720
you can be free.

81
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:54,420
If that's how it is,

82
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:55,950
what about you two?

83
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,870
You don't need to worry about this.

84
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,030
Hearing you saying this

85
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:04,750
is already enough.

86
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:07,300
You two have saved me.

87
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:09,810
I was the one who agreed
to get married.

88
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,350
So now,

89
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,350
it is time for me to bear
my own responsibility.

90
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:19,540
I was deceived by Qi Zhu back then.

91
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:21,360
I was even hunted by assassins.

92
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,370
Even now,

93
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:24,180
I have no idea where she has escaped to.

94
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,390
I'm so frustrated!

95
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,270
Since you already made the decision

96
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:33,900
to get married,

97
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:38,270
then I will definitely escort
you to Xuanhan safely.

98
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,740
Regarding the assassin,

99
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,190
I don't think it is that easy.

100
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:45,710
The assassin meant business.

101
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:47,840
He clearly wanted to ruin the wedding.

102
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,590
He won't give up that easily.

103
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,120
I have an idea.

104
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,790
I will pretend to be the princess
and go to Xuanhan.

105
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:59,730
You can pretend to be a normal citizen
and use a different route.

106
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:00,780
If we do this,

107
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:02,330
wouldn't you be in danger?

108
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,170
His Highness will be with me.
I'll be fine.

109
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:09,030
You should rest for the day.

110
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,660
Xu Jia.

111
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:13,110
Tomorrow, assemble an entourage

112
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:14,640
in commoner's attire

113
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:17,450
and escort the princess
to her destination.

114
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:18,970
Noted.

115
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:21,260
It seems all my life,

116
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:23,920
I've been bidding farewell
to my loved ones.

117
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,650
When I was young,

118
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:27,210
Mother and Father left me

119
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:29,650
and never returned.

120
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:31,510
And now...

121
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,000
Duke Su,

122
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,440
promise me.

123
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,680
Take good care of yourself.

124
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:43,970
You too.

125
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:46,840
I know.

126
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:48,990
I promise we'll see each other again.

127
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:51,090
Princess.

128
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:54,210
Please go and rest.

129
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,430
Just go.

130
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:01,190
Your Highness.

131
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,970
I'll see you in Xuanhan.

132
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:17,040
Why are you covering me
with a blanket?

133
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:24,470
General.

134
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,750
The weather is getting colder.

135
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,240
If you get sick,

136
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:28,660
your leg might not heal.

137
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:34,890
You always were rough around the edges.

138
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:37,299
Why are you suddenly so thoughtful?

139
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,720
Something's odd.

140
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,820
Of course not.

141
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,430
Be honest.

142
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:46,160
Did you do something wrong?

143
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:48,530
If you don't tell me,

144
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,720
I'll have someone take you
to jail to question you.

145
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,430
General.

146
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:55,480
It's...

147
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:57,460
It's Ms Fu.

148
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:01,340
Ms Fu didn't leave the other day.

149
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:10,690
I'm sure the general will refuse any help.

150
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,830
I will bring over a small stool.

151
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,620
When he awakes,

152
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:17,610
he can easily use the stool to get
onto the wheelchair from his bed.

153
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:19,220
As for washing up,

154
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:21,630
the small table in the tent
is too low.

155
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:23,030
The general needs to bend down.

156
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,600
It's not convenient.

157
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,150
Could you place

158
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:28,690
the basin and handkerchief
at a higher spot?

159
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,300
Besides that,

160
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:32,390
the wheelchair is too cold and hard.

161
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:35,520
I'll ask someone to bring
a cushion and a blanket another day.

162
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,370
When the general goes out of the tent,

163
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:39,760
please cover him with the blanket.

164
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,990
I'm sure he doesn't want me to

165
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:44,030
see him in a pitiable condition.

166
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,020
I also don't wish to embarrass him.

167
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,120
I will leave

168
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:50,520
you to take proper care of him.

169
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,500
If anything happens,

170
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:55,160
you can look for me anytime
at Fu Residence.

171
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:56,470
Yes.

172
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,990
Ms Fu is a kind person.

173
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,260
Even if it's for her own good,

174
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,930
you shouldn't have
broken up with her.

175
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:07,770
Who said we broke up?

176
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:09,860
Then

177
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:12,980
why did you anger her on purpose
the other day?

178
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,150
My legs will get better.

179
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,390
Is there a need for her
to see me like this?

180
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:21,790
It will only make her sad.

181
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:22,940
This...

182
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:25,130
It's fine.

183
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:27,150
Since she knew,

184
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,060
there's no reason for me
to hide from her.

185
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,390
I...

186
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,330
The poison has penetrated the lungs.

187
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:07,720
My time is near.

188
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,440
I knew that my brother
was at fault.

189
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,550
Yet I took my anger out on Fu Rong.

190
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:15,510
Now my selfish desire
has turned into a disaster.

191
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:18,040
I deserve this.

192
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:20,590
But you are so kind
and innocent,

193
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:23,290
I just hope you can
forget about me quickly.

194
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,780
Duke Huai.

195
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,340
I did not stray from the platoon
by accident.

196
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:49,930
I left them on purpose

197
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:52,350
in order to escape the marriage.

198
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,740
The reason I agreed
to the marriage proposal

199
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:58,180
is to get a chance to gain freedom.

200
00:11:58,270 --> 00:11:59,390
Qi Zhu.

201
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,940
-In the future that I'd envisioned,
-Qi Zhu.

202
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,900
-there is no you.
-Qi Zhu.

203
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:05,350
Qi Zhu.

204
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,040
Qi Zhu.

205
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:10,630
Qi Zhu.

206
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:24,540
Xuan'er.

207
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,630
I thought you said

208
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,320
you don't want to see me?

209
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:35,540
Why would I not want to see you?

210
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:39,030
The other day,

211
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,790
I thought I'd become a cripple.

212
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:41,800
I feared

213
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:43,620
I won't be able to see you again.

214
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:46,620
Don't speak nonsense.

215
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:47,830
Or else...

216
00:12:58,450 --> 00:12:59,700
Or else what?

217
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:02,580
Or else I'll push you off.

218
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:09,260
Why do you look so cute
even when you're threatening someone?

219
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,300
I just think that,

220
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:23,140
given my condition,

221
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:24,830
I don't deserve you at all.

222
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,580
But don't worry.

223
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:27,790
The doctor told me...

224
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:28,880
Wu Bai Qi.

225
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:30,930
I don't mind at all.

226
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,830
It doesn't matter what you become.

227
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:35,170
I don't mind.

228
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,830
Even if your legs are paralyzed,

229
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:39,470
I can still push you.

230
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,160
Even if the road is rough and steep,

231
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:45,590
I can improve my strength.

232
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,680
By that time, I can even carry you.

233
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,500
There is a water source here.

234
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:01,930
We will station here.

235
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:14,100
Rong'er.

236
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:16,450
Your Highness.

237
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:41,250
Second Prince?

238
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:48,220
Your Highness.

239
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:49,350
Don't come out.

240
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:02,930
Rong'er!

241
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,410
It's you.

242
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,840
Nong Nong.

243
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:52,970
Nong Nong.

244
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:23,060
General.

245
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,190
You can walk already.

246
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,329
Why do you still use a wheelchair?

247
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:29,360
You don't understand.

248
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:30,450
When Xuan'er arrives,

249
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:32,010
I'll stand up abruptly

250
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,660
and surprise her.

251
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,030
General, Ms Fu is here.

252
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,910
-Invite her in.
-Yes.

253
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:43,920
Stop.

254
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:05,720
I have a surprise for you.

255
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:09,310
Looks like we're indeed

256
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,660
a match made in heaven.

257
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:11,830
What a coincidence.

258
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:14,360
I have a surprise for you too.
But you go first.

259
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:25,920
Our general...

260
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,130
Great.

261
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,860
Xuan'er.

262
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:34,070
Thank you so much.

263
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:36,360
You're very considerate.

264
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:37,680
You're welcome.

265
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,070
Not bad.

266
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,490
It is much lighter than your previous one.

267
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:06,980
I know

268
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:09,980
you have been practicing walking.

269
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:12,460
But you don't push yourself too hard

270
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:14,150
or you might get hurt.

271
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:15,840
One time,

272
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:17,520
as I was reading an ancient book,

273
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,640
I came across a general from
the past dynasty

274
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:22,040
who was born with disabilities.

275
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:24,260
But because he was adept
at the art of war,

276
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,670
he won many battles.

277
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,660
That's why

278
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,100
once you get better,

279
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:31,400
I want to study military books with you.
What do you say?

280
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,670
Of course.

281
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:37,660
But Xuan'er.

282
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:39,380
what if...

283
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,270
I'm saying what if

284
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:45,280
my legs can't be cured?

285
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,450
What will you do?

286
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:50,060
Don't say such things.

287
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:52,870
You know I won't mind.

288
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:54,720
I'm only worried

289
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:57,320
you might feel dejected.

290
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,880
As long as you're with me,

291
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,840
I am content.

292
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:16,930
Why would I feel dejected?

293
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:22,340
Xuan'er.

294
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:25,950
Actually, I...

295
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,630
How do I stop this thing?

296
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:34,100
On the right side!

297
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:58,440
Are you okay?

298
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:00,720
I'm okay.

299
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,050
But you...

300
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:04,950
Actually,

301
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:07,770
the surprise that I was going to tell you

302
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:10,150
is that my legs

303
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:11,820
are basically healed now.

304
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:13,400
It's just that

305
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:16,810
you have gifted me
another wheelchair,

306
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:18,760
so I didn't want to disappoint you.

307
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,870
That is why...

308
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,220
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

309
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:26,130
Xuan'er! Xuan'er!

310
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:29,370
Aren't you happy that
my legs are better?

311
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,540
Still want to lie to me?

312
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,730
I didn't lie to you.

313
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:55,240
[Shi Qu Pavilion]

314
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,560
Where is Duke Su and Concubine Rong?

315
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:58,800
What are you looking at?

316
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:06,980
When will your king arrive?

317
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:09,780
I'm hungry and tired.

318
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:12,450
I want to take a bath and rest.

319
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:14,780
The king has arrived.

320
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,270
[King of Xuanhan]

321
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:38,090
Respects to the King of Xuanhan.

322
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:39,540
Respects to the king.

323
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:43,090
Spare the formalities. You must be tired
coming all the way here.

324
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:44,430
Respects to the king.

325
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:57,010
Princess, your journey
must have been tiring.

326
00:23:57,010 --> 00:23:59,180
But why are you dressed like this?

327
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,280
And where's the procession?

328
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:02,600
There was an assassin.

329
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,250
We had no choice

330
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:06,610
but to use someone else as my decoy.

331
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,600
Me and my entourage took a detour here.

332
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:14,190
Did you not read the marriage contract?

333
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:15,350
You seem skeptical.

334
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:18,910
If you don't believe me,

335
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:21,260
-you can send me back.
-Princess!

336
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:24,380
When the entire procession shows up,

337
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,120
you'll be sorry.

338
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,350
I didn't doubt you.

339
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:34,450
I knew you were a princess
the moment I saw you.

340
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:40,180
You could tell just by my air of nobility?

341
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:44,040
Yes.

342
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:17,050
Why is there dust on my face?

343
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:21,670
Why didn't you tell me?

344
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,980
How embarrassing!

345
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,350
Why is this princess so...

346
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:36,330
Then, why is Second Prince lying?

347
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:39,700
My brother has not returned.

348
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:42,320
The princess met an assassin.

349
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,770
What else could it be?

350
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:50,750
The wedding procession might be in danger.

351
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,150
Send someone to go check.

[Fu Residence]

353
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:09,200

355
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:14,990
Wait for a moment.

00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:25,390
Are your legs alright?

357
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:33,290
Xuan'er.

Please don't be angry anymore.

359
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:37,800
I wasn't angry.

360
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:48,340
This is...

361
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:58,500
I made this from the wreckage
of the wheelchair.

362
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,530
Look.

363
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:02,150
Does it remind you
of Little Wu standing up?

364
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:03,420
Why did you make this?

365
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:04,420
As a memento.

366
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:06,050
For this injury.

367
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:07,550
Not only did you not forsake me,

368

you even promised to push my wheelchair
for the rest of your life.

Amazing.

Duke An sent you back.

You've been unconscious until now.

this just in from the frontier.

00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,470
The wedding procession
encountered assassins

396
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:39,300
on its journey.

The Princess of Xihe and Duke Su

Understood.

410
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:16,390
But the nearby villagers said

411
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,680
none of the people who had
fallen off the cliff

412
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,380
lived to tell the tale.

To think that after I left,

425
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:44,730
His Highness flew a kite by himself.

This is Xuanhan's palace.

438
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,909
When the princess reached the palace,

439
00:34:44,909 --> 00:34:47,150
the wedding procession
was nowhere to be seen.

440
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:49,150
So they sent people to look for you.

how can I take back what I gave you?

450
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,240
Take this.

451
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:22,120
In case of a misfortune.

452
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:26,800

Duke Su, please rest assured.

00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:56,830
Xiao Qi and I are both
members of Ruyi Pavilion.

461
00:35:56,830 --> 00:35:58,350
He has informed me that

462
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:01,090
Duke An has sent Master
back to Fu Residence.

463
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:06,740
Thank you for saving me.

464
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:10,260
My previous attitude towards
Ruyi Pavilion...

465
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:11,600
No need to thank me.

466
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:13,430
I was on my way

467
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:16,080
to Xuanhan to investigate
Duke An's mother

468
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:17,690
and lent a helping hand.

469
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,090
Besides,

470
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:22,550
helping our fellow men
is Ruyi Pavilion's credo.

471
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:25,480
One day, you'll see that it is true.

472
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:30,550
Then did you manage to find out anything
about Duke An's mother?

473
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:32,620
According to my investigation,

474
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:35,220
back then, Queen Dowager Wen

475
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:37,620
was not burned to death
at Hong Fu Temple.

476
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,530
I have found someone

477
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:42,260
whose age, figure and appearance

478
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:44,960
are very similar to Queen Dowager Wen's.

479
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,350
This person

480
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,770
lives in the outskirts between
Dayu and Xuanhan.

481
00:36:48,770 --> 00:36:50,390
She rarely shows her face.

482
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:53,620
Looking for her will require some time.

483
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:57,000
Since the marriage is settled,

484
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:03,030
-I should go back immediately.
-Your Highness, you're still injured.

485
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,370
It's fine.

486
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:07,700
If I don't go back soon,

487
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:09,700
Rong'er might be in danger.

488
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:11,900
And Queen Dowager Wen...

489
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,560
Duke Su, please rest assured.

490
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:17,260
I will definitely bring Queen Dowager Wen
back to Dayu safely.

491
00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:18,690
Thank you Uncle San.

492
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:27,900
Duke Su!

493
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:34,770
Are you okay?

494
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:36,500
I'm so worried.

495
00:37:36,770 --> 00:37:38,070
Greetings, my king.

496
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,580
Greetings,

497
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:41,470
my queen.

498
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:43,560
I'm no queen of his.

499
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,520
At least not for now.

500
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:49,850
Where is Fu Rong?

501
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:52,050
We have been separated.

502
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:54,070
She has returned to Dayu.

503
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:56,760
I need to go back soon, too.

504
00:37:58,720 --> 00:37:59,790
Your Majesty,

505
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:01,590
I shall take my leave.

506
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:04,430
You are severely injured.

507
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:06,130
I'll have someone escort you.

508
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,140
Do you know

509
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:10,060
who the assassin is?

510
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:12,160
Is it my second brother?

511
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:16,630
It seems you already knew.

512
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,430
It's just a guess.

513
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:19,690
Don't worry.

514
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:21,940
I have already sent some men
to capture him.

515
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:24,800
Why would the second prince
want to assassinate me?

516
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:30,070
I think

517
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:32,520
it was due to jealousy.

518
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:35,200
That's why he wanted
to ruin the marriage.

519
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:36,630
Before this,

520
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:40,870
I heard you insisted
on marrying the Princess of Xihe.

521
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:43,400
I guess that was also his doing.

522
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:45,650
My brother always was prideful.

523
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:46,710
I need to capture him

524
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:47,700
and punish him severely.

525
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:48,690
So,

526
00:38:48,770 --> 00:38:50,620
you never desired to marry me?

527
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:52,620
It was all a bluff by your brother?

528
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:53,750
I...

529
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:57,780
Why are you bothered by this?

530
00:38:57,990 --> 00:38:58,960
Didn't we get along well

531
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,740
these past few days?

532
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:02,000
Fine.

533
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,130
I'll tell you.

534
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:04,670
When you first laid eyes on me,

535
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:08,200
it didn't seem as if you were looking
at the woman of your dreams.

536
00:39:08,370 --> 00:39:10,750
You knew I misunderstood,
yet you didn't tell me.

537
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:11,720
You...

538
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:12,930
You are evil!

539
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:19,740
Princess Xihe is straightforward
and sincere.

540
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:21,950
Please don't take it to heart.

541
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,250
The princess is lively and adorable.

542
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:25,990
I find her quite interesting.

543
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:30,350
Here's the marriage contract.

544
00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:32,530
Please take it back to Dayu.

545
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:34,280
The horses are ready.

546
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,770
They're outside the palace.

547
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:37,910
Safe journey, Your Highness.

548
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:39,870
Farewell.

549
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:45,920
Duke Su.

550
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:47,900
Though we'll be far apart,

551
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:49,520
may fate let us meet again.

552
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:51,790
Please take care.

553
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,240
You too.

554
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:14,270
[Duke Su's Residence]

555
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:36,760
Whatever will happen

556
00:40:37,730 --> 00:40:39,730
will happen regardless.

557
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:44,280
Brother.

558
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,960
Your health is important.

559
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:49,950
If you keep this up,

560
00:40:50,930 --> 00:40:53,420
I will become very worried.

561
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:58,410
Whenever I think about Jin'er

562
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:00,710
and Wan'er,

563
00:41:03,730 --> 00:41:05,020
my heart

564
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:07,630
aches.

565
00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:09,470
Duke Su is valiant.

566
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:13,670
He has always managed to return safely
after a battle.

567
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:16,600
But now it seems

568
00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:19,940
the heavens are jealous
of his talent.

569
00:41:22,290 --> 00:41:24,350
The wedding procession led by Duke Su

570
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:27,550
has perished

571
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:29,790
in service of our country.

572
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:32,810
They deserve a hero's burial.

573
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:37,560
Your Majesty, I know you're physically
and mentally drained.

574
00:41:38,010 --> 00:41:41,540
So Duke Huai and I took the liberty
of preparing the grave goods.

575
00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:43,310
Later tonight,

576
00:41:43,650 --> 00:41:45,220
you may look them over.

577
00:41:47,290 --> 00:41:48,590
I leave this matter

578
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:52,520
entirely to you.

579
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,270
One more thing.

580
00:41:57,460 --> 00:41:59,280
Should Concubine Rong

581
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:01,760
be buried with her husband?

582
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:09,230
As everyone knows,

583
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:13,040
Duke Su loved
his concubine dearly.

584
00:42:14,610 --> 00:42:17,140
Now that Duke Su
has died for the country,

585
00:42:17,770 --> 00:42:20,080
with no other concubines or heirs,

586
00:42:22,350 --> 00:42:24,000
being buried alone

587
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:27,640
is way too lonesome.
