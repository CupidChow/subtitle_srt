Please take care of His Highness.

My lady.

10
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:04,850
His Highness was not afflicted with
cold toxin.

11
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,790
And that's what happened.

12
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,740
Consort Shu and the Emperor

13
00:02:30,829 --> 00:02:33,390
were worried about your love
towards His Highness.

14
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:34,660
Hence,

15
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:36,900
they came up with this plan.

16
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:41,570
Mother and Mr Ge lied to you.

17
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,740
Aren't you angry?

18
00:02:43,829 --> 00:02:45,220
I'm not angry.

19
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:46,950
I'm so happy that you're alive.

20
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:48,300
Why should I be angry?

21
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:54,020
But I'm angry.

22
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,710

31

Yes, Your Highness.

32
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:24,380
Mr Ge had your best interests at heart.

33

Stop pleading for him.

How can you

36
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:34,980
come up with such an idea?

37
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,490
If you die,

38
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:39,510
what am I going to do?

39
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,730
Waking up

40
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,760
and finding you gone.

41
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:51,610
Do you know

42
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:55,180
how that would make me feel?

43
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,690
I once had many plans for the future.

44
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,680
I wanted to reopen Ruyi Pavilion.

45
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,980
Be filial to my parents.

48
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,250
But now it seems

49
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:18,800
these dreams won't come true

50
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,470
without you by my side.

51
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:24,740
So I really wanted you to live.

Do you think I won't be angry anymore

53

if you say that?

54
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,050
All this while,

have you been hiding anything from me?

You think I'm doing this

57
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:52,150
to repay you for not marrying a wife?

58
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:54,620
More than that.

59
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:59,810
You brought me tonic soup at night,

60

Are you allowing me to run

Running Ruyi Pavilion is your prerogative.

72

Why do you need my permission?

73

Why would I blame you?

Ruyi Pavilion was my master's
sweat and blood.

00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,580
It has been in Hengjing
for 20 over years,

00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:44,490
for the selection of Huxiao Camp's

That's one of the reasons.

Most importantly,

168
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:01,560
it's because of the corruption
in Huxiao Camp.

169
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,290
Huxiao Camp?

170

Huxiao Camp is responsible for
protecting the capital.

00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:20,040
Who could do such a thing?

175
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:25,980
The leaders in Huxiao Camp have
grown out of control.

176
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:27,830
Over the years,

177
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,910
I wasn't able to rectify the situation

178
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:34,250
because I was busy maintaining
peace at the court.

179
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:39,970
Your return to the capital
has hardened my resolve.

180
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:41,630
There's nothing I hate

181
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:45,160
more than corruption in the court.

182
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:48,640
But my spies found out that

183
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:54,100
someone in Huxiao Camp is smuggling
weapons out of the capital.

184
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:58,540
That person is indeed brazen.

185
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:01,710
He must also be involved in

186
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:04,750
the army ration corruption case
in Guanyan Town.

187
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:07,740
In my opinion,

188
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:12,360
in order for the thief
to smuggle the weapons,

189
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:17,500
he must have contacts in the capital.

190
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:20,250
Moreover, he'd need to mix the weapons

191
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:23,970
with silverware and copperware

192
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,130
in order to smuggle them out.

193
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:28,880
In the capital,

194
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:30,770
the most frequently traded item

195
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:32,160
is copperware.

196
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:34,000
I think

197
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:36,020
we should begin our investigation

198
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:38,890
with the copperware shops.

199
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,120
I've chosen the right person for the job.

200
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:44,860
This important mission

201
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:47,110
shall be entrusted to you.

202
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,580
Yes, Father.

203
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,430
[Duke Cheng's Residence]

204
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,710
Wu Bai Qi?

205
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:14,930
He also participated in
the martial arts competition?

206
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:16,310
Not only did he participate,

207
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:18,070
he even performed extraordinarily well

208
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:19,670
during the competition.

209
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:22,800
Wu Bai Qi

210
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:25,920
is your legitimate son.

211
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:28,870
You'll have to decide

212
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:32,210
what we should do with him.

213
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:34,630
Let me say one more thing.

214
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:37,270
If Wu Bai Qi joins Huxiao Camp,

215
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:39,470
it won't be easy for us

216
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,890
to carry out our plan.

217
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:44,220
Please bear in mind.

218
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:47,480
It seems the scam with Huxiao Camp

219
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:51,420
is no less lucrative than that
with the Imperial Guards.

220
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:54,520
In all these years,

221
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:58,790
he has never treated me like a father.

222
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:02,790
He's just an unfilial son.

223
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:06,930
We shouldn't worry about him.

224
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,890
Just go for it.

225
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:13,660
Keep your eyes on the prize.

226
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,650
Why isn't Little Marquis here yet?

227
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:24,310
He is still training.
He probably can't come.

228
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:25,890
Here you go, Mr Xu.

229
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,030

232
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:33,610
You seem to know Little Marquis
very well.

Rong'er.

234
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:36,140
Stop talking nonsense.

235
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:41,000
Little Marquis wanted me

236
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:42,740
to personally pass to you

237
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:44,900
this invitation to
the martial arts competition.

238
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:47,190
When he heard you'd become
Ruyi Pavilion's bookkeeper,

239
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:49,340
Little Marquis was over the moon.

240
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,570
He said he will personally
congratulate you

241
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:53,700
after the martial arts competition.

242
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:55,370
Thank you, Mr Ge.

243
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:58,930
Mr Ge.

244
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:01,930
How's Little Marquis doing?

245
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:03,260
Little Marquis

246
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,870
is doing very well.

247
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,500
But

248
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:09,670
he'd be even happier

249
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:13,450
knowing you're so concerned about him.

250
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,670
What's this?

251
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:39,500
Is this a token of love from His Highness?

252
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:42,760
How could he buy something this tacky?

253
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:44,570
Could it be

254
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:47,900
a gift from another woman to His Highness?

255
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:06,370
Father wanted to have dinner with me.

256
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,230
So I couldn't make it to Ruyi Pavilion.

257
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:11,880
You saw it?

258
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:13,330
Yes.

259
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,180
Tell me.

260
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:17,910
Did you buy this for me?

261
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,250
You don't like it?

262
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,380
Even hairpins from Ruyi Pavilion
are more exquisite than this.

263
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,810
You wouldn't buy something like this
for me.

264
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:30,980
Indeed, I didn't buy it for you.

265
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,480
I passed by a copperware shop today.

266
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,100
In the spur of the moment,

267
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:39,940
I decided to make a hairpin.

268
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:44,180
You made this?

269
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,300
I made it myself.

270
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,160
The shopkeeper asked me

271
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,050
who I am making it for.

272
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:53,680
I told him

273
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:55,750
it is for my wife.

274
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,120
But now it seems

275
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,660
she doesn't like it.

276
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,330
-Too bad. I have to throw it away.
-No, no.

277
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:03,800
I love it so much!

278
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:05,780
It's so exquisite!

279
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,970
I'm glad you like it.

280
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:14,980
Why don't you sleep here tonight?

281

282
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:21,420
I have many documents to review.

283

After I'm through with it,

284
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:27,690
I'll come back and sleep on the couch.

285
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:30,220
You should sleep on the bed.

286
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:33,040
I'll sleep on the inner side.
You won't wake me up.

00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,210
Please let him go.

344
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,410
Yuan.

345
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,100
Have you any idea what you're doing?

346
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,270
Ms Liu.

347
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:14,940
I'm begging you.

348
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:16,750
Yuan.

349
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,200
Yuan.

350
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:37,820
Ms Liu.

351
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:41,060
Ms Liu.

352
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:42,440
Ms Liu.

353
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:50,540
Yuan.

354
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:51,970
Yuan.

355
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,350
This happened

356
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:55,850
because you wanted to save me.

357
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:58,410
It was an accident.

358
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:00,480
Mr Ju Shui.

359
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:02,550
Yuan.

360
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,400
From now on,

361
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:06,510
I'll protect you.

362
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,140
Ms Liu has a secret room.

363
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:22,770
Many secrets are kept within it.

364
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,910
If the room is discovered,

365
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,560
you could get into trouble.

366
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,480
If you trust me,

367
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:33,440
just leave everything to me.

368
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:50,640
Marquis Xindu dare lay his hands
on Huxiao Camp's weapons?

369
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:54,420
He actually put his life on the line
for profit.

370
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,450
You're right.

371
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:56,700
People die in pursuit of wealth,

372
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,300
birds die in pursuit of food.

373
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:02,560
Moreover, Marquis Xindu has always
valued wealth more than life.

374
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:04,020
If Marquis Xindu wants to

375
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:06,390
keep his secret safe,

376
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,630
he'll want the Valiant General

377
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,670
to be someone from his side.

378
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:13,620
However,

379
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:16,360
the candidate most likely to be
appointed as Valiant General

380
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,010
is Wu Bai Qi.

381
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:19,500
You mean Marquis Xindu

382
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:22,010
will try to harm Wu Bai Qi?

383
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:24,180
Good.

384
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:38,420
You're gathered here today

385
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:41,070
because you are Dayu’s best warriors.

386
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:43,050
I'm awed

387
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:45,170
and comforted by this view.

388
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:47,910
While the best scholar is
hard to determine,

389
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,540
the best warrior can be decided
through battle.

390
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:53,130
There'll only be one winner today.

391
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:57,330
I will appoint him as Valiant General.

392
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:59,620
He will possess
the Seal of Huxiao Camp.

393
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:07,080
Huzzah! Huzzah!

394
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:10,370
Before we begin
the martial arts competition,

395
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:12,370
there'll be a battle of arrows
as usual.

396
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:15,530
Everyone's welcome to compete.

397
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:21,480
Huzzah! Huzzah!

398
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:27,230
Huzzah! Huzzah!

399
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:39,810
While the men compete,

400
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:42,190
the ladies will contribute as well.

401
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:43,790
These are floral bands.

402
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:45,800
Each lady will take one of them

403
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,440
and present it to the man of your choice

404
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,610
to wish him the best of luck.

405
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,480
Huzzah! Huzzah!

406
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:56,180
Huzzah! Huzzah!

00:25:56,270 --> 00:26:02,160
Huzzah! Huzzah!

408
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:02,920
Duke Cheng.

409
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:04,550
I apologise.

410
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,140
You are...

411
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,690
Duke Huai.

412
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:15,380
Duke Cheng.

413
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,770
Princess Consort of Qingping.

414
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,820
Little Follower.

415
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:24,660
I hope you win.

416
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:27,780
Good luck!

417
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:56,510
Be careful.

418
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:58,930
Good luck!

419
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,390
Got it.

420
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:03,130
Your Highness.

421
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:05,410
Everyone in the palace has gone to
Nanshan hunting ground.

422
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:06,870
Why are you here

423
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:08,420
moping about by yourself?

424
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,760
Why should I go?

425
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:12,790
I don't want to watch
that lovey-dovey couple.

426
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,230
Since you no longer have feelings
for Duke Su,

427
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:17,110
you should at least go out for a walk.

428
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:19,350
You might meet someone better.

429
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:22,390
Who says I don't have feelings
for Duke Su?

430
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,660
As long as Fu Rong is not his wife,

431
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:27,230
I will not give up.

432
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,250
Duke Su.

433
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,800
I'll become your wife.

434
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:33,830
Lousy Fu Rong!

435
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:36,200
Lousy Fu Rong!

436
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,140
You're a bookkeeper now.

437
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:46,030
How could you make such a blunder?

438
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:47,510
What do you mean?

439
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:51,110
The floral band only has value
if it's given to someone.

440
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:53,160
Holding it in your hand is a waste

441
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:54,500
and a blunder.

442
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:57,460
If you don't have anyone to give it to,

443
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:58,900
you can give it to me.

444
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,620
If you want a floral band,

445
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:08,850
I have one here.

446
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:10,780
Yes, I do want a floral band.

447
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:11,930
But

448
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,260
I only want hers.

449
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:16,090
I see.

450
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:18,570
Well, I hope you get what you want.

451
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:26,050
If you keep acting like this,

452
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:28,810
others might misunderstand.

453
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:37,620
Only others?

454
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,210
What about you?

455
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:51,130
Why not go all the way

456
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:53,020
and put it on my hand?

457
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:29,230
May you complete the trial safely.

458
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:30,570
You only want me

459
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:32,320
to safely complete the trial?

460
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:35,300
What's more important than your safety?

461
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:39,350
You're right. Don't worry. I'll be safe.

462
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,970
I haven't even married yet.

463
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:42,110
I mustn't get hurt.

464
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,400
Don't worry.

465
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:47,110
I'm not worried.

466
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,810
Keep your eyes on me.

467
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:50,530
Not on the others.

Not bad, young man.

Of course.

00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:23,200
or Consort Duan.

516
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:30,410
What do you mean?

517
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:33,800
I happened to be busy the other day

518
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:36,350
when you wanted to enter the palace.

519
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,520
Aunt.

520
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:41,500
About Feng Lai Yi,

521
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,360
are you just going to let it be?

522
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:47,090
I saw that your heart wasn't in it,

523
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,780
so I took care of the business for you.

524
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:51,710
That's all.

525
00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:53,120
I did it

526
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:56,110
in your best interest.

527
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:57,660
Was overriding my seal

528
00:36:57,750 --> 00:36:59,410
and stealing from the shop

529
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,230
in my best interest as well?

530
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:09,090
Bai Qi.

531
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:12,040
Why are you

532
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,590
still so immature?

533
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,540
If it weren't for me,

534
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:21,310
Wardrobe Service wouldn't have engaged
Feng Lai Yi for its services.

535
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:22,770
Girls all over the country

536
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:25,680
wouldn't have jumped on the bandwagon.

537
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:27,520
Instead of thanking me,

538
00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:32,100
you're reprimanding me over
a little pocket change.

539
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:34,740
Isn't that ridiculous?

540
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:37,780
Harsh words indeed,

541
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:39,450
my dear aunt.

542
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:42,000
If I cared about money,

543
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,610
would I have been so indifferent
about Feng Lai Yi?

544
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:47,680
Would I have sent money

545
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:50,400
to the palace every month?

546
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:55,770
Who's the one

547
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:59,910
caring about pocket change now?

548
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:03,870
Wu Bai Qi.

549
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:07,300
Please know your place

550
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,410
and who you're talking to.

551
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:11,610
I'm not obligated to tell you

552
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:16,490
everything that goes on in Feng Lai Yi.

553
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:24,810
I have a competition to win.

554
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,610
I must go now.

555
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:29,520
Please do not get angry

556
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:31,180
for the sake of your health.

557
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:44,590
Little Marquis is usually so immature.

558
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,940
But today he looks rather impressive.

559
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:52,000
Don't talk nonsense.

560
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:53,790
Concubine Rong.

561
00:38:53,850 --> 00:38:56,440
These are the honey date cakes
from Duke An.

562
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:07,490
Little Follower is quite thoughtful.

563
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:12,280
Try some, Your Highness.

564
00:39:12,370 --> 00:39:13,900
-Your Highness.
-Try some?

565
00:39:14,330 --> 00:39:15,350
Who gave this to you?

566
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:16,640
Duke An.

567
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,220
Do you want to try some?

568
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,180
I don't like sweet things.

569
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:23,150
More for me, then.

570
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:32,580
You're not allowed to accept gifts

571
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:33,980
from other men.

572
00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:46,030
I've asked around, Your Highness.

573
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:48,450
Our horse is the strongest one of all.

574
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:50,960
I'm confident that we will win.

575
00:39:51,310 --> 00:39:52,620
We just need

576
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:53,910
to be wary of him.

577
00:39:57,590 --> 00:39:59,540
Just keep an eye on them.

578
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,300
This time...

579
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:09,130
Wu Bai Qi.

580
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:11,700
Your Highness.

581
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:13,330
The competition is about to start.

582
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:15,250
Why do you look unsettled?

583
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:19,710
I'm thinking about the fastest way
to reach the finishing line.

584
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:21,050
Speed may be important,

585
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:22,860
but safety is the priority.

586
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:28,230
Things are complicated in Huxiao Camp.

587
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:32,710
Someone may not want you
to become the Valiant General.

588
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:35,970
You'll meet many obstacles later.

589
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,610
As you watch out for obstacles,

590
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:41,110
be aware of your surroundings too.

591
00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:43,000
Be careful of ambush.

592
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:44,100
I got it.

593
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:46,370
Thank you for reminding, Your Highness.

594
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:47,940
Good.

595
00:40:48,350 --> 00:40:49,560
Your Highness.

596
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:51,980
What are you holding?

597
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:57,090
I brought this for you.

598
00:40:57,370 --> 00:40:59,330
-For me?
-No, I mean...

599
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:01,360
For your horse.

600
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:04,880
This will give your horse energy
and make it

601
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,110
run faster.

602
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:08,460
May you become the Valiant General.

603
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:09,610
Here.

604
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:10,950
Take it.

605
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:13,280
Remember to feed this to your horse.

606
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:25,680
What a coincidence.

607
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:27,230
Where are you going?

608
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:30,830
Are you going where I'm going?

609
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:34,260
There are too many people here.

610
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:36,420
If you want to talk to me,

611
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:38,380
we can go together.

612
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:39,430
That's great.

613
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:40,580
That's great.

614
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:43,590
I didn't expect Duke Su to be like that
in private.

615
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,710
-Sister, my stomach hurts.
-What's wrong?

616
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:54,980
I'll be right back.

617
00:41:55,070 --> 00:41:56,870
Lan Xiang, you should accompany her.

618
00:41:56,870 --> 00:41:59,210
No. Don't come along.
I'll be back soon.

619
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:03,660
-Be careful.
-Alright, I will.

620
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:09,030
Look at this scenery.

621
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:10,510
It's really delightful.

622
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:13,220
What a beautiful day.

623
00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:17,780
The kind of day even the gods would envy.

624
00:42:18,390 --> 00:42:21,860
If you look down on my past

625
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:23,620
and see me as your plaything,

626
00:42:24,310 --> 00:42:25,380
I would rather

627
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:28,490
be killed by the beasts in this forest.

628
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:30,280
-No...
-Your Highness.

629
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:31,750
Your Highness.

630
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:35,930
The martial arts competition
is about to begin.

631
00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:36,840
Got it.

632
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:38,330
-You...
-Your Highness.

633
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:40,100
You should go and spectate.

634
00:42:40,830 --> 00:42:42,030
I'm not feeling well.

635
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:43,300
I have to go now.

636
00:42:57,310 --> 00:42:58,580
What was the hurry?

637
00:42:59,590 --> 00:43:01,220
When am I ever late?

638
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:04,500
Let's go.
