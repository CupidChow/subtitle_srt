00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:10,389
Whenever Heaven invests a person
with great responsibilities,

00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:12,230
it first exercises his mind
with suffering

Do you understand?

What he means is...

16
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:19,410
if a kite wants to soar above the skies,

17
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,430
it first has to overcome some obstacles

18
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:22,980
For example

19
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,579

20
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:33,860

00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:05,370
Have a cup of tea

342
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,730
How did you know it's me?

343
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,710
Why wouldn't I?

344
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:18,430
Why are you dressed like this?

345
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:21,380
I heard...

346
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:24,350
Farmer Ju Shui's Yuedan Commentary
is really famous

347
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:26,150
I just want to join in the fun

348
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,290
Could you get an invitation for me?

349
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,430
Why have you become...

350
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,860
Farmer Ju Shui's admirer, just like Yuan?

351
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,490
No, I'm not

352
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:36,210
I'm just curious...

353
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,730
about Mr Ju Shui
who's admired by thousands

354
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:42,450
Master, you have to help me

355
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:44,220
But I have one condition

356
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,590
Ms Fu Xuan has always been reliable

357
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:48,790
You need to go with her

358
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,020
I will

359
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,210
Why hasn't Mr Ju Shui come out yet?

360
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,540
I've been waiting forever for him

361
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:05,340
-Look.
-Fu Xuan, you look great

362
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:18,090
What is taking Mr Ju Shui so long?

363
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:19,440
[Qi Ce, prosecutor,

-Rong
-Brother Qi

366
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:30,920
What a small world

367
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,480
The staff gave me
an invitation to see Farmer Ju Shui

368
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:36,490
Today is my off day
I have some free time, so I came to see

369
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:39,130
Had I known you were interested,

370
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,620
then...

371
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:42,510
I would've invited you along

372
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:47,160
Nothing wrong with a chance encounter

373
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,920
Since you're here, just join us

374
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:49,920
Sure,

375
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,230
I'd be glad to

376
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:06,050
Xuan,

377
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:08,800
what do you think of
the concept of this painting?

378
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,550
It seems to be real yet vague

379
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,900
It appears to be empty,

380
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:13,750
yet the undercurrent is surging

381
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:15,510
It looks just like a fairyland

382
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:16,670
Rong'er,

383
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,110
what do you think?

384
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,040
Rong'er?

385
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:21,230
Xuan,

386
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,580
when Rong'er was speaking,
you were captivated by the painting

387
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:26,110
-I guess you didn't hear her
-Where did she go?

388
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:27,560
She said this is her first time here

389
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,790
She's curious,

390
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,740
so she'll walk around

391
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,060
Don't worry

392
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:34,280
All the buildings nearby
belong to the hall

393
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,480
She...

394
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,980
will be fine

395
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:39,190
Miss, what can I do for you?

396
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:40,310
May I ask...

397
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,610
how often do you clean the hall?

398
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:45,050
There are people
who'd clean the hall everyday

399
00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:47,010
If you see any dirty spots,

400
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:48,350
I'll get someone to clean up

401
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:50,060
That's not it

402
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,400
I noticed some cobwebs on the beam,

403
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,080
that's why I asked

404
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:56,040
The ceiling of the hall is too high

405
00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:57,860
The servants can't reach it

406
00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:01,240
So we clean it with a ladder
at the end of every year

407
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,260
I see

408
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,620
I see That will be all

409
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:05,900
Yes

410
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:15,100
-Mr Wen
-Master Wang

411
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,540
Someone's waiting for me

412
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:18,650
I have to go

413
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:19,900

[Farmer Ju Shui]

415
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,280
Who is this gentleman?

416
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,750
He is so dashing

417
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:29,970
I have no idea either

418
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,870
Could he be Prince Su?

419
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,600
I heard he had just returned...

420
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,000
to the capital from a campaign

421
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,220
Is that true?

422
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:37,910
How is that possible?

423
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:41,050
Duke Su never shows himself in public.
Why would he be here?

424
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:42,570
But he does look sophisticated

425
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:44,360
-Yes
-Exactly

[Shen Chen, scholar, Jizhou]

00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:12,620
I'd like to hear your feedback

437
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:17,630
Mister

438
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:19,610
The implication of your poem...

439
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:20,760
is impeccable

440
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:23,400
It puts the readers in a blissful state

441
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,160
Thank you, mister

442
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:26,870
I rate it second grade

443
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:29,760
-Second grade?
-Only second grade?

444
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,810
-Second grade?
-I've read that poem as well

445
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,770
I didn't expect it to be
only second grade

446
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:36,120
Mister, you praised it,

447
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:37,650
yet you only gave it second grade

448
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:38,930
Why is that so?

449
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:41,210
I guess you haven't read...

450
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:42,930
"Crusade in the North" by Duke Su

451
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:45,390
Duke Su fights at the frontier
all year round

452
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:47,380
Does His Highness write poems too?

453
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,620
That's right

454
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,780
Duke Su has always kept a low profile

455
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:54,680
In the poem, Duke Su led his army
in a campaign up north

456
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,660
When Duke Su passed by Gan Quan Temple,

457
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:58,120
His Highness lamented...

458
00:30:58,430 --> 00:31:00,140
that Buddha blessed all beings,

459
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:02,860
but not the warriors who died in battle

460
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:04,570
Just a few sentences...

461
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:07,860
are enough to make people feel like
they're in the desert,

462
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:11,400
listening to the wind rustling,

463
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,030
but smelling...

464
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,360
the scent of a candle

465
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:17,560
Your poem has portrayed your intention

466
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:20,050
Your word-play is impressive

467
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:23,190
However, it lacks passion

468
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,300
Hence, a second grade

469
00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:29,090

00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:56,630
I'm fine
But you reminded me of an old friend

503
00:34:57,570 --> 00:34:59,900
Your old friend likes climbing walls too?

504
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,560
Well, I have something to do
I have to go now

505
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:09,210
There's a bamboo grove over there

506
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:11,630
Pass through it
and you'll see an alley

Thank you, mister

509
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:17,480
Till the next time

510
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,860
We'll meet again if we're destined to

511
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:28,300
Mister,

512
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:30,460
the front hall has been taken care of

513
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:32,440
Duke Su has returned safely

514
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:33,950
The beam incident...

515
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,700
is definitely not an accident

516
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:38,600
It almost hit Duke Su

517
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,320
Keep this in mind

518
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,570
Ju Shui Pavilion...

519
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:44,010
must never be involved
in the court's disputes

520
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:45,730
Look into this matter

521
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,080
Find out...

522
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:48,580
if it has anything to do...

523
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:50,300
with the people in this pavilion

524
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,560
If you find the vandal,

525
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:52,570
expel him

526
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:53,780
Yes

527
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:58,930
One more thing

528
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,600
Help me find out...

529
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,490
about the girl just now

530
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:04,250
Sure

531
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:09,260
Miss, you're finally back

532
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:10,920
Your sister is worried sick

533
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:12,290
Rong'er,

534
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:14,200
where have you gone?

535
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:17,860
Brother Qi and I were looking all over
Ju Shui Pavilion for you

536
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:20,680
I left the pavilion...

537
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:22,290
and lost my way
in a bamboo grove

538
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:23,900
I barely made it out

539
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:26,760
If you were back any later,

540
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:29,260
I'd have asked Father and Mother
to search for you

541
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:31,820
Fu Xuan, what I did was wrong

542
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:33,660
It won't happen again

543
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,710
Fu Rong is just playful

544
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,160
Perhaps

545
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,930
Brother Qi, thank you for helping

546
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:44,860
It's getting dark

547
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:48,050
Rong'er and I are going to have a talk

548
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:50,470
Sure

549
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,490
Till we meet again

550
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:02,770
Don't be angry

551
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:04,290
The angrier you are,

552
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,940
the sadder I am

553
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:08,070
It's my fault for going off on my own

554
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,150
You can punish me by...

555
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:13,040
grounding me for the night

556
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,580
Sleeping is grounding now?

557
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:20,240
Anyway, I'm off to my punishment

558
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:33,240
[Have you heard?]

559
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:34,690
[The prince's new wife...]

560
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:37,010
[is forced to marry him
because she lost her entire family]

561
00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:38,400
[Of course I've heard]

562
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:42,100
[Her father was beheaded, sister died
in childbirth, brother died prematurely]

563
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:43,690
[She's a jinx]

564
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,370
It was a dream

565
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:11,540
It was a dream

566
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,660
Miss, are you awake?

567
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:19,460
Master has returned

568
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:25,530
Okay

569
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:34,200
Father, Mother, Fu Xuan

570
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:37,750
Father,

571
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:40,970
were you implicated
by the incident in Ju Shui Pavilion?

572
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,390
Luckily this time,

573
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:45,640
there was no casualty

574
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:48,100
It was merely a false alarm

575
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,550
But,

576
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:53,200
this case is not as simple as it seems

577
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:55,620
The person...

578
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:57,820
that the beam almost hit...

579
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,330
was Duke Su

580
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:02,580
-Duke Su?
-Duke Su?

581
00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:04,380
Duke Su?

582
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:07,870
The accident...

583
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:11,270
was likely an attempt
to assassinate Duke Su

584
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:13,880
Thanks to God's blessing,

585
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,860
Duke Su managed to survive

586
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:17,450
That explains it

587
00:39:17,570 --> 00:39:19,210
So that's what happened

588
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:21,540
Explain what?

589
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:25,510
I mean,

590
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,630
it all makes sense

591
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,360
Of all times,

592
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:30,850
the beam fell during
the Yuedan Commentary

593
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:32,910
But Father,

594
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,630
wasn't Duke Su away on a campaign?

595
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:38,300
Why would someone harm him
as soon as he's returned?

596
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:40,020
This is a royal affair

597
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:42,610
It's not something we can speculate

598
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,950
I've been working all night

599
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,370
I'm tired

600
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:49,650
I'll take a rest in my room

601
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:53,130
Help yourselves

602
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:02,190
Rong'er

603
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:05,470
Father is fine now

604
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,470
Why do you seem dejected?

605
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:08,910
Sister,

606
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,600
has this ever happened to you?

607
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,420
The more you fear something,

608
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:14,170
the more likely it is to happen

609
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:16,840
Even if it had,

610
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,190
it was probably a coincidence,
not some miracle

611
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:27,620
I guess I should be careful

612
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:31,940
What are you mumbling to yourself about?

613
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:33,980
Fu Xuan,

614
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:38,290
Father said the case has been handed over
to the prosecutor

615
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:41,260
Isn't Brother Qi, whom you were
seeing off yesterday,

616
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:44,170
the prosecutor from the
Criminal Investigation Bureau?

617
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:45,180
Could you please

618
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:46,700
No way

619
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:50,280
The case is none of our business

620
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,970
Eat up

621
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:56,620
Let's eat
