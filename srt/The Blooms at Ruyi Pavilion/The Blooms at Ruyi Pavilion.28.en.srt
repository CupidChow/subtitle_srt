[Episode 28]

4
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,530
Don't.

5
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05,550
It took you so long to
get the base into shape.

6
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:07,450
You'll have to redo it now.

7
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,270
This is all my fault, just punish me.

8
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:13,340
That's enough.

9
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:16,200
This is not the time to
hold anyone responsible.

10
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,740
What should we do now?

11
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:20,290
If only Ms Liu was here.

12
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:21,990
Master.

13
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,280
Do you remember master
had given me a coronet before?

14
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,260
She must have kept the base of it.

15
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,579
We can put the jewellery
we made earlier on the base.

16
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,690
Use shell pearl pieces as flower petals.

17
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:40,800
Make it into something like a lotus crown.

18
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:01,920
I used to think Ruyi Pavilion was
keeping its light under a bushel.

19
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:05,300
Turned out it simply relied on
these fancy knick-knacks

20
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,930
to grab people's attention.

21
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:08,780
However,

22
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:10,940
look at its work.

23
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:15,030
It's quite similar to
our Feng Lai Yi's crafts.

24
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:18,800
Speaking of which,

25
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,960
I've gone through a lot of
trouble to learn this skill.

26
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,630
I wonder where did
you learn it from, Mr Ji?

27
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:27,790
I had...

28
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,590
I got some help of course.

29
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:31,710
It seems that

30
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:35,310
Ruyi Pavilion's metal craftsmanship
is more refined.

31
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,810
Its mother-of-pearl inlay
is more delicate as well.

32
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:42,410
Although there are many pearls,
gold and silver on the crown,

33
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:44,260
it's luxurious but not garish.

34
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:49,570
At first glance,

35
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,290
the crown resembles a flower.

36
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:55,329
Your Majesty, that is right.

37
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:58,630
Your Majesty has written a poem before
to praise the virtue of lotus flower.

38
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:01,050
Therefore, I use spiral shells as base,

39
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,200
gold threads for its side,

40
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,790
silver threads to hold it,

41
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:05,930
pearls as embellishment.

42
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:07,060
Layers over layers.

43
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,030
Every layer of the petals

44
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:11,120
represent the officials
and the civilians of Dayu.

45
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,850
The biggest pearl in the middle

46
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,250
represent Dayu.

47
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:16,180
Under the efforts of Your Majesty
and all people,

48
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,550
may Dayu long live and

49
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,920
its reign long lasting.

50
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,130
That's very thoughtful of you.

51
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:27,090
And you spoke wisely.

52
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,530
Ornaments Attendant Chen,

53
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:32,860
bring it closer, I want
to take a good look.

54
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,490
Yes.

55
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:55,560
How dare you, Fu Rong.

56
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,030
You've got nerve to fool His Majesty

57
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:01,450
with a cheap pearl.

58
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,540
You sounded so vehement just now.

59
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:07,790
Or were you being sarcastic?

60
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,380
[Your Highness.]

61
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:22,670
[Consort Duan asked to see you]

62
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:23,810
[in the Tong Xi Palace.]

63
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:26,980
[Your Highness, I need to deliver these
jewellery to the Wardrobe Service.]

64
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:29,490
[Never mind, I'll deliver it for you.]

65
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:30,980
-[But...]
-[Consort Duan's request]

66
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:32,130
[is more important.]

67
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:33,180
[Go now.]

68
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,900
[I didn't expect Fu Rong would
change the design last minute.]

69
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,250
Fortunately, I have a backup plan.

70
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,100
Your Majesty, Your Highness,

71
00:05:57,409 --> 00:05:59,670
I have picked the finest pearl
of the East Sea.

72
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:00,770
With my utmost honesty,

73
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:02,480
it's impossible that there
is any cheap material.

74
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,410
Then how did this pearl turn black?

75
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:07,970
It was still glowing when
I entered the palace.

76
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,620
Your Majesty, may I take a look at it?

77
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:12,250
Give it to her.

78
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:13,730
Yes.

79
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,650
Your Majesty, Your Highnesses,

80
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:40,050
I'm sorry for being late.

81
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,520
What's going on?

82
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:48,120
Did Concubine Rong make trouble again?

83
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,680
You're just in time, Your Highness.

84
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,940
May I borrow the hairpin
that you're wearing right now?

85
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:57,310
You can't possibly want to
take back a gift that you gave me.

86
00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:00,570
Rest assured, Your Highness.
I just want to borrow it.

87
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,660
Thank you, Your Highness.

88
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:16,720
Your Majesty, could I ask a court
lady to get me some hot water?

89
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:17,990
Granted.

90
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,250
Why?

91
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:41,210
Your Majesty,

92
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,200
if a pearl isn't properly kept,

93
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:45,060
it would easily lose its natural colour.

94
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,860
When I was inspecting the pearl,

95
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,320
I noticed a pungent scent.

96
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,160
Probably because it was
accidentally exposed to silver nitrate .

97
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,410
That's why it turned
black in such short time.

98
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:54,300
All jewellery in Ruyi Pavilion

99
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:57,330
are coated with protective layer
to prevent them from turning dark.

100
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:58,790
Whereas for this crown,

101
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:01,650
it wasn't coated yet as
we ran out of time.

102
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:07,450
So you mean the protective layer
on my hairpin

103
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:10,010
was washed out by you just now?

104
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:13,070
In that case,

105
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:15,430
wouldn't my hairpin turn yellow faster?

106
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,340
I'll make it up to you with more hairpins.

107
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:21,360
Fascinating.

108
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:25,180
I'm committed to making jewellery to the
liking of Your Majesty and Your Highness.

109
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:27,880
Hence I'll never use any
shoddy material to fool anyone.

110
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,930
Though I'm guilty for my negligence,

111
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:31,820
please forgive me, Your Majesty.

112
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,040
All right.

113
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:40,580
You may rise.

114
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,220
Thank you, Your Majesty.

115
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:50,480
This lotus crown is truly spectacular.

116
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:54,100
Ruyi Pavilion shows
great originality in its design.

117
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:57,170
It is fitting that they build
the silver building.

118
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:58,930
Fu Rong,

119
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:01,430
you have a special identity.

120
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,330
Once you take this job,

121
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:05,930
you must be committed to it from now on.

122
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,950
Do not make any more mistake.

123
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:09,450
Yes.

124
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,880
I wonder if Ji Qing Ting
did it on purpose,

125
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,310
or was it just an accident?

126
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:22,200
Such coincidental accident doesn't exist.

127
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,970
I made Feng Lai Yi to present their work

128
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:26,170
before Ruyi Pavilion on purpose

129
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:29,250
so that Fu Rong will be
accused of plagiarism.

130
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,230
By right,

131
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,330
Zhu'er,

132
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:34,350
your plan was perfect.

133
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:36,020
The only thing that went wrong

134
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:38,710
must be the part that
involved Ji Qing Ting.

135
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,770
I have to

136
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:44,160
look into Ji Qing Ting.

137
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:47,330
But I couldn't figure out

138
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:49,790
why Fu Rong would change

139
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:52,250
the design of the crown all of sudden.

140
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,170
Fu Rong

141
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:59,550
is an eyesore and the thorn in my flesh.

142
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,800
Don't worry, my lady.

143
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,390
I have another plan.

144
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,560
Perhaps I'll be able to

145
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:12,640
remove this thorn of yours.

146
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,880
I'm listening.

147
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,880
[Ju Shui Pavilion ]

148
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:30,950
You're in a good mood today, Young Master.

149
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:34,800
Of course.

150
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:38,120
I'm pleased because Nong Nong
is out of trouble.

151
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:42,770
However,

152
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:44,620
Consort Duan definitely won't

153
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,950
let her off easily after this.

154
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,760
Send some men to keep
watch over Ruyi Pavilion.

155
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,130
Inform me immediately

156
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:53,390
if anything goes wrong.

157
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:55,310
Yes.

158
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:09,530
Mother asked me to tell you

159
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:11,100
Zhi Hui has found that

160
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,950
the maid who delivered
the jewellery that day

161
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:15,480
was stopped by
Princess Consort of Qingping.

162
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:17,880
Consort Duan won't give up easily.

163
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:19,640
-His Majesty has given his decree.
-Maybe...

164
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,570
There is no room for change in this.

165
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:24,610
Don't worry, Your Highness.

166
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,910
I will just focus on my duty.

167

Thank you, Your Highness.

I'll have to count on you to
take care of them from now on.

00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:40,780
It'd be my pleasure.

343

It's been so long. What's the situation?

344

We haven't heard a word
yet after waiting for so long.

We've been waiting
for so long, seriously.

-What is the situation now?
-Please settle down.

-What's the situation now?
-What's going on?

348
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,410
Thank you for all your
support over the past few days.

349
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:56,490
However, the vacancies in
Ruyi Pavilion have been filled.

350
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:58,550
-Filled?
-Please go home, everyone.

351
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:00,010
We've waited for a few days,

352
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:01,990
and we didn't see you
picking any one of us.

353
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:03,600
And you're just going to
send us away like this?

354
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,070
That means Ruyi Pavilion
was just deceiving us, right?

355
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:06,870
That's right.

356
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,380
-You cheated us. Give us an explanation.
-If Her Highness

357

doesn't give us an explanation today,

That's right, we're not leaving.

360
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,750
-Yes, sit down.
-Sit down, everyone.

361
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:19,980
What?

362

If it hadn't been for the assassins,

I'm afraid our scout wouldn't have

Her Highness has recruited artisans.

They were asked to leave,

380

but they refused to do so.

Nothing to be afraid of.

Nothing to be afraid of.

383
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:58,480
So what if he's a duke.

384
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,930
Does that mean he can just bully us?

[Ruyi Pavilion]

Sure.

this piece is made of white jade.

397

-Agree.
-That's right. It's made of white jade.

Wrong.

That's impossible.

-And it's smooth when you touch it.
-Yes, we can see that at a glance.

Feng Lai Yi is the only thing

that my sister left for
me before she died.

That's why I couldn't bear
to give Feng Lai Yi away.

437
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:36,570
But as I've been living in the palace,

438
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:38,900
I could only entrust the
management of Feng Lai Yi

00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:45,280
You're here at this late hour.

502
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:47,840
Tell me, what happened?

503
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:52,330
Ji Qing Ting deliberately
hindered Ruyi Pavilion's duty

504
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:53,740
in making jewellery for the royals.

505
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:54,970
He is now in jail.

506
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,330
However,

507
00:28:56,770 --> 00:28:58,750
Feng Lai Yi has been seized as well.

508
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:01,080
Really?

509
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,590
Didn't Consort Duan make a scene?

510
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:07,590
Not only did she not, she actually
asked the matter to be dealt strictly.

511
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:10,940
Looks like Consort Duan
really believed that

512
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:12,740
Ji Qing Ting has come to our side.

513
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,360
This move of Consort Duan has killed
two birds with one stone.

514
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,690
Not only did she get rid of Ji Qing Ting,

515
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:22,090
but she also won His Majesty's approval.

516
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,090
However,

517
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,260
Feng Lai Yi has been shut down.

518
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:29,760
What about you?

519
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:32,060
Never mind.

520
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:34,430
I'll ask to see Consort Duan after a while

521
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:35,770
to see if I can offer to

522
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,510
to buy Feng Lai Yi from her.

523
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:41,190
I'll still have to count on
you on the ledgers by then.

524
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:47,410
I don't think

525
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:50,230
Consort Duan will let this
matter go that easily.

526
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:05,940
The craftsmanship of these
jewellery is truly intricate.

527
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:07,080
Excellent.

528
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:08,840
Thank you, Your Highness.

529
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,900
This is all good.

530
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,210
Later today,

531
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,620
I'll ask Ornaments Attendant Chen

532
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:14,620
to distribute them to the chambers.

533
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,060
Yes.

534
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,960
Rong'er, go home now and rest.

535
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,170
Look how skinny you've become.

536
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:24,050
You've worked hard these days.

537
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:26,570
It is an honour to serve His Majesty
and Your Highness.

538
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:28,160
An honour indeed.

539
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,000
These hard work are nothing to you.

540
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,850
Since you could gain
something from it.

541
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:34,270
Am I right, Concubine Rong?

542
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:37,530
Also,

543
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:40,040
Consort Shu has been
doing everything herself

544
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:42,980
for such trivial matter.

545
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:47,340
There is something
shady behind this, isn't it?

546
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:51,390
What do you mean by this, Consort Duan?

547
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,590
Ornaments Attendant Chen.

548
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:01,200
Concubine Rong,

549
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,530
my words carry little weight.

550
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:08,060
But you misappropriated the
jewellery materials from Wardrobe Service.

551
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:09,340
If I didn't report it,

552
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,630
I wouldn't be able to live
with my conscience.

553
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:12,900
Ornaments Attendant Chen,

554
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,400
what nonsense are you talking about?

555
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,540
Consort Shu,

556
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:17,830
I know you adore Concubine Rong,

557
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:19,800
but she has committed

558
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:21,760
a crime of deceiving His Majesty.

559
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:23,420
Ornaments Attendant Chen,

560
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:25,180
you're slandering me
for deceiving His Majesty.

561
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:27,070
Have you ever thought
about the consequences?

562
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:29,400
I wouldn't dare to slander Your Highness.

563
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:31,420
If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes,

564
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,860
it was really appalling.

565
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,330
Fine.

566
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,840
You said I misappropriated the materials.

567
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:41,970
Where is your proof?

568
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:44,100
The proof

569
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:46,650
is this handover document.

570
00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:54,700
[Ruyi Pavilion Stamp]

Ruyi Pavilion Stamp]

573
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:11,600
Judging by your expression,

574
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:14,620
could you be thinking of
destroying the evidence?

575
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:16,440
Rong'er,

576
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:19,720
it was indeed Ruyi Pavilion's
stamp on the document.

577
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:23,080
Although the stamp is real,

578
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:27,570
these numbers are completely different
from those I read during the handover.

579
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:30,120
His Majesty has arrived.

580
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:39,890
You may rise.

581
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,860
Thank you, Your Majesty.

582
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,810
Consort Duan,

583
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,710
what's going on?

584
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:48,290
Your Majesty,

585
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:50,490
Ornaments Attendant Chen found that

586
00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:53,000
Ruyi Pavilion has misappropriated
the materials from Wardrobe Service.

587
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,950
I'm questioning Concubine Rong.

588
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,970
Is it true?

589
00:32:58,370 --> 00:33:00,230
Please take a look, Your Majesty.

590
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,190
I've checked just now.

591
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:05,010
There is indeed a huge difference
between the amount of the jewellery

592
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:07,340
and the numbers on the handover document.

can prove my innocence.

600

Yes, Your Majesty.

603
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:30,750
Yes, Your Majesty.

604
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,440

I wouldn't dare to tamper with
the materials from the palace.

there is no reason for
me to get involved in it.

with Emperor Jia He for Nong Nong.

into an argument for sure.

Consort Duan has always been a fool.

Someone must be giving
her advice behind this.

Find that person.

662

Yes.

664
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:24,690
Thank you for your help this time.

665
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:28,280
Not only did you get rid of
that obnoxious Ruyi Pavilion,

666
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:31,850
but Mao'er and I made
quite a fortune as well.

667
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:34,920
It's because you're foresighted,
Your Highness.

668
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:37,620
Speaking of which, Zhu'er,

669
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:41,750
the batch of materials from the palace
has been delivered to Weiyang City.

670
00:37:43,610 --> 00:37:45,140
Ornaments Attendant Chen,

671
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:47,920
thank you for your help.

672
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:50,600
Don't worry, once everything ends,

673
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:52,710
I'll reward you

674
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,570
everything you deserve.

675
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:57,690
Thank you, Your Highness.

676
00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:07,460
Duke Cheng have kept
those material well hidden.

677
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:09,140
Don't worry, Your Highness.

678
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:13,120
Things are going to get heated
in Duke Su's Residence now.

679
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:18,450
Let's just wait and see.

680
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:53,560
I'm going to avenge Ms Liu.

681
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:12,120
The Ms Liu you're talking about,

682
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,670
is it Liu Ru Yi?

683
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,140
I didn't kill Liu Ru Yi.

684
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:30,040
Who else could it be if it wasn't you?

685
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,140
Ms Gu said that

686
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:32,900
you were the last person to meet Ms Liu.

687
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:34,920
And you had an argument with her.

688
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,390
Rong'er found Ms Liu's suicide note

689
00:39:37,690 --> 00:39:39,810
in the secret room of Ruyi Pavilion.

690
00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:41,920
You're saying that she committed suicide?

691
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:42,890
Impossible.

692
00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:44,780
Mistress had poured her
heart and soul into Ruyi Pavilion.

693
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:47,150
There's no way she would kill herself
irresponsibly.

694
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:49,840
I don't believe Ms Liu
would commit suicide too.

695
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,760
You're calling her mistress

696
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,300
and you want to avenge her.

697
00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:56,980
What's your relationship with Liu Ru Yi?

698
00:39:57,390 --> 00:39:58,770
We owed her a debt of gratitude.

699
00:39:58,770 --> 00:40:00,700
It's only right that we avenge her.

700
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,500
If you were just ordinary men,

701
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,960
why would someone want to hunt you down?

702
00:40:07,090 --> 00:40:08,220
If you don't tell me,

703
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:10,530
I won't be able to help

704
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:14,030
nor find out Liu Ru Yi's
real cause of death.

705
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:16,540
This has nothing to do with Ms Liu.

706
00:40:16,910 --> 00:40:19,110
I'll believe you for now.

707
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:21,600
About the death of Ms Liu,

708
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,540
we'll find out ourselves.

709
00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:26,440
-Good bye.
-Good bye.

710
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,450
Send someone to watch them.

711
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:36,610
Yes.

712
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:55,570
Your Highness, you're finally home.

713
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:56,540
Ruyi Pavilion has been seized.

714
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:58,650
Her Highness has been brought to
Criminal Investigation Bureau Jail.

715
00:40:58,650 --> 00:40:59,800
What did you say?

716
00:41:37,810 --> 00:41:40,800
[Concubine Rong has been put into jail.]

717
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:44,060
[If there is any injustice in it,]

718
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:46,000
[talk to His Majesty yourself.]
