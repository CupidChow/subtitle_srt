Sir, would you like some tea?

5
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,450
We just received a fresh batch of
Baiting Tea yesterday.

6
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:46,710
You can't find it anywhere else.

7
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,580
The taste is highly desirable.

8
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:51,009
Can't find it anywhere else?

9
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:53,170
Not even the palace...

10
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:57,539
I will give it a try.

11
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:59,100

Yes, it is.

18
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:16,579
Yes.

19
00:02:16,829 --> 00:02:18,210
Please enjoy.

20
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:21,260
Here. Take a sip.

21
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:27,860
It smells good.

22

Sir, please follow me upstairs.

Duke Cheng.

24
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,630
I've heard so much about you.

25
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:49,740
This place is not soundproof.

26
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,170
What happened?

27
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:54,090
I'll ask the proprietor
to give us another room.

28
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:01,070
Do you know about
the battle at the border?

29
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:02,580
Yes, I do.

30
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,550
Your Commander in Chief has fallen.

31
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:07,500
But what does it have to do with me?

32
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:08,580
Your Highness.

33
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:12,220
He trusted Dou Yan too easily.

34
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:13,580
Moreover,

35
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:18,290
the tactical map I provided is genuine.

36
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:19,880
If it weren't for me,

37
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:22,870
you wouldn't have taken down
Zhangyang City so easily.

38
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,140
That is not the point.

39
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,150
If you had given us the tactical map

40
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:27,880
for Pingsai and Jiuli earlier,

41
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:30,750
our Commander in Chief
wouldn't have trusted Dou Yan

42
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,310
and changed our route for Pingsai.

43
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:34,230
He would have attacked
Guanyan Town directly

44
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:35,570
and taken Hezhou down.

don't you understand?

47
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:44,940
It's too late to say this now.

48
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:47,250
As long as you're sincere,

49
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:50,970
I can give you what you want.

50
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,020
Do you mean it?

51
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:59,740
But first,

52
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:01,510
we have to discuss

53
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:03,820

Yes, Your Majesty.

Go.

57
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:31,660
Arrest this rebellious son

58
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:33,420
and spy of Xuanhan.

59
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:36,810
Yes, Your Majesty.

61
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,060
Uncle San.

62

Take a seat.

63
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:52,470
His Majesty has given his orders

64
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:55,000
to punish Duke Cheng
for committing treason.

65
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:57,510
The spy of Xuanhan was also arrested
for further investigation.

66
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,700
We owe this to you, Your Highness.

67
00:04:59,909 --> 00:05:00,870
You're right.

68
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:02,540
If it weren't for her,

69
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:04,850
we wouldn’t have completed this mission
so easily.

70
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:06,550
After the incident at the hideout,

71
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:08,220
Duke Cheng never reflected on his mistake.

72
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,860
Instead, he committed treason.

73
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:13,030
He has only himself to blame

74
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:14,700
for this.

75
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,430
Since this problem has been resolved,

76
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:19,030
I shall return to Ruyi Pavilion.

77
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:20,230
If you need anything,

78
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,970
please come to Ruyi Pavilion.

79
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:24,540
I'll stay here for now.

80
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:26,790
If you know the location of Ruyi Token,

81
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:28,820
you may inform me anytime.

82
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:40,900
Her Highness is indeed a good person.

83
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:41,900
She's also smart.

84
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:44,240
No wonder she was so precious to Ms Liu.

85
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:50,659
Duke Cheng was exposed

86
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,220
because of Rong'er?

87
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:55,230
Yes. Through Zhi Hui,
she contacted Consort Shu,

88
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,110
then me.

89
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,190
His Majesty witnessed

90
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,950
Duke Cheng and the spy
of Xuanhan colluding.

91
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:00,270
That's why he was furious.

92
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:02,200
Duke Cheng was caught red-handed.

93
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:05,380
Rong'er did that all on her own?

94
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:08,130
A few other people helped her.

95
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:09,750
They were skilled fighters.

96
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:11,260
Then again,

97
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:13,680
how did she know so many skilled fighters?

98
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:18,690
Maybe they were just some
vagabonds she got to know.

99
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:21,770
You did well this time.

100
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:26,670
Marquis Xindu was also Duke Cheng's
bargaining chip.

101
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:29,300
I didn't do it entirely for Your Highness.

102
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:30,820
I did it for myself too.

103
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:34,820
Your Highness.

104
00:06:34,909 --> 00:06:36,380
I have to get going.

105
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:48,030
Even Little Marquis is suspicious

106
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:49,820
of Her Highness.

107
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:51,220
This...

108
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:53,970
Ruyi Pavilion

109
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:55,390
will be exposed soon.

110
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:59,440
I can't let Rong'er get involved in it.

111
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:00,500
In that case,

112
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:04,050
should we get Her Highness to return?

113
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:05,700
I have my own plans.

114
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:18,510
Why is the Phoenix Crown here?

115
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:21,060
Didn't you say you needed more clothes?

116
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:22,830
So I went back
to Duke Su's Residence

117
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:24,300
to get them for you.

118
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:27,740
Since this Phoenix Crown was a gift
from Ms Liu to you,

119
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:29,550
I thought you'd miss it dearly.

120
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:30,950
So I brought it back here.

121
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:58,540
Say...

122
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:01,950
I almost forgot that I have some matters
to attend to.

123
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:02,940
I need to go out.

124
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:04,430
Guard the Phoenix Crown.

125
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:05,660
Guard it well.

126
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:06,980
Yes, I will.

127
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,950
Lan Xiang, I have an urgent matter
to attend to.

128
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:11,940
I have to go now.

129
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:16,540
Why is everyone so busy?

130
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:21,260
I still can't figure out

131
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:23,470
the meaning behind this lotus symbol.

132
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:25,600
But I'm certain that my master drew it

133
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:27,660
and hid it in the Phoenix Crown.

134
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,930
What was she trying to tell me?

135
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:34,890
This lotus might be referring to
Lotus Village.

136
00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:39,309
Ms Liu once disappeared for some time.

137
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:41,770
We thought she was dead.

138
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,770
But one day,

139
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:45,710
we received a secret letter from her

140
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:47,770
saying that she was in Lotus Village.

141
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,260
Where is this Lotus Village?

142
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:53,430
It's somewhere near Yun Luo Temple.

143
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:57,390
Those who're religious but cannot forsake
their worldly ties

144
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:59,070
and devote themselves to monkhood

145
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:00,580
will gather at this place

146
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:02,140
to read scriptures.

147
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:05,980
I've been to Yun Luo Temple with master
many times.

148
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:08,630
Sometimes, she would go somewhere else.

149
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:10,230
But she never mentioned Lotus Village.

150
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:11,830
Lotus Village is a hidden place.

151
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:13,270
She probably didn't tell you

152
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:14,510
because she was afraid

153
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:16,500
to get Lotus Village involved.

154
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,250
Since it's a hidden place,

155
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:23,940
could it be where she hid the token?

156
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,740
It's finally over.

157
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,130
Should I go see Ms Fu?

158

Give it to me.

163

Give what to you?

Stop acting dumb.

Do you have the stamp of Feng Lai Yi?

166
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:04,630
You must have forgotten about it,
Little Marquis.

167
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:05,980
I did have the stamp.

168
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:07,940
But didn't you ask Ms Fu

169
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,580
to take it back from me?

I know.

236

In your eyes,

237
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:35,670

I don't understand you well enough.

I'd always offend and hurt you.

Now that I think about it,

I fell in love with you

245

246

You...

247
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:01,110
Someone is here to steal the bride.

248
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:03,140
Servants, get him out of here.

249

Come back here.

250

I don't know what more I can do

251
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:20,980
to make you believe me.

252
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:22,910
But I want to tell you that

253

What is going on?

273

that Ms Fu is getting married today.

That was Mr Shen.

280

Besides,

281
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:29,980
I've made myself clear to him.

282
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:42,890
What did you tell him?

283
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,940
If you don't want to tell me,

284
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,340
just forget that I asked.

285
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:54,180
I told him that

286
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:55,860
I once thought

287
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:58,300
marriage must be arranged by parents.

288
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:00,420
But I realised later on that

289
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:04,369
I can't just get married like that

290
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:07,319
because

291
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:11,930
I have fallen in love with someone else.

292
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:26,190
You have fallen in love with someone else?

293
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:27,380
Who is that?

294
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:28,860
Do I know him?

295
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:31,060

I should have realised
where my heart lay.

301
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:02,980
It's just that

302
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,620
I've always seen myself

303
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:09,220
as a reserved person.

304
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:12,260
Moreover, I've always treated you coldly

305
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:15,980
and I'm no fun to be around.

306
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:19,280
Don't say that about yourself.

307
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:21,930
I like those traits in you.

308
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,360
I like them as long as it's you.

I'll go to Fu Residence

and ask your parents for your hand
in marriage.

His expression changed

344
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:01,070
when he heard my master's name.

345
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:03,130
So, I decided to give him the picture.

346
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:05,900
Let's just wait patiently

347
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:07,440
for him to make his move.

348
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,610
-Your Highness.
-Your Highness.

349
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:18,220
We were just talking about them.

350
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:21,930
-Your Highness.
-Your Highness.

351
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:24,390
We went through Duke Cheng's Residence.

352
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:27,740
Most of the documents and letters
are missing.

353
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:30,640
They must have been taken away.

354
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:32,140
Taken away?

355
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:36,000
Didn't we capture all of Duke Cheng's
subordinates?

356
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:38,610
I went to the prison to investigate
just now.

357
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:41,600
Duke Cheng's right hand man, Zhong Rui
was not there.

358
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:43,100
He must have fled.

359
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:44,500
He must have taken away

360
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:47,180
the documents.

361
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:51,850
These documents must be very important.

362
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:55,780
Zhong Rui has sought refuge in Xuanhan.

363
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:59,900
We'll get the spy as long as
we get Zhong Rui.

364
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:03,100
The gate is heavily guarded.

365
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,300
Zhong Rui must still be in Hengjing.

366
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:06,510
I'll get some men to search for him.

367
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,640
I'll inform you
once we find anything.

368
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:20,460
We have been searching

369
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:21,870
Zhong Rui's room for hours.

370
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:23,420
But we found nothing.

371
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:28,610
Search it thoroughly.

Ms Fu.

375
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:17,860
Bao Zhu told me

376
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:20,150
you've been pacing
up and down outside.

377
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:21,490
Why didn't you come in?

378
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:24,660
I was afraid

379
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:26,600
it would be inappropriate.

380
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:29,180
I'm surprised you know that.

381
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:33,060
Last time, you caused quite the commotion

382
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:34,780
at Mr Yao's wedding.

383
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,620
Now, you're swamping my family
with gifts.

384
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:39,990
The hall is full with your gifts now.

385
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:41,700
Is this

386
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:43,540
considered appropriate?

387
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:46,110
It's my first time proposing marriage.

388
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:47,230
I've asked many people about it.

389
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:50,090
I was told to please my prospective
father-in-law.

390
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:51,100
By the way,

391
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:52,540
where are your parents?

392
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:54,820
Did they say anything

393
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:57,450
after you went home last time?

394
00:24:57,910 --> 00:24:59,900
They went out to a dinner party.

395
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:02,620
Last time...

396
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:06,230
My father said

397
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:08,170
that I should know what I'm doing.

398
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:10,990
It's fine as long as I'm
certain of my decision.

399
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:13,420
That's great.

400
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:14,500
That's great.

401
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:18,620
You came here today just for this?

402
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:20,620
Say,

403
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:23,170
do you remember the time
you were kidnapped?

404
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:25,340
Why?

405
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:26,710
The man who kidnapped you

406
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:28,240
wasn't any old trafficker.

407
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:29,590
He was from Duke Cheng's Residence.

408
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:30,790
His name is Zhong Rui.

409
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:33,430
You must have also seen him
in the martial arts competition.

410
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:35,020
He was beside Duke Cheng.

411
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:37,820
Someone from Duke Cheng's Residence?

412
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,780
Why did he kidnap me?

413
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:43,110
I don't know either.

414
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:44,570
Zhong Rui is on the run now.

415
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:46,430
You must be more careful when you go out.

416
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:47,580
Don't go out alone.

00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:56,500
from Ru Yi?

423
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:58,140
Yes.

424
00:26:58,470 --> 00:26:59,630
Master said she made it

425
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:00,980
just for me.

[Owner of Ruyi Pavilion, Liu Ru Yi]

427
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:31,900
Ru Yi asked me to safekeep this box.

428
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:34,190
She told me, if fate permits,

429
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:37,660
I shall pass it to a person with
a Ruyi emblem bracelet.

430
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:41,970
How long ago did she

431
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:43,450
hand this to you?

432
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:46,320
A very long time ago.

433
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:50,540
She was always worried about
homeless children

434
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:53,110
running aimlessly out in the world,

435
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:54,990
unable to liberate themselves.

436
00:27:57,910 --> 00:27:59,180
The last time we met,

437
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:00,870
she wanted me to cure

438
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:02,980

439
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:05,820

He's the youngest son of Mr Dong Fang Li.

441

I've heard it from His...

443

I've heard it from a friend.

444
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:20,890
I've never thought

445
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:23,380
that Master asked you to...

446
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:28,420

that would be the last time we met.

00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:40,260

450
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,280
if she knew you care about her so much,

All that matters is you're safe.

Since your identity has been exposed,

521

639

With the help of the Valiant General,

640
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:55,240
we've made a major breakthrough
in Xu Mao's case.

641
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:57,850
More than ten subordinates
have been arrested

642
00:41:57,850 --> 00:41:59,680
and many jewellery were found.

643
00:42:00,490 --> 00:42:01,890
After questioning them,

644
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,510
we've made

645
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:07,240
some shocking discoveries
about Xu Mao's case.

646
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:18,830
Since the army ration corruption case
in Guanyan Town,

647
00:42:19,330 --> 00:42:22,370
Xu Mao has been wary that I might
discover this conspiracy.

648
00:42:22,370 --> 00:42:24,920
So he forced Qi Ce to assassinate me.

649
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:26,720
When his plan failed,

650
00:42:26,970 --> 00:42:29,500
he turned demolishing
the quarry for profit.

651
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:31,370
He used Dong Fang Li's youngest son

652
00:42:31,370 --> 00:42:34,430
to threaten Mr Dong into transporting
the explosives.

653
00:42:34,570 --> 00:42:35,600
The explosives

654
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,880
are likely linked to the landslide
on Mount Tai.

655
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:40,860
Throughout this case,

656
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:45,280
the Imperial Guards and Huxiao Camp
have done a good job.

657
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:48,040
But you must get to the bottom of it.

658
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,320
Do not leave out

659
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,000
anyone linked to the case.

660
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:58,460
Brother.

661
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,160
From my investigation,

662
00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:01,850
Xu Mao had more subordinates

663
00:43:01,850 --> 00:43:04,120
than those who were captured.

664
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:07,430
He had been in contact with a gang.

665
00:43:07,810 --> 00:43:10,680
The gang collects secrets

666
00:43:10,770 --> 00:43:12,890
in exchange for profit.

667
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:14,120
Qi Ce,

668
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:15,520
Shang Kai Yang,

669
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:16,840
Zhang Yao Cheng

670
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:18,320
and Xu Mao

671
00:43:18,650 --> 00:43:20,960
obtained secrets from the gang.

672
00:43:21,450 --> 00:43:23,510
I beg Your Majesty to investigate it.

673
00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:33,400
Your Majesty.

674
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,720
This is outrageous.

675
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:47,130
I didn't think Dayu

676
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:49,760
would still have gangs like this.

677

Duke Su.

678
00:43:52,970 --> 00:43:55,950
Why didn't you discover this?

679
00:43:58,330 --> 00:43:59,990
It was an oversight on my part.

680
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:01,720
I'll accept punishment.

681
00:44:02,010 --> 00:44:04,040
The gang members are cunning

682
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:05,310
and elusive.
