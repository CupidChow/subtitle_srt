What threats and promises
has Master brought this time?

Mr Qi,

9
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,750
there's no need to be grouchy to me.

10

I am but just a messenger by order.

13

Consort Duan...

17
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:43,910
saw a peasant girl named Qi Zhu
praying for her mother's blessings.

18
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:45,590
She kowtowed after each step.

19
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:47,350
She was deeply moved.

20
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:50,110

21
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,150
with such an act?

22

00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:00,580
You think of each other.

26
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:03,830
But, it's a pity.

27

28
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:08,190
can only save you.

29
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:10,510
Seeing that you're alone...

30
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,670
and being filial,

31
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:14,710
and I happen to...

32
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:17,740
be needing someone to serve alongside me.

33
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,040
Why don't you...

34
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:21,630
come to the palace with me?

35
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,550
When His Majesty heard of such a thing,

36
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:27,750
he praised the loyalty
and filial piety of Ms Qi.

37
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,510
She will be conferred as
Princess Consort of Qingping.

38
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:34,520
An auspicious date will be picked
for her to officially receive the title.

39
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,920
It's not all bad to be lonely and
to be taken off an engagement.

40
00:03:38,829 --> 00:03:42,940
She now has instant success as
Princess Consort of Qingping.

[Book of Confession]

to exploit officials and rich merchants

So, he thought of making the first move
to gain the upper hand.

88

That's why he sent assassins
to kill you many times.

to confer Qi Ce's younger sister
as Princess Consort of Qingping?

with the emperor late-night.

00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,150
Zhu'er,

171
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,710
do you really want to
depend on Consort Duan?

172
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:08,170
Her sudden favour upon you
must have been...

173
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:09,150
What?

174
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:10,700
Worried now?

175
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:14,190
You're worried that me
becoming Princess Consort...

176
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:17,720
with Consort Duan as my backing
will be disadvantageous to you?

177
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:20,510
You're not wrong.

178
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:23,670
After all, she's the aunt of Prince Yan.

179
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:25,270
How can you possibly not worry?

180
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:26,600
That's not what I meant.

181
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:28,970
I'm worried they'll use you and harm you.

182
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:32,230
My elder brother used his death
in exchange for my riches.

183
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:34,850
And now, you want me
to forsake everything?

184
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:36,190
Fu Rong,

185
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:38,200
my elder brother was right.

186
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:41,030
You spit kind words...

187
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:42,280
with a wicked heart.

188
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:49,510
Am I not clear enough?

189
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:52,300
I want nothing to do with you.

190
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:55,710
It's better for us not
to cross paths again.

191
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:59,200
Just take it as
we've never known each other.

192
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:31,250
Why are you here?

193
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,350
Did you save Zhu'er?

194
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:43,410
Qi Ce has himself to blame.

195
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:46,210
You don't need to feel guilty.

196
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,710
Zhu'er is pure and naive.

197
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:55,270
I'm worried that she'll be caught in
all the drama and can't get out of it.

198
00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:00,350
Oh, I forgot that
you grew up in the palace.

199
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:03,470
I didn't mean to be sarcastic
with what I've just said.

200
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:05,790
When I was twelve,

201
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:08,490
the late empress was critically ill.

202
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:09,630
My father...

203
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:12,200
sent me to Hong Fu Temple...

204
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:14,990
to copy scriptures and pray for her.

205
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:18,150
I accidentally toppled the candlestick...

206
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,630
which resulted in a fire.

207
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:23,520
Although the fire was put out quickly,

208
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:28,360
the late empress passed on
at that exact hour.

209
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:30,390
Father was furious...

210
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:32,320
and sent me to the frontier.

211
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:33,430
Since then,

212
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:36,240
I'd never returned to the capital.

213
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:41,350
But, compared to Hengjing City,

214
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:44,790
I prefer the lonely and
deserted frontier.

215
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:49,630
It's chilly here.

216
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:51,090
Let's head back, shall we?

217
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:12,590
Look at you,

218
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:13,910
you've lost more weight.

219
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:15,110
I'll feed you more.

220
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:16,870
Here.

221
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:19,750
Isn't this Mr Wen?

222
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:22,210
Don't you like what I've brought you?

223
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:23,670
Next time,

224
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:25,670
I'll bring what you like.

225
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:27,860
It's funny that...

226
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:30,190
Mr Wen talks to fishes.

227
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:35,550
Show yourself.

228
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:36,630
I saw you.

229
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:40,470
Well... Mr Wen...

230
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:43,990
I... I saw nothing.

231
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:45,630
I saw nothing.

232
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:48,360
You shall tell no one...

233
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:49,670
about this.

234
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:52,360
Alright.

235
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:53,430
I swear.

236
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:56,710
Even if I'm tortured by court officers,

237
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:58,430
I'll still keep my mouth shut

238
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:01,230
Thank you.

239
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:09,590
Little fat fish,

240
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:11,230
you've gotten fat.

241
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:14,990
Looks like you've been
fed well by Mr Wen.

242
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:19,110
Duke Su and I are childhood sweethearts.

243
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:21,480
We've been separated for decades.

244
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:23,230
And now that he's back,

245
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,480
I'm sure that he wants to see me.

246
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:27,310
The last time I came,

247
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:30,620
I accepted when you said
he was recuperating.

248
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:33,760
And this time, you're
giving me more excuses.

249
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:35,230
I tell you...

250
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:38,830
Your Highness.

251
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,610
Why is it always the both you
every time that I'm here?

252
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,790
[Cui Wan, Princess of Xihe]

253
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,360
Where is Duke Su?

254
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:47,310
His Highness is heavily wounded.

255
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:48,960
He really can't see anyone.

256
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:52,110
That bad?

257
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,740
That won't do,
all the more I should see him.

258
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:57,270
Your Highness.

259
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:00,610
I won't stop you
if you must see His Highness.

260
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:03,550
But, please hear me out as a physician.

261
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:06,500
Women are cold-natured,
therefore, possess stronger Yin.

262
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,310
With you frequenting this place,

263
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:11,310
it might delay His Highness' recuperation.

264
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:14,860
Forget about it, then.

265
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:15,950
I will not see him.

266
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:17,910
It's just that...

267
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:19,620
What's happened to Duke Su?

268
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,350
When will he be well?

269
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:24,710
Don't worry.
He's way passed the critical stage.

270
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:25,750
He just needs...

271
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,440
to recuperate in peace.

272
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,470
I understand.

273
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:32,630
Why don't you...

274
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:35,300
send men to deliver news to me...

275
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:37,150
when he's all better?

276
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:40,500
Sure. Sure.

277
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:49,690
Goodbye, Your Highness.

278
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:02,620
Is this Princess of Xihe...

279
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:05,150
really childhood sweethearts
with His Highness?

280
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:07,410
Why does His Highness keep avoiding her?

281
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:09,010
I didn't expect to see...

282
00:17:09,579 --> 00:17:12,109
such a girl who
argues noisily in the capital.

283
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:15,550
You're such a blockhead.

284
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:18,550
His Highness grew up
at the frontier.

285
00:17:18,869 --> 00:17:21,730
How would he possibly
have a childhood sweetheart?

286
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:24,730
The lady has interest,

287
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:26,190
but not His Highness.

288
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:48,030
What? Worried of something?

289
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:51,670
Besides studying,

290
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:53,730
you're also good at other things.

291
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:57,410
This was taught to me by an old friend.

292
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:59,140
An old friend?

293
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:02,620
Besides Zhu'er,

294
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,390
I don't have any close friends.

295
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:06,270
However, it was a little boy
that I rescued when I was little...

296
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:07,330
who taught me this.

297
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:10,310
Later on, his family found him
and brought him away with them.

298
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:11,910
Or else, I would have asked
my father to take him in...

299
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:14,230
to be my little footman.

300
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,140
Can you teach me a thing or two
about stone skipping?

301
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:20,470
Firstly, choose a flat stone.

302
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:26,190
How's this one?

303
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:28,550
Not bad.

304
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:32,620
Then, fling it like this.

305
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:34,190
Fling it, go!

306
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:35,820

307

00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:56,150
you're here.

338
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,560
This painting looks good.

339
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:02,830
It looks way better than the jewellery.

340
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:04,920
Thank you for the kind praise, sir.

341
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:09,830
Little Marquis, Mr Ji.

342
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:13,000
Today, new paintings are sold
at Ruyi Pavilion.

343
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:16,430
People say that the
four paintings at Ruyi Pavilion...

344
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:18,070
are similar to ours.

345
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:19,590
Really?

346
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,090
I thought they've been getting
the eldest daughter of the Fu Family...

347
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:23,290
to make word posters?

348
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:25,620
How could she do such a shameful thing?

349
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:26,750
That's right!

350
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,940
Ms Fu Xuan,

351
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:44,310
you've worked hard for the past few days.

352
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:46,310
Why don't you go home early and rest?

353
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,230
Ms Liu, you've worked hard too.

354
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,900
I wish you good sales
for the new paintings.

355
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:52,470
Thank you.

356
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:56,070
How shameless is Ruyi Pavilion!

357
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:57,470
They copied our paintings...

358
00:21:57,470 --> 00:21:59,790
even without the intention of covering...

359
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:00,670
up.

Mr Ji,

364
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,540

Ms Fu,

367
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:15,400
did you draw the four paintings?

368
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:16,890
The four paintings...

369
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,790
were drawn by me, stroke-by-stroke...

370
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:19,710
at home.

371
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:22,490
What do you mean by that question?

372
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:27,110
You copied the recommended
word posters of Feng Lai Yi.

373
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:29,590
You even copied everything...

374
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:30,910
without missing a word.

375
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:32,350
And, you still want me to explain?

376
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:33,480
I did not explain...

377
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:35,380
to save you some face.

378
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:37,220
What? Feng Lai Yi...

379
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:39,190
also has both of these paintings?

380
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:43,630
Ms Fu,

381
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:46,270
you've been giving people
the cold shoulder.

382
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:48,110
It's really an unpleasant feeling.

383
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:49,910
And now, you're displaying
hypocritical attitude.

384
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,550
It makes me miss...

385
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:53,590
that cold-shoulder look of yours.

386
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:55,880
Okay.

387
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:57,440
Fine, if you won't admit it.

388
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:58,720
Hold it right there.

389
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:00,850
You better explain this to me.

390
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:03,790
The paintings of both our families
had never been shown to the public.

391
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:06,250
Tell me, how were
the paintings duplicated?

392
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:13,590
What a coincidence,

393
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:15,150
Mister Bi Yu...

394
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:17,590
bumped into us
while holding the scrolls...

395
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:20,220
and mistakenly took
two scrolls of our paintings.

396
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,340
Coincidentally,

397
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:23,270
the two scrolls of paintings...

398
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:26,000
are indeed the ones you mentioned.

399
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:28,560
Little Marquis,
what venomous slander it is!

400
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:30,950
Bi Yu had indeed mistaken
scrolls of paintings.

401
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:32,430
But, he's never opened them...

402
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:34,310
and took them to
Ruyi Pavilion straight away.

403
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:35,390
That's right, Little Marquis.

404
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:36,750
I swear I didn't open the scrolls.

405
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:39,070
I've never seen the paintings
of the Fu Family.

406

I... My lady isn't too good at needlework.

418
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:47,090
Plus, I don't practise it regularly.

419
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:49,070
So, since it's such a good weather,

420
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:50,600
I decided to practice here.

430
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:47,830
and often use weapon.

431

In fact,

432
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:51,550
you're good at raising fish...

I'm curious to know...

436
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:03,790
who did you learn to do embroidery from?

437
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:07,830
When I was little,

438
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:10,510
I was forced from
home and wandering about.

Every winter,

440
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:14,200
I needed to collect quilt cloth...

441
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:16,110
and stitch them into clothes...

442
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:17,340
until...

443
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:23,130

to come see us first.

458
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:09,560
Finding him would be like
finding a needle in the haystack for us.

This great opportunity from the heavens
was a newfound gold mine...

The lady in the painting realised,
the desire to own the bright moon...

487
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:41,990
is only unrealistic.

But, only the flowers and birds
by her are real.

and third paintings,

490

00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:36,670
In the first painting, "Viewing things
through rose-tinted spectacles",

505
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:38,070
the lady is by the river.

506
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:41,390
The waters reflect
the bright moon in the sky.

507
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:45,470
It means, the years keep passing by,

508
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:47,560
while we are different every year.

509
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:49,590
Compared to the days and nights,

510
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:50,740
life is but a rush,

511
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,070
like a dream.

512
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:54,270
In the second painting,

513
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:56,430
the lady slips deep into a dream
without realising it.

514
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:59,030
This depicts her in her dream.

515
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:01,230
In this picture, the lady...

516
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:03,110
has aged a little.

517
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:07,870
Her youth and beauty are
only preserved in a dream.

518
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:16,310
A young beauty that does not seem to age,

519
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:17,190
but,

520
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:19,070
has aged.

521
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:21,590
Once a budding beauty,

522
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:23,860
now, one with a headful of grays.

523
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:25,830
But, when she looks herself in the mirror,

524
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:27,350
she sees the same
dazzling head ornaments...

525
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:30,190
she wore during her younger days.

526
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:32,710
It's like seeing herself beautiful...

527
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:35,590
and younger self in the mirror.

528
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:40,470
The fourth painting,

529
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:44,120
"To become immortal and
to levitate heavenwards",

530
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,390
the lady has passed on.

531
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:49,580
But, word of her beauty
was passed on for generations.

532
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,840
Like how time flies on earth,

533
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:56,750
there will always be young
and beautiful girls...

534
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:58,310
wearing bedazzling head ornaments,

535
00:30:58,310 --> 00:31:01,510
chasing beautiful things that are
seemingly uncertain.

536
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:15,430
-Well said!
-Well said!

537
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:19,070
After hearing both artists
elaborate about their paintings,

538
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:21,150
I think it's clear that...

539
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:23,710
which one of the two spoke from the heart,

540
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:26,090
and which one was just
hoping to deceive the crowd.

541
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:33,760
Ruyi Pavilion!

542
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:41,060
These were the scattered details...

543
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:42,670
when I was brainstorming.

544
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:44,230
Please take a look.

545
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:51,750
For this case,

546
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:53,750
I have the answer in my heart.

547
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:55,360
From today onwards,

548
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:57,700
we'll take down these four paintings.

549
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,300
Half of the profit gained...

550
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:01,280
will be given to Ruyi Pavilion.

551
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:04,510
Good!

552
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:05,550
Little Marquis...

553
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:06,550
You still have the face to be here?

554
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:07,470
Scram.

555
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:09,630
Serves him right!

556
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:10,900
Let's go already!

557
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:15,870
Scram, scram, right away!

558
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:18,590
And,

559
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,370
I have spoken rudely to you.

560
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:22,510
I am to blame.

561
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:25,120
I'd need to go back to handle this.

562
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:27,330
I'll drop by to apologise.

563
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:54,070
Mother,

564
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:57,990
you once said that...

565
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:02,030
if I won in this round of chess,

566
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:04,950
you'd return.

567
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:07,230
You didn't.

568
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:12,910
I've waited for a decade.

569

[Queen Dowager Wen, mother of Xu Ping,

Mother...

572
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:33,870
Don't be anxious to win
when playing chess.

573
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:37,570
Do not only focus on attacking
and forget about defending.

574
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:41,150
Did you forget about all I've taught you?

575
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:44,870
Yes.

576
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:48,580
I have been careless.

577
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:51,120
I've lost.

578
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:57,310
You're still not lighting up the lanterns.

579
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,840
If it wasn't for my fear of light,

580
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:02,750
you wouldn't need to...

581
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:04,950
use the dim light of a short candle.

582
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:08,920
As long as it's for you, Mother,

583
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:11,110
I'd do anything.

584
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:17,270
A few days before, the lanterns
in the pavilion were so beautiful.

585
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:19,139
That girl is beautiful too.

586
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:33,500
Ping'er,

587
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:35,139
please live a good life...

588
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:36,469
for yourself.

Why?

592
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:50,470
You're finally here!

593
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:52,950
I've waited for you for half a day,
even the sun's starting to set.

594
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:54,390
Why have you come to see me?

595
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:56,030
I know that you're not
in a good mood today.

596
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:57,750
I know of a good place,
let me bring you there.

Mr Ju,

600
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:15,070
write your wishes on
this parchment paper lantern.

601
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:16,000
It really works!

602
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:18,090
I made my wish with this.

603
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:19,620
I wished for a younger brother.

604
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:21,990
Then, my mother had
Guan Ge very soon after.

605
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:23,740
And, if this lantern...

606
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:25,740
goes with the current of this river,

607
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:27,510
you wish shall truly come true.

608
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:33,270
Why don't you tell me your wish,

609
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:35,010
and I'll write it down for you.

610

I...

611
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:41,000
I'd like to see my mother once more.

612
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:43,430

where your mother is,

forever to see my wish come true.]
