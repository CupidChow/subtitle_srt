00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:20,810
I told you to stop reading web fiction.

13
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:24,350
This dream's been following
me since I can remember.

14
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:27,079
I dreamed about it once in a while before.

15
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:30,190
But it's become more frequent lately.

16
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:31,610
You know what this is?

17
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:32,730
This is

18
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:34,300
thinking by day,

19
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,079

20
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:37,890
I thought so, too.

But,

22
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,540
I met the person in my dream yesterday.

23
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,670
Ms Qiao, someone asked for you.

24
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,970
Wake up.

25
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:12,420
I told you not to wake me up.

26
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,329
Hi.

27
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:55,370
Ms Qiao Yi Rong.

28
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:57,940
Who are you?

29
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:58,910
Ms Qiao,

30
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:00,940
this is Mr Xu of Dayu Auction House.

31
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,170
Xu Jin?

32
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:06,490
I've heard a lot about you.

33
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:07,490
Hi, Mr Xu.

34
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:15,910
This is the most important item
for Dreamlike Past Exhibition.

35
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:21,930
This is the first hairpin I've ever made.

36
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:24,180
The shop owner asked me,

37
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:25,620
for whom I made it.

38
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:27,330
And I said,

39
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:29,330
it's for my wife.

40
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:32,900
So, this is the item Mr Ge mentioned.

41
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:35,010
The one named

42
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,040
Furong Hairpin?

43
00:04:36,659 --> 00:04:37,580
Yes, it is.

44
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:41,300
It looks unique,

45
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,260
but it's too old.

46
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:45,020
There're even dents.

47
00:04:45,409 --> 00:04:47,420
It'd take half a month to repair it.

48
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:50,840
I can still make it.

49
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:56,020
I'm counting on you.

50
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,960
Do you mind giving me your number?

51
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,970
He's some guy from Dayu Auction House.

52

Xu Jin.

53
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:10,420
Xu Jin.

54
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,340
Dayu Auction House? Is it

55
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:16,150
the very famous auction house?

56
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,090
Yes, it is.

57
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:18,890
And Xu Jin is

58
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:20,620
the man that'd easily

59
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,330
become a hot topic?

60
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,380
Yeah.

61
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:27,250
Are you saying

62
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,810
that Mr Yu organized the
collaboration between Ruyi Pavilion

63
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:32,140
and Dayu Auction House?

64
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:35,580
No wonder they kept helping me.

65
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,530
Is it because of destiny?

66
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,170
You mean marriage?

67
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,010
People like you

68
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:46,590
are decreasing in number.

69
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,580
Hey, uncultured swine.

70
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:51,040
I meant, destiny like
meeting him by chance.

71
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:51,970
Hey,

72
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:53,260
do you think he dreams

73
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:54,830
about the past like me too?

74
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:56,570
Maybe

75
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:58,909
he's not only someone in my dream.

76
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:01,610
Maybe he's been waiting
for and protecting me.

77
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:03,620
Wow,

78
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,780
such imagination.

79
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:07,540

coffee been during monsoon.

82
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,270
It'll taste different.

83
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,460
You look somehow...

84
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:25,080
-Familiar.
-Yeah.

85
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:27,420
That must be due to destiny.

86
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:28,930
Enjoy yourselves.

87
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:30,100
Destiny?

88
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,000
Maybe

89
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:34,020
he really has been protecting you.

91
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:37,390

92
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:38,980
Don't fan the flames.

93
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:40,770
I've decided

94
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,140
to court him.

95
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:44,940
Give me a hand.

96
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,790
Tell us.

97
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,490
What do you need us to do?

98
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:52,090
I don't think there's
anything I can do to help.

99
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:53,570
I'll help.

100

102
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,880
don't you think this is a little too over?

103
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,530
Just listen to me.

106
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,460
Yes, that's him.

107
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,030
He looks terrific walking up to us.

108
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:35,620

109
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:36,700
you're here.

110
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:38,920
Do we discuss it here

111
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,890
or in your office?

112
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:40,820
Let's do it here.

113
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,659
We can check on the exhibits too.

that the owner of Dayu Auction House

00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:02,940
is young and capable.

123

I find you live up to your reputation.

124
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:07,410
Go ahead with your work.

The Furong Hairpin

129
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:22,500
is the most important item,

130
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,420
so, we plan to link its story

131
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:26,150
to the theme, Dreamlike Past.

132
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:27,860
I'd like to ask about

133
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:29,820
the story behind the hairpin.

134
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:31,770
A Duke

135
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:33,970
made this hairpin for his wife.

136
00:08:35,929 --> 00:08:36,929
It's a love token.

137
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:42,090
What is it?

138
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:44,410
Nothing.

139
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:45,820
I'm just curious.

140
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,700
A cheap hairpin as gift?

141
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:49,610
He made it himself. Himself.

142
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,310
Well, yeah. He made it himself.

143
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:54,900
Get the documents ready

144
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,260
and hand it to Mr Ge.

145
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:58,540
Mr Xu.

146
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:01,380
Well, I'm getting engaged next month.

147
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:03,050
Would you like to come?

148
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:23,390
You're here too? What a coincidence.

149
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,000
My office is upstairs.

150
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:28,850
Really?

151
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:30,780
I didn't notice that.

152
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,030
Where are you going?

153
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:34,910
I'm just taking a walk.

154
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,100
What a coincidence.

155
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,300
I'm taking a walk too.

156
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:39,920
Maybe we can take a walk together?

157
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,380
Which way are you headed?

158
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:42,670
This way.

159
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:45,540
This way is fine too.

160
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:47,010
I made a mistake just now.

161
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:48,210
I was headed this way.

162
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:54,650
This...

163
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:56,460

-Sure.

I can't finish them al...

167
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:04,260
Take them to Dayu Auction House.

168
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,770
-All of them.
-Okay.

169
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:11,780
I need to go now.

170

Well, small wealth
comes from being frugal,

171
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,290
great wealth comes from fate,

172
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:26,660
and massive wealth
comes from being stingy.

173
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,570
Look at Mr Xu.

174
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:29,450
He'd rather stuff himself
than sharing with you.
