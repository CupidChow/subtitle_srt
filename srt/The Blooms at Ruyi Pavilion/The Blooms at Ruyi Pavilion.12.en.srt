00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,140
have been moved into
a rice storehouse in Hong Village.

173
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,550
The storehouse is guarded.

174
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:57,880
Continue to spy on them.

175
00:10:58,350 --> 00:10:59,350
I believe that...

176
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:01,490
they won't leave these things...

177
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:03,900
inside the rice storehouse for long.

178
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:06,080
Yes, Your Highness.

179
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,460
But,

180
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,530
we have both the man and the goods.

181
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:12,260
This might be our best chance
to arrest Mr Dong.

182
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,940
I want to find out...

183
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:17,800
what are they going to do...

184
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,910
with these sulphur and nitre.

185
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:21,410
But if we drag this out,

186
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,630
we might be accused for embezzlement.

187
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:26,510
So many prohibited goods are missing from
the imperial storehouse now.

188
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:28,140
I'm afraid that someone might...

189
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:29,280
accuse the commander of Imperial Guards...

190
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,130
for not doing his job because
he's the nephew of...

191
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:33,930
Mr Dong, superintendent of
Imperial Storehouse.

192
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:38,080
From the day the letter
was sent to Duke Su's Residence,

193
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:41,470
I'm already caught between two sides.

194
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:43,190
They used Mr Dong...

195
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,420
because they want to tie
His Highness's hands.

196
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,830
Yuan said that you are doing a research.

197
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,820
So, you are just spacing out here.

198
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,770
Let me draw a forehead marking here.

199
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:09,020
I promise that it'll be
even prettier than before.

200
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,080
Thank you, Master.

201
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:18,830
Why are you always away
from the pavilion lately?

202
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,880
Our previous workshop is faulty.

203
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:25,250
So, I have been looking for a place...

204
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,970
to build a new workshop.

205
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,000
Did you go to Hong Village?

206
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:32,630
I saw someone who looked
so much like you that day.

207
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,670
Is that so?

208
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:38,900
If I wanted to go to Hong Village,
why wouldn't I tell you?

209
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,660
You are right.

210
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,300
Maybe I miss you too much.

211
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,760
Master.

212
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:51,450
Are you the one who
made this bracelet yourself?

213
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:52,800
Yes.

214
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:54,290
What's wrong?

215
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:55,920
Nothing.

216
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:57,900
It's just that this design...

217
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,190
is different from the others.

218
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:02,520
It's designed by me.

219
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,470
Of course it's different from
other Ruyi Emblem.

220
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,880
Will others be able to imitate it?

221
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,920
No one will be able to...

222
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,720
imitate my design.

223
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:18,380
This design is exclusive to Ruyi Pavilion.

224
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:25,930
What else can this bracelet do?

226
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:34,640
Did Duke An say something to you?

227
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:36,140
Duke An?

228
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:38,510
I don't know him.

Stop lying to me.

230
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:42,380
They said that you are quite close to...

231
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:44,190
Duke An and Duke Su lately.

232
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:47,650
I just know them briefly.

233
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,210
That's all.

Actually, it's not your fault.

Don't blame yourself.

254

Actually, you are very strange.

When you suspected me,

256
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,500
you bullied me and interrogated me...

257
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,990
just because you are bigger.

258
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:59,880

When my master was in trouble,

269
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:25,450
we knew how good Mr Dong is.

270

We also believe that...

271
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,920
he didn't try to hurt Guan Ge on purpose.

an honest chat with Mr Dong?

When I was young,
my sister liked to study chess.

275
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:46,960
She would study it
for the whole afternoon.

I can never beat her in chess.

00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,960
my friend's family member
almost did something unforgivable.

341
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,330
At first, I hated him.

342
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:14,790
But now,

343
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,490
I think he'll be able to handle it well.

344
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:20,470
Great.

345
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,490
Duke An.

346
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:31,420
Be at ease, Mr Fu.

347
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,690
Are you here for something important?

348
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,860
No, I don't have anything important.

349
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:40,930
I'm just here to visit Ms Fu Rong.

350
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,380
Rong'er?

351
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,350
You know Rong'er?

352
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:50,340
I've met your daughter before.

353
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:53,870
My daughter is very cheeky
and has a loose tongue.

354
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:57,160
I hope that she didn't offend you.

355
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:00,290
No such thing.

356
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,840
Your daughter is intelligent and cute.

357
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,200
She won't offend me.

358
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:08,650
My daughter is from a poor family.

359
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,010
And she's unbridled.

360
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:12,120
We might find a match for her...

361
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:14,370
among the common men out there.

362
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:19,180
But we'll never hope for her to be
married into a prestigious family.

363
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:23,950
I still have things to do. Goodbye.

364
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:26,100
Farewell, Your Highness.

365
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,360
Dear.

366
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,840
We just broke our marriage engagement
with Xindu Residence.

367
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:53,090
And now, Duke An
is here on his own volition.

368
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:57,050
I'm not sure if Duke An
is interested in Rong'er or not.

369
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:58,640
But if he is interested,

370
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:00,700
why should you reject him?

371
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:02,900
If Rong'er can become a consort,

372
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:05,190
she'll bring honour to our family.

373
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,170
Honour?

374
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:13,080
Have you ever thought about this?

375
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:15,740
Is honour more important...

376
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,080
or her safety more important?

377
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,280
What do you mean?

378
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,020
Are you saying that Duke An
might kill Rong'er?

379
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:25,960
You don't understand.

380
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:30,400
Xindu Residence is
not that deeply connected to the royalty.

381
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:33,440
If Rong'er can marry into
Xindu Residence,

382
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,400
she can live a luxurious life...

383
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:38,630
without having to fall into
the endless fight for power.

384
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:42,190
But Duke An is different.

385
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,480
Duke An...

386
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:47,520
is just a rich and idle duke.

387
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,970
You are ignorant.

388
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:52,400
Duke An is His Majesty's
biological brother.

389
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:54,690
Even if he wants to hold himself aloof,

390
00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:56,400
it's not up to him.

391
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,650
Based on her personality,

392
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,820
even if she can become Duke An's consort,

393
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:03,800
it'll be very dangerous for her.

394
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:06,440
Our family has little to no power.

395
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:08,620
If anything happens in the future,

396
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,400
we won't be able to help Rong'er...

397
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,940
even if we want to do that.

398
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:13,520
Su Niang.

399
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:15,320
Go out and hang out more.

400
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:19,680
See if there's any man of equal status...

401
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:21,220
who suits Rong'er.

402
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,160
I understand.

403
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,900
This girl is really worrisome.

404
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:29,760
Places that are too rigid
don't suit her at all.

405
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:32,090
As her father,

406
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,690
I don't hope that her husband's family...

407
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,320
can help me in the future.

408
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:40,890
I just wish that she can live
in happiness and peace.

409
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,660
Yes.

410
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:45,330
Don't worry.

411
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:53,910
Sister!

412
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,080
I know that it's you.

413
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,840
Why are you behaving so rashly again?

414
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,440
No. I'm just happy because
the weather is nice.

415
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,940
I heard that...

416
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,530
Duke An came to visit you.

417
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:10,320
Are we going to have
a duke's consort instead of...

418
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:12,130
an earl's consort now?

419
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:15,690
Sister, don't you know me well enough?

420
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:17,670
Duke An is just a friend.

421
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:20,180
Moreover, I don't want to
become a consort.

422
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:21,590
It's tiring and there are many rules.

423
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:22,990
I might even lose my life.

424
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,800
You are talking as if
you've been a consort before.

425
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:28,540
In my dream.

426
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:30,170
Your dream?

427
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:32,190
Nothing.

428
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:37,600
Rather than worrying about me,

429
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,600
how about you worry about yourself?

430
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:42,800
You've already came back
for quite some time.

431
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:45,920
A lot of young men
are already checking you out.

432
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,150
Well,

433
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,470
after another half a month,

434
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:50,230
our house's stairs will become flat.

435
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:51,200
Nonsense.

436
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:52,650
This is not nonsense.

437
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:55,160
You are so lovable.

438
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:57,950
There are so many people
who want to marry you.

439
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,280
Let me think about it.

440
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,800
What about...

441
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:03,920
Little Marquis?

442
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,830
Something is always not right
whenever both of you are together.

443
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:09,280
What do you mean by not right?

444
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,740
We are not good together.

445
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:11,790
Sister.

446
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,040
You've never been good with anyone.

447
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:16,980
I think both of you...

448
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:21,360
are enemies and lovers
who are destined to meet.

449
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,750
Fu Rong!

450
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:23,980
Stop right there!

451
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:29,390
[Duke Su's Mansion]

452
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:35,550
Jin'er.

453
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:39,600
Why did you invite me...

454
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:41,090
to your residence today?

455
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:52,670
Sulphur.

456
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:55,090
Nitre.

457
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,520
Uncle.

458
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:01,580
You know that I'm the commander
of the Imperial Guards.

459
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:04,200
I work on corruption cases.

460
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:06,670
That man is using you...

461
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:09,080
because he wants to trap...

462
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:10,490
you, me,

463
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:11,810
my mother...

464
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,620
and even Wen'er into this.

465
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:15,720
I...

466
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:22,850
I didn't want to drag others into it.

467
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:24,480
That's why...

468
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,900
But now,

469
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:32,840
everything is too late.

470
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:35,790
Once wrong,

471
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:37,990
always wrong.

472
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,740
There's no way back.

473
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,410
Tell me.

474
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,050
Who's behind this?

475
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:53,870
I can't tell you.

476
00:27:57,130 --> 00:27:59,150
I've been an official for decades.

477
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,180
I'm always dedicated and attentive...

478
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,630
to my duties.

479
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:05,360
I've never once neglected them.

480
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,420
But now,

481
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:12,330
my reputation is going to be ruined.

482
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:13,620
Uncle,

483
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:17,190
do you still care about
your reputation now?

484
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:18,780
If you don't tell me,

485
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:21,750
you'll be forced to death
inside this trap.

486
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,140
If you tell me,

487
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:25,580
there's still hope to turn this around.

488
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:27,940
Break the game.

489
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:39,540
I'll lure the man behind this to come out.

490
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,570
Then, you'll be able to
catch him red-handed.

491
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:46,500
As for me,

492
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:50,150
no need to spare me.

493
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:53,930
I have only myself to blame.

494
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:05,700
We've already gotten
to the bottom of this.

495
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:08,250
Dong Fang Li is indeed used by Duke Cheng.

496
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:09,420
But,

497
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:12,800
will Duke Su be able to
convince Dong Fang Li?

498
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,450
No matter what Dong Fang Li's decision is,

499
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:16,490
I believe that...

500
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,850
if I send this letter to Duke Cheng,

501
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,640
Mao'er will definitely make a move.

502
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,050
If it's what you want,

503
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,560
I'll lay down my life for you...

504
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:30,100
without any regrets.

505
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:33,560
Wen Xing.

506
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:35,910
After this matter is concluded,

507
