00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:07,950
Xiao Shi.

174
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,700
Don't talk nonsense.

175
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:11,100
Silly boy.

176
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:12,670
I am here.

177
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,860
You will be fine.

178
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,830
Though I was dumped by my parents,

179
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:20,170
I don't blame them.

180
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:24,870
I thank them

181
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:27,780
for giving me a chance to meet Ms Liu

182
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,380
and all of you.

183
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,550
-Uncle San.
-Xiao Shi.

184
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:35,690
Xiao Shi.

185
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:47,450
Xiao Shi.

186
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,960
Xiao Shi.

187
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,670
Xiao Shi!

188
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:55,940
Xiao Shi!

189
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:59,160
What happened?

190
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:00,650
Mistress.

191
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:02,700
Our whereabouts were exposed.

192
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,650
Imperial Guards attacked us.
That's why Xiao Shi...

193
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,160
Imperial Guards?

194
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,210
They also said that

195
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:12,140
Duke Su has given a death order

196
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:13,820
to wipe out Ruyi Pavilion.

197
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,490
Xiao Shi.

198
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:37,720
[Duke Su's Residence]

199
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:26,440
[As Kind As Water]

200
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:32,800
Rong'er.

201
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,300
You are back.

202
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:39,170
Why are you exterminating Ruyi Pavilion?

203
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:45,020
His Majesty has found out about
the secret organisation of Ruyi Pavilion.

204
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:47,220
I am ordered to investigate the matter.

205
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:50,150
You better stay away.

206
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:51,770
Don't get involved in it.

207
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,980
I can't stay away.

208
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,480
I am the new owner of Ruyi Pavilion.

209
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,420
What?

210
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:07,570
Why are you so stubborn?

211
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:10,610
It is because

212
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,170
I am my master's only disciple.

213
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:16,530
It is because Ruyi Pavilion is in danger.

214
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:18,460
It is also because

215
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:22,540
Ruyi Pavilion is not as evil as
you imagine.

216
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:26,640
Do you know how dangerous it is?

217
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:28,050
I know.

218
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:31,880
Just arrest me.

219
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,940
Not only can you please His Majesty,

220
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,730
you can also steer clear of
Ruyi Pavilion.

221
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,020
You should arrest me now.

222
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:43,390
Fu Rong.

223
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:49,780
When His Majesty chased me off,
I made assumptions.

224
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:52,910
I thought His Majesty wanted me to
stay out of Zhenbei General's case.

225
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:55,640
That's why His Majesty chased me away
on purpose.

226
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,160
I was mad at you for the wrong reason.

227
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:00,120
Now, when I look back,

228
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:05,640
I think when Your Highness caught Xiao Wu,

229
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:09,370
His Majesty had already decided
to uproot Ruyi Pavilion.

230
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:12,790
You told Wu Bai Qi to follow me around.

231
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,830
Did you want him to protect me

232
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,270
or to spy on me.

233
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:26,810
To you,

234
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:29,650
I am that kind of person.

235
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:34,680
Your Highness.

236
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,420
We promised each other

237
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:38,920
not to hide anything from each other
no matter what happens.

238
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:39,920
Did you honour it?

239
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:41,340
What have you done?

240
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:43,750
When you pushed me way

241
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,440
and flung out hard words on me,

242
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,240
I had not suspected you for a bit.

243
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:50,500
Now, a life had been lost.

244
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,120
There will be more in the future.

245
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,790
You and I have turned into enemies.

246
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,310
Enemies?

247
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:05,950
You want me to arrest you?

248
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:08,910
Suit yourself.

249
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:14,000
Fine.

250
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:16,440
Don't regret.

251
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:21,530
We shall be enemies from now on.

252
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,480
I shall prove that Ruyi Pavilion
is not what you think!

253
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:49,530
Have you recovered?

254
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,620
Thanks for the care, Your Highness.

255
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:53,020
I am in a great condition.

256
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:55,930
So great I can put down
my enemies one by one.

257
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,190
There will be a big market
west of the city a few days from now.

258
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:00,690
Everyone will be there,

259
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:03,610
When the time comes,

260
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,950
I will lure Xu Jin to Ruyi Pavilion.

261
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,230
Then, you may burn Ruyi Pavilion

262
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:11,700
to ashes in order to have your revenge.

263
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:13,810
Yes.

264
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:15,920
I want him to have a taste

265
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:18,110
of the pain that I suffered.

266
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:20,370
Xu Jin.

267
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:23,970
Mr Wen.

268
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:42,240
[She is the love of my life.]

269
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,770
[Xu Jin alone is not enough.]

270
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:57,350
Young Master.

271
00:18:57,430 --> 00:19:00,290
I saw Ms Gu
eavesdropping at the door.

272
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,720
Since she has found out,

273
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:07,580
will letting her stay
at Jushui Pavilion be...

274
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:11,880
I have plans for her.

275
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:15,020
Keep walking!

276
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,670
Hurry up!

277
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:17,680
Hurry up!

278
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:20,070
Stop dilly-dallying! Keep walking!

279
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,280
Hurry up!

280
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:25,300
Lan Xiang.

281
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:27,190
Did you really see Yuan?

282
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,560
Yuan said that something happened
to her family.

283
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,320
That's why she is not at Ruyi Pavilion.

284
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,670
She is just in time to go
to the West City Market.

285
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:35,210
She planned to go and have a look.

286
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:36,880
Let's go to the market.

287
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:39,400
Hurry up!

288
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:40,530
Hurry!

289
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,960
Imperial Guards are on duty!

290
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,550
No one is allowed to be here!

291
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,400
Go away!

292
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:48,600
Let's go.

293
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:01,060
Lord Fu.

294
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:04,000
What are you doing here?

295
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:05,480
Here is a letter for you.

296
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,530
From who?

297
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:16,640
[Fu Rong is trapped in Ruyi Pavilion
and is at stake]

298
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:19,580
Rong'er?

299
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:21,550
Master, finally you are back.

300
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:24,320
Inform Madam now.

301
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:25,680
Tell her something bad
happened to Rong'er.

302
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,950
I have to go Ruyi Pavilion.

303
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:28,190
Sure.

304
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:32,590
Hurry!

305
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,610
I wonder how Mr Ge and Guo Rui
are doing with the investigation.

306
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:55,750
Your Highness, something bad happened!

307
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,610
Something bad happened to Madam.

308
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:00,650
What happened to Rong'er?

309
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:01,680
Madam is...

310
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,290
Madam passed out at Ruyi Pavilion.

311
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:10,970
Your Highness.

312
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:12,160
Mr Xu.

313
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:17,660
Are you luring me to Ruyi Pavilion?

314
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:19,290
Why?

315
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,270
Your Highness.

316
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:27,220
I am threatened by bad guys

317
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:28,710
and I have to work for them

318
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,870
but I have never thought
of harming Madam.

319
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,900
That person

320
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:36,020
forced Madam to tell him some secrets.

321
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,740
He tortured her to get answers.

322
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:38,870
I couldn't bear to see it.

323
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:40,270
That's why I sneaked out.

324
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,440
Your Highness.

325
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:46,470
You are the only person who can save her.

326
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,230
Tell me.

327
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,630
Who is that person?

328
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:55,250
My family is in his hand.

329
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:56,480
I can't tell you.

330
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,980
Your Highness, please.

331
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:03,070
Xu Jia.

332
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:04,930
Keep a close watch on her.

333
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,570
Yuan?

334
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,140
Yuan!

335
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:48,970
You are smiling.

336
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,200
Concubine Rong treats you so well

337
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,400
yet you betrayed her.

338
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,980
You are so despicable.

339
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:57,600
You know that Madam treats me well.

340
00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:00,520
Furthermore, she is so smart.

341
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:03,800
No way I could trick her
into going to Ruyi Pavilion.

342
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,050
What do you mean?

343
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:09,460
His Highness is so reserved.

344
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:11,240
He can't pacify Madam

345
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:13,470
If she didn't come up with some ideas,

346
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,920
they might really get divorced this time.

347
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:20,990
You mean

348
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:24,210
it is a plot set up by you
and Concubine Rong?

349
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,520
You will know when the time comes.

350
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,980
Be prepared to apologise.

351
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:31,110
Concubine Rong is tricking His Highness.

352
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,270
What is she after?

353
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:33,640
I can't tell you.

354
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:35,000
Tell me.

355
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:45,240
I am sorry.

356
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,290
Lord Fu!

357
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:10,200
Lord Fu, wake up.

358
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,300
Duke Su.

359
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,930
Go now!

360
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:42,390
Go now!

361
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:43,690
Zhang Yan is not dead!

362
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:45,450
He wants to burn us into ashes!

363
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:47,330
Zhang Yan? We'll leave now.

364
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:53,380
You had a lucky escape at Mount Dong.

365
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:54,720
This time,

366
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:56,440
you won't escape easily.

367
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:57,960
This time,

368
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:59,630
we shall change the game.

369
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:12,700
Lord Fu, let's go!

370
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,130
This way.

371
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,510
Watch out!

372
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:33,100
Duke Su, are you okay?

373
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,520
Leave now! Let's go!

374
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:46,040
Watch out!

375
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:49,200
Even if I have to die,

376
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:51,550
I will make sure both of you die together!

377
00:26:57,730 --> 00:26:59,440
Lord Fu, let's go!

378
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:03,140
Stand there!

379
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:10,510
No way! Ruyi Pavilion is on fire!

380
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,940
Let's put out the fire!

381
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,770
Let's go.

382
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:21,310
Your Highness, leave now!

383
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,200
You won't make it if you don't leave now.

384
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,920
We'll leave together!

385
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,400
Wait for me!

386
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,030
Lord Fu!

387
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:44,240
Let's go!

388
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:45,260
Let's go!

389
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:48,830
Let's go!

390
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:53,300
Your Highness, leave now!

391
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:07,760
Take care of Rong'er.

392
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:23,870
Quick, put out the fire!

393
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:26,320
Chief Commander.

394
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:28,230
Chief Commander, are you okay?

395
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:30,370
Ruyi Pavilion is closed at the moment.
It should be empty.

396
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:31,670
Send Chief Commander back.

397
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:32,860
Both of you, stay and put out the fire.

398
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:33,960
-Let's go!
-Yes!

399
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:40,520
There are too many people.

400
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,730
I saw her just now.

401
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:42,920
Where is she?

402
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:46,680
Yuan!

403
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:48,910
Let's go.

404
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:50,270
Yuan!

405
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:52,690
-Yuan!
-Ruyi Pavilion is on fire!

406
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:54,330
It is on fire!

407
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:56,090
Ruyi Pavilion is on fire!

408
00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:57,320
It is on fire!

409
00:28:57,410 --> 00:28:58,460
It is over there!

410
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:07,700
Young Master said that

411
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:09,770
you only need to lure Ms Fu
out of Ruyi Pavilion.

412
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:10,870
You may leave now.

413
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:12,950
Be careful, don't let anyone see you.

414
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:13,870
Yes.

415
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,360
-Put out the fire!
-Yes!

416
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,900
-Your Highness.
-Hurry up!

417
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:31,810
Your Highness, a suspicious
man in black was here.

418
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:33,540
-Go after him!
-Yes!

419
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:40,880
Madam.

420
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,990
It's too late.

421
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:47,920
Why did this happen?

422
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:00,060
[It's the Imperial Guards.]

423
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:02,030
[Xu Jin,]

424
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:04,970
[are you really going to be so cruel?]

425
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:06,600
Master!

426
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:08,120
-Mother.
-Master!

427
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,930
-What are you doing here?
-Master! Where is your father?

428
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:12,130
Isn't father at home?

429
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:14,540
No, he told me that
he would meet up with you.

430
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:15,420
Where is he?

431
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,090
Where is he? I hope he is not inside.

432
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:22,230
Master!

433
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:33,940
Master!

434
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:40,100
Master!

435
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:45,400
Master!

436
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:56,030
[Fu Residence]

437
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:34,700
Duke Su is here.

438
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:56,290
Duke Su.

439
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:59,000
The Fu Family doesn't wish to see you.

440
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,220
Please leave.

441
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:14,780
Your Highness.

442
00:32:57,610 --> 00:32:59,140
There are many people here.

443
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:00,670
We shall talk in private.

444
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:40,180
Duke Su, answer my question.

445
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:44,480
Did you send the Imperial Guards
to burn down Ruyi Pavilion?

446
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:47,180
No.

447
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:50,400
What were the Imperial Guards
doing at the scene?

448
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:53,660
Not long after you ordered for the arrest
of its staff,

449
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:55,190
Ruyi Pavilion caught fire.

450
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,900
Was that just a coincidence?

451
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:00,120
My lady.

452
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:03,060
Gu Yuan told us that
you were in danger at Ruyi Pavilion.

453
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:04,030
My lady.

454
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,580
We remember what you said.

455
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:08,040
We had arrested Gu Yuan

456
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,270
but

457
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,449
she said that she was threatened

458
00:34:11,889 --> 00:34:14,090
and you were tortured at Ruyi Pavilion.

459
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:15,290
Once he heard that,

460
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:16,780
His Highness got scared.

461
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:19,120
Well...

462
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:21,360
His Highness lost his cool.

463
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:23,540
Where is she?

464
00:34:25,389 --> 00:34:26,630
She knocked me out

465
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:28,020
and ran away.

466
00:34:29,969 --> 00:34:31,139
Mr Xu.

467
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:33,070
You are not good at lying.

468
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:35,480
-I...
-No doubt Gu Yuan knows kung fu

469
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:37,060
but she is no match for you.

470
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,500
Your Highness is so smart.

471
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:46,909
You knew that something is
wrong with Gu Yuan.

472
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:49,139
That's why you put the blame on her.

473
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,570
However, man proposes, God disposes.

474
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:55,080
I saw her in the market that day.

475
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:58,200
She couldn't have split herself into two
to meet you at your place

476
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,730
and set fire at Ruyi Pavilion
at the same time.

477
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:01,940
My lady.

478
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:05,670
In fact, the person who set the fire
was not Gu Yuan.

479
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:06,790
It was Zhang Yan.

480
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:13,110
I saw Gu Yuan in the market
with my own eyes.

481
00:35:13,370 --> 00:35:15,900
I saw Imperial Guards
outside Ruyi Pavilion.

482
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:19,960
Furthermore, Zhang Yan died
at Mount Dong long time ago.

483
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:23,100
You want me to not believe
what I saw with my own eyes

484
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:26,100
and believe in the allegations
that you made instead.

485
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:30,460
Fine.

486
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:32,900
Gu Yuan escaped.

487
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:35,020
How about Zhang Yan?

488
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:36,860
Zhang Yan...

489
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:38,820
Zhang Yan was killed in fire.

490
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:43,600
Say something.

491
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:46,030
Why don't you admit it?

492
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,570
Admit that you want to
burn down Ruyi Pavilion.

493
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:49,230
Admit that you want to stop me.

494
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:52,870
-Rong'er!
-Don't come near me.

495
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:01,470
I failed to save Lord Fu.

496
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:05,010
I failed you.

497
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:08,850
Don't come here again.

498
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,840
You are not welcome at the Fu Residence.

499
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:15,600
Rong'er.

500
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:17,400
Father is gone.

501
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:19,860
Mother has fallen sick
with grievance and toil.

502
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:21,580
We are the only two left.

503
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:23,810
You must take care of yourself.

504
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:30,180
Rong'er.

505
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,370
Did Duke Su kill father?

506
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:35,310
Even if Duke Su did it,

507
00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:38,600
why did father appear at that time?

508
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:42,040
Don't you think that something
is fishy about the incident?

509
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,050
Furthermore,

510
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:45,410
Duke Su has not recovered from injuries.

511
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:49,290
It might be done by someone else.

512
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:52,260
[If Ge Chuan was telling the truth,]

513
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:54,540
[if the fire was started by Zhang Yan,]

514
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:57,920
[two dead bodies would have been
found in Ruyi Pavilion.]

515
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:08,230
Rong'er.

516
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,720
Guan Ge'er is still young.

517
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,870
He is still weak.

518
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:13,590
Why don't you bring him home for a rest?

519
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:16,150
I shall keep watch at night.

520
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:18,580
I won't be able to sleep.

521
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:20,020
You bring him back.

522
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:23,380
I think mother has something to tell you.

523
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:25,300
Okay.

524
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:27,190
I shall replace you at midnight.

525
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:33,340
Guan Ge'er, are you sleepy?

526
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:36,080
Let's go home to take a break, okay?

527
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:37,490
Okay.

528
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:40,050
But where did father go?

529
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:43,450
Father...

530
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,520
Father has gone travelling.

531
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:50,760
Guan Ge'er, be good.

532
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:53,390
Let's go.

533
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:57,800
All of you may go back for a rest.

534
00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:00,060
Yes.

535
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:06,170
Mother!

536
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:08,460
Mother.

537
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:10,350
Mother.

538
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:12,730
-Bao Zhu, please help me.
-Madam.

539
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:14,700
Mother, are you okay?

540
00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:19,020
Madam.

541
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:24,340
Mother.

542
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:25,920
The doctor said that

543
00:39:26,270 --> 00:39:27,980
you are worrying too much.

544
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:29,930
You should take care of yourself.

545
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,150
Stop thinking.

546
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:32,400
Do you get it?

547
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:34,350
It is okay.

548
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:35,740
I am okay.

549
00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:38,860
Mother.

550
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:46,300
This...

551
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:49,760
This is the grant of the mansion
at Hong Village.

552
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:51,270
Sell it.

553
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:54,590
No matter what, it will be helpful.

554
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:56,020
Mother.

555
00:39:56,950 --> 00:39:58,090
Don't worry.

556
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:02,010
We will survive this.

557
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:04,400
I believe in that.

558
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:30,500
Why are you still here?

559
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:32,820
How is Madam Fu doing?

560
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:38,490
I am exhausted.

561
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:39,860
Please leave.

562
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,900
You had to greet the guests

563
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:45,580
as well as console Concubine Rong.

564
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:48,620
You also had to take care
of Guan Ge'er and Madam Fu.

565
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:50,490
Everyone else is crying

566
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:53,450
but you have been holding it back.

567
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:01,350
What is the point of crying?

568
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:20,540
Hong Village?

569
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:29,370
I saw Butler Li asking money from you.

570
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:32,300
Are you going to sell the mansion away?

571
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:34,790
It is none of your business.

572
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:37,870
When will you go there?

573
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:38,840
I'll go with you.

574
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,390
Wu Bai Qi!

575
00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:43,200
Don't you get me?

576
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:46,680
The Fu Residence has nothing
to do with you anymore.

577
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:52,520
Is that because you have to
mourn for three years?

578
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:54,070
Is that it?

579
00:42:06,310 --> 00:42:07,550
I'll keep you company

580
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,860
just like how you kept me
company in the past.

581
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:15,760
You will regret it.

582
00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:19,240
-The Fu Family is...
-Xuan'er.

583
00:42:21,810 --> 00:42:24,010
I'm willing to do whatever else you say,

584
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:30,270
but you have no say in this.

585
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:34,330
Let alone three years,

586
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:36,640
even if it's thirty years

587
00:42:36,850 --> 00:42:38,180
or three hundred years,

588
00:42:39,870 --> 00:42:40,930
I will wait for you.

589
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:45,690
It's just waiting.

590
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,340
I am not afraid of it at all.

591
00:42:50,870 --> 00:42:52,000
I only worry that...

592
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:14,520
I only worry that when you are crying,

593
00:43:15,870 --> 00:43:17,120
no one is by your side.
