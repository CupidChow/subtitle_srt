[Episode 11]

4
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:55,979
That's strange.

5
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:58,400
How did I end up here?

6
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:05,330
Ms Fu should be inside.

7
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:10,650
Fresh flowers.

8
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:20,620
Ms Fu.

9
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:21,940
It's late.

10
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,829
You may head back and take a rest.

11
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:25,930
No way.

12
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:27,950
Both Rong'er and Ms Liu
aren't around.

13
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:30,500
I'll familiarise myself with the ledger...

14
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:32,290
so that I can help them out.

15
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:35,520
That's very responsible of you, Ms Fu.

16
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:37,329
But it's fate which decides...

17
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,130
how the business is doing.

18
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:43,130
I want to make it as perfect as possible.

19
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:44,750
I'll just try my best...

20
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,610
and let fate take care of the rest.

21
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:50,390
Ms Fu, are you afraid Feng Lai Yi
will hit below the belt again?

22
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:55,340
Apart from what happened,

23
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:58,970
Feng Lai Yi has been
competing fairly with Ruyi Pavilion.

24
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:02,140
And I don't think...

25
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:05,410
Little Marquis would hit below the belt.

26
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:08,460
But sometimes...

27
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:10,770
he does confusing things.

28
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:13,770
I just don't get Little Marquis.

29
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:16,010
Neither do I.

30
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:18,430
And I think...

31
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:20,329
he's not what he seems.

32
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,570
What is he like?

33
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:25,290
I'm not sure.

34
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:28,370
He doesn't seem like a bad person.

35
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:31,690
Moreover,

36
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:33,900
sometimes...

37
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:35,370
he's pretty righteous.

38
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:39,490
If he can get rid of
some of his bad habits,

39
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:40,620
he...

40
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:42,930
would make a great General.

41
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:48,829
Why am I talking about all this?

42
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:50,490
Let's go and organise things.

43
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:14,810
Your Highness.

44
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:17,149
You want everyone to know who I am?

45
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:21,930
I'll call you Mr Xu, okay?

46
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:28,490
Are you here to shop?

47
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:33,050
Do I need to report to you on what I do?

48
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:42,010
Miss, check out this perfume pouch.

49
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:44,860
Look how well-embroidered they are.

50
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,930
Look, they're exquisite.

51
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:50,080
-Which one do you prefer?
-Sir.

52
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:51,650
I'm looking for someone.

53
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:53,750
Mister, you got the right person.

54
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:54,750
With my good memory,

55
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,659
I can remember anyone.

56
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,550
What does that person look like?

57
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:01,890
He's about my height...

58
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:03,250
and is in his forties.

59
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:06,090
He has a small beard.

60
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:07,540
Beard?

61
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:09,670
Well,

62
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,260
if he did pass by here,

63
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:12,420
I'd surely know.

64
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,630
But I haven't seen...

65
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:14,920
such a man lately.

66
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:21,020
Sir, how much is this?

67
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:22,870
It's not expensive. It's only ten wen.

68
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:23,980
Sure.

69
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:27,610
It's an affordable price.

70
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:29,380
Miss.

71
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:32,170
You're not broke, are you?

72
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:41,700
-Forget it.
-I'll have all these perfume pouches.

73
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,970
You...

74
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,690
Sure...

75
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:49,010
-Keep the change.
-Sure...

76
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:57,370
You don't have to do this.

77
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:03,890
Where are you heading?

78
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,760
I'm looking for someone.

79
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,470
He's forty-something...

80
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:08,690
and about my height.

81
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:10,720
He has a beard similar to yours.

82
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,930
Sorry, I didn't see him.

83
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:21,130
How stingy you are.

84
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:24,590
Here's a perfume pouch for you.

85
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:26,090
Take it. Thank you.

86
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,770
Thank you...

87
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:33,370
Sir.

88
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:36,630
Stir-fried beef tenderloin.

89
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,490
Annin tofu. Mandarin fish.

90
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:41,010
Anything else?

91
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:43,220
That will do.

92
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,890
Sure. Any food restrictions?

93
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:48,530
-No ginger and garlic.
-Sure.

94
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:49,690
Please wait.

95
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:54,360
How did you know I don't
eat ginger and garlic?

96
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:59,010
I said, I don't eat them.

97
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:07,600
Why did you buy and
give those pouches away?

98
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:09,290
None of your business.

99
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:12,850
I'm just asking.

100
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:15,570
It's your money.

101
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:17,790
Don't you want them?

102
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:19,040
No.

103
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,420
They're too ugly.

104
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:22,840
I'll throw them away
if you gift them to me.

105
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:30,690
So,

106
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:32,810
who are you looking for?

107
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:37,870
Fine.

108
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,280
You don't want to say it?

109
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:41,260
That's better.

110
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:42,480
You'd suspect me...

111
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:43,970
if something happened.

112
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:45,170
What?

113
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:49,010
-What could happen?
-How would I know?

114
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:50,750
You always...

115
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:53,230
bump into assassins or killers, don't you?

116
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:55,590
And you get suspicious all the time.

117
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:57,260
And I'm unlucky enough...

118
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:59,050
to make you suspicious of me.

119
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,760
Of course it's better
for me to know nothing.

120
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:07,650
Stop acting weird.

121
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:11,450
You should stop acting weird.

122
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,690
Here comes the dishes.

123
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:17,800
Annin tofu.

124
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:19,410
Mandarin fish.

125
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:21,320
Enjoy your food.

126
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:23,690
I'm not eating.

127
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:53,490
[Please let Guan Ge be safe]

128
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,660
Today is Lantern Festival
at Hong Village?

129
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:07,590
How would I know?
I'm not from Hong Village.

130
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:09,090
I didn't ask you.

131
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,360
I was talking to the air.

132
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:19,810
Ms Fu, wait here.

133
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:27,560
Master.

134
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,230
Master.

135
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:31,610
Master...

136
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:44,670
-Sir, have a seat.
-We have all kinds of lanterns.

137
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:46,230
-Sir, what will it be?
-A bowl of noodles.

138
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:48,110
-Check them out.
-One bowl coming up.

139
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:49,510
It's my family's recipe.

140
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:51,250
Sir, check it out.

141
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:56,050
Sir, what's the matter?

142
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:02,270
Sir, here's your noodles.

143
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:03,370
Thanks.

144
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,350
We have all kinds of lanterns.

145
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:07,720
I made them. Check them out.

146
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:17,870
Why are you hanging the lanterns up there?

147
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:19,110
You're not a local, are you?

148
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:20,630
It's our village tradition.

149
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:22,830
We pray and hang lanterns
during Lantern Festival.

150
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,290
The higher, the better.

151
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:25,860
Thank you.

152
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:31,630
Someone is giving away lanterns there.

153
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:32,730
Go take them!

154
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:35,030
-Really?
-Let's go!

155
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:36,290
Let's go!

156
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:56,470
The ladder is over there.

157
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:08,680
Look...

158
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:23,690
What are you doing?

159
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,080
Are you taking advantage of me?

160
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:28,410
Let go of me!

161
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:38,550
Didn't you ask me to let go?

162
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:39,930
-I'll do it.
-No!

163
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,950
Now you're taking advantage of me.

164
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:46,160
I'm willing to do so.

165
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:51,650
Now that we...

166
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,210
and the lanterns are here,

167
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:54,630
are you hanging them?

168
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:00,190
Hang yours over here.

169
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:01,300
It's nearer.

170
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:07,400
We're on the ground.

171
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,630
And you're still holding me.

172
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,630
-Drink some water.
-I'm not drinking it...

173
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:36,380
-Drink some...
-No!

174
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:37,580
Guan Ge.

175
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:39,500
Sister Rong!

176
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:40,660
Slowly...

177
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:41,890
Sister Rong!

178
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:45,850
Why is your face so hot?

179
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:47,710
Guan Ge has been asking for you...

180
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:49,650
since he woke up from the nap.

181
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,640
Since it's Lantern Festival,

182
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:53,650
I took him out for a walk.

183
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:55,430
I should've kept an eye on him.

184
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:56,830
He almost got lost.

185
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:58,020
Luckily he's found.

186
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:00,820
Didn't I tell you not to
take him to crowded places?

187
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:05,280
Guan Ge, why didn't you listen to me?

188
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,250
Sister Rong.

189
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:08,390
All children...

190
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:09,730
are playful by nature.

191
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:11,860
Your Highness.

192
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:13,890
He's my brother.

193
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:15,750
I dote on him.

194
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:17,490
It's my job to discipline him.

195
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:18,930
Forget it.

196
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:20,580
I'll brew him some medicine.

197
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:22,290
-Send him back.
-Yes.

198
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,240
It is hot.

199
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:34,930
Brother, are you going to scold me?

200
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:36,820
Of course not.

201
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:43,930
I brought you two perfume pouches.

202
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:45,420
They're for you.

203
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,450
They smell nice! Thank you, Brother.

204
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:55,850
But why did you give me two?

205
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:00,080
You can...

206
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:02,210
give one of them to anyone.

207
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:05,800
Can I give one to Sister Rong?

208
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:08,420
I sneaked out today.

209
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:11,130
Sister Rong seems to be mad at me.

210
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:13,690
Then...

211
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,730
keep this for yourself, okay?

212
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:17,150
Okay.

213
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:18,690
Go ahead.

214
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:28,530
-Here.
-I'm not drinking it...

215
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,830
-Finish it. Hurry up.
-I'm not drinking it!

216
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:31,940
Open your mouth.

217
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:33,410
I'm not drinking it.

218
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:38,000
You're good at acting pitiful.

219
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:40,240
I'll get you a physician tomorrow.

220
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:43,760
Got it, Sister Rong.

221
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:45,960
Here's a candy for you.

222
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:50,330
I don't eat junk food like you do.

223
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,000
For me?

224
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:07,790
Sister Rong, don't get mad.
Here's a gift for you.

225
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:10,170
Sister Rong, here's your gift.

226
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,650
Where did you get this?

227
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:14,540
Brother gave it to me.

228
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:15,940
He gave me two.

229
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:17,790
He asked me to keep one for myself...

230
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:20,570
and give one to you.

231
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:26,590
Don't you...

232
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:28,540
accept anything from anyone.

233
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:30,290
Don't do it again, got it?

234
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:32,700
Got it, Sister Rong.

235
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:34,730
Fine, go to bed now.

236
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:44,530
[Don't you accept anything from anyone.]

237
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,980
Ms Fu, you're not going to bed?

238
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:02,630
Do you have eyes on the back of your head?

239
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:05,930
It's the smell.

240
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:13,040
I've thrown away that perfume pouch.

241
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,160
Why is the smell still lingering?

242
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:16,740
You've thrown it away?

243
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:17,839
Yes.

244
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,400
What?

245
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:29,770
You got nothing from me today.

246
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:32,530
Is that why you're sad?

247
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:34,050
Sorry for disturbing.

248
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:37,160
I'll leave first thing in the morning.

249
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:39,820
Right.

250
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,460
You're a busy man.

251
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:43,010
You should get going soon.

252
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:49,130
I'll drink to you.

253
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:51,540
Here's to...

254
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:52,770
a safe journey.

255
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:55,170
May you stay out of danger.

256
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:01,410
Why do you always
think that I'm not safe?

257
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:04,900
Do I?

258
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:09,920
I'm just saying. Don't take it seriously.

259
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:14,370
You sure can hold your liquor.

260
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:16,430
You can't stop drinking.

261
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,490
None of your business.

262
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:23,050
I can hold my drink
better than someone for sure.

263
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:47,250
Lantern Festival.

264
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:50,410
How beautiful that lantern is.

265
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:54,690
Why did the fire die?

266
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:00,410
The lanterns of this city...

267
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:04,970
all die in a night...

268
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:07,290
like fungus...

269
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:09,770
and cicadas.

270
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,730
Xu Jin.

271
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:29,090
You inauspicious man.

272
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,170
Go to bed...

273
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:35,020
or I'll put you in prison
for disrespecting me.

274
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:36,850
Let go of me!

275
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:51,530
What a handsome face.

276
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:00,970
What a sturdy physique!

277
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:04,810
Why did you die so young?

278
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,380
I remember.

279
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:10,530
I remember you said the same thing...

280
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,130
when you're drunk.

281
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:18,770
I won't die young.

282
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:29,520
Let me down.

283
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:38,390
You can't hold your liquor.
But you insisted on drinking with me.

284
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:46,010
I don't want to die.

285
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:47,930
I don't want to die!

286
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:56,880
You can't hold your drink,
and yet you drank a lot.

287
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:33,120
I feel so dizzy.

288
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:36,810
And I have no idea what I said last night.

289
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,850
I shouldn't have drank with Duke Su.

290
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:42,530
Duke Su went out early in the morning.

291
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:46,210
He left?

292
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:49,770
He seemed to be in a good mood.

293
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:55,330
Good riddance...

294
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:02,710
Ms Rong!

295
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,690
Ms Rong, bad news.

296
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:07,290
Ms Rong, Guan Ge is having chickenpox!

297
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:15,210
-Go get a physician now!
-Yes.

298
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:28,340
Miss.

299
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:31,230
Physician.

300
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:33,300
Guan Ge has had the medicinal larvae.

301
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:35,090
But it doesn't seem to work.

302
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:40,850
Miss.

303
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,630
The chickenpox your brother is having...

304
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:45,130
is an unusual case.

305
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:46,470
It came all of a sudden.

306
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:48,700
I can't do anything about it.

307
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:50,750
You're a physician.
If you can't treat him,

308
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:51,900
what shall I do?

309
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:53,420
I'm not skilled.

310
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:55,590
You should get a physician
from the capital.

311
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:56,920
Maybe it's not too late.

312
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:59,190
I can only prescribe some medicine...

313
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:00,610
and hope for the best.

314
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:01,780
Physician!

315
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:03,630
We have all kinds of medicinal herbs here.

316
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:06,510
Lan Xiang, head back to the capital
and tell Father about this.

317
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:07,590
Ask him to save Guan Ge.

318
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:09,720
-Miss, your face.
-Miss.

319
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:25,790
Here's my instruction.

320
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:28,190
One of you will stay here and
send us food from time to time.

321
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:29,850
And the rest, you may leave...

322
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:32,010
to avoid getting infected.

323
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:33,810
Yes.

324
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:37,160
Leave some mugwort and firewood here.

325
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,100
The herbs are all in the kitchen.

326
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,830
I'm going to brew the medicine.

327
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:42,870
Lan Xiang, head back to the capital.

328
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:43,870
Miss.

329
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:45,900
Do as I said. Go.

330
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:16,500
Good boy,Guan Ge!

331
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:18,120
You'll be fine in a few days.

332
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:23,590
Your Highness, you're finally here.

333
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:25,510
Your Highness, where were you last night?

334
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:27,060
We were waiting for you.

335
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:29,480
We thought something had happened to you.

336
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:32,130
I was investigating it...

337
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:33,490
and found nothing.

338
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:35,950
Did you find out anything?

339
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:37,070
We dare not do it openly.

340
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:38,710
We're afraid people will find out.

341
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:40,050
But at this rate,

342
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:41,880
it's hard to find out anything.

343
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:46,290
Sir, this way please.

344
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:50,380
Thank you.

345
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:55,930
-I'll have a jin of beef.
-Sure.

346
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:04,290
Aren't you the one
who gifted me the pouch?

347
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:07,000
What a coincidence.

348
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:09,440
It's been only a day...

349
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:11,420
and you're looking like a million taels.

350
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:12,700
Thanks to you.

351
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:14,710
After receiving your perfume pouch,

352
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:16,230
I received a big order at night.

353
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:18,020
I shipped a box of jewelry out-of-town.

354
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:19,390
Must be for a rich family...

355
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:21,590
who's marrying a girl from our village.

356
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:24,430
Where are they moving it?

357
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:27,190
To some wilderness.

358
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:29,730
They're probably afraid
that we'd covet it.

359
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:33,320
Thank you.

360
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:39,980
Don't tell anyone...

361
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:42,290
about what I asked you.

362
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:45,640
Don't worry, I'll keep quiet.

363
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:50,770
Don't you think...

364
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:52,290
something is wrong?

365
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:55,090
What?

366
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:57,970
If it's a wedding,

367
00:25:58,150 --> 00:25:59,810
they would've made it public.

368
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:02,830
Why did they choose to
send the box at midnight?

369
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:04,830
Last night was Lantern Festival.

370
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:06,490
The street was full of people.

371
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:10,130
I'm sure they chose that time...

372
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:12,210
to send it to the wilderness.

373
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:14,770
And they're so generous.

374
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:18,270
First, they transported
the goods to the wilderness.

375
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:20,080
Once the carter had left,

376
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:22,690
they sent it to their stronghold.

377
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:35,740
Sir...

378
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:37,870
-What's the fare to the capital?
-Five taels.

379
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:39,110
-Let's go then.
-Sure.

380
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:40,250
Lan Xiang?

381
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:43,380
Lan Xiang.

382
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:45,280
Your Highness.

383
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:48,230
Why are you going to the capital alone?

384
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:49,750
Young Master is having chickenpox.

385
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:50,930
So is Miss.

386
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:54,460
She doesn't want us to get infected.

387
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:56,270
That's why I'm heading back...

388
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:57,850
to get Master.

389
00:26:58,230 --> 00:26:59,900
Your Highness, please.

390
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:01,940
Please save Ms Fu!

391
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:03,610
Lan Xiang, get up first.

392
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:06,820
Xu Jia,

393
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:07,910
go back to the capital...

394
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:09,770
and continue our investigation.

395
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:11,670
-Yes, Your Highness.
-Ge Chuan.

396
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:13,850
We'll go to the retreat together.

397
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,310
You can't enter this room!

398
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:18,250
Your Highness, you can't enter!

399
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:21,140
Why are you back? Get out now.

400
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:22,580
I had chickenpox when I was a child.

401
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:23,730
I won't get it again.

402
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:26,090
It's...

403
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:27,570
Mr Ge who treated me.

404
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:31,370
Mr Ge, please take a look at my brother.

405
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:35,260
Why are you...

406
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:36,620
Forget about me.

407
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:38,110
Let's help Guan Ge first.

408
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:51,010
Your Highness. Ms Fu.

409
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:54,160
Young Master isn't having chickenpox.

410
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:55,920
What?

411
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:59,710
It's more likely a poison called
Three Days of Withering.

412
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:01,150
It causes unconsciousness...

413
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:02,350
and blisters all over the body.

414
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:03,650
Just like chickenpox.

415
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:05,250
Kids are weak.

416
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:08,210
They usually die within a day
of being poisoned.

417
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:10,910
Luckily you fed him medicinal herbs...

418
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:13,030
which delayed the poison
from spreading.

419
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:14,700
Or else even deities...

420
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:16,390
wouldn't be able to save him.

421
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:19,140
I'll write you a prescription
and perform acupuncture.

422
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:20,740
He'll get better in two days.

423
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:22,690
You need not worry, Ms Fu.

424
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:24,620
Mr Ge,

425
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:26,230
I'll never forget your kindness.

426
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:28,530
Miss, don't mention it.

427
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:31,680
I'm just working for His Highness.

428
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:34,250
You should thank him instead.

429
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:38,770
Thank you, Your Highness.

430
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:41,460
Mr Ge.

431
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:42,830
Please check on her too.

432
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:44,360
Since it's not chickenpox,

433
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:45,880
why did she get infected?

434
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,850
Here, miss.

435
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:57,320
You've been poisoned too.

436
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:59,380
Young Master is young and weak.

437
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:01,350
Hence his symptoms are more severe.

438
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:02,380
I'll write you a prescription.

439
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:03,630
Please take it at once.

440
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:05,930
That'll prevent new blisters.

441
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:10,390
Your Highness, I'm going to
write the prescriptions.

442
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:12,090
Mr Ge, please come with me.

443
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:29,120
I'll take my leave then.

444
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:30,850
Thank you for today, Mr Ge.

445
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:33,260
Lan Xiang, send Mr Ge to his room.

446
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:35,720
Yes. Mr Ge, this way please.

447
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:48,770
Is Guan Ge better now?

448
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:56,080
You saved our lives today.

449
00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:00,680
Even if you suspect me again...

450
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:01,990
and put me into prison,

451
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:03,370
I wouldn't mind.

452
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:11,480
I guess I was wrong about you all along.

453
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:19,570
Why did you...

454
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:22,250
care about this bracelet so much?

455
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:24,050
A month ago,

456
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:28,870
I returned to the capital to investigate
the army ration corruption case.

457
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:29,970
Since then,

458
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:31,890
many people have been killed.

459
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:36,050
After Qi Ce died,

460
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:38,650
I found in his letter...

461
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:43,010
a pattern similar to that
on your bracelet.

462
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:45,110
That's why I wanted to know...

463
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:49,000
who gave you this bracelet.

464
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:54,450
This bracelet...

465
00:30:58,430 --> 00:30:59,430
Give me some time.

466
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:01,510
I'll definitely give you an answer.

467
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:04,500
Only...

468
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:07,290
Only if you believe me.

469
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:19,610
What are you doing?

470
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:22,070
It may not be chickenpox,

471
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:23,430
but it'd still leave scars.

472
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:24,810
I'd become really ugly.

473
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:28,250
A scar won't make any difference.

474
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:42,050
What are you thinking?

475
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:48,170
I'm wondering...

476
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:50,730
if I'll look...

477
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:52,690
as ugly either way.

478
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:58,410
You said...

479
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:01,600
you came to the retreat
to escape the heat.

480
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:06,800
Why did you store in the kitchen
so many medicinal herbs?

481
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:12,210
You won't believe it.

482
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:17,280
I dreamt that Guan Ge contracted...

483
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,510
chickenpox in the capital.

484
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:19,820
I got scared,

485
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:22,090
so I brought him here to avoid crowds.

486
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:24,250
Is that why...

487
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:28,100
you were so worked up when Ms Miao Ling...

488
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:29,680
took Guan Ge out?

489
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:31,100
Yes.

490
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:33,180
So I prepared those herbs...

491
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:34,850
just in case.

492
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:37,720
Did you dream of my death?

493
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:41,530
Why are you asking this?

494
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:45,060
Because when you're drunk,
you kept saying that...

495
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:46,490
I'll die young.

496
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:51,850
Did I?

497
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:54,930
You said that more than once.

498
00:32:58,350 --> 00:32:59,770
Maybe...

499
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:06,720
in wine, there's truth.

500
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:09,130
I just said what's in my heart.

501
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:17,980
I'm such an evil and petty girl.

502
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:19,390
I wished death upon you...

503
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:20,990
just because you suspected me.

504
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:22,410
I was pathetic and vile.

505
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:24,630
Thank you for forgiving me, Your Highness.

506
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:26,150
I'll repay your kindness even if...

507
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:27,830
it means be your servant in the next life.

508
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:29,580
And I'll repent.

509
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:31,710
When all this is over,
I'll go to Yunluo Temple...

510
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:33,840
and light a longevity lantern for you.

511
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:40,760
Your Highness, you're magnanimous.

512
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:43,770
You'll forgive me, won't you?

513
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:47,530
You're such a sweet talker.

514
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:49,850
What else can I say?

515
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:53,610
Thank you for today.

516
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:57,470
That's all?

517
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:04,420
As for the perfume pouch Guan Ge gave me,

518
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:06,230
you can get his thanks...

519
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:08,489
when he's up.

520
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:10,760
Wait.

521
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:14,400
I heard it all.

522
00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:17,300
Someone said...

523
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:19,590
she'll be my servant in the next life...

524
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:21,040
and repay my kindness.

525
00:34:30,219 --> 00:34:31,550
And the longevity lantern.

526
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:32,690
Don't forget that.

527
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:55,860
Little Marquis.

528
00:34:55,949 --> 00:34:57,220
What are you doing?

529
00:34:57,310 --> 00:34:59,770
You always practise until midnight.

530
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:01,190
And before the sunrise

531
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:04,320
you're back here again.
Are you trying to kill yourself?

532
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:15,550
I want to make up for the wasted days...

533
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:17,410
and try out for Corporal.

534
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:20,160
Little Marquis. Didn't you say...

535
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:21,930
you're not joining?

536
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:23,460
I'm not good at business.

537
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:25,170
But I'm good at martial arts.

538
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:27,470
Since I have a chance
to protect my homeland,

539
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:28,930
I can't waste it.

540
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:31,490
Little Marquis.

541
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:32,890
At last,

542
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:35,810
you've grown up.

543
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:39,460
You want to die?

544
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:40,620
Practice with me.

545
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:41,930
No...

546
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:49,900
Mr Ge is amazing.

547
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:51,230
It's been only two days.

548
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:52,950
Guan Ge has gotten much better.

549
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:54,830
Miss, there's already
a scab over your wound.

550
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:56,750
I'm sure there won't be any scars...

551
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:58,170
when the scab falls off.

552
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:04,400
There'll be no scars this time.

553
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:05,610
This time?

554
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,170
Was there a last time?

555
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:15,870
Why are you still wearing
the forehead marking?

556
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:18,370
Are you afraid I'll notice your scar?

557
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:38,390
The fever has finally gone away.

558
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:47,490
Miss, are you alright?

559
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:50,020
You've been busy taking care of
Young Master...

560
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:51,860
that you forgot about yourself.

561
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:53,480
I'm okay... I'm just tired.

562
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:56,430
-Don't worry.
-I'll ask Mr Ge to check your pulse.

563
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:57,900
You can't fall sick...

564
00:36:57,990 --> 00:37:00,250
when Young Master hasn't recovered yet.

565
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:06,700
I'll just stay here,

566
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:08,970
in case you get a temperature again.

567
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:26,350
Please.

568
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:42,140
What's wrong?

569
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:44,090
The poison hasn't cleared up?

570
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:49,150
Don't worry, Your Highness.

571
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:50,790
There's no more poison in Ms Fu's body.

572
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:51,910
But her body is weak.

573
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:54,170
She gets headaches from catching a cold.

574
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:57,140
I'll get Ms Fu medicine based on...

575
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:59,560
Sanjiu Apothecary Shop's prescription.

576
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:01,940
Ms Lan Xiang,

577
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:04,290
give Ms Fu the medicine three times a day.

578
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:05,610
Got it.

579
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:09,310
I'm friends with Ninth Uncle
from Sanjiu Apothecary Shop.

580
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:11,660
Their family prescription for colds...

581
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:13,170
is highly acclaimed.

582
00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:15,670
Just follow the prescription.

583
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:17,600
You need not worry, Your Highness.

584
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:49,210
Why are you here?

585
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:52,890
I'm here to check on Guan Ge.

586
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:55,130
He's much better.

587
00:39:17,310 --> 00:39:18,770
Did you do that on purpose?

588
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:20,570
Of course not.

589
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:24,840
Why is there a scar?

590
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:27,970
I'll ask Mr Ge for a prescription.

591
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:31,250
It might help to heal your scar.

592
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:32,650
Forget about it...

593
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:35,810
Perhaps it's destiny.

594
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:38,250
It makes no difference.

595
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:39,540
Yes.

596
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:41,530
You're not ugly.

597
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:45,540
I'm not ugly?

598
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:48,010
That means I'm pretty?

599
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:53,690
Do I look pretty?

600
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:02,530
Sister Rong.

601
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:05,290
Guan Ge has wake up.

602
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:06,450
I'll go get Mr Ge.

603
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:20,220
Don't have to worry,Ms Fu

604
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:21,990
Young Master is pretty much cured.

605
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:23,270
A little time and care...

606
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:24,630
and he'll be fully recovered.

607
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:25,740
Great!

608
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:28,860
Sister Rong, I still feel unwell.

609
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:30,480
Be good. It'll be over soon.

610
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:32,070
Guan Ge.

611
00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:34,730
When you went out with Miao Ling,

612
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:36,250
whom did you meet?

613
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:37,970
What did you eat?

614
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:40,650
Yes. Guan Ge, think carefully.

615
00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:45,460
-Guan Ge.
-Candied haws!

616
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:47,330
Slowly...

617
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:50,030
You want to get candied haws?

618
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:51,350
I'll have that.

619
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:52,570
The bigger one.

620
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:53,770
Sure.

621
00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:00,050
Guan Ge.

622
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:01,580
Guan Ge!

623
00:41:02,310 --> 00:41:03,490
Horse.

624
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:09,730
There's a horse here.

625
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:13,470
I saw a group of people...

626
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:15,990
pass by carrying many things.

627
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:19,090
And I followed them.

628
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:23,010
Why didn't you tell me?

629
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:26,260
Because a man told me...

630
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:29,890
not to tell others that I saw them.

631
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:31,660
Thank you, mister.

632
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:32,860
Don't mention it.

633
00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:36,820
-Is this your horse cart?
-Yes.

634
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:38,250
Here, take them all.

635
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:41,190
Don't tell others about
what you saw today.

636
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:48,570
Guan Ge!

637
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:51,170
Guan Ge!

638
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:54,660
Where have you been?

639
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:56,240
I was worried sick.

640
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:58,500
I'm sorry, Sister.

641
00:41:58,590 --> 00:42:00,170
Don't ever run off again.

642
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:06,700
Yes.

643
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:09,390
This candy contains
Three Days of Withering.

644
00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:10,490
No wonder.

645
00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:12,890
Guan Ge gave one to me.

646
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:14,730
That's how I got the blister.

647
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:16,860
Ms Fu, you only had one.

648
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:19,750
And you're an adult.
Hence your symptoms were mild

649
00:42:19,990 --> 00:42:21,490
But for a child,

650
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:23,130
it would've been fatal.

651
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:29,390
That man tried to kill Guan Ge.

652
00:42:29,470 --> 00:42:32,690
Guan Ge probably saw something
he shouldn't have seen.
