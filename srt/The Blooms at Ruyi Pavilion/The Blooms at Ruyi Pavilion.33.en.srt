What emblem is this?

5
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,190
This is the secret sign for the people
in the pavilion to keep in touch.

6
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:50,180
Your Highness.

7
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:52,509
You aren't a member of the pavilion.

8
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:54,660
But Master gave you this bracelet.

9
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:58,070
That proves you're the one
that she valued the most.

10
00:01:58,070 --> 00:01:59,470
If you are ever in danger,

11
00:01:59,789 --> 00:02:01,510
the members of the pavilion

12

when they see this emblem.

-In Ruyi Pavilion,
-Master.

14
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:09,400
there's a big secret room.

15
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:13,140
There are various scrolls inside.

16
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,740
We found the room.

17
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:17,410
But there was nothing in it.

18
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,960
All that's left is Ruyi Pavilion's ledger.

19
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,690
It seems someone
has tampered with it.

20
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:25,070
It must be the murderer.

21
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:26,430
Murderer?

22
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,320
Didn't Master commit suicide
and left behind a suicide note?

23
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,850
Master couldn't possibly commit suicide.

24
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,440
Master had devoted all of her time
and energy to Ruyi Pavilion.

25
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,240
Even if she wanted to kill herself,

26
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,640
she would have paved
the way for the future.

27
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,500
Master died a sudden death.

28
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,579
The scrolls have been stolen.

29
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:50,670
Someone must have done this on purpose.

30
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,790
It's not only that.

31
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:54,950
After Master's death,

32
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,230
there's a mysterious force

33
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:59,540
trying to win over
the members of the pavilion.

34
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:01,070
Those who refused to submit

35
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:02,510
would be shown no mercy,

36
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,660
especially Xiao Ba and I.

37
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:07,690
They've been pursuing us relentlessly.

38
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:08,760
Why?

39
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:11,280
The people who hunted us once asked

40
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:12,950
about Ruyi Pavilion's token.

41
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:14,260
I think

42
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:17,690
they probably thought
we know where the token is

43
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:21,170
since Xiao Ba and I served
by Master's side.

44
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,940
What token?

45
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:27,010
Most of the members of Ruyi Pavilion

46
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:29,000
don't know one another.

47
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:32,160
Not many knew of Master's identity.

48
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:34,170
So the members of the pavilion

49
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:36,520
take orders and act based on the token.

50
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,030
Otherwise,

51
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,829
if they can’t get their hands
on the token,

52
00:03:42,829 --> 00:03:45,890
they'll never be able to take control
of Ruyi Pavilion.

53
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:46,900
But...

54
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:50,180
But if they actually
lay their hands on it,

55
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,460
there'll be dire consequences.

that master trusted the most.

If we can find the token together,

63
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,810
we can restore Ruyi Pavilion

64

00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,840
but never plumed himself
on his accomplishment.

169
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,860
He has been guarding Zhangyang City
for Dayu.

170
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:28,230
It's very admirable.

171
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,280
It would be nice
if I had the honour to meet him.

172
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:37,740
When we travel the country

173
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,550
and pass by Zhangyang City,

174
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,780
I'll take you there to meet him.

175
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:53,510
[Duke Su's Residence]

176
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:53,380
Time and tide wait for no man.

177
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,830
Since Your Highness is willing to help,

178
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:57,490
I believe there'll be news
about the token soon.

179
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:59,100
I'm going to contact Uncle San

180
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,430
and find a way
to gather the rest of our men.

181
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,500
Is Uncle San the elder
that you talked about?

182
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:08,970
Why didn't he come to the capital?

183
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:11,070
Uncle San has a weird temperament.

184
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:12,800
It's better if I go and meet him.

185
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,350
You haven't fully recovered.

186
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:17,690
You need to be careful.

187
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:19,870
Thank you, Your Highness.

188
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,940
As for the token,
I'll need your help with it.

189
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:24,380
Don't worry.

190
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:26,220
Right.

191
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:29,220
Does Yuan know the secrets
of Ruyi Pavilion?

192
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:32,600
I don't know if Ms Gu knows.

193
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,440
Our master was a cautious person.

194
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,990
It was always a one-way communication
between her and the members.

195
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:40,830
But Master trusted Ms Gu a lot.

196
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:43,570
Perhaps she knows something.

197
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,070
Got it.

198
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:49,390
Don't worry. I'll contact you
as soon as I hear anything.

199
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,000
Take care, Your Highness.

200
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,360
Your Highness,
are you going to the palace?

201
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,730
Xuanhan raided Zhangyang City.

202
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:12,620
Zhangyang City has been captured.

203
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:14,230
That means your master...

204
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:16,070
Your Highness, quickly go now.

205
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:28,660
Xuanhan has succeeded.

206
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:28,850
[Reflect on your mistakes]

207
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:31,410
Not only did Dou Yan lose the battle,

208
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:33,150
he even defected to the enemy.

209
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,480
What did you say?

210
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:42,340
Dou Yan defected to the enemy?

211
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,380
Is it true?

212
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:47,330
His Majesty has gotten his dander up

213
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:48,610
and called for a meeting
with the ministers.

214
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:50,260
It's as true as it gets.

215
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,900
Good.

216
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,790
Very good.

217
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:57,520
Dou Yan is Xu Jin's master.

218
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,280
I doubt

219
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:02,750
Father won't lash out at Xu Jin this time.

220
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,900
An important government official

221
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,920
defected to the enemy
just before the battle.

222
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,400
How loathsome.

223
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,470
Convey my decree.

224
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:16,090
Immediately detain
all of Dou Yan's family members

225
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:17,960
and put them on the death row.

226
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:18,950
Father.

227
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:22,970
The Zhenbei General and I have spent much
time defending the frontier.

228
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:24,230
I know his character

229
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:25,810
very well.

230
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,770
He'd rather die in battle

231
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:29,500
than to surrender to the enemy.

232
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:31,950
There must be more to this
than meets the eye.

233
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:34,130
Detain Dou Yan's family at once.

234
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,190
Father, you can't do that.

235
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,280
Why not?

236
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:39,360
Father.

237
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:41,960
It's still early to jump to conclusions.

238
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:46,510
The Zhenbei General is a highly
respected person in the borderland.

239
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:48,470
If we detain his family now

240
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:51,920
and news of it reaches
the soldiers at the frontier,

241
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:56,520
I'm afraid the soldiers will lose the will
to protect Dayu.

242
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:00,350
It's no news that Dou Yan has defected.

243
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,610
Are you still trying to defend him?

244
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,480
Father, please reconsider it.

245
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:07,490
Your Majesty, please reconsider it.

246
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,280
Father, please reconsider it.

247
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:14,300
Father, our top priority now

248
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,410
is to deal with Xuanhan.

249
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:24,060
Convey my order.

250
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:28,400
The army near Zhangyang City
should assemble at once

251
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,940
to fight against Xuanhan.

252
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:33,440
Hezhou will provide troops,
army provisions and assistance.

253
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:37,640
The soldiers in Guanyan Town
must defend it to the death.

254
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,920
Don't let Xuanhan advance any further.

255
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:45,750
Dou Yan and his family will be dealt with

256
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:50,860
after the issue at the border is resolved.

257
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:53,590
Thank you, Father.

258
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,920
Your Majesty is wise.

259
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:59,420
Xuanhan's army is bearing down
on the border.

260
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:02,060
We need to increase the military strength
in the capital.

261
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,050
Father.

262
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:05,069
May I ask

263
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,530
-that you let me...
-Duke Su.

264
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,819
You're distraught because of Dou Yan.

265
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,920
If you lead the troops,
you'll surely act rashly.

266
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:15,410
Besides, you're injured.

267
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:17,740
Just rest in your residence.

268
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:19,900
Yes.

269
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,790
Father.

270
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:25,349
I'm willing to lead an attack on Xuanhan.

271
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:28,780
Hao'er.

272
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,050
But you've never led a battalion before.

273
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,930
Father, you can send the Pingnan General
to go with me.

274
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:38,440
All I know is that as a prince,

275
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:41,190
I should share the burden
for you and the people.

276
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:45,540
Father, please send reinforcements
and let me lead the troops.

277
00:17:58,330 --> 00:17:59,430
Princess Consort of Qingping.

278
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:00,680
Duke Huai.

279
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:04,470
Your Highness, you seem to be in a hurry.
Did something happen?

280
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,160
I'm going to gather the troops.

281
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,690
We set out for Zhangyang City tonight.

282
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:10,950
You're leading the troops?

283
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,800
This is a protective talisman that I got

284
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,130
from a temple
before entering the palace.

285
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,380
I've been carrying it with me
ever since.

286
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,720
It has kept me safe.

287
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:31,640
If you don't mind...

288
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,710
Not at all.

289
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,170
[Peace]

290
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,700
With this protective talisman,

291
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,230
I'll surely return safely.

292
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:43,760
When I do,

293
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:46,090
I'll thank you again.

294
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:48,160
Sure.

295
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,510
I await your triumphant return.

296
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:51,980
All right.

297
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:07,460
Your Highness, this is the new report
from the border.

298
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:12,850
Secret passages?

299
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,930
Why would Xuanhan

300
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:21,550
be familiar with the weak points
of Zhangyang City?

301
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,490
They had been

302
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,570
digging ditches and tunnels quietly

303
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,130
before sneaking into Zhangyang City.

304
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,630
Indeed.

305
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:33,790
From the looks of it,

306
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:36,880
they are well aware
of the military strength, defence layout

307
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,020
and supply status in Zhangyang City.

308
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,500
A few days ago,

309
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:43,880
The Zhenbei General sent reinforcements
to a nearby area.

310
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,770
Zhangyang City was not well defended.

311
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:48,370
Xuanhan's army was bearing down
on the border.

312
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:50,590
Why would there be such a coincidence?

313
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,050
Could there be a traitor at the border?

314
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:56,550
Someone must have leaked
the Zhangyang City defence layout.

315
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:57,680
From the looks of it,

316
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:00,620
someone did leak out
the secret information.

317
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,030
Your Highness.

318
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,500
What do you make of

319
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:10,540
the Zhenbei General's defection?

320
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:12,400
I believe that my master

321
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,040
would rather die

322
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,360
than to surrender to the enemy.

323
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,470
My lady.

324
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:40,180
Why are you sneaking around?

325
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,990
Who's sneaking around?

326
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,300
His Highness didn't sleep last night

327
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,700
and he's now having a discussion
with Mr Ge.

328
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:51,060
I'm just worried.
They've been in there for hours now.

329
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,580
Since you're worried,

330
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:55,160
why don't you knock on the door
and ask His Highness?

331
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,150
Well...

332
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:59,200
His Highness is busy dealing
with the war at the border.

333
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,600
It's not appropriate for me
to disturb him.

334
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:02,790
Forget it.

335
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,540
I wonder how the general's
family is doing.

336
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,570
Let's go.

337
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:17,160
[Duke Su's Residence]

338
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:39,130
Your Highness.

339
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:42,400
Did Rong'er make this soup?

340
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,390
Your Highness.

341
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:47,930
Her Highness went
to the Zhenbei General's residence.

342
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,370
Mrs Dou doesn't seem to feel so well.

343
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:53,450
Her Highness sent me to Sanjiu
Apothecary Shop to buy some cold medicine.

344
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:56,110
Then she asked me to prepare
some medicinal soup

345
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,960
and send it over there.

346
00:21:58,210 --> 00:21:59,200
But

347
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:01,550
Her Highness said
since she was making the soup,

348
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:03,080
she may as well prepare some

349
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:05,310
for Your Highness as well.

350
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:08,740
You may go now.

351
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:09,930
Yes.

352
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:20,310
[I should have visited Mrs Dou.]

353
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:23,230
[How thoughtful of Rong'er.]

354
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:41,030
[The person that I married in my dream
was Rong'er.]

355
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:03,710
Your Highness, why are you up so early?

356
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:06,530
Rong'er.

357
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:09,130
Have you been to Jichang City?

358
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:31,430
Have you recalled everything?

359
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:44,580
So it was really you that night.

360
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:48,560
That hibiscus pattern
embroidered shoes

361
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:49,910
were yours too.

362
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:55,720
My mother made that for me.

363
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:58,380
But Your Highness was drugged
at that time.

364
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:01,210
I escaped in a hurry
and left the shoes behind.

365
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:04,660
Why did you go to Jichang City then?

366
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:09,270
It's a long story.

367
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:11,380
I followed my master to Jichang City

368
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,760
but there were two low-ranking officials

369
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,770
who abducted girls in your name.

370
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,460
[So nothing has changed.]

371
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,720
[I married the girl
of my dreams after all.]

372
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,690
It's all right.

373
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:46,510
Ms Fu rummaged through all the drawers

374
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,360
and probed me to see if I know
the inside story of Ruyi Pavilion.

375
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,670
I think

376
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:53,260
she has found out
Liu Ru Yi's true identity.

377
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,940
Right now,

378
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:57,370
she must be looking for the token too.

379
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:58,720
Wen Xing.

380
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:02,590
Xiao Qi was living in Duke Su's residence
for such a long time,

381
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:04,350
and you just found out.

382
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:06,380
Where is he now?

383
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:08,260
I've neglected my duty.

384
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:11,330
I'll find out Xiao Qi's whereabouts
as soon as I can.

385
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:13,190
Also, the situation with Duke Su.

386
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:17,860
Since Nong Nong knows about it,

387
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:20,630
I bet Duke Su is aware of it too.

388
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,890
Xu Jia has been investigating
Ruyi Pavilion's affairs lately.

389
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:29,740
All right.

390
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,920
Since he wants to investigate it,

391
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:34,140
let him find something then.

392
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:38,340
[The highest goodness is like water]

393
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,940
Master must have intentionally

394
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:42,760
defected to the enemy.

395
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,310
Why do you say so?

396
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:49,380
According to the battle report,

397
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,780
the enemy moved westward

398
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,100
after capturing Zhangyang City.

399
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:57,260
Zhangyang City was captured
all of a sudden.

400
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:59,060
The enemy should go south first.

401
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:01,610
Attacking Guanyan Town
is the best strategy

402
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,460
because once we capture Guanyan Town,

403
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:05,470
Hezhou would be near at hand.

404
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,580
It's an affluent city.

405
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,550
Even if reinforcements
can’t arrive on time,

406
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:12,810
they can rest in the city

407
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:14,880
before attacking Dayu.

408
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:16,530
But if they go west,

409
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:17,940
there are also places like Jiuli.

410
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:20,050
It's sparsely populated
and easily captured.

411
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:22,210
If they succeed in capturing it,
they could repose there

412
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:24,010
before launching a big assault.

413
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:26,980
Master

414
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:29,640
must have persuaded the people of Xuanhan

415
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,980
with the same reason.

416
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,160
But everyone in the court thinks

417
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:36,240
that the Zhenbei General
has defected to the enemy.

418
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:37,500
Your Highness.

419
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:40,330
Should we contact the general

420
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:42,150
and help him fend off the enemy?

421
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:44,150
I've sent a letter to Hao'er

422
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:47,870
and asked him to try his best
to get in touch with Master

423
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,850
to formulate a counterattack.

424
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,560
I just hope it can all be done swiftly.

425
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:56,020
Otherwise,
if Pingsai and Jiuli are captured,

426
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:58,830
the consequences would be unthinkable.

427
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:01,060
Your Highness.

428
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:03,000
I found a member of Ruyi Pavilion.

429
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,690
Your Highness, how can I help you?

430
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:13,130
Mr Ge told me to see you
as soon as I got back.

431
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,970
He's a member of Ruyi Pavilion.

432
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:20,380
Do you recognise him?

433
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,630
Miss, do you still remember me?

434
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,760
I set up a stall outside Ruyi Pavilion

435
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:26,990
and have helped Ms Liu on my occasions.

436
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:31,660
I think I've seen you a few times.

437
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:35,660
Could you repeat

438
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:37,600
what you've told me?

439
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:39,050
Sure.

440
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:42,630
I was not involved in a lot of things.

441
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:45,080
I only know a thing or two about Qi Ce.

442
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:48,620
Back then, Ms Liu and the proprietress
of Drunken Spring Court,

443
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:50,080
Qin Qing, were in contact.

444
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:52,680
They did quite a lot of things for Qi Ce.

445
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,060
Later on, something happened to Qi Ce.

446
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:57,220
So Ms Liu began to work directly

447
00:28:57,810 --> 00:28:59,740
with Marquis Xindu and Duke Cheng.

448
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,850
In order to help Duke Cheng
transport sulphur and other things,

449
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:05,580
she went to Dong Fang Li

450
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,730
and threatened him with an old case
involving the Twelve Folding Fans of Shu

451
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:10,730
so that he
would work for Duke Cheng.

452
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:13,980
After that,
Dong Fang Li refused to play ball.

453
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,200
So Ms Liu

454
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:19,090
used Dong Fang Li's son,
Dong Wen, to threaten him,

455
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:20,870
driving Mr Dong to commit suicide.

456
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:21,920
You're spewing nonsense.

457
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,680
How could Master possibly
drive Mr Dong to his demise?

458
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,530
I'm only telling you what I know.

459
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:27,080
I dare not make up stories.

460
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:30,220
Go on.

461
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:31,540
Yes.

462
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:34,180
After Mr Dong's death,

463
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:37,500
Duke Cheng put Ms Liu
in charge of the explosives.

464
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:39,850
Ms Liu predicted the total solar eclipse

465
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:42,890
and found Shang Kai Yang
of Jichang City.

466
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:47,180
My master even had dealings
with Shang Kai Yang?

467
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:48,810
Was that why she went to Jichang City?

468
00:29:48,810 --> 00:29:49,800
Yes.

469
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:52,150
The reason why Shang Kai Yang
was promoted so quickly

470
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:54,680
was because of Ms Liu's
insider information.

471
00:29:55,410 --> 00:29:57,890
They milked Ten Mile Pavilion for profits.

472
00:29:58,350 --> 00:30:00,290
But they were afraid of being discovered.

473
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:04,350
So they used the total solar eclipse
as a pretext for blowing up Mount Tai.

474
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:08,060
Are you saying that

475
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:12,300
the Mount Tai's landslide
was orchestrated by my master too?

476
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,380
Yes, miss.

477
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:16,200
I'm not lying.

478
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:19,280
For man proposes, but God disposes.

479
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:22,050
Duke Su got wind of it quick enough

480
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:24,400
which rendered the plan a failure.

481
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:27,170
Ms Liu was afraid that
Shang Kai Yang would expose her.

482
00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:28,900
So she ordered him to be killed.

483
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:33,660
After that, Ms Liu felt that Duke Su
was constantly opposing her.

484
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:35,340
She was furious.

485
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,680
And was even planning
to get rid of Duke Su.

486
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:40,660
That's enough.

487
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:41,930
Say no more.

488
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:17,530
Rong'er.

489
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,240
That's impossible.

490
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,060
My master wasn't such a person.

491
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,510
Back in Jichang City,

492
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:27,920
Xu Jia captured a man in black
who wanted to destroy the ledger.

493
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,650
Her body shape
was very similar to Liu Ru Yi's.

494
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:33,540
Most importantly,

495
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:37,720
this was the weapon she used.

496
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:45,160
Due to lack of evidence,

497
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:47,370
I confronted Liu Ru Yi myself.

498
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:50,410
She told me to give her more time.

499
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:52,380
So I agreed.

500
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:55,050
-But I never thought...
-Your Highness.

501
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,690
I think there's more to this
than meets the eye.

502
00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:00,360
If that was the truth,

503
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:01,910
why didn't Xiao Qi tell us?

504
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:03,240
If he told you that,

505
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:06,390
would you still help him
find the Ruyi token?

506
00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:09,530
All he told us

507
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,810
was that Ruyi Pavilion
is an information broker.

508
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:16,230
But he didn't tell us exactly
who Ruyi Pavilion works for.

509
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:17,940
It shows that

510
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:20,330
Ruyi Pavilion only works for profit.

511
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:24,850
As long as it could satisfy Liu Ru Yi,

512
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:28,280
she couldn't care less
about the consequences.

513
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:29,920
The landslide at Mount Tai.

514
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,130
How many innocent people
were tragically killed?

515
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:33,290
It's not like that.

516
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,710
Perhaps

517
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,000
my master was coerced.

518
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:39,630
Or perhaps

519
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:42,460
there's someone else behind this.

520
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,070
Rong'er.

521
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:46,640
Do you actually believe that?

522
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,510
I do.

523
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,400
Compared to these
fragmented pieces of evidence,

524
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,860
I'd rather believe in
the master that I knew.

525
00:32:57,870 --> 00:32:59,850
She couldn't possibly be so vile.

526
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:00,920
Rong'er.

527
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:03,320
Stop fooling yourself.

528
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:04,400
Your Highness.

529
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:06,710
You went for broke
and trusted your master.

530
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:08,230
Why can't I?

531
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,070
I'm sorry.

532
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:15,220
I'm just...

533
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,430
Ruyi Pavilion is involved in many ways

534
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:24,170
and has made a lot of mistakes.

535
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:28,340
It's better to let it fall apart now.

536
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,710
Otherwise,

537
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,670
it will do more harm to others.

538
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:33,940
You want to find the Ruyi token

539
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:35,130
and restore Ruyi Pavilion.

540
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:36,730
This is no different from...

541
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:38,100
What?

542
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,800
Holding a candle to the devil.

543
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:46,200
I will find out who is behind this.

544
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:49,120
My master wasn't that kind of person.

545
00:34:12,489 --> 00:34:13,920
Princess of Xihe?

546
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:15,900
What a coincidence.

547
00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:17,389
Where are you going?

548
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:20,790
Are you going to Ruyi Pavilion again?

549
00:34:21,949 --> 00:34:23,750
Duke Su hasn't recovered.

550
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,820
Don't you know how to stay put
and look after him?

551
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:27,270
All you do is keep wandering around.

552
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:28,440
Jeez.

553
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:32,659
Why do you look so restless?

554
00:34:33,909 --> 00:34:36,750
What brings you here today?

555
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:38,639
I'm here to visit His Highness.

556
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:41,920
I'm worried that His Highness
might not be in a good mood

557
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:44,780
because of the situation
with the Zhenbei General.

558
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:47,239
Thank you for your concern.

559
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:49,820
Look.

560
00:34:49,929 --> 00:34:51,659
Does this look familiar to you?

561
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:54,489
This is the jade pendant
that His Highness gave me.

562
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:56,639
Suit yourself.

563
00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:05,660
Ms Fu.

564
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:07,400
Wen Xing.

565
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:10,140
Mr Ju invites you to a
meetup at Ju Shui Pavilion.

566
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:14,330
Lan Xiang.

567
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:15,930
Go over to Ruyi Pavilion

568
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:17,990
and tell them that I'll be late today.

569
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,170
Yes.

570
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:21,770
This way, please.

571
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:42,530
Did I see it right?

572
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:45,540
Wasn't that Duke An's guard?

573
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:47,240
I think so.

574
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:48,950
Follow them.

575
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:52,120
Fu Rong is too audacious.

576
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,000
What brings you here

577
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:05,800
today?

578
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:08,930
Can't I just come and pay you a visit?

579
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:12,400
Your Highness.

580
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,780
Are you in a bad mood?

581
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:18,260
Is it because of the Zhenbei General?

582
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:21,820
Your Highness.

583
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:24,480
As you predicted,
Pingsai has been captured

584
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,000
before Jiuli.

585
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,800
Xuanhan's army has been stationed
in Pingsai.

586
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:31,080
Pingsai has been captured too?

587
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,140
His Majesty has gotten his dander up

588
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:35,920
and issued a house arrest order
against the Zhenbei General's family.

589
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:36,980
Prepare the horse.

590
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:38,150
Enter the palace.

591
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,510
Yes.

592
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:41,880
Wait for me. I'm coming along.

593
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,280
Little Follower.

594
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:46,280
Nong Nong.

595
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:48,790
Your injury...

596
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:50,860
It's fine now.

597
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,660
You got injured because of me.

598
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:57,860
I couldn't visit you
even after returning to the capital.

599
00:36:58,490 --> 00:37:01,900
Duke Su got injured at Qingfeng Hideout
the other day.

600
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,140
You should look after him.

601
00:37:04,610 --> 00:37:06,390
He went to Qingfeng Hideout?

602
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,860
Didn't he tell you?

603
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:14,510
All I know is that
he's investigating Qingfeng Hideout.

604
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:18,880
He and I are safe now.

605
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,200
That's great then.

606
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:23,060
The weather is good today.

607
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:24,430
Let's go out for a walk.

608
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,220
Duke Su.

609
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:35,250
His Majesty is in a rage now.

610
00:37:35,850 --> 00:37:38,780
If you continue to kneel,
hoping to seek an audience,

611
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:40,050
I'm afraid

612
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:42,290
the Zhenbei General's family

613
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:45,330
will have to suffer more
than just a house arrest.

614
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:48,960
What about me?

615
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,030
Eunuch Wang.

616
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:53,270
Please inform His Majesty
that I would like to seek an audience.

617
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:54,260
Your Highness.

618
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:57,160
His Majesty doesn't want
to see anyone now.

619
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:59,100
You should go back now.

620
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,390
Your Highness.

621
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:11,570
If things go as you expected,

622
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:13,370
Jiuli will soon be captured too.

623
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:16,170
When that happens,
I'm afraid His Majesty...

624
00:38:17,290 --> 00:38:18,700
Now that it has come to this,

625
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:20,160
there's only one way left.

626
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:21,670
What is it?

627
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:24,220
But I'm afraid

628
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:26,910
it will implicate the innocent.

629
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:28,360
Your Highness.

630
00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:30,420
Wait for me.

631
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:32,320
Is there anything else?

632
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:35,770
When I went to your residence,

633
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:37,420
I saw Fu Rong on her way out.

634
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:39,950
But she didn't go to Ruyi Pavilion.

635
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:43,040
Instead, she got into a carriage
with Duke An's guard.

636
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,350
So...

637
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,570
So I asked Su Yu to follow them.

638
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:49,370
Su Yu, tell His Highness

639
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:50,690
where they went.

640
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:51,790
Your Highness.

641
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:53,110
I saw it with my own eyes

642
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:56,440
that Her Highness followed the guard
into Ju Shui Pavilion.

643
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:10,950
Nong Nong.

644
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:13,500
You seem moody today.

645
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:15,110
Is it because of Duke Su?

646
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,780
We have some disagreements.

647
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:24,500
It's normal for people
to have disagreements.

648
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:26,410
We don't always get what we want.

649
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:28,070
But remember this, Nong Nong.

650
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:29,820
No matter when or where,

651
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:31,380
or what you do,

652
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:33,200
you'll always have my support.

653
00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:35,370
Thank you.

654
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:38,510
You haven't fully recovered.
You should go back and get some rest.

655
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:40,890
It's still early. I can go back on my own.

656
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:41,970
It's fine.

657
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:45,050
I won't rest until I see that
you're back home safely.

658
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:48,650
No need to trouble yourself.

659
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:51,870
Your Highness.

660
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:14,390
Uncle, to think you actually
have the leisure

661
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,900
to lead a double life.

662
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:21,340
I didn't choose to become a duke.

663
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:26,760
But living life as Farmer Ju Shui

664
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:29,400
is what I want.

665
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:55,900
Your Highness.

666
00:40:55,990 --> 00:40:57,520
There's no need to explain.

667
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,110
What? Pingsai has been captured too?

668
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,350
Yes, I just heard.

669
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:07,210
They said Xuanhan is only taking a rest

670
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:09,410
-before pressing on to Jiuli.
-This is...

671
00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:10,290
What do we do?

672
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:13,060
The enemy troops couldn't have
marched right in without resistance.

673
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:14,870
Unless the Zhenbei General
defected to the enemy.

674
00:41:14,870 --> 00:41:16,520
Zhenbei General?

675
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,000
He's nothing but a traitor.

676
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:20,450
What a disgrace.

677
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:23,140
I heard His Majesty has put
his family under house arrest.

678
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:24,700
I wonder if it's of any use.

679
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:28,590
Your Highness.

680
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:31,190
There were too many people.
So it was inconvenient for me to speak.

681
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:32,750
But actually...

682
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:34,250
I...

683
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:35,850
You should rest earlier.

684
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:38,300
No.

685
00:41:38,450 --> 00:41:40,510
Our last issue has not been resolved.

686
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:41,880
If we don't communicate,

687
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:44,080
our misunderstandings will only get worse.

688
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,070
Resolve it?

689
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:46,520
How?

690
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:49,050
I want you to stay out
of Ruyi Pavilion's affairs.

691
00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:50,220
Can you do that?

692
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:52,620
I want you to stay away
from Farmer Ju Shui,

693
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:53,780
from my uncle.

694
00:41:54,330 --> 00:41:55,540
Will you listen to me?

695
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:57,900
You knew

696
00:41:57,990 --> 00:41:59,590
my uncle is Farmer Ju Shui.

697
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:02,230
Yet, you never told me.

698
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:05,320
You said we'd never hide anything
from each other.

699
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:08,340
Being so intimate with another man.

700
00:42:08,370 --> 00:42:10,230
Have you considered my feelings?

701
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:12,000
Also,

702
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:14,260
I went to the palace to see His Majesty

703
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,370
but he turned his back on me.

704
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:18,950
My father and I are drifting apart

705
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:20,530
all because of you.

706
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:22,450
Right now, my master is in trouble

707
00:42:22,450 --> 00:42:24,050
and there's nothing I can do.

708
00:42:24,210 --> 00:42:25,640
All of this

709
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,790
is because of you.

710
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:31,450
All I can feel now is regret.

711
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:34,700
What do you regret?

712
00:42:34,990 --> 00:42:36,240
Marrying you.
