00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:40,890
The antidote!

176
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:42,440
Where's the antidote?

177
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:45,290
There's no antidote.

178
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:46,850
Impossible.

179
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,140
Impossible, there must be a way.

180
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,210
Rong'er, let's go find Mr Ge.

181
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:54,950
Nong Nong.

182
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:57,280
I didn't expect

183
00:20:57,850 --> 00:20:59,930
that you'd die for him.

184
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:02,150
But he's not worth it.

185
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,240
He's not worth it.

186
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:07,280
If that's the case,

187
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,210
I'll accompany you.

188
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:37,320
[You are Little Follower?]

189
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,830
[Do you envy such love?]

190
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:41,820
[I only have one wish in life,]

191
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,220
[to live for one person.]

-Duke Su.
-My lady!

193
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,760
Duke Su.

194

-Quickly.
-Your Highness.

195
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:42,080
-Concubine Rong...
-Help me up.

196
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,770

197
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,200
-Ping'er.
-Rong'er.

198
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,460
-Mistress.
-Ping'er.

199
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:52,250
Ping'er.

200
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,990
Rong'er, hang in there.

201
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,130
Ping'er.

202
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:04,190
Mother.

203
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,250
Ping'er.

204
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,120
Ping'er.

205
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:11,060
I am still alive.

206
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,580
You've misunderstood Duke Su.

207
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:17,290
The Emperor was behind
the fire at Hong Fu Temple.

208
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:20,160
All the ministers wrote to the Emperor,

209
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:22,310
saying I would cause his downfall.

210
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:24,430
In order to protect me,

211
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:28,310
His Majesty sent me away
during the fire.

212
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:30,990
Mother.

213
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:33,360
All these years,

214
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,410
why didn't you come to see me?

215
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,410
I missed you.

216
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,060
By the way,

217
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,800
I've solved the chess game.

218
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:51,940
Ping'er.

219
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,070
It's not because I didn't want to.

220
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:58,030
You could only be safe

221
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:00,370
if I didn't see you.

222
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:03,280
[I used all the means to seek revenge.]

223
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:06,330
[I killed many people.]

224
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:09,350
[But the person who was really wrong]

225
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:11,740
[has always been me.]

00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:14,080
[I'm sorry.]

228
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,360
Ping'er.

00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:26,880
Ping'er.

230
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:43,570
Rong'er.

231
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:47,970
You promised me,

232
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:51,770
to travel the world with me.

233
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:54,650
I've thought about it.

234
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:57,340
In spring,

235
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,590
we'll go to Jiangnan

236
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,300
to see the flowers bloom.

237
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:04,830
In summer,

238
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,290
we'll stay in Xuan Han.

239
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:12,460
In autumn,

240
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:15,370
we'll visit Nanshan

241
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:18,120
to see the maple leaves.

242
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:21,170
In winter,

243
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:24,150
we travel to the south,

244
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:27,950
to the southernmost island

245
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:31,270
and bask in the sun.

246
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,120
You are family-oriented.

247
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:37,130
You'll miss Ruyi Pavilion.

248
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:40,500
You'll miss Guan Ge

249
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,290
and your mother.

250
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:45,400

00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:32,160
[Guang Yang Palace]

252
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,620
Both of you are all right.

254
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,480
Mother.

255
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:41,920
You said the same thing
for the umpteenth time.

256
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:47,090
Jin'er is finally all right,

257
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:48,990
but Rong'er got into trouble.

258
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:51,620
My heart...

259
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:53,950
I was smart.

260
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:56,100
I made a soft armour for Duke Su

261
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,320
and one for myself.

262
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:59,450
The poison didn't reach my heart.

263
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:01,180
It stopped at the surface.

264
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,620
All these years,

265
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:07,120
you have been crying non-stop.

266
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:08,850
Your hair has turned grey.

267
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,370
Don't laugh at me,

268
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:11,920
you're the same.

269
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:14,780
No, I didn't cry.

270
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:22,110
I'm sorry to make you and Hao'er worried.

271
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:24,180
Xu Jin,

272
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:28,030
do you have news of
Princess Consort of Qingping?

273
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:29,950
I went looking for her,

274
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:31,850
but

275
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,430
I couldn't find her.

276
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:37,020
Why are you looking for her?

277
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:43,490
She disappeared after that day.

278
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:46,010
I haven’t seen her since.

279

I'm just in time.

282
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,400
His Majesty has agreed

283
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:22,520
for me to bury the ashes of Ping'er

284

in the Valley of Flowers.

285
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:26,500
Did something happen?

286
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:28,300
No.

287
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:31,820
May I have a word with Mr Wen?

288
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:40,200
Mr Wen.

289
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:42,570
My sewing has improved.

290
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:45,370
Does this look like a little fat fish?

291
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:49,970
When can you come back?

292
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,510
According to Madam,

293
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:53,540
His Majesty already pardoned you.

294
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:56,600
You're to protect
Queen Dowager Wen and Duke An.

295
00:28:56,690 --> 00:28:58,150
His Majesty is kind to you.

296
00:28:58,390 --> 00:28:59,710
This time,

297
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:03,590
it'll take at least ten years
for you to come back.

298
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,200
This purse is for you.

299
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,680
Keep it with you.

300
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:10,790
I won't come back anymore.

301
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:16,480
There is no way Duke An and I

302
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:19,610
could redeem the wrongs we made.

303
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:27,660
You made a nice purse.

304
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,310
Give it to someone else.

305
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,080
Your Majesty.

306
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:43,940

Good.

Duke Su.

310
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:30,380
It was a challenging trip.

311
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,570
You've succeeded.

312
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:34,190
The credit should go to you.

313
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:36,010
I am very happy.

314
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:38,450
You'll be handsomely rewarded.

315
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:40,840
Thank you, Father.

316
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:46,600
Father.

317
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:48,930
I have a request.

318
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,050
What is it?

319
00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:55,530
The organisation you
asked me to investigate,

320
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,650
it's called Ruyi Pavilion.

321
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:58,900
Ruyi Pavilion.

322
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:03,120
I hope you could summon
the owner of Ruyi Pavilion,

323

Fu Rong.

324
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:16,230
Summon the owner of Ruyi Pavilion,
Fu Rong to the imperial court.

325
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:33,920
Your Majesty.

326
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:37,400
Duke Su told me,

327
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:40,020
you're the owner of Ruyi Pavilion.

328
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:41,550
Yes.

329
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:43,800
Fu Rong,

330
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:46,540
I've underestimated you.

331
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:48,270
Did you know

332
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,460
I ordered Ruyi Pavilion to be destroyed?

333
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:55,940
Since you're the owner,

334
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:58,020
you should be arrested.

335
00:31:58,830 --> 00:31:59,710
Your Majesty.

336
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:03,840
Ruyi Pavilion uses information
to help uphold justice.

337
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:07,150
Only the brave and righteous
are found in Ruyi Pavilion.

338

But they were taken advantage of
to engage in bad things.

339

In my hand

340
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:14,970
is a token to command Ruyi Pavilion.

341

I bring it here

342
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:17,410
for your usage.

343
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:20,430

00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:33,900
Father.

348
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:37,040
I was able to return alive

349
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:40,980
all because of Ruyi Pavilion's help.

350
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,880
It is like a double-edged sword.

351
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:44,870
Good or bad,

352
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,750
it depends on the user.

353
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:49,930
It takes orders from the royal court now.

354
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,030
It could be very useful.

355
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:00,190
Deliver my order.

356
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:03,030
Stop all actions against Ruyi Pavilion.

357
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:05,960
Those working in Ruyi Pavilion

358
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,000
will be reorganised.

359
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:11,190
Duke Su will be in charge of

360
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:13,660
the Department of Internal Affairs.

361
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:16,500
Thank you, Your Majesty.

362
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,610
Father.

363
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,810
I have another request.

364
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,310
What is it?

365
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,140
Please allow me

366
00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:30,680
to divorce

367
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:32,160
Concubine Rong.

368
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:43,570
[A Beautiful Day]

369
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,500
Both of you are being ridiculous.

370
00:34:09,139 --> 00:34:10,900
When I first received the news,

371
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:12,590
I almost fainted.

372
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:16,699
Duke Su insisted.

373
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:17,989
I had no choice.

374
00:34:19,449 --> 00:34:20,610
In Dayu,

375
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:23,780
it isn't appropriate to
promote concubine to wife.

376
00:34:23,889 --> 00:34:24,790
So,

377
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:26,980
Duke Su wanted to give me

378
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:29,670
an official wedding fit
for a legitimate wife.

379
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:32,080
He said

380
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:35,440
he wants me to wear the Phoenix Crown
in a decent manner.

381
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:42,920
Sister.

382
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:44,860
I've married twice.

383
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:46,610
When will be your turn?

384
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:47,900
She's right.

385
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:50,780
I...

386
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:53,610
Your Highness.

387
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,230
Your Highness.

388
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:56,730
The time has come.

389
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:57,820
Come out now.

390
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:01,190
He's in time. Go now.

391
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:07,260
Look at her.

392
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:12,470
Your...

393
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:19,340
Xuan'er.

394
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:20,790
What's the matter?

395
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,600
The time has come.

396
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,250
Step back.

397
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:28,990
Step back.

398
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:37,470
Close the door.

399
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:40,470
What is this supposed to mean?

400
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:42,390
-Don't close it.
-Little Marquis.

401
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:43,710
-We hold the door.
-Xuan'er.

402
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:44,670
To go in,

403
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:46,720
-you need to pay.
-Red packet money.

404
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,720
Red packet money?

405
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:49,740
Bai Qi.

406
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:51,300
I want a hug.

407
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:52,990
Guan Ge,

408
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:54,640
are you here to join the fun?

409
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,730
Bai Qi.

410
00:35:55,810 --> 00:35:57,530
Give me red packet.

411
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:59,470
Little Marquis, why do you stand there?

412
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:00,870
-Where's the money?
-No.

413
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:02,450
Nobody asked me to prepare for it.

414
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:04,310
You'll have to get it from Duke Su.

415
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,530
It's fine, I have an idea.

416
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:08,920
Ladies, let's talk.

417
00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:10,850
Let's talk.

418
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,250
No. Why are you like this?

419
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:14,170
-No.
-Pay up.

420
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:15,210
-Pay up.
-Pay up.

421
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:17,730
Sister,

422
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:20,390
are you still angry at him
for knocking you out?

423
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:21,720
It was for your own good.

424
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:23,070
This is the rule.

425
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:24,830
You're not married yet.

426
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,340
You mustn't help him.

427
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:31,170
It's only money.

428
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:32,320
I have money.

429
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:35,300
However, it has to come from
Young Lady Fu Xuan.

430
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:36,910
I don't manage the finance.

431
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:38,110
All the expenditures

432
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:40,210
are managed by Xuan'er.

433
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,950
Xuan'er, open the door.

434
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,160
Just pay up.

435
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,850
It's no use talking, just pay up.

436
00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:52,380
Yes, give us the red packets.

437
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,330
Pay up.

438
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:54,680
-The red packets.
-No.

439
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:55,600
Grab her.

440
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,120
Barge in.

441
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:00,550
Pay up, Little Marquis.

442
00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:05,430
Give us red packet money.

443
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,570
Open the door.

444
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,320
Sister,

445
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:09,980
when you get married,

446
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,740
you must give them
a lucrative red packet money.

447
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:14,380
What's the matter with you?

448
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,410
Stop making fun of me at this point.

449
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:20,360
Here.

450
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:28,030
Put on the Phoenix Crown.

451
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:29,860
Our Rong'er

452
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:32,470

[Duke Su's Residence]

Duke Su.

455
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:10,220
What did you just call me?

456
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,050
My dear husband.

[Elegant and Peaceful]

458
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,000
Did you have a good dream?

459
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,800
You're happy.

460
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,470
I had a dream like last time.

461
00:41:23,870 --> 00:41:25,650
But the nightmare became a sweet dream.
