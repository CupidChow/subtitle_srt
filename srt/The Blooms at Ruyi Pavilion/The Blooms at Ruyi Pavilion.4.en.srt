I didn't expect him
to plan for assassinations

He had to deal with official duties

160

The second person was Mr Zhao

He had an emergency at home

00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:19,200
[But she could come and go as she pleased]

174
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,460
[At first]

175
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,530
[I thought Qi Ce was just her customer]

176
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,610
[But she became more vigilant]

177
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:31,230
[Drunken Spring Court]

178
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,300
[And that gave the game away]

179
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,470
[I didn't dare to alert her]

180
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:34,210
[So, I sent someone to guard
outside of Drunken Spring Court]

181
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:37,260
Qin Qing

182
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:40,100
is indeed Qi Ce's subordinate

183
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,740
The recent assassinations
were indeed arranged by Qi Ce

184
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,380
But the most important thing right now

185
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:48,740
is to find the person behind
who gave the order

186
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,030
Even so

187
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:52,430
shouldn't they be arrested immediately

188
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:54,180
so we can interrogate them?

189
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,060
There you go again

190
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:57,890
What can we do if we arrest them?

191
00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:00,690
We have neither witness nor evidence

192
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,780
I'm afraid they might complain about
His Highness later

193
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:07,780
They will say that His Highness
was abusing his power against officials

194
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,380
It'll be hard to argue with them

195
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,620
For now

196
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,680
it's better to bide one's time

197
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,680
Find the right time

198
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:18,920
and force them to act again

199
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,580
Drunken Spring Court

200
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:22,530
looks like a normal brothel

201
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,050
but we don't know about

202
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:25,340
the inner situation

203
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,860
I'm afraid they'll be more vigilant

204
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:31,660
if there are a few
new faces customers suddenly

205
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:35,690
Young Master Wu, you can't go in

206
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:39,980
[Imperial Guards]

207
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,270
Wu Bai Qi

208
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:39,180
Think carefully

209
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:41,140
You saved me

210
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:44,860
but you only ask to compete
with me in archery

211
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:47,440
Saving you is just a small effort

212
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:48,820
I have money

213
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:51,020
Gold and silver don't entice me

214
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:52,530
Since it's a match

215
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,430
there should be a reward

216
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:58,620
If I win

217
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:00,730
I don't have to bow to you anymore

218
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,340
I don't need to be punished if I'm late

219
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:03,420
If I have something urgent

220
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:04,750
I can take leave anytime

221
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:05,700
Preposterous!

222
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:07,420
Alright

223
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,970
You've seen my archery skills

224
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:11,260
You're so confident?

225
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:12,640
If I win

226
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,220
I just need you to go to one place

227
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:16,450
If I lose

228
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:18,810
I'll go anywhere you say

229
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:20,090
How do we compete?

230
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,100
One person gets three arrows

231
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:26,060
The one who hits the bullseye wins

232
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:36,860
I can't take advantage of you

233
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:38,580
Since you let me shoot first

234
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,180
I should give up something too

235
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:42,060
I'll give up two arrows

236
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:45,780
-Young Master Wu is generous!
-Young Master Wu will win!

237
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,610
Young Master Wu is mighty!

238
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:13,450
Young Master Wu is amazing

239
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:15,650
-Hit the bull's-eye!
-Young Master Wu is mighty!

240
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:16,850
Young Master Wu is mighty!

241
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:18,900
Young Master Wu is amazing!

242
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:20,610
I'm quite lucky today

243
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,460
I hit the bullseye with one arrow

244
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:23,370
Your Highness

245
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:24,970
From now on

246
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:46,760
Amazing

247
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,500
Incredible

248
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:49,610
How did he do that?

249
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:50,570
It's amazing

250
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:52,930
You gave up two arrows

251
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,870
I returned six arrows to you

252
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:04,930
Where do you want me to go?

253
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,250
Just tell me

254
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,220
I...

255
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:12,570
I dare not have any complaints

256
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:17,830
I don't need you to go anywhere

257
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,430
I want you to indulge in sensual pleasures

258
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:22,650
What?

259
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,200
Your Highness, I'm a decent man

260
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:27,210
Wu Bai Qi

261
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:30,050
You used to go to Drunken Spring Court
with the others

262
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:31,130
I was just drinking

263
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:32,780
I shun evil influence

264
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:35,230
What do you want actually?

265
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:38,370
I want you to make a fuss
at Drunken Spring Court

266
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:39,250
What?

267
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:42,480
The assassination incident
few days ago

268
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:44,130
was related to Qi Ce

269
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,370
Qi Ce?

270
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:48,620
Why does it sound familiar?

271
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:53,960
Qi Ce is the current prosecutor of
Criminal Investigation Bureau

272
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,770
It seems that Young Lady Fu Xuan

273
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,370
is engaged to him

274
00:15:58,210 --> 00:15:59,270
What about the Fus?

275
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:00,750
It's unrelated to them

276
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:03,460
Drunken Spring Court is Qi Ce's nest

277
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:06,940
This task will be extremely dangerous

278
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:09,090
If you don't dare to go

279
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:10,620
I won't force you

280
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:12,660
I must accept that I lost

281
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,120
I'm not afraid of anything

282
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:15,140
However

283
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:17,740
this is an important task

284
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:19,940
You're willing to entrust it to me?

285
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:23,140
Are you not trustworthy?

286
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:34,210
You can rest assured

287
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:39,610
Little Marquis

288
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:41,540
Little Marquis

289
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:42,790
Are you alright?

290
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:43,770
Of course

291
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:46,580
Why did His Highness ask to see you?

292
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:47,530
To go...

293
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:50,330
That's our secret

294
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:51,540
I can't tell you

295
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:53,170
No

296
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:54,370
Little Marquis

297
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:58,880
Let's go

298
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:13,089
Ms Fu

299
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:14,569
My master wants to see you

300
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:17,140
Can't you see she's studying?

301
00:17:17,859 --> 00:17:19,130
It's quite late

302
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,380
She needs to rest

303
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:39,210
Thanks to you today

304
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:41,490
Fortunately, we two cooperate well

305
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:43,170
Without you

306
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:44,820
I wouldn't know what to say

307
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:47,160
I don't want to be punished by them

308
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:48,570
Sometimes

309
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:51,020
it's quite hard to serve
Young Lady Fu Rong

310
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:57,350
You're quite smart

311
00:17:58,890 --> 00:17:59,840
Mr Wen

312
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,930
Please don't tell Mr Ju Shui

313
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:04,180
Where did Ms Fu go?

314
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:07,820
She went out to do something

315
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:10,290
She didn't go to some place she shouldn't

316
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:11,170
I assure you

317
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:12,730
Really?

318
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:14,530
Yes

319
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:27,940
Sir, why are you so late?

320
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,290
Sir

321
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,810
Sir

322
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:34,360
You look new

323
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:35,780
Is this your first time?

324
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:36,690
Sir

325
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:38,160
Let's drink

326
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,370
I'll accompany you

327
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:41,680
Sir, come

328
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:43,370
Sir

329
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:44,640
Sir

330
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:46,570
Sir, which girl do you like?

331
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:48,730
Ask your courtesan to come out

332
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:51,540
You're interested in Ms Ya Le?

333
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:51,670
[Ya Le, Courtesan at
Drunken Spring Court]

334
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:54,450
Ms Ya Le never meets guests for money

335
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:56,890
These two are actually pretty good too

336
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:58,210
-Sir
-That's right

337
00:18:58,290 --> 00:18:59,410
-Look at me
-Look at me

338
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:01,570
-I want her only
-I'll find two new girls for you

339
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:02,530
No

340
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:04,030
Ms Ya Le is not free now

341
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,060
You offered hefty money to see me

342
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:08,090
I can't reject you

343
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:11,330
However, I haven't met you before

344
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,370
I guess

345
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:15,410
this is your first time here

346
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:20,810
Don't need to be nervous

347
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:22,930
I don't eat humans

348
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:27,380
Follow me to the room

349
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:30,990
Let me play a song for you

350
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:38,890
Little Marquis?

351
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:40,450
Long time no see

352
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:42,490
Why are you here alone today?

353
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:43,740
As usual, a room and

354
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:45,430
two jars of pear flower wine?

355
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:50,490
If anyone can make me happy today

356
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:52,450
this bag of silver

357
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:54,210
will be hers

358
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:59,240
-Give me
-Give me

359
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:06,430
Let me

360
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:22,250
Ju Shui Pavilion is indeed quiet

361
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:25,250
I wonder if I can meet Mr Ju Shui

362
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:28,490
Mr Ju Shui is knowledgeable

363
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:31,960
Rong'er must have
learned a lot during this time

364
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:42,990
Rong'er

365
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:45,160
Mother made some delicious snacks

366
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,490
I brought it here for you

367
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:47,690
Rong'er

368
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:51,210
Lan Xiang?

369
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,940
Where's Fu Rong?

370
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:55,960
She's not feeling well today

371
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:57,600
She went to bed earlier

372
00:20:57,810 --> 00:20:59,170
She's not feeling well?

373
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:03,080
Miss Rong said the disease is contagious

374
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:04,730
You must not go in

375
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:07,280
You used this method last time

376
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:08,770
You thought I don't know?

377
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:10,010
Step aside

378
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:11,890
This

379
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:14,210
Step aside

380
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:20,050
Rong'er

381
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:21,730
Miss Xuan

382
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:02,100
What's that?

383
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,420
Bao Zhu, close the doors

384
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,410
Take it out

385
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,940
What's this about?

386
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:32,290
What happened actually?

387
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:36,200
Miss Rong stole man's clothing
in the pavilion

388
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,000
and went to Drunken Spring Court

389
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:40,650
Miss Xuan, I...

390
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:42,890
I couldn't stop her

391
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:49,840
So you don't want to serve me?

392
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:56,680
How dare a broken brothel
pull a long face on me?

393
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:00,750
Today, I must find

394
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,600
a girl that I like here

395
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:05,130
Little Marquis

396
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:07,360
You used to only come to drink

397
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:09,410
This is unusual for you today

398
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,170
Sorry for asking

399
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:13,540
but are you really here to have fun?

400
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,360
Do I need to report to you?

401
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:18,820
What's with the people behind you?

402
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:20,970
Why?

403
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:25,010
Do you want to fight me?

404
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:31,610
I think you're drunk

405
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:33,000
Escort him out

406
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,250
Brat

407
00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:00,500
I'm not skilled

408
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:02,050
Thanks for your tolerance

409
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:07,310
Here

410
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,470
When I was playing the song

411
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,960
you looked restless

412
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,500
Is something on your mind?

413
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:18,960
No

414
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,520
It seems that you're not drinking enough

415
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:24,040
You won't open up your heart

416
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:15,960
I actually want to ask you something

417
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:22,440
Does Mr Qi, the prosecutor of Division
of Punishment and Investigation,

418
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,970
always come here?

419
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,080
Mr Qi?

420
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,640
I never heard of him

421
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,960
You spent a lot of money

422
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,350
just to inquire about this Mr Qi?

423
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,040
He

424
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,970
He asked to marry my best friend's sister

425
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:46,320
I heard he behaved sloppily

426
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,920
So I came to inquire about him

427
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,280
I see

428
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,400
I've been working here for a long time

429
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,160
but I've never heard of him

430
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,080
Sir

431
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,200
Time is of the essence

432
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,960
-Why don't we go to rest?
-Don't

433
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,960
It's hard to find an intimate friend

434
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,890
Let's drink

435
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,280
Come

436
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,700
Women disguised as men
to enter brothel is unpopular nowadays

437
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,520
You dare to drink like this

438
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,680
You're really brave

439
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:30,040
Ms Ya Le

440
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,160
Ms Ya Le

441
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,510
Come down, someone wants to see you

442
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,130
It has caused a disturbance

443
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,430
If I don't find a girl that I like today

444
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:52,680
I won't leave

445
00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:55,760
I was wondering who was causing a scene

446
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,640
Ms Ya Le is here

447
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,300
Are you satisfied now?

448
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,510
Little Marquis

449
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,800
I'm here now

450
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,840
This is better

451
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,830
That's great

452
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:08,970
Everyone, dismiss

453
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:09,880
Dismiss

454
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,560
Boss Qin, the guest upstairs

455
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:14,500
Just serve Little Marquis

456
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,460
Don't worry about the other guest

457
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,170
I didn't expect to meet you here

458
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:42,750
I don't want to drink anymore

459
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,260
I don't want to drink anymore, Ms Ya Le

460
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:47,260
I can't drink anymore

461
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:54,440
Sister

462
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,950
Don't marry that jerk

463
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:00,070
Which jerk?

464
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,140
Qi Ce?

465
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,900
Qi Ce

466
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,400
Zhu'er is a good girl

467
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,720
How could there be
a jerk brother like you?

468
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:19,920
Zhu'er

469
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:22,320
Zhu'er, don't be afraid

470
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:23,760
I'm here

471
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:24,800
Don't be afraid

472
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,680
Sister

473
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,920
Don't be afraid too

474
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:35,620
Father's safe, you'll be safe too

475
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
I'm here

476
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:40,880
I will protect you all

477
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:05,980
[Drunken Spring Court]

478
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:13,470
Sir, you're so late

479
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:13,390
[Drunken Spring Court]

480
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:15,910
I'm a little tired today

481
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,320
I'll go back and rest

482
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,240
Little Marquis

483
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,990
Don't go, Little Marquis

484
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,230
Little Marquis

485
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,560
Little Marquis, don't go

486
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:44,360
Boss Qin, when did you
have such a nice looking girl?

487
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,140
Why haven't I seen her before?

488
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:47,710
Ouch! Let me go!

489
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,790
-Go
-Just you wait and see

490
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,820
Ms Fu Xuan?

491
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:57,320
Little Marquis

492
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:58,760
Ms Fu

493
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,910
This is not the place for you

494
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,120
I came to look for someone

495
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,190
Look for someone?

496
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,640
You know someone here?

497
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:11,440
I'm in a good mood today

498
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,230
Tell me, who are you looking for?

499
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:14,110
I'll help you

500
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:20,150
Are you looking for a man in green?

501
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,440
You saw him?

502
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,280
Where's he now?

503
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,740
What a coincidence

504
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:30,470
He's upstairs in a private room

505
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:31,950
A private room?

506
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,800
Where is he?

507
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:44,800
There was no one when I came in

508
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,030
Miss, where did he go?

509
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,720
Don't worry

510
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,310
I guess he already left

511
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:52,070
I found out she's a girl

512
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,560
but I took good care of her

513
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,240
However

514
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:58,150
she seems to be inquiring
about a certain Mr Qi

515
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:02,280
Mr Qi?

516
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:05,530
Why did you follow me here?

517
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:06,680
I...

518
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,870
I was going this way

519
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,080
I didn't follow you

520
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,040
Thank you

521
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:24,690
Little Marquis, sorry for not
taking good care of you

522
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:25,900
Please come again

523
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:30,010
I was wondering why he acted so crazily

524
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:33,530
So his lover is going to marry Mr Qi

525
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:35,080
Thus he made a scene here

526
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,540
He wants to vent on someone

527
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:39,860
What's with that girl disguised as a man?

528
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:41,610
She came to inquire about Mr Qi

529
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:42,910
I thought she was a spy

530
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:44,040
I made her drink a lot

531
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,870
to interrogate her

532
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,110
I guess I don't need to worry now

533
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,750
That woman should be the second young lady
of Fu Residence

534
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:55,080
I guess she came to inquire
about her future brother-in-law

535
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:57,640
Tonight is really troublesome

536
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,070
Fortunately, it was just a false alarm

537
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,790
Why do you have an Adam's apple, Ya Le?

538
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,030
I want to

539
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:16,909
change my fate!

540
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:21,889
You want to change whose fate?

541
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:25,010
My sister and Duke Su's fate

542
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,270
You're so bold

543
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:29,590
You dare to change Duke Su's fate

544
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:32,449
Duke Su is petty and annoying

545
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:35,739
Get down

546
00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:38,880
Carry me

547
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:50,469
Xu Jin?

548
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:55,050
Just die by yourself if you want,
don't implicate me

549
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,870
Why would I die?

550
00:34:58,310 --> 00:35:00,750
Not only will you die, you'll die young

551
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,830
Didn't you just see my fortune?

552
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:06,760
You said I'll have a long life

553
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:08,870
You believe my nonsense?

554
00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:11,040
I said you'll die tomorrow,
do you believe me?

555
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,100
I'll die tomorrow?

556
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:14,510
Even if I die tomorrow

557
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:16,510
what has it got to do with you?

558
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:17,910
Do you want to die with me?

559
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:19,070
Nonsense!

560
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:20,950
Who wants to die with you?

561
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:24,500
I guess you really want to get down

562
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:00,640
Little Marquis

563
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:01,960
Stop following me

564
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:09,790
I still say the same

565
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:11,190
This path does not belong to you

566
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:13,430
Why can you walk on it but not others?

567
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:14,590
Little Marquis

568
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:17,350
Drunken Spring Court
has many pretty women

569
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:19,270
Why do you follow me?

570
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:20,270
Ms Fu

571
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:22,920
Why did you go to
the Drunken Spring Court?

572
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,200
I heard that you're engaged to Mr Qi

573
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:28,030
Mr Qi always goes to Drunken Spring Court

574
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:29,680
so you went to catch him?

575
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:31,270
Little Marquis

576
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:35,760
Although Mr Qi and I
are not formally married,

577
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:37,830
I still won't you have speak ill of him

578
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,800
This is not an act of a gentleman

579
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,680
Ms Fu

580
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:44,790
Going to Drunken Spring Court
is not necessarily to find women

581
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:46,880
I had other things to do today

582
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:55,070
Maybe Mr Qi has other things too

583
00:36:56,490 --> 00:36:57,750
What do you want to say?

584
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:04,670
You really don't know anything?

585
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:07,410
What do you think

586
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:09,030
I should know?

587
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:16,630
Thank you for helping me today

588
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:19,140
We two don't have any grudges

589
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:20,760
Why do you keep pressing me?

590
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,590
You'll make people misunderstand

591
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:30,790
Misunderstand what?

592
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:35,230
It'll make people think that you

593
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:39,230
like me

594
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:42,230
Because of jealousy

595
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:45,070
you speak ill of me and Mr Qi

596
00:37:45,290 --> 00:37:46,170
You

597
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:47,270
You're a lady

598
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,350
If you don't want to be misunderstood

599
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:51,800
please watch your mouth

600
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:02,750
I should be the one telling you that

601
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:11,310
Why do you want to go back to
Ju Shui Pavilion?

602
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:13,170
You should go back to Fu Residence

603
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:14,670
No

604
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:16,670
Rong'er

605
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:18,150
Rong'er

606
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:19,150
Stop

607
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:22,350
Who are you? Put my sister down

608
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,240
Rong'er

609
00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:27,690
Rong'er

610
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,180
[Su]

611
00:38:28,830 --> 00:38:29,710
I'm Xu Jin

612
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:32,060
Duke Su?

613
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:35,190
Sorry for offending you

614
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:36,270
Please forgive me

615
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:37,430
On the way

616
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:40,150
I saw your sister drunk as a skunk

617
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:43,150
I wanted to send her back to Fu Residence

618
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:44,230
Since you're here

619
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:46,190
please send her back

620
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:49,510
My sister is ridiculous

621
00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:51,350
Sorry for troubling you

622
00:38:51,350 --> 00:38:52,230
Don't worry

623
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:53,790
I used empty lanes

624
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:55,030
No one saw us

625
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:58,070
Thank you, Your Highness

626
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:02,550
She seems to be worried
about your marriage

627
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:05,690
There must be a reason
for her to go to the brothel

628
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:08,950
I understand

629
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:10,670
I won't be too harsh on her

630
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:21,280
Rong'er

631
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:33,670
Little Marquis

632
00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:37,540
Even if you're mad,
don't vent on the rockery

633
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:41,620
I can't believe there's such an

634
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:42,960
imperious

635
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:45,190
woman

636
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,210
Why hasn't His Highness come back?

637
00:39:51,270 --> 00:39:52,150
Your majesty

638
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,090
Your Highness

639
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:00,090
You've all done well today

640
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:02,350
Especially you, Little Marquis

641
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:04,870
It was just a piece of cake

642
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:12,510
This hairpin

643
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:15,670
is how Qin Qing delivers news

644
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:17,390
When Qin Qing has reports

645
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:19,050
she'll stick this hairpin

646
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:21,900
outside the window of her room as a signal

647
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:23,980
Opposite the Drunken Spring Court

648
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:25,950
is a restaurant named Happiness

649
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,360
The second floor is a private room

650
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:30,830
The guest can see
Qin Qing's room from there

651
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:32,830
I see

652
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:35,790
No wonder after watching her for so long

653
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:38,470
she never left Drunken Spring Court

654
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:41,820
I'll send someone to guard
at the Happiness Restaurant

655
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:45,080
If someone goes to the restaurant
when the hairpin appears

656
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:46,660
I'll send someone to follow that person

657
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:48,950
I'm sure we can find out who it is

658
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:52,600
Little Marquis is familiar with
Drunken Spring Court

659
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:54,160
I'll leave it

660
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:56,950
to you then

661
00:40:57,470 --> 00:40:59,730
Bring a group of people
to keep an eye on it

662
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:03,630
You've given the task to me

663
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:04,510
Don't worry

664
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:07,220
They won't get away

665
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:13,430
Your body stinks of alcohol

666
00:41:18,830 --> 00:41:20,580
So you like to drink too

667
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:22,350
We should drink together

668
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:24,870
Alright

669
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:27,990
I have a lot of good wine

670
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:29,750
Nu'er Hong, pear flower wine,

671
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:30,640
Zhuyeqing wine

672
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:32,300
Which one do you like?

673
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:36,550
Now?

674
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:38,700
Alright, anything

675
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:42,190
A jar of each type of wine.
We real men should drink until drunk

676
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:43,940
-Xu Jia
-Yes?

677
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:45,820
Get a few jars of good wines

678
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:46,890
We'll drink it here

679
00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:47,800
Yes

680
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:49,260
Wait a moment

681
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:50,900
Your Highness

682
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:54,450
Tomorrow, Little Marquis needs to work
at the Imperial Guards

683
00:41:54,450 --> 00:41:56,330
If he gets drunk and is late to work

684
00:41:56,830 --> 00:41:58,990
or if he smells of alcohol during work

685
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:01,140
he'll be punished severely

686
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:02,820
Ge Chuan

687
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:04,340
You don't drink

688
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:06,080
Why are you talking so much?

689
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:07,420
Xu Jia, bring the wine

690
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:09,240
-Punish
-Wait a minute

691
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:10,990
Your Highness

692
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:12,440
We have a lot of time

693
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:13,820
Why the rush?

694
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:15,430
I'll leave now

695
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:21,170
If you don't drink,
we'll drink by ourselves

696
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:26,960
Ge Chuan

697
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:29,470
Take a few jars of good wine
and send them to his residence
