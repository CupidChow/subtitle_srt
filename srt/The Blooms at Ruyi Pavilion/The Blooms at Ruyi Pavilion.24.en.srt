00:01:55,789 --> 00:01:58,450
The following event is
horseback flag hunting.

6
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,490
According to the regulated route,

7
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:03,090
the first person who can
clear all the obstacles,

8
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:05,070
come back to this place

9
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:07,360
and grab the flag

10
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:08,820
will be the winner.

11
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:10,750
Go!

12
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:42,820
Yes!

13
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,280
Who is that?

14
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:50,430
Come out now!

15
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,250
What a coincidence, Duke Cheng.

16
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:58,760
What are you doing here?

17
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:04,640
I saw Princess Consort of Qingping
and you left the event.

18
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,440
I wanted to talk to Her Highness.

19
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,310
Why is she not here?

20
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,510
What did you see?

21
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:13,880
What did I see?

22
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,040
What did I see?

23
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:18,850
Why did Princess Consort leave so soon?

24
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:20,480
Is that so?

25
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,810
Too bad.

26
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:26,910
Too bad Xu Jin's concubine
who is young and pretty

27
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:29,550
will be killed by beasts

28
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,350
in the wild today.

29
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:35,090
You must be kidding, Duke Cheng.

30
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:37,380
The wilderness is so quiet.

31
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,340
No way there are beasts.

32
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,180
It's too bad.

33
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:51,590
Your Highness.

34
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,170
Where is Concubine Rong?

35
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:54,980
She left the event suddenly.

36
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,720
She didn't allow me to follow.

37
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:03,680
Which way did she go?

38
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,620
Well...

39
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:31,680
What is wrong?

40
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,120
Nothing.

41
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,870
It's not safe to stay here. Let's go.

42
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:36,909
Stop!

43
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:48,790
Why are you so frantic, Duke Cheng?

44
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:52,970
When I was appreciating
the views in the forest,

45
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:54,970
Duchess Su appeared out of nowhere.

46
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:57,830
It seemed that
she had something to tell me.

47
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:00,750
But she left before she finished speaking.

48
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:02,990
What is wrong?

49
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,850
You can tell me.

50
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,560
Nothing.

51
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:08,940
Just now,

52
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:11,170
an animal chased after me.

53
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,460
That's why I kept running.

54
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:14,350
-I guess Duke Cheng didn't see it.
-You!

55
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:15,230
Enough.

56
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:16,900
The competition is going to start.

57
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,100
We should go back now.

58
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:22,350
Duke Cheng.

59
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:25,080
You seemed flustered.

60
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:27,080
You better keep your nose clean

61
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:30,450
in case His Majesty
put the blame on you.

62
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,140
Let's go.

63
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,700
Are you leaving with Duchess Su
alone, Royal Uncle?

64
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:39,790
I don't think it is proper.

65
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,020
We are Dukes.

66
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,300
What's wrong?

67
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:54,350
Are you trying to poke your nose
into my business?

68
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:00,800
You are right, Royal Uncle.

69
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:16,430
Are you okay?

70
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:19,110
I am okay.

71
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:21,550
Let's go. His Highness will get worried.

72
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:23,430
You still care about him.

73
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:26,900
Of course.

74
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,710
That's why he is my lover.

75
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,920
You'll get it when you find yours.

76
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,190
I have found mine a long time ago.

77
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,760
Hurry up!

78
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,450
Let me help you so that
you can walk faster.

79
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:41,990
Let's go.

80
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:09,840
Fu Rong!

81
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:15,820
Her hand is injured.

82
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:22,270
What is wrong with your hand?

83
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:24,620
It's just a small wound. It's okay.

84
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,490
I am leaving.

85
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:47,590
I encountered danger
when I was in the forest.

86
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:50,870
You are being jealous.

87
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,710
I was so close to death!

88
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,460
Fortunately Duke An saved me.

89
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:58,409
He repaid my kindness
for saving him last time.

90
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:02,290
So, both of you don't owe
each other anymore.

91
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:04,270
Your Highness, don’t worry.

92
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,470
I am indebted to you more.

93
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:08,190
More than three times.

94
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:16,110
I don't want you to repay the kindness.

95
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:17,340
I want you to hug me.

96
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,490
The result is coming out. Let's go.

97
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,250
Okay, I shall hug you.

98
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:30,050
Let's go.

99
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:49,690
It's Little Marquis. He won!

100
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,040
Guard the Emperor!

101
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:28,540
Young Lady.

102
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,220
Guard the Emperor!

103
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:32,980
Let's go.

104
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:41,040
Little Marquis.

105
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,740
Wake up.

106
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,000
Your Majesty.

107
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:49,990
I have accomplished the mission.

108
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:51,650
How is your injury?

109
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,850
It is just a minor injury. I am fine.

110
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,570
Though you were shot in secret,

111
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:57,370
you are still the winner.

112
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,590
Brave and skillful

113
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,210
is for none other than you.

114
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,240
Consort Duan.

115
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,400
Your nephew is indeed marvellous.

116
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,680
Thank you, Your Majesty.

117
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:13,170
Bai Qi has been really brave since young.

118
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:17,300
Wu Bai Qi,

119
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:20,780
I shall name you the Valiant General.

120
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:23,310
You will be leading
the Seal of Huxiao Camp.

121
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,580
Thank you, Your Majesty.

122
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:29,360
Miss Xuan, he is fine.

123
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:35,070
Duke An.

124
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:43,390
Find out

125
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,680
who shot the arrow from hiding.

126
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,660
Yes, Your Majesty.

127
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:56,020
Rubbish, you are useless!

128
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,120
It must be Duke Su

129
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:01,610
and Duchess Su
who had informed Wu Bai Qi earlier.

130
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:03,240
He was prepared.

131
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,600
You are right.

132
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:06,760
Uncle,

133
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,440
if it weren't for your mercy,

134
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:12,390
Wu Bai Qi wouldn't have had escaped!

135
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,030
Yes.

136
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,780
As His Majesty was at the scene,

137
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:26,640
I didn't want to make a scene.

138
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:31,060
It's pointless to say all these now.

139
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:32,930
I am trying to hold back my anger.

140
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:36,500
At the moment,

141
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:39,140
we can't harm Wu Bai Qi,

142
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:41,300
let alone Xu Jin.

143
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:43,940
Go now.

144
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,780
Teach Fu Rong a lesson.

145
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:49,520
Let me vent my dissatisfaction.

146
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:04,840
The arrow is not poisoned,

147
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:06,650
just some anaesthetic on it.

148
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:09,060
It makes one feel temporarily numb.

149
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,780
Your Highness is so great.

150
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,320
At that dangerous moment,

151
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:14,690
Your Highness broke the arrow into two.

152
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,080
You were brave too, Little Marquis.

153
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,130
He is now

154
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:20,890
General Wu.

155
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:22,830
I am in awe.

156
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:24,330
Stop calling me General.

157
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:25,650
It sounds weird.

158
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:28,390
I must thank Your Highness for saving me.

159
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:30,050
The arrow is not poisoned.

160
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,860
It seems that the culprit
did not aim to kill you.

161
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:34,660
They just didn't want you to win.

162
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:37,010
Ge Chuan.

163
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:38,580
Your Highness.

164
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:42,580
I shall investigate the list of
the candidates in detail.

165
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:46,590
Since you are fine,

166
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,600
I shall check on Rong'er.

167
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:50,370
Your Highness.

168
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,980
Where is Concubine Rong?
Is she out there?

169
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:54,860
Well...

170
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,570
Well, Young Lady Fu Xuan...

171
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,250
Rong'er is not here.

172
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:00,610
You should take a rest.

173
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,400
Hurry up, take a rest.

174
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:08,680
You should take a good rest.

175
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:18,690
Ms Fu, you are...

176
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:20,560
Rong'er's attire got dirty.

177
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,490
She will have to attend
a banquet with you later.

178
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:24,210
She needed a change of clothes.

179
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:26,270
That's why we exchanged our clothes.

180
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:28,520
Lan Xiang is helping her get ready.

181
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:30,590
She will make it to the banquet in time.

182
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:32,590
You have thought about everything.

183
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,470
Wu Bai Qi

184
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:38,860

185
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:42,330
Ms Fu, you should pay him a visit.

See you.

188
00:15:58,570 --> 00:15:59,670
Ms Fu.

189
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,280
Ms Fu, since you are here,

190
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:09,630
why don't you pay Little Marquis a visit?

191
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:12,960
I am here to pass a message
from Rong'er to Duke Su.

192
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:15,930
-His Highness...
-His Highness...

193
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,200
You are here to see His Highness?

194
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,080

197

She...

198
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,670
She has left.

199
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:47,800

200

Are you okay?

201
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:52,340
Be careful.

202
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:55,550
Are you thirsty?

203
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:56,820
Let me help you.

204
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:01,090
Why are you wearing Duchess Su's attire?

205
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:03,240
It's none of your business.

206
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:10,329
Well...

207
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:13,230
Did you see me capture the flag?

208
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:19,730
Don't you think that I am
extremely brave and attractive?

209
00:17:19,869 --> 00:17:21,140
Little Marquis.

210
00:17:21,369 --> 00:17:23,630
No one compliments themselves that way.

211
00:17:24,369 --> 00:17:25,910
Since you don't compliment others,

212
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:27,170
I am left with no choice

213
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:29,030
I have to compliment myself.

214
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:39,630
Turns out you have recovered.

215
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:42,580
Why did you pretend to be sick?

216
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:45,440
You have no idea how dangerous it was.

217
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,730
Fortunately I was blessed with
your bracelet.

218
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:49,390
That's why I am sound and safe.

219
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,730
Sit down, let me tell you the story.

220
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:55,030
A bunch of people were on the horse.

221
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,960
In short, thank goodness
for my fast reaction.

226

Okay, I am going to remove it.
Hang in there.

229
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:58,040

230

-I am here.
-Turn your head.

231
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,760
It is scary. Don't look at it.

232
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:06,930
Listen, Little Marquis.

233
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:09,130
Don't talk at the wrong timing. Bite it.

234
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,630
It will be very painful.

235
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:11,590
Bite it.

236
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,270
Get ready.

238
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,180
It's okay.

239
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:26,500
It's not painful.

240
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:28,000
It's not painful.

241

Mr Ge.

242
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:35,480
Is the arrow poisoned?

243
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,000
The arrow is indeed poisoned

244
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,380
but fortunately

245
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,700
it didn't pierce deeply.

246
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:46,440
It's okay.

247
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,000
The assassin escaped.

248

Duke An has instructed people
to look for the assassin.

doesn't feel as painful.

another part of my body is aching.

has passed out again.

Don't worry, Ms Fu.

264
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,910

265

He will wake up soon.

266

This is...

00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:49,940
I think this is a bird.

279
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,360
It's not a bird. It's a Mandarin Duck.

I thought the handkerchief
was blown away by wind.

Turns out someone
stole the handkerchief.

-Look.

are Merak and Dubhe.

Merak is connected to Phecda and Megrez

while Dubhe is connected to Alioth.

00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:18,430
He was injured at the back.

or is Ms Fu asking?

However, if Ms Fu had asked,

318
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:08,750
Wu Bai Qi had reminded me many times

319
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,420
to say that he is badly injured

322
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:22,080

511
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:23,450
While investigating Kushui Village,

512
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:28,900
we found that Marquis Xindu
went there quite often.

513
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:33,960
Of course.

514
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:35,940
I don't have enough evidence with me.

515
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:37,700
I don't get it.

516
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:40,430
Hence, I am here to inquire.

517
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,660
After all,

518
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:45,000
even a vicious tiger
will not eat its cubs.

519
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:48,390
I am no longer his son.

520
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:51,380
Even in that case,

521
00:40:51,610 --> 00:40:53,720
blood is thicker than water.

522
00:40:54,990 --> 00:40:56,490
I don't get it.

523
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:58,160
Why is he

524
00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:00,660
doing this to you?

525
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:05,440
Blood is thicker than water

526
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,400
but it is not thicker than money.

527
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:10,650
As for Marquis Xindu's agenda,

528
00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:12,310
I have made some assumptions.

529
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:15,360
Please don't report it to His Majesty yet.

530
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:16,900
Give me some time.

531
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:18,430
If I find any clues,

532
00:41:18,530 --> 00:41:20,330
I will definitely report to you.

533
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,140
Of course.

534
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:24,640
That's why I am here.

535
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:25,900
However,

536
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,950
if you have personal resentment
against him,

537
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:29,480
you can solve it in private.

538
00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:32,360
If there are other reasons,

539
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:35,730
make sure you don't forgive him easily.

540
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:38,480
Thank you, Your Highness.

541
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,120
Okay.

542
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,370
Don't further delay the matter.

543
00:41:49,370 --> 00:41:51,900
Please find out the truth
as soon as possible.

544
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:53,900
Yes.

545
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,790
Are you wondering

546
00:42:06,930 --> 00:42:10,360
why I told Wu Bai Qi about it?

547
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:13,390
I know that you intend to manipulate him.

548
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:15,680
However, according to
the clues given by Ms Gu,

549
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:18,060
in addition to my investigation,

550
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:19,590
it is safe to say that

551
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:22,240
Marquis Xindu's contact point
in the capital...

552
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,570
is the copper-ware shop
in the West of the city.

553
00:42:24,570 --> 00:42:26,770
We just have to attack copper-ware shop

554
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:29,240
and obtain evidence
from Duke Su's Residence.

555
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:30,850
Marquis Xindu will be
under the impression that

556
00:42:30,850 --> 00:42:32,980
Duke Su has found out about everything

557
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,220
and he would act first
to gain the upper hand.

558
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:36,620
Xu Jin, on the other hand,

559
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:40,280
will not allow the evidence in his hand
disappear for no reason.

560
00:42:42,090 --> 00:42:44,090
You have thought about everything.

561
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:48,150
Send someone to attack
the copper-ware shop tonight.

562
00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:51,280
The day Xu Jin knows about it

563
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:53,890
will be the day he dies.
