00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:01,420
you may stand.

176
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:08,850
The weather today is nice.

177
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:13,120
Accompany me to the garden for a stroll.

178
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:15,050
Yes.

179
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:22,510
Do you remember this set
of jewellery that I'm wearing?

180
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,350
Sunny Bright.

181
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,030
Yes.

182
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:30,810
A good jewellery with a good name.

183
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,360
Since you presented it to me,

184
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,070
I like it very much.

185
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,700
I often wear it.

186
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,460
It gave me a good impression

187
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:39,560
towards you

188
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:41,100
and Ruyi Pavilion.

189
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:43,580
Thank you, Mother.

190
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:46,420
I thought of you as a jeweller apprentice.

191
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:48,050
I never thought

192
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,210
you to be Jin'er's concubine.

193
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:52,760
I should've expected it.

194
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,430
Why would my brother

195
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:57,470
suddenly take great pains
for Ruyi Pavilion.

196
00:15:58,390 --> 00:15:59,810
You misunderstood me.

197
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,690
Back then, I did know His Highness.

198
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:03,440
But we were just acquaintances.

199
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,090
His Highness had helped me because of you.

200
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:08,400
His Highness and I
have never crossed the line too.

201
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,740
Don't worry.

202
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,490
I won't make things difficult for you.

203
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:14,720
Jin'er is an introvert

204
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:16,610
but he's affectionate.

205
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,290
I only hope you would understand

206
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,100
his affection for you.

207
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:24,180
Yes.

208
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:29,530
Since childhood, Jin'er

209
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,790
has been doing everything alone.

210
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,080
Now with you by his side,

211
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,730
he has someone to depend on
and accompany him.

212
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,580
Whenever I think of this,

213
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:39,930
I feel gratified,

214
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:42,400
I hope you can help him
manage the house

215
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,730
and save him from worry,

216
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,070
As for the remaining,

217
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,670
I don't care at all,

218
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:52,510
I understand,

219
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,340
Is your injury serious or not?

220
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,970
Thank you for your concern.

221
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,700
They’re really just superficial injuries.

222
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,550
I summoned you back to the capital

223
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:10,069
to help me purge corruption
among the officials.

224
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:12,619
Now, you've married Fu Rong.

225
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,170
It's time to focus.

226
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:16,839
You're right.

227
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:23,530
General Situ of Huxiao Camp is very old.

228
00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:25,420
It's time for him to retire.

229
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:28,940
I want to select a brave general

230
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:30,560
to reorganize Huxiao Camp.

231
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,780
Do you have a suitable candidate?

232
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:36,020
I want to hold a martial arts competition.

233
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:39,560
Let highly-skilled soldiers compete
with one another.

234
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:42,620
The final winner will be the general.

235
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:44,780
Father.

236
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:47,330
The Imperial hunt is about to start.

237
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:49,140
Why not

238
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:52,940
we organize the martial arts competition
on imperial hunting day

239
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,600
Kill two birds with one stone.

240
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,230
It's not a bad idea.

241
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,280
As for the person in charge
of the competition...

242
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,880
Let Duke An do it.

243
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,590
If you have any talented soldiers,

244
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:15,270
you can let them participate too.

245
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:17,870
It'll be useful for me in the future.

246
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:19,190
Yes.

247
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:21,440
You just got married

248
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:22,790
and are still injured.

249
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:24,640
Just rest at home.

250
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,180
When you recover,

251
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:28,560
I have an important task for you.

252
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:34,620
Thank you for your concern.

253
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,050
I'll listen to your advice.

254
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:42,150
What did mother tell you?

255
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:44,310
Nothing.

256
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:46,280
It's just some intimate conversations.

257
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,830
No need to worry.

258
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:50,120
Mother is kind-hearted.

259
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:52,840
I don't think she'll
make things difficult for you.

260
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,690
If you feel uncomfortable,

261
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:56,230
just let me know.

262
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:08,820
-Uncle.
-Duke An.

263
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:10,990
Duke Su.

264
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,390
Duchess Su.

265
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:20,040
Are you here

266
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:22,770
to inform my father
about the Imperial Guards?

267
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:28,830
I shall not disturb you then.

268
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:32,090
Rong'er, let's go.

269
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:53,510
How about this?

270
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,190
Just follow the old rules.

271
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:57,830
I like a straightforward person like you.

272
00:19:57,910 --> 00:19:59,060
Thank you.

273
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:04,650
Little Marquis.

274
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:07,990
It seems that Mr Qi is more generous.

275
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,360
Little Marquis.

276
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:23,170
Why are you here today?

277
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:25,120
I remember after the first time

278
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,910
we signed the documents,

279
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I never saw you again.

280
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:30,640
Mr Zhang.

281
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,050
I should've met you, a regular client
of Feng Lai Yi, sooner.

282
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,230
I'm sorry.

283
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:36,540
It's okay.

284
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:40,960
You're a corporal now.

285
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:41,960
You're busy.

286
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,630
Mr Zhang.

287
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,380
I didn't bring my stamp today.

288
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:48,880
How about this?
I'll go to Yongzou Music tomorrow

289
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,400
to sign the paperwork, okay?

290
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,990
Of course.

291
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:55,290
I'll leave now.

292
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,540
Mr Ji, Little Marquis.

293
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,870
See you tomorrow.

294
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:02,330
-Take care. Goodbye.
-I won't send you off.

295
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,530
Little Marquis.

296
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,570
I really didn't want to betray you.

297
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:16,010
It's Consort Duan.

298
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:19,400
Consort Duan keeps forcing me.

299
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,870
How dare you slander Consort Duan?

300
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,020
You're really dauntless.

301
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:34,040
I dare not do that.

302
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,150
Think about it.

303
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,470
Besides your stamp,

304
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:39,990
whose stamp can convince people
to sign a deal with us?

305
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,230
Whose?

306
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:56,170
Little Marquis, I had no choice.

307
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:58,030
Consort Duan asked for too much money.

308
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:58,110
[Consort Duan]

309
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,570
I can't please both sides.

310
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:00,940
Call me greedy,

311
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:04,680
but I dared not do it
even if you killed me.

312
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,780
The weather is hot these few days.

313
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:08,900
I asked Yipin Vegan

314
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:11,830
to send some new products
that can cool down the body.

315
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,290
I dislike sweet desserts.

316
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,900
Your Highness.

317
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,450
This hawthorn mixed nut cake
is not sweet.

318
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,770
It's fresh and tasty.

319
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:22,650
There is a lot of greenery
outside the room.

320
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:25,560
I don't feel hot.

321
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,160
That's right.

322
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:29,130
His Highness is powerful.

323
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:31,900
He's not afraid of summer heat
nor winter chill.

324
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,770
As for me though...

325
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:38,440
You're just weak.

326
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,780
Your body is too heaty.

327
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:43,060
Your Highness.

328
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:46,870
How about we send this dessert
to the palace?

329
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:49,080
There's only one portion.

330
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,710
It's too petty to send to the palace.

331
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:53,600
Besides,

332
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,340
the gate is closing soon.

333
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:56,770
In that case,

334
00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:00,110
I'll give it to other people in the house.

335
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:04,210
What for? I want to eat.

336
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:19,690
Madam.

337
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,240
Mr Ge came just now.

338
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,380
He said that

339
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:24,490
His Highness will sleep
in the study room again tonight.

340
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:26,120
Next, he said

341
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,400
the weather is too hot.

342
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,380
He's worried about your appetite.

343
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:32,800
So he sent someone to bring this

344

345
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:37,120
I can't eat this.

346
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,480
You two eat it.

347
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,550
Why?

348
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:45,960
She can't eat peanuts.

349
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,760
If she eats it,

350
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:50,290
she'll have rashes
on her face and hands.

351
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:51,860
It's quite scary.

352
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:53,260
I see.

353
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:57,160
It's a pity that His Highness
prepared this specially for you.

354
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:58,370
Madam.

355
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:00,920
His Highness just doesn't know
you can't eat peanuts.

356
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,460
He still cares about you.

357

You two haven't slept together
since being married.

358
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,430
If others knew about this,

359
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,750
it'd be...

360
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:10,990
He's injured.

361
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,590
If we sleep together, I might hurt him.

362
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,540
There's enough space in the room.

363
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:19,110
Did you and him quarrel?

364
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,910
Don't blindly guess.

365
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:21,990
Okay.

366
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,720
Since you didn't quarrel...

367
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,650
Mr Ge brought us desserts.

368
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:30,630
Shouldn't we give something back

369
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:31,850
or say thank you?

370
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,920
Let's go buy wine.

from Xianlu Wine House is quite nice.

-Okay.
-Let's give His Highness a surprise.

374
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:46,590
His Highness is at the study room

375
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,090
because he'll go out
in the early morning tomorrow.

379
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:56,990
I didn't go eat breakfast, tell them

380

-Same old rules.
-Yes.

Yes.

388

Her Highness seems to have heat stroke.

389
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,480
This is the physician
who came to check on her this morning.

390
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,890
It was not you two on duty

391
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,350
so you might not know.

392
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:38,640
I'm going to send him off.

393

Also to stop by Sanjiu Apothecary Shop
to buy some herbs.

394

You don't need to go yourself.

395

We can do it.

396
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:45,370
It's okay.

397
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:47,120
I've been with Her Highness
for a long time.

398
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,200
Besides, I know the boss of Sanjiu.

399

It's not appropriate for you to go alone.

Duchess Su got a heatstroke
and is not feeling well.

She invited a physician to check on her

But I think no physician
is as good as Mr Ge.

She hasn't been out of her room today.

She didn't even come out for lunch.

gave to Her Highness yesterday.

I'll think of a way for you
to leave Duke Su's Residence,

469
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:56,720

why didn't he kill Yuan?

there's no need for him
to go alone and kill people.

477
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:18,710
I thought he was the murderer
and became irrational.

00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,800
But after I've calmed down
and thought about it,

479

he saw His Highness.

00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:43,000
[Father, look, I found a treasure.]

514
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,210
[Rong'er, this...]

515
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:51,010
[Who's this?]

516
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,350
[He nearly got kidnapped
by human traffickers.]

517
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:55,280
[I think he's in shock.]

518
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:56,950
[Father.]

519
00:32:57,070 --> 00:33:00,510
[Our family will have a boy now.]

520
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,470
[What nonsense are you talking about?]

521
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:03,400
[If you do this,]

522
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,840
[you're the same as the human trafficker.]

523
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:08,390
[Boy.]

524
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:10,850
[Who are your parents?]

525
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:12,290
[Where's your house?]

526
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,030
[How about this?]

527
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:17,540
[I'll send you to the magistrate first.]

528
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:19,470
[Father.]

529
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:21,370
[Please.]

530
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:24,530
[Let him be my follower, okay?]

531
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:28,010
It's different now.

532
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,410
I miss the old days.

533
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:35,360
Fancy that you still remember.

534
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:37,120
I dare not forget.

535
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:43,390
But what happened to you?

536
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:45,530
Who were the people chasing you?

537
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:48,920
It is a past event of the palace.

538
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,630
It's not worth mentioning.

539
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,440
I won't ask if you don't want to tell.

540
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,120
It's quite late.

541
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:00,610
I'll go back now.

542
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:02,030
Let's meet again next time.

543
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:02,940
Nong Nong.

544
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:06,420
Be careful on your way back.

545
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:08,790
When you've given it some thought

546
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,130
and want to leave Duke Su's Residence

547
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:13,150
I'll help you at all costs.

548
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:17,190
Thank you, Little Follower.

549
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:19,219
But I want to

550
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:21,389
investigate this matter myself.

551
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:23,840
Okay.

552
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:34,139
Nong Nong.

553
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:36,909
I'm afraid you'll never know

554
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:39,600
the truth of this matter.

555
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,600
What's this?

556
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:51,710
His Highness knows that you and Lan Xiang
went out without permission.

557
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:52,880
He's furious.

558
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:56,230
What has it got to do with them?

559
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:58,480
It's so hot, get up now.

560
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,130
You heard her.

561
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:08,370
Duchess Su asked you to get up
Why aren't you up?

562
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:09,470
I neglected my job.

563
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:11,120
I'm willing to be punished.

564
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:14,930
This...

565
00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:17,220
It's me who did wrong.

566
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:19,410
I'll receive punishment.

567
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:47,480
Your Highness.

568
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:49,730
I know I was wrong, just punish me.

569
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,960
What did you do wrong?

570
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:58,030
I should abide by my duty as your wife.

571
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:59,580
I should stay at home

572
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:01,070
not disguise as a man

573
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:02,400
and go out.

574
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:04,030
It'd be really shameful

575
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:05,690
if someone recognised me.

576
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:08,030
You think I'm angry because of this?

577
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:11,380
Isn't it?

578
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:15,090
It seems you still don't know
what you did wrong.

579
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:20,370
Why can't His Highness be straightforward?

580
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:22,420
Just tell Her Highness that

581
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:23,560
he's angry

582
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:26,110
because he's worried she’d be in danger.

583
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:27,270
Yeah.

584
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,050
He's looking for a fight.

585
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:31,310
No matter what,

586
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:32,980
I was wrong today.

587
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,310
Please calm down.

588
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:37,450
Let those people get up first.

589
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:38,610
Fu Rong.

590
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:41,930
I know you didn't want to marry me.

591
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:44,680
But you're my wife now.

592
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:47,100
I want you to remember

593
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:49,660
that every wrong you make

594
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:52,050
will implicate others.

595
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:57,900
I know.

596
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,290
Get up, all of you.

597
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:06,370
Get up.

598
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:08,620
Get up.

599
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,430
Your Highness.

600
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:17,440
Her Highness didn't go out
for no reason today

601
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,210
Your Highness sent
hawthorn mixed nut cake yesterday.

602
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:23,180
So madam wanted to get a gift as thanks

603
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,030
and give you a surprise.

604
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:30,360
This is Lotus Stamen
from Xianlu House Wine.

605
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,720
Her Highness personally lined up
to buy it for you.

606
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:33,760
It's so hot.

607
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:35,620
-It wasn't easy.
-Lan Xiang.

608
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:37,040
Come in now.

609
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:39,180
You're asking to be punished.

610
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,560
Yes, madam.

611
00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:47,600
Madam.

612
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:50,760
I heard from Mr Ge just now.

613
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:53,550
His Highness thought you liked
yesterday's dessert

614
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:56,480
so he went to Yipin Vegan
to buy it for you personally.

615
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:57,980
He heard you were sick

616
00:37:58,250 --> 00:37:59,920
and came to find you

617
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,630
but you were not here.

618
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:06,470
Madam, it's my fault.

619
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:08,830
Not only did I fail to cover your leaving,

620
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,550
but when His Highness came,

621
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:12,670
I was eating cake.

622
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:14,130
No wonder.

623
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:15,520
Did you tell His Highness

624
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,180
that madam can't eat peanuts?

625
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:19,620
He was too angry.

626
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:21,700
He said he wanted to punish
everyone in the house

627
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,160
so I dared not speak at all.

628
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:26,760
Madam.

629
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:28,590
You should tell His Highness

630
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:30,630
that you can't eat peanuts.

631
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:34,760
His Highness looked
for you the whole afternoon.

632
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:37,490
But you lost your temper
the moment you returned.

633
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:39,210
You're too...

634
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:41,940
Madam.

635
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:58,130
Concubine Rong.

636
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:01,580
Perfect timing. Inform His Highness
that I want to see him.

637
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:03,140
But His Highness and Mr Ge

638
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:05,170
seem to be discussing something important.

639
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:07,570
He specifically asked not to be disturbed.

640
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:09,080
Something important?

641
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:14,310
Please don't get angry.

642
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:15,830
His Highness is a prince.

643
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:18,520
There must be a first lady in the house.

644
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:24,480
They're talking about finding
a first lady?

645
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:32,050
Okay, I got it.

646
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:33,850
I won't disturb them.

647
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,580
Yes.

648
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,330
Your Highness.

649
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:51,550
Since you have this plan,

650
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:53,390
why not

651
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,870
you tell Her Highness?

652
00:39:57,310 --> 00:39:58,800
Lest she knows nothing

653
00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:01,620
and misunderstood your hard work
in the future.

654
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:02,580
That's right.

655
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:03,640
Your Highness.

656
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:05,400
If you still won't sleep in the room

657
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:08,220
rumours may find their way
to the palace sooner or later.

658
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:10,020
You're asking for more trouble.

659
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:24,370
[What's wrong with her?]

660
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,270
[Why is she in a bad mood suddenly?]

661
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:29,730
[She's not usually like this.]

662
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:33,910
[Did something happen?]

663
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,320
Your Highness.

664
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:48,300
I'll leave now.

665
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:59,120
Why did you come here to sleep suddenly?

666
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:01,890
We're husband and wife.

667
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:03,960
It's normal

668
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:05,410
to sleep here

669
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:08,190
You're right.

670
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:12,720
I’ve done a bad job as your concubine.

671
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:16,020
I hurt you on the wedding night.

672
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:19,050
I haven’t served you in the days after.

673
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:22,490
Today, I disguised as a man
and sneaked out.

674
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:26,140
Fu Rong.

675
00:41:26,970 --> 00:41:29,770
I'm not asking you
to follow the rules in the house.

676
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:33,310
It's just that you sneaking out...

677
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,600
What if something bad happened?

678
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:38,240
I was also thinking

679
00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:42,990
if I hadn't sneaked out back then,

680
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:45,190
would I never have met you?

681
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,320
Maybe

682
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,600
our meeting was wrong to begin with.

683
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:55,800
What are you trying to say?

684
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:57,860
You think so too, right?

685
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:00,980
I can't be a good concubine.

686
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:05,380
Now in this house,

687
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:08,770
I'm just an extra mouth to feed.

688
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:12,460
Just an additional person
to make you unhappy.

689
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,490
It's meaningless.

690
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:17,260
Instead of this,

691
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:21,600
why don't we separate?

692
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:25,840
Fu Rong.

693
00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:28,980
Do you know what are you talking about?

694
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:32,660
I said let's get separated.
