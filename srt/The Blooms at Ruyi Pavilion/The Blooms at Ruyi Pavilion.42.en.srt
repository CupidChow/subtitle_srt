Will you go to the hospital?

No.

5
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:27,010

What are you doing here?

11
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,470
You had a fever last night.

12
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,160
But you refused to go to the hospital.

13
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,420
So I stayed and applied ice packs for you.

14
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,290
Why all the alarms?

15
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,560
Well, in case I fall asleep.

16

17

What was it?

18

27
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,060
Yes, he did.

28
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,480
But he's been stalling.

29
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,670
We only signed a letter of intent,

30
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,280
but not a formal contract.

31
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,480
So, he's not breaking a contract.

His Silver Moon Tassel
Hairpin was badly damaged.

34

It can only be repaired by Ruyi Pavilion.

35
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,340
Why would he go back on his words?

36
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,400
What should we do now, Ms Qiao?

37
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:59,710
Their exhibition's called

Do you know Feng Lai Yi?

41

They've been copying what

42
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:27,910
And they're organizing a "Past

43
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,420
That's your problem.

44

You should've tried to
figure out the problem

That's true,

47

but the problem is in front of me now.

48
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,350

Okay.

173
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:06,080
By the way,

174
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:08,070
it's my birthday tomorrow.

175
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:10,540
Would you go to the
amusement park with me?

176
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:12,270
Tomorrow's not your birthday.

177
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:17,310
I can have my birthday whenever I like.

178
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:19,270
I'm going no matter what.

179
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:20,910
You don't have to go.

180
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,040
Okay.

181
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:28,160
What if you break your promise?

182
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:33,050
Then I'd be a loser.

183
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,160
Thank you.

184
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:09,460
I thought you were annoyed and left.

185
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:56,350
When will the fireworks show start?

186
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:59,020
And it's not snowing as forecasted.

187
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:15,210
Why did you wear a
skirt in this cold weather?

188
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:16,940
Aren't you feeling cold?

189
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:18,600
I'm not.

190
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,170
But you're cold.

191
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,820
[Why is he always]

192
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:36,870
[blowing hot and cold?]

193
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:42,830
Hey,

194
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:45,790
Dreamlike Past Exhibition is coming soon.

195
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:47,580
What if...

196
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,430
I mean, the things we saw

197
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,380
in our dreams...

198
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:54,190
Do you think

199
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,500
they actually happened before?

200
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,040
Xu Jin.

201
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:03,910
Xu Jin.

202
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,190
Qiao Yi Rong.

203
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,840
You've broken the agreement.

204
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:55,310
