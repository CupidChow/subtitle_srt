[Episode 18]

4
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:43,550
Young Master

5
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:45,390
The Imperial Guards sent news that

6
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:46,990
they can't locate him in town

7
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:49,190
There's no news from the outside

8
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:52,710
What about that side?

9
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:56,580
The secret guards

10
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:58,680
discovered that Duke Cheng's men

11
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,270
were reallocated frequently

12
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:01,330
Not in the capital,

13
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:04,190
but in one Hu Village by the countryside

14
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:06,660
Hu Village?

15
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,949
Have a check on it tonight

16
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:13,630
Whatever you can find
about Liu Ru Yi's case

17
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:15,090
If there's anything on Hu,

18
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:16,990
keep an eye on it

19
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:20,390
He might be the key to rescue Nong Nong

20
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:22,490
Yes

21
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,270
This must be the place

22
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:31,270
I wonder how Mr Ge and Officer Xu are

23
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:32,670
after separating with us

24
00:02:33,829 --> 00:02:35,079
Xu Jia is there

25
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:36,480
Don't worry

26
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:44,310
Logically speaking,

27
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:47,280
not many will ride horses in such villages

28
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:48,670
From the hoofprints,

29
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,200
a number of horses came here

30
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:53,160
All equipped with horseshoes.

31
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:55,240
They wanted to kill Coroner Hu?

32
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:57,240
The hoofprints are all dried up

33
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,260
They must've been here for some time

34
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:03,370
If they've really killed Coroner Hu,

35
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:06,310
why did they malign you on a jailbreak?

36
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,760
They won't give up so easily

37
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:10,120
and leave just like that

38
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:12,670
We shall look for some villagers

39
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:14,640
and ask for information

40
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:17,270
I have a way

41
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:22,650
Don't rub it off

42
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:23,829
It's important

43
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,650
Your elegance and grandeur

44
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:26,990
will expose you

45
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:31,829
Don't be too composed

46
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:45,110
You two are...

47
00:03:45,829 --> 00:03:48,050
We're siblings who came from Yuzhou

48
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,150
for our relatives

49
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,920
But we came across some bandits

50
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:56,990
We met them at the Zhe Gu Hill

51
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:58,790
Why did you go to Zhe Gu Hill?

52
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:00,340
The bandits on that hill

53
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:01,790
are really arrogant

54
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:03,910
We're outsiders

55
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,370
We didn't know about it

56
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:08,240
My brother was beaten up
in order to protect me

57
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,530
We didn't eat and drink

58
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:10,950
after escaping from them

59
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,750
Can you keep us in for the night?

60
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:14,540
This...

61
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:18,110
We don't have money with us

62
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,990
But this still worth some money

63
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:21,910
Please keep us in for the night

64
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:23,620
This hairpin is too precious

65
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,580
Come in for the night

66
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:27,540
It's fine, you don't have to pay

67
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,350
-Come in
-Yes

68
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,310
It must be tough for you. Hurry in

69
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:32,490
-Come in
-Thank you

70
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,220
You're such an actor

71
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,350
They believed you

72
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:44,830
How can I win against you?

73
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:46,710
So straightforward

74
00:04:47,659 --> 00:04:50,520
If I was really good,
you wouldn't be making fun of me

75
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:52,370
But to be honest

76
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:56,130
They wouldn't have believed us
if you hadn't mentioned Zhe Gu Hill

77
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:58,150
Alright, alright

78
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:00,290
You've come all the way

79
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:01,440
You must be starving

80
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:05,050
-Here, have some porridge
-Thank you

81
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:07,230
My husband is in the kitchen,

82
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,950
making some dishes for you two

83
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,220
It's good of you to take us in

84
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:13,210
This is...

85
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:14,620
It's two bowls of porridge

86
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,660
It's not much

87
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:17,260
By the way

88
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:18,710
What is your surname?

89
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:20,210
How should I address you?

90
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,590
-Xu
-Fu

91
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,450
That's it, you can stop your pretence

92
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:28,290
I've already known about your identities

93
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:31,520
You two have eloped, haven't you?

94
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:34,900
Don't be shy

95
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:37,010
My family forced me into marriage too

96
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:38,830
After that I eloped with my husband

97
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:39,960
and stayed here

98
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:42,430
Therefore I knew at once

99
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:43,810
when I saw you two today

100
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:45,180
That's why I let you in

101
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,159
Ma'am

102
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:49,350
We're...

103
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:50,550
Yes

104
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,500
We're husband and wife

105
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,020
It's like this

106
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,030
My mother passed away early

107
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,680
The First Madam always bullies me

108
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,080
My father never cared and

109
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:05,900
he wants me to marry an old squire

110
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,710
as his eighth wife

111
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,830
I couldn't take it anymore

112
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:11,470
So I eloped with him

113
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:13,370
Then,

114
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:14,990
I came to look for my uncle

115
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:16,350
He lives in Hu Village

116
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:18,060
What's his name?

117
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:23,990
Hu Ming

118
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,590
Hu Ming?

119
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,930
Isn't he the son of Old Lady Wang?

120
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,780
He's a coroner in the capital

121
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:31,490
He's filial

122
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:33,790
He always comes home during the festivals

123
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:34,850
Where does he live?

124
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:36,500
When you go out from here,

125
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,230
walk along the pebble road

126
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,790
and you'll see a courtyard

127
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:40,820
That's the place

128
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:43,170
Then we shall...

129
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:44,990
It's so late now

130
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:46,530
The old lady must be asleep

131
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:48,200
You can go tomorrow morning

132
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:49,760
But we're sorry that

133
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:52,200
you have to make do with
our warmer tonight

134
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:53,920
That's all

135
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,390
Go and have some rest

136
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,510
I'll bring you a blanket

137
00:06:57,909 --> 00:06:59,310
One blanket?

138
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:01,010
Of course

139
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:02,430
The weather is not so cold

140
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:04,230
that you have to use two blankets

141
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:07,940
I'm just asking

142
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,520
Your...

143
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:15,510
My husband

144
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:16,920
What do you think?

145
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:20,590
I'll follow your cue

146
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:23,440
Let's rest early then

147
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:44,210
You're right on, Young Master

148
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:46,000
There was a coroner surnamed Hu

149
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:47,650
who went missing recently

150
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:50,300
It was said he returned home
for recuperation

151
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:53,620
Perhaps Xu Mao wants him

152
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:55,510
to have a rest in the nether world

153
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:57,430
The Imperial Guards pursuing

154
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:58,760
Duke Su is nearby as well

155
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:01,510
If the news is accurate,

156
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:03,670
should we increase manpower?

157
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:05,440
Send our own secret guards

158
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:07,390
if he resists, kill him

159
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:08,750
One more thing

160
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:11,710
Bring Nong Nong and Hu Ming

161
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:13,190
back safely to me

162
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:15,100
As for Xu Jin...

163
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:21,780
Understood

164
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:36,659
Nong Nong, you must return safely

165
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:50,330
I'll sit right here

166
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,630
Go and have some rest

167
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,530
You're tired after a whole day of walking

168
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:58,560
This is nothing to me

169
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:00,830
Hurry and rest

170
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:13,710
These are runnings from a girl's outfit

171
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:21,460
This was washed a few days ago

172
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:25,270
Perhaps the servants' clothes
got stuck by accident

173
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:32,690
You care about it?

174
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:35,870
I was merely asking

175
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:40,470
You care about it?

176
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:44,430
I was merely asking

177
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:47,130
You care about it?

178
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:50,590
I was merely asking

179
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,120
Men are approaching

180
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:09,430
We can't stay here

181
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,070
Innocents will be harmed

182
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:12,740
-Let's go
-Wait

183
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:16,950
Though she didn't want this,

184
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,350
but it's the only one I got

185
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:20,920
I'll compensate
with something better later

186
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:46,710
Let's go

187
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,810
Your Highness

188
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,270
More of them are coming

189
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:06,590
We can't keep running

190
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:24,250
Split up and search

191
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,680
Your hand

192
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:43,150
It's fine

193
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:04,870
Let's look over there

194
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,230
We must leave now

195
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:21,010
They'll return if we don't

196
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:23,430
But we can't return to the Hu Village

197
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:25,560
The most dangerous place is the safest

198
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:26,930
Not just going back,

199
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:28,560
we'll go to the Hu Residence

200
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,050
Let's go

201
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:36,440
Hide

202
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:45,300
Let's move

203
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,550
Won't they pursue us again?

204
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:52,870
Those people are ruthless

205
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:54,820
They're strangers

206
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:57,910
So they have to avoid the Bureau

207
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,610
and the Imperial Guards

208
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:02,630
So,

209
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,610
the Hu Residence is even safer

210
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,100
Thank you for letting us in

211
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,790
[Coroner Hu's mother]

212
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,930
You're not leaving my doorstep

213
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:16,150
If I didn't let you in,

214
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:19,180
you'd be luring them in

215
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:21,640
Here

216
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:23,440
Bandage your wound right away

217
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:25,870
You'll die if you bleed too much

218
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:41,310
You're clueless, aren't you?

219
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:42,230
Move aside

220
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:43,590
I'll do it

221
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,510
You should leave right away

222
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:50,510
after you're done

223
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,940
Since you've let us in,

224
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:54,950
please tell us where Coroner Hu is

225
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:56,790
We're not trying to harm him

226
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:58,780
We just want his post-mortem

227
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:00,750
The thing you said,

228
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:02,740
what post-mortem?

229
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:04,110
I don't know what it is

230
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:08,350
Hu Ming didn't return home at all

231
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:10,910
I don't know where he is

232
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,950
You're worried that we'll
lure the others here

233
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:16,030
But even if we're not here today,

234
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:18,030
you must have been disturbed lately

235
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:21,340
You let us in because you saw casualties

236
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:22,790
What a benevolent healer

237
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:24,990
I believe that Coroner Hu
was influenced greatly

238
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:27,250
and became such a formidable coroner now

239
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:30,850
Little girl

240
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:32,550
It's no use saying nice words

241
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:34,750
I truly don't know

242
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:39,350
How can you not know what is a
post-mortem as a healer?

243
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:41,110
These days,

244
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:44,030
groups of people came here

245
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,550
and left here repeatedly

246
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:48,510
It's useless for you to ask me

247
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:55,420
Those people are trying to be polite
before resorting to force

248
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:58,590
They might act desperately and harm you

249
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:59,580
That's right

250
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,880
If Coroner Hu continues to hide,

251
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,990
you may not see each other again soon

252
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:08,470
To be honest,

253
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:11,280
I'm the Fourth Prince,

254
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:12,480
Xu Jin

255
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,950
She is the one being set up

256
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:21,070
We just want Coroner Hu to testify for us

257
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:23,610
I'll definitely keep him safe

258
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:25,670
You're Duke Su

259
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:28,070
It's here. Search for them

260
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,470
Open up, open up

261
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,530
Open up

262
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:34,760
Why are you here again?

263
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:37,060
Make way

264
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,630
-You lot
-Move from here

265
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:40,730
What are you doing?

266
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:44,630
I said Hu Ming is not here

267
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:47,390
I knew you would say that

268
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:49,450
I'm done with your nonsense

269
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,460
Return to the capital with us

270
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:52,840
-You can't do this
-Move

271
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:54,630
-I did nothing wrong
-Be still

272
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:56,160
-You can't do this
-Be still

273
00:15:58,990 --> 00:15:59,870
Madam

274
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,560
The Criminal Investigation Bureau
took action

275
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,810
It's dangerous here

276
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,520
I'm fine

277
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,670
I'm worried about Ming'er

278
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,180
Do you know there's a Taoist
abbey under Zhe Gu Hill?

279
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:17,550
Hu Ming is there

280
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:19,300
Go to him right now

281
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:23,050
Walk towards the east once
you leave the village

282
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:25,570
Hurry and find Ming'er

283
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,540
After I meet my subordinates,

284
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,200
I'll send them here for you

285
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,030
Rong'er

286
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:39,560
Rong'er

287
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:44,000
Rong'er

288
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:45,610
Rong'er

289
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,020
Rong'er

290
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:48,540
Are you alright?

291
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:56,430
Let's go

292
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:51,000
To think we're greeted by this
after a narrow escape

293
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,290
Even if we died here...

294
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,630
I thought you didn't fear death

295
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,350
That's before I knew you

296
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,460
They're coming for us

297
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:18,630
You're highly skilled

298
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:19,870
You must hide

299
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,870
This happened because of me

300
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:24,350
I'll let them take me

301
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:26,400
They won't take my life recklessly

302
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,640
Take this fan

303
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:34,080
You can defend yourself

304
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,560
if danger comes

305
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:37,710
I don't want it

306
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:39,750
I know you won't run away alone

307
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:43,080
Just like how I won't abandon you here

308
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:46,720
But you kept this fan as a
weapon close to you

309
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,130
So I want you to take it

310
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:51,770
In this lifetime,

311
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,330
we'll never be apart

312
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,380
You're asking a girl's hand in marriage

313
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:07,700
with just a fan?

314
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:14,540
I'm keeping it

315
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,300
Don't give anyone else the same thing

316
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,660
This fan

317
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:26,960
is a one and only

318
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:28,240
My heart

319
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,410
is a one and only

320
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:52,060
It's better for me

321
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,470
to be alive than dead

322
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:59,460
We can spare your life if you're
willing to be captured

323
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:00,530
Don't worry

324
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:03,870
-Tie him up
-Yes, sir

325
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:14,980
Retreat

326
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,110
Commander

327
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:24,640
Thanks for saving us

328
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:26,280
Commander

329
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:27,760
We're not here

330
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:29,810
to rescue you today

331
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:31,440
-We're under orders
-I know

332
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:33,320
You're arresting me

333
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:35,980
We can't disobey His Majesty

334
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,320
Please forgive us

335
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:39,280
I should be the one to apologise

336
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:41,130
I feel guilty

337
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:43,070
towards every one of you

338
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:45,240
I left the capital

339
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:47,550
to search for the truth

340
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:49,340
Did you find any clue?

341
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:51,990
Wait till I return to Hengjing

342
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,900
I'll give you an answer

343
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:56,200
This...

344
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:58,980
From the day the Commander led us,

345
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,620
he never broke his promise

346
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:03,150
If he said he'll return to
Hengjing tomorrow,

347
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:05,350
then I'm willing to trust him

348
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:13,170
-I trust the Commander
-I trust the Commander

349
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:19,160
I'm willing to trust him too

350
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:21,510
It's getting late now

351
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:23,160
Hurry and leave, Commander

352
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:25,440
Before the gates close tomorrow,

353
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,900
we'll wait for your return

354
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,600
When I return,

355
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:33,290
I'll bid farewell to all of you properly

356
00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:35,510
Another thing

357
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:37,510
Send some men

358
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:41,030
to Hu Village to protect
Coroner Hu's mother

359
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:42,740
Understood

360
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:45,400
If you see Mr Ge on the road,

361
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:46,440
tell him

362
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:48,830
to meet me at the East Gate

363
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:50,040
Yes, sir

364
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:36,970
[I knew it]

365
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:39,060
[You wouldn't believe me easily]

366
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:51,310
[The Founders' Hall]

367
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:13,590
[Master]

368
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,540
Master

369
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,340
Is something the matter?

370
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,920
Do you remember me, Master Hu?

371
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,600
We met at Ru Yi Pavilion before

372
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:28,310
I don't know what you mean

373
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:30,380
You're smart, Coroner Hu

374
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,500
But you implicated your mother

375
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,700
She was nearly arrested yesterday

376
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:41,900
-My mother...
-She told us you're here

377
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:43,270
Your mother is fine

378
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:44,900
We're grateful for his help

379
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,710
Is the post-mortem still with you?

380
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:51,230
If not, they wouldn't be tracking you down

381
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,150
He is...

382
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:54,190
To be honest,

383
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:55,940
I'm the...

384
00:24:57,910 --> 00:24:58,790
My surname is Xu

385
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:01,110
His name is Xu Jin

386
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,630
Your Highness

387
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,320
If you agree to testify,

388
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:08,370
I'll ensure you and your mother's safety

389
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:09,700
Things have come to this

390
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:11,310
The Criminal Investigation Bureau

391
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:13,250
will never let me off

392
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,700
I trust you guys

393
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,930
I'll return with you

394
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,580
Your Highness

395
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,160
Ms Fu

396
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:31,520
Are you two alright?

397
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,570
We're fine. I'll enter the city first

398
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:37,770
You two shall escort Ms Fu
and Coroner Hu

399
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:39,890
Bring them to a safe place

400
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:43,370
-I'll follow you
-No way

401
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:45,670
If you enter now,

402
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,500
the Bureau will catch you right away

403
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:50,580
We don't know their dirty tricks

404
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:51,950
You'll suffer from it

405
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:54,020
-But...
-Wait for me outside

406
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:57,600
I'll let Royal Father reinstate
a joint hearing

407
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:58,950
to prove you innocent

408
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:02,840
Then you must fulfil it

409
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:03,970
Don't worry

410
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:05,610
For you,

411
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:07,340
I'll be fine

412
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:18,220
Ms Fu

413
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,880
If the Bureau wants to play dirty,

414
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,690
we'll take them on accordingly

415
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,410
Regardless, this is my matter

416
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:42,720
I can't let you go alone

417
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:44,410
I must go to the Bureau

418
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:45,710
Fu Rong

419
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:50,530
Your Highness

420
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:54,860
Your Highness

421
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:56,300
Young Lady Rong

422
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:57,670
I returned on time

423
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:59,020
I kept my promise

424
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:02,750
Rong'er

425
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:05,260
-Sister
-Rong'er

426
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:10,000
How did you know we're coming back?

427
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,920
You're here

428
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:21,230
Rong'er

429
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,760
It's been hard on you

430
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,010
I missed you, Sister

431
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:28,120
Thank you for all the hard work

432
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:29,380
in the capital

433
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:31,370
It's fine, Your Highness

434
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,760
What shall we do next?

435
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:34,740
I'll go to the palace

436
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:37,740
Fu Rong will go to the Bureau

437
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:53,240
That's enough

438
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:55,620
His Highness said you'll meet again

439
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:57,000
I believe Fu Rong

440
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:58,750
will be back home safely soon

441
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:02,230
I hope so

442
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:04,980
Anyway

443
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,310
Why did you come today?

444
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,550
You looked angry yesterday

445
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:11,440
You burned the paper that night

446
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:15,030
I thought...

447
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:18,530
[Tomorrow at the East Gate]

448
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:19,870
[Come if you trust me]

449
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,530
If you want to act,

450
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:29,030
how can I not cooperate?

451
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,320
It's just that

452
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,950
Guan Ge was injured

453
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,100
I was anxious about it

454
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,730
I burned the paper

455
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:38,290
for fear of eavesdroppers

456
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:39,790
How's Guan Ge?

457
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:42,720
He's fine

458
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,320
How did you know I was acting?

459
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:48,590
Couldn't I really betray His Highness?

460
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:50,050
He broke out of jail

461
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:52,010
He might disappear just like that

462
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:53,820
I had to look for a new way

463
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:57,160
I knew it was you

464
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,360
You wouldn't betray His Highness

465
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:03,070
Then...

466
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:04,880
I suffered a lot this time

467
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:06,250
Mostly for your sister

468
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:10,940
Shouldn't you thank me nicely?

469
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:13,360
Then...

470
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,180
I'll check Feng Lai Yi's ledgers for you

471
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:21,250
That's it?

472
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:24,370
I'm not becoming your accountant

473
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,570
Only if you're overwhelmed with work,

474
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,020
I can help with some

475
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:34,320
What?

476
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:36,360
Could it be that

477
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:38,450
you're not willing to give me the ledgers?

478
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:39,350
No way

479
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:41,440
You're not suspicious of me

480
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:42,880
How can I not trust you?

481
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:44,370
Get some rest first

482
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:45,950
You'll be busy afterwards

483
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:52,220
Nong Nong is back at the Bureau?

484
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:54,180
Ms Fu returned with Duke Su

485
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:57,930
The Imperial Guards took him
back to the palace

486
00:29:57,930 --> 00:29:58,970
We wanted to act

487
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,840
But we missed the chance

488
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:03,830
That useless Xu Jin

489
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,920
How could he let Nong Nong return
to that hellhole?

490
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:10,570
Useless

491
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:03,470
You're not playing?

492
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:07,950
Excuse my prudence, Royal Brother

493
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:10,750
I'm always losing

494
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:13,630
in our day-to-day games

495
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:17,020
This noise today

496
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:20,220
kept spinning around me

497
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,430
It disturbs my thoughts

498
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:23,900
If this continues,

499
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,040
I'll still lose the game

500
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:31,150
You

501
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:33,210
You're benevolent

502
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,520
We'll stop if you want to

503
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,200
Yes

504
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,270
Stop

505
00:31:56,630 --> 00:31:57,520
Royal Father

506
00:31:58,270 --> 00:31:59,160
Uncle

507
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:04,010
How do you explain the word Royal Father?

508
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:06,370
You're my ruler,

509
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:08,290
as well as my father

510
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:12,600
You lawlessly broke into jail that night

511
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:14,030
That's disloyalty

512
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:17,540
You hid your tracks and did as you please

513
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:18,960
That's disobedience

514
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:20,880
In your eyes,

515
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,190
there is no ruler nor father

516
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:32,640
You told me convincingly that you'll
take over the Imperial Guards

517
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,480
to search for corrupted officials for me

518
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:36,870
But now?

519
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,430
I'm willing

520
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:42,420
to bear all responsibilities by myself

521
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,470
I'll never forget

522
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,760
to look for the culprit

523
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:49,670
But a life is at stake

524
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,870
I can't turn my eyes away

525
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:54,130
Even now,

526
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:56,290
you're still thinking of

527
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:58,780
clearing the name of that female prisoner?

528
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:00,720
Fu Rong didn't kill anyone

529
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:02,260
She didn't jailbreak

530
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:05,200
But she was nearly beheaded in public

531
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:09,810
I'm not willing to see such
deceits happen upon you,

532
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:12,350
so I took the risk

533
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:15,660
This murder

534
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:18,110
contains plenty of suspicions

535
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:20,720
I beg you to look into it

536
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:54,410
[Upright and Honest]

537
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:56,150
Bring forth the criminal

538
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:00,960
Who is here on the court?

539
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:03,350
I'm Fu Rong

540
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:05,230
Fu Rong

541
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:07,860
With the presence of all judges today,

542
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:09,560
you must answer us honestly

543
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:11,710
If you make a false remark,

544
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,600
it's considered unforgivable

545
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,530
and your family will be implicated

546
00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:18,730
Understood

547
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:20,570
On the tenth this month,

548
00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:24,030
the owner of Ruyi Pavilion, Liu Ru Yi,
was found dead in her room

549
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:26,590
When the constables arrived,

550
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:29,780
you were the one holding the weapon

551
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,870
with hands full of blood by the body

552
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:34,889
Are you guilty of the crime?

553
00:34:35,969 --> 00:34:36,880
I'm not guilty

554
00:34:36,969 --> 00:34:38,030
Why must I confess?

555
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:41,010
Sure. Lord Ding

556
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:43,170
You were the one who caught her

557
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:45,730
Can you tell us what happened that day?

558
00:34:45,929 --> 00:34:46,820
Yes

559
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:49,670
Wait

560
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:56,870
Your Highness

561
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,040
Today,

562
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,070
I'll have a debate with Lord Ding

563
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:05,590
Your Highness, this might not be suitable

564
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:07,640
Which one of the law of Dayu states that

565
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:08,970
she can't have a lawyer?

566
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:10,610
Today,

567
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:12,780
I'm Fu Rong's lawyer

568
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:14,300
-My lordship
-Fine

569
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:16,510
There's no regulation

570
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:18,840
to forbid His Highness as Fu Rong's lawyer

571
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:20,280
Let's not delay

572
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:21,770
We'll begin immediately

573
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:23,920
Yes

574
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:27,380
I'm the prosecutor of the
Investigation Bureau

575
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:28,830
On the evening of the tenth,

576
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:29,870
I received a report

577
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:31,670
about an improper transaction
at Ru Yi Pavilion

578
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:32,790
Therefore I hurried

579
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:34,790
and arrived there at a quarter after

580
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:36,390
I saw Liu Ru Yi on the ground

581
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:37,870
with a dagger in her chest

582
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:40,830
Fu Rong was beside her with
hands full of blood

583
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:42,110
My lord

584
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:43,410
This is Coroner Jiang

585
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:44,690
The coroner of the case

586
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:47,600
Greetings, my lord

587
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:50,540
I arrived at six in the evening

588
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:51,910
As it was an emergency,

589
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:53,440
I roughly examined the body

590
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:56,020
Then I examined it again carefully
in the Bureau

591
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:58,510
Liu Ru Yi must've been killed
between quarter to three

592
00:35:58,510 --> 00:35:59,650
to a quarter to four

593
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:02,190
It matched the time when Fu Rong arrived

594
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:04,290
The weapon is that same dagger

595
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:06,780
Fu Rong

596
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:09,670
What do you have to say about this?

597
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:11,960
My lord

598
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:15,340
I did have a quarrel with my
master a few days ago

599
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:18,220
I wanted to apologise to her
on that fateful day

600
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:20,450
But I never thought I'd find her dead

601
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:22,250
when I arrived at Ru Yi Pavilion

602
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,660
Just then, Lord Ding brought his men

603
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:27,840
Then I was accused as the murderer and

604
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,020
took me into custody

605
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:31,720
I've seen plenty of murderers like you

606
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:32,600
I don't expect

607
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,800
that you'll confess to your own crime

608
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:36,110
Lord Ding

609
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,660
If I was so cruel to kill my master,

610
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:40,350
would I be so foolish to stay,

611
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:41,430
awaiting your capture?

612
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:42,910
We merely arrived on time

613
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,330
and you couldn't escape

614
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,540
From what I know,

615
00:36:46,090 --> 00:36:49,920
Liu Ru Yi has immense strength from
shaping silver all these years

616
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:52,550
But Fu Rong is weak

617
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:54,650
If they had fought,

618
00:36:54,930 --> 00:36:56,660
Fu Rong had no chance of winning

619
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:59,200
Why would she use such a way

620
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:01,790
to kill her own master?

621
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:04,820
What if she did it without
Liu Ru Yi knowing?

622
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:06,570
Lord Ding

623
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,670
That's a wrong speculation

624
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:10,430
It is written on the scroll

625
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:13,680
that there were signs of fighting
in Liu Ru Yi's room

626
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:16,990
The culprit must've fought Liu Ru Yi

627
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:18,860
and killed her after

628
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:21,570
These are merely guesses, my lord

629
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:22,970
Up until now,

630
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:25,260
she doesn't own any evidence

631
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:26,950
that clears her from the case

632
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:30,950
Could Lord Ding and Coroner Jiang's
post-mortem

633
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:32,870
be problematic?

634
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:36,020
Your Highness

635
00:37:36,330 --> 00:37:38,190
How can the post-mortem be wrong?

636
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:42,750
This one

637
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:45,190
is Coroner Jiang's post-mortem

638
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:47,420
It is written

639
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:50,610
that Coroner Jiang arrived at
four quarters to five

640
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:52,530
But from my investigation,

641
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:54,730
at a quarter to five,

642
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:56,720
Lord Ding arrived

643
00:37:56,810 --> 00:37:58,280
with another coroner

644
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:00,480
But without a reason,

645
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,110
this Coroner Hu

646
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:05,330
left with his post-mortem

647
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:06,660
Your Highness

648
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:08,870
Your words are overbearing now

649
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:11,530
Coroner Hu had some matters at home,

650
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:12,830
therefore he left

651
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:14,610
Your Highness

652
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:18,060
Is Hu Ming present?

653
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,180
Your Highness

654
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,980
I, Hu Ming, pay respect to my lordships

655
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:29,670
After I examined the body,

656
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,130
I wrote the post-mortem

657
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:32,950
After Lord Ding stamped it,

658
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:35,430
he suddenly told me to stay
away from the case

659
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,340
and asked me to leave

660
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,640
I then returned home

661
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:43,040
I took the post-mortem
with me while I left

662
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,730
But I was pursued

663
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:46,310
the moment I arrived home

664
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:48,910
I've been on the run since

665
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:50,400
Is that what happened?

666
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,900
Do you know who's after your life?

667
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:55,020
I don't want to make any conclusion

668
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:57,950
But please have a look, my lordships

669
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:01,860
When I arrived,

670
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:05,550
Liu Ru Yi's eyes and chin
were already stiff

671
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:07,900
Her fingers as well

672
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:11,110
Rigor mortis had already set in

673
00:39:11,330 --> 00:39:14,090
She had died around two hours ago

674
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,120
Fu Rong

675
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:19,940
Where were you two hours before?

676
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:21,270
I was at home

677
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,240
Any proof?

678
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:26,200
If you don't trust the people
in the Fu Residence,

679
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:29,410
you can ask the neighbours
around the residence

680
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:31,000
With all eyes watching me,

681
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
when did I go to the Ru Yi Pavilion?

682
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,580
I believe Lord Ding has found out

683
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,210
I was there before a quarter to five

684
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:42,830
Lord Ding?

685
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:49,710
-Yes
-How can Fu Rong murder Liu Ru Yi

686
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:51,560
when she's ten miles away?

687
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:53,100
If that's so,

688
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:55,680
Fu Rong is definitely not the killer

689
00:39:56,370 --> 00:39:57,970
Wise remark, your Lordships

690
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:00,150
But I want to know

691
00:40:00,370 --> 00:40:02,570
Since Lord Ding read this post-mortem,

692
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:06,230
why did he make Coroner Hu leave

693
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:08,640
and insisted that Fu Rong was the killer?

694
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,140
My lord

695
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:14,170
I didn't read the post-mortem closely

696
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:15,860
I roughly scanned through it

697
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:17,850
And Coroner Jiang was here

698
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:21,050
because I was concerned about
Coroner Hu's experience and

699
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:22,730
couldn't write a clear post-mortem

700
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:25,760
I bet you yourself
wouldn't believe those words

701
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:30,690
I was a fool

702
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:32,680
I thought that this was a big case

703
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,880
If I can solve it, I'll earn a great merit

704
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:38,210
So I thought of using my relative
to push away Coroner Hu

705
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:40,140
As for the post-mortem,

706
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:42,070
I really didn't read it closely

707
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:44,520
I never thought that I'd implicate anyone

708
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,110
with my selfishness

709
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:47,550
I

710
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:49,870
should die for my mistake

711
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:02,790
Now that Fu Rong is found innocent,

712
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:04,230
we shall release her

713
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:06,270
A declaration will be made

714
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:09,390
Coroner Hu was terrified by the incident

715
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:12,210
The Bureau must provide him some comfort

716
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,630
As for Ding Peng,

717
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:17,540
he's full of selfishness even as

718
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:19,200
the prosecutor of the Bureau

719
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,010
He almost caused an injustice

720
00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:24,390
He's punished for a year's salary
and 50 canes,

721
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:27,270
henceforth demoted as a regular constable

722
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:28,360
Come

723
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:30,390
Take them away

724
00:41:39,810 --> 00:41:41,250
Respects to Your Majesty

725
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:42,220
Royal Father

726
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:47,590
On the murder of Liu Ru Yi,

727
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:51,570
the Criminal Investigation Bureau and the
Ministry of Justice must not slack

728
00:41:51,570 --> 00:41:53,170
Investigations must be done

729
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:54,810
until the truth is found

730
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,340
and the culprit caught

731
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,050
Fu Rong

732
00:41:58,510 --> 00:42:00,210
Though you're innocent,

733
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:04,270
but your behaviour after you were caught

734
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:06,180
was absolutely ridiculous

735
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:09,000
Spare the rod, spoil the child

736
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:11,240
Fu Pin Yan is hereby punished

737
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:15,910
for three months' salary

738
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:21,180
And you're punished to copy the
Female Commandment at home

739
00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:23,850
Yes, Your Majesty

740
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:25,430
I shall obey your orders

741
00:42:26,350 --> 00:42:27,250
Jin'er

742
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:29,020
Go back with me

743
00:42:29,310 --> 00:42:30,200
Yes
