This is absurd.

How is this absurd?

6
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:00,520
This coloured glaze
is cheaper compared to others,

7
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:03,380
but not everyone can afford it.

8
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:06,510
How can it be the Seven Colour Sparkler
that I want?

9
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:08,139
I got it.

10
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:09,550
I will search for it again.

11
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:10,750
Sorry for disturbing you, master.

12
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,620

I should be taking a stroll

You wasted quite a lot of my time.

It's going to rain.

Master Xu is drying some dye ingredients
in his yard.

31
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:07,970
I wanted to use these lotus leaves
to cover them.

32

33

Enough.

Let's take shelter.

35
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,820
Okay. This should be fine.

36

Your Highness, when did you come back?

37
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:05,630
I just got back.

38

How did you know I'm here?

39
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:09,390
Did you go to Ruyi Pavilion
as soon as you got to the capital?

40
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:12,170
Lan Xiang said
you came to Mount Xinglin alone.

41
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,860
The sky was getting dark.

42
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:16,760
I worried it might rain,

43
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:18,680
so I came to find you.

44
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:20,670
Did you come without an umbrella?

45
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:22,290
-I did.
-Where is it?

46
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:26,470
I met an old man on my way here,

47
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:28,360
so I gave it to him.

48
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:33,750
Did you take care of the issue
in Kushui Village?

49
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:35,530
We made some progress.

50

I'll report to Father in the capital.

51
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,300
So, you mean

52
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:41,909
you're leaving soon.

53
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:47,110
Are you really busy

54
00:05:47,409 --> 00:05:48,490
or

55
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:52,580
are you afraid of letting me know
that the Emperor told you to divorce me?

56
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:55,310
I know you don't want to make me worry,

57
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:57,190
but the more you hide, the more worried

58
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,310
and paranoid I am.
What if we have a misunderstanding?

59
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,780
So, in the future,

60
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:05,070
don't hide anything.

He's my husband.

74

Did both of you move them for me?

75
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:03,660
And covered them for me?

76
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:04,910

you left without taking care of them.

80

What if they were soaked in the rain?

81
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:12,750

It's called filigree inlay.

120

this hairpin is beautiful,

121
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,220
especially the clip,

122
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:40,920
it can hold the hair firmly.

123
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:42,870
Besides, after taking it off,

124
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:45,200
it won't stick to the hair
like it tends to.

125
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:49,200
I guess this is
the magic of filigree inlay.

say he'd figure it out?

some cheap jewellery

148

149

Your Highness, please calm down.

153
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:25,110
Ji Qing Ting has been running

If you dismiss him at this time,

out of desperation,

157
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,940
he might turn to Ruyi Pavilion.

158
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:38,090
I'm afraid Wu Bai Qi has bought him off

159
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:41,390
and he's been colluding
with Ruyi Pavilion.

160

In this way, Ruyi Pavilion
won't be in your way any more.

When I was in the palace yesterday,

166

my clothes and shoes got wet by accident.

167
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:11,850
Zhi Hui took me to change my shoes.

168
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:14,610
She didn't know my shoe size,

169
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:17,560
so she let me try on different sizes.

170
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,370
She said, these shoes

171

were made by mother herself.

00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,070
Mother made so many pairs of shoes.

173
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:31,460
Are those for Duke Huai?

174
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,680
Every lining of those shoes
are made with leather.

175
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,370
They have thick soles.

176
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:45,670
Are those for someone
with a cold feet problem?

177
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:48,540
So all these years,

178
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:49,950
Mother worries
about your cold feet problem,

179
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:52,950
that's why she's been
making shoes for you every year?

180
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,120
Although you were never by her side,

181
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,540
she still cares about you.

182
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,330
But you were faraway,

183
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:04,170
she can only guess your shoe size.

184
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:06,040
So she made them one by one.

185
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:08,380
Now I know.

186
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:09,770
Zhi Hui told me,

187
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,690
Mother always gets sore wrists.

188
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:13,700
It must be the needlework.

189
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:19,640
Since when did you get
so close with Zhi Hui?

190
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,990
Well, I'm popular.

191
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:33,910
Keep them properly for me.

192
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:35,650
Just put them on!

193
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:36,970
Keep them.

194
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:05,420
Safflower cream.

195
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:08,110
Promotes blood circulation
and heal bruises?

196
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,900
But I don't have these problems.

197
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:16,790
Is it for Mother?

198
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,610
[Guang Yang Palace]

199
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:36,550
Greetings to you, Mother.

200
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:38,740
I wish you happiness and peace.

201
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:42,140
You look radiant.

202
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:43,980
I am happy when I see you,

203
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:45,530
that's why I look radiant.

204
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:47,180
Rong'er,

205
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:48,940
come sit here with me.

206
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:50,190
Yes.

207
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:54,850
Come.

208
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:59,150
I heard that Ruyi Pavilion
is selling jewellery in the market

209
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:00,880
and they are well-received.

210
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:03,780
So you heard about it.

211
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:05,280
This is a good thing.

212
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:06,420
It is natural

213
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:07,970
for good things to spread.

214
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:11,910
Mother, do you not mind the fact
that I expose myself in the public

215
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:13,290
and run business?

216
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,150
I don't mind.

217
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:17,430
Do you still remember

218
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:19,040
Sunny Bright which you gifted me

219
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,950
when we first met?

220
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:24,530
I remember.

221
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,330
Back then, you said,

222
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,920
it's easy to please the nobility,

223
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,850
but it's hard to please the people.

224
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:30,820
And now,

225
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:33,420
you manage to please the people.

226
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,680
What do I have to worry about?

227
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:37,930
Thank you, Mother.

228
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,230
How is Jin'er doing?

229
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,030
Yesterday he got drenched.

230
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,700
Did he catch a cold?

231
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:47,340
He is doing fine,

232
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:48,640
but he's busy today,

233
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:50,530
so he couldn't come here with me.

234
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:59,070
He learned that you have sore wrists,

235
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:00,670
so he told me to bring this.

236
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:05,069
Isn't that considerate, Your Highness?

237
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:09,520
Let me apply it for you.

238
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:11,280
Sure.

239
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:24,119
What happened here?

240
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,020
It's nothing.

241
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:27,950
I accidentally cut myself.

242
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:29,870
Concubine Rong,

243
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:31,460
Her Highness noticed

244
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,590
that Duke Su didn't seem
to like her boots,

245
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:35,190
so she started making shoes again.

246
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:36,590
Last night, she worked through the night

247
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:37,910
and pricked her finger.

248
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:39,040
Zhi Hui.

249
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:44,030
When those shoes are completed,

250
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:46,120
don't just keep them in Guang Yang Palace.

251
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,350
That's such a waste.

252
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:49,980
You should give them
to their intended owner.

253
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,060
It wasn't easy for him to come back.

254
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:14,890
[Mother gifted these in return.]

255
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,090
What's the matter?

256
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:10,110
Are you in a good mood today?

257
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,400
Your Majesty,

258
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,480
Jin'er knows that I'm not feeling well,

259
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:17,090
so he told Concubine Rong

260
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:19,220
to bring me safflower cream.

261
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,730
Jin'er is a good son.

262
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:24,410
Despite being a little stubborn,

263
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:27,410
he is a good child indeed.

264
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:30,350
You're right.

265
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,670
Your Highness.

266
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:37,080
Your Highness, Attendant Chen
would like to see you.

267
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,200
Attendant Chen?

268
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:41,640
The Emperor is here,

269
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:43,160
let her wait for a while.

270
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:46,020
Ask her to come in.

271
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:52,920
Greetings to Your Majesty and Consort Shu.

272
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:54,550
Get up.

273
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:56,220
Thank you, Your Majesty.

274
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:01,310
What brings you here, Attendant Chen?

275
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:03,000
Your Royal Highness,

276
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:05,840
to comply with the Empress’s will,

277
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:07,600
the Wardrobe Service Department
has always been frugal

278
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,810
and never splurged.

279
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:11,320
In order to save manpower
and materials back then,

280
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,050
we engaged private jewellery houses

281
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:15,980
to make some of the jewellery
in the palace.

282
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:17,780
That's right.

283
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:19,100
Any problem with it?

284
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,060
But,

285
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:22,730
since Ruyi Pavilion

286
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:24,580
accidentally offended you last time,

287
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:27,840
our department dare not
engage other private jewellery houses.

288
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,710
We could barely stay afloat.

289
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,500
New season is approaching soon,

290
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:34,290
it's time to make new jewellery.

291
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:35,790
So...

292
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,100
Hold on.

293
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:41,720
How did Ruyi Pavilion offend you?

294
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:43,580
Your Majesty,

295
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:45,470
it was just a misunderstanding.

296
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,860
Just follow our original plan.

297
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:51,020
Yes.

298
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:52,300
It's just that

299
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:55,020
the private jewellery houses
vary in quality.

300
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:56,400
I'm wondering

301
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:57,870
if we should select one of them

302
00:20:57,870 --> 00:20:59,690
to design jewellery
for the Wardrobe Service.

303
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:01,360
After all, you're all royalty.

304
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,890
I'm sure there'll be no more misconduct.

305
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:06,840
You're right.

306
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:10,450
We should select
a suitable jewellery house.

307
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:14,850
Consort Shu, I'll leave it to you.

308
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:17,140
Yes, Your Majesty.

309
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:19,780
Go ahead.

310
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:22,200
Yes.

311
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:30,330
-Attendant Chen, what brings you here?
-Mr Ji,

312
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,400
I'll be frank with you today.

313
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,900
Consort Shu said

314
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:35,580
between you and Ruyi Pavilion,

315
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:37,330
only one can stay.

316
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:42,000
May I know who is the proprietor here?

317
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:44,020
I am.

318
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:46,550
I am an attendant
from the Wardrobe Service.

319
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:47,950
Congratulations.

320
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:50,260
The Emperor has ordered our department
to select a jewellery house

321
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,970
to design jewellery for the palace.

322
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:54,360
Ruyi Pavilion is one of the candidates.

323
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:55,590
Well...

324
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:58,620
But Ruyi Pavilion currently

325
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,840
designs jewellery for the commoners.

326
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:03,160
I'm afraid the nobles won't like them.

327
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:06,110
It's good to know your own limitations.

328
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,050
I think you can tell the Emperor

329
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:11,320
that Ruyi Pavilion

330
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:13,150
refuses to take part.

331
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,210
Ms Fu,

332
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:20,510
with these cheap designs of yours,

333
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:23,010
you better don't embarrass yourself
in the palace.

334
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:24,850
It will be a laughing stock.

335
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:28,440
Will Feng Lai Yi
join this competition too?

336
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,510
Of course.

337
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:31,760
-I get it now.
-What do you know?

338
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:33,630
You're jealous of Ruyi Pavilion.

339
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:36,310
I couldn't care less about Ruyi Pavilion.

340
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,580
You can only fool the commoners.

341
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:40,400
When it comes to craftsmanship,

342
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,580
it is extremely terrible.

343
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:46,060
Whether or not our craftsmanship
is terrible,

344
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:47,860
you don't have a say in this.

345
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:51,730
We'll let the nobles decide.

346
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,890
So you agreed, Ms Fu?

347
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,000
I will report it to my superior.

348
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:57,940
After ten days,

349
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:00,310
please bring your work to the palace.

350
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:02,340
Ten days?

351
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,680
Rong'er,

352
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,950
we don't even know
if this competition is a good thing.

353
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:16,490
How could you agree right away?

354
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:17,370
Sister,

355
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:19,340
I hate getting involved
with the nobles as well,

356
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:21,520
but what he said hit a nerve in me.

357
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:23,280
What did he say?

358
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,280
Look,

359
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:26,250
the commoners like our work,

360
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:27,420
but if things continue this way

361
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:29,690
people will think our jewellery
is cheap and crude.

362
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:32,620
But not if we supply jewellery
for the palace as well.

363
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:34,130
Rong'er,

364
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:36,300
you're quite thoughtful.

365
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,660
There's something
I need to discuss with you.

366
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:53,110
Please don't be mad.

367
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:55,250
Is it about the competition?

368
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,990
Have you heard about it?

369
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:03,250
I join the competition because
that was Master's dream,

370
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:05,100
and I want to uphold our reputation.

371
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:07,040
But if I'm selected,

372
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,120
I'll put Mother in a tough position.

373
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:11,320
Just focus on the competition,

374
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:12,790
don't worry about it.

375
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:16,170
I'll be here for you.

376
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:18,540
Thank you.

377
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:22,680
Are these your designs
for the competition?

378
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:25,220
Yes, I'm still figuring it out.

379
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:26,990
I really can't decide.

380
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:31,170
Why don't you ask Master Xu
to teach you again?

381
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:33,090
Master Xu is highly skilled.

382
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,550
It would be best if he could teach me.

383
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:38,070
But when he promised
to teach me filigree inlay,

384
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:39,880
it was already a great surprise.

385
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:42,230
Unless I can find Seven Colour Sparkler,

386
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:44,280
I don't know how to face him.

387
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:47,100
Rong'er,

388
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:50,250
I will leave the capital
for a case tomorrow.

389
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:52,420
You're leaving again?

390
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:54,140
It won't take long.

391
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:09,710
Bao Zhu.

392
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,050
Bao Zhu.

393
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:21,990
Ghost! Don't touch me! Don't touch me!

394
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,540
Don't be scared. It's me.

395
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:29,070
Little Marquis?

396
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,840
I finally caught someone I know.

397
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:36,240
Why are you dressed like this
in the middle of the night?

398
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,920
Would you believe me
if I tell you I can't sleep

399
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,920
and I'm pretending to be invisible?

400
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,550
-No.
-That's right.

401
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:46,230
You won't believe me anyway.

402
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:48,260
Bao Zhu,

403
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:49,320
let me ask you.

404
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:50,810
What's up with Ms Fu Xuan?

405
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:53,320
I heard she's been staying
at Ruyi Pavilion.

406
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,850
What happened?

407
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:57,140
You see,

408
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,900
Ruyi Pavilion has agreed

409
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:00,750
to participate in the palace's
tendering process.

410
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:02,640
Within ten days...

411
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:05,260
No, they have only eight days left now.

412
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:06,970
They need to design a piece of jewellery.

413
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:09,630
Although Ms Fu Xuan doesn't know
much about designing,

414
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:11,570
she wants to help Concubine Rong.

415
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:13,820
So she's having a hard time.

416
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:19,650
Bao Zhu, don't tell Ms Fu Xuan

417
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:21,210
that I came here.

418
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:23,410
Why not?

419
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:25,820
I want to give her a surprise.

420
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,200
A surprise?

421
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:32,650
A surprise or a shock?

422
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:37,570
When is it going to be my turn?

423
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:38,540
I know, right?

424
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:40,570
-I've been waiting for so long.
-I've waited for hours.

425
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:42,590
-Me too.
-When will we see him?

426
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:45,320
My legs are sore.

427
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:49,700
Miss.

428
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:51,380
You're a hopeless romantic.

429
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:00,930
Miss, are you here to see Little Marquis?

430
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:03,070
Please queue up over there.

431
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,500
Queue up?

432
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:06,550
There's a little marquis inside?

433
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,980
Which little marquis?

434
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:11,300
Why, the most popular little marquis
in the capital, Little Marquis Wu.

435
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:13,870
I don't know what he is up to today.

436
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,260
Bao Zhu,

437
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:18,490
let's leave.

438
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,750
Rong'er.

439
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:38,380
Your Highness.

440
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:42,380
When did you get here?

441
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:43,900
Are you hurt?

442
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:45,070
No.

443
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:47,710
Look.

444
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:49,200
What is this?

445
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,820
When I was on duty,

446
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:04,350
I stumbled upon a mountain.

447
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:06,250
There's a kind of stone in that mountain

448
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:07,730
known as Magic Dew Stone.

449
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:09,960
It has a seven-coloured sheen.

450
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:11,470
So,

451
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:13,180
I brought some for you.

452
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,130
Are you sure you just happened to pass by?

453
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:17,410
Yes.

454
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,540
Fine. I'll trust you.

455
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,350
Tomorrow,

456
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:29,140
let's go to Mount Xinglin

457
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:30,850
and ask Master Xu

458
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:34,200
if this is the Seven Colour Sparkler
that he's looking for.

459
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:51,370
These are just scratches,

460
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:53,070
but that tiger was fierce,

461
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:54,450
hence the deep marks.

462
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:59,200
Your Highness,

463
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:01,670
remember to avoid contact
with water for now.

464
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:03,430
If there's any discomfort,

465
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,020
remember to inform me.

466
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,620
Mr Ge,

467
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:13,460
don't tell Rong'er about this.

468
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:30,180
You found Magic Dew Stone.

469
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:33,050
This is the Seven Colour Sparkler,
isn't it?

470
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:34,840
No.

471
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:37,310
Anyway,

472
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:39,570
although it is not Seven Colour Sparkler,

473
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:41,040
Magic Dew Stone

474
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,250
can only be found in Qingdian Valley.

475
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:45,140
But Qingdian Valley

476
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:47,390
is off the beaten track.
Wild beasts lurk in the valley.

477
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:50,750
It is extremely difficult to go there
and get Magic Dew Stone.

478
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:52,400
How did you do it?

479
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,930
I found it as soon as I got there.

480
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:55,980
Nonsense.

481
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:57,660
I went there last month

482
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:59,320
and I saw tigers from afar.

483
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:00,980
I got scared and left.

484
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,930
Ms Fu,

485
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:06,620
I just taught you filigree inlay
not long ago.

486
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:08,850
You can make lots of jewellery with it.

487
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:11,490
Why would you need a new technique?

488
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:13,070
To be frank,

489
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:16,070
the palace is inviting private jewellery
houses to work with them.

490
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:17,730
That includes Ruyi Pavilion.

491
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,030
Not only do you want to sell
commoners jewellery,

492
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:24,170
you want to work with the palace.

493
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:26,580
You want to have your cake and eat it too.

494
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:28,120
You are right.

495
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,690
The intention of Ruyi Pavilion

496
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:32,150
is to create jewellery
for all walks of life.

497
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:34,350
Now we're offering cheaper jewellery

498
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:37,470
hoping that the commoners
get to wear better jewellery.

499
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:39,670
But as we're promoting economical pieces,

500
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:42,090
it also creates a status gap
between nobles and commoners.

501
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:44,160
This completely violates
the original intention of Ruyi Pavilion

502
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,660
and tarnishes its reputation.

503
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:47,110
So I'd like to take this chance

504
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:48,470
to let our clients know

505
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,590
that our jewellery does not distinguish
between rich and poor.

506
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:52,740
It's for everyone,
from nobles to commoners.

507

Recently,

523
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:05,470
I've been inviting all kinds of women
to Sifang Pavilion

524

533
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:29,690
I sifted through them

534
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:31,360
and ended up with these.

535
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,380
Some of them are rare.

Did Master Xu trick us
into taking a lake tour?

560

Are you sure
you weren't attacked by any beast?

What kind of beast could beat me?

You're always like this,

It's just some scratches.

This is weird.

590

This fish tasted fresh a moment ago,

591
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,730
but all of a sudden

592

it tastes sour.

No.

you wouldn't hide anything from me.

is the basics.

609
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:55,400
By using filigree inlay technique
and hammering method,

610
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:59,500
you'll plate the edge of the shell
with gold.

611
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:02,400
