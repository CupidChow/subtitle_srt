The blooming flowers in spring
have their own style.

88
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,530
The dangling ornaments are like flowers
hanging on the head,

and accompany by butterfly and dragonfly
silver hairpin.

it's like a flower that never wilts.

Why is there a floral fragrance?

96
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,860
It's a flower,
so it must have flower fragrance.

97
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,180
With a special process,

98
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,290
we sealed the floral fragrance
in the silverware.

The floral fragrance adds on the vitality.

100

Not bad.

101
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:57,350

-Yes.

104
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,190
I dare not ask for a reward.

105
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:05,010
My master, Liu Ru Yi,
didn't know about your taboo...

106
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:06,270
and made a big mistake.

107

Please forgive her.

108
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:12,440
As a woman,
it's hard for her to endure in the prison.

109
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:13,940
Wait a moment.

110
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:16,320

111
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,120

I didn't say as I'm worried you'll be sad.

114
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,480

How could you act on your own?

120
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:36,340
You dislike peony.

121
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,490
Sometimes, you shed tears
when you see peony.

122
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:41,260
If so, why should I send
this nasty thing...

123
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,580
to you?

124
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,870
Just punish me if you want.

125
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:47,160
I just don't want you to be sad.

126
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:48,570
Forget it.

127
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,670
Go and reflect on yourself.

128
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,880
I'll cut your allowance for three months.

129
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,110
If you do it again,

130
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:56,510
leave Guang Yang Palace immediately.

131
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,380
Yes, Your Highness.

132
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,930
I felt weird...

133
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:01,940
why would...

134
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,350
you come suddenly.

135
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,540
So this is what happened.

136
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:07,630
Why didn't you ask me?

137
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:08,590
This...

138
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,050
I don't want you to be sad.

139
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:14,270
Ruyi Pavilion is jewellery store
for the people.

140
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:16,680
Even if they have presented
a peony head ornament,

141
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,150
that's a miscommunication
between them and the palace.

142
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:22,010
As the saying goes,
one who doesn't know is not guilty.

143
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:23,370
I won't blame them.

144
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:28,610
It seems that you brought this jewellery
to make up for it.

145
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:30,370
Yes.

146
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,030
I can see that you have put in
a lot of efforts.

147
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:38,990
How did you get the idea
of this Sunny Bright?

148
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,100
To be honest,

149
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,640
when I was making jewelry,

150
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,100
I realized a truth.

151
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:46,300
What truth?

152
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,480
Ruyi Pavilion
is a jewellery store.

153
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,310
To make a good jewelry,

154
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,940
it's hard to satisfy you,

155
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,290
but it's harder
to satisfy the people.

156
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,780
Why do you say so?

157
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:00,680
As a consort,

158
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,680
if you want any kind of jewellery,

159
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:04,780
every jewellery store in the world
will make it for you.

160
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,310
You can offer a lot of money.

161
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,770
But for the people,

162
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:09,570
they can't afford to pay...

163
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,190
for a gold or silver thread.

164
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:14,440
Your flower is made with gold and silver,
it won't wilt.

165
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,500
The people tie fresh flowers
and wear it on their head.

166
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,370
That's their Sunny Bright.

167
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,640
It's easy to make the noble happy,

168
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:23,870
but it's hard to make the people happy.

169
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:25,590
I hope in the future,
Ruyi Pavilion...

170
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:27,130
can make the people happy.

171
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:30,120
If the people are happy,
you must be happy too.

172
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:32,060
Make the people happy?

173
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,440
Alright.

174
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:36,760
Well said.

175
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,810
Even if it's for the glory future
of Ruyi Pavilion,

176
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,450
I can't hold your master any longer.

177
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:46,580
Brother, let her go now.

178
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:49,270
Thank you, Your Highness.

179
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,020
How much?

180
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:56,040
-Fifty taels.
-If you pass by,

181
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,140
-don't miss it!
-No counter-offer. It's 50 taels.

182
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,500
-No, thanks.
-Take a look.

183
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,470
-Mister.
-Mister.

184
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:00,440
Take a look.

185
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,720
Stone signed by Farmer Ju Shui.

186
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:08,880
How much is this stone?

187
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,350
This is a stone signed by
Farmer Ju Shui himself.

188
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:13,330
Fifty taels.

189
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,180
Forty taels.

190
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,940
If you get close and smell it,

191
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,320
it has the smell of Farmer Ju Shui.

192
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,380
Enough.

193
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,230
-Forget it.
-I'm not lying, mister.

194
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:25,160
-It's really good.
-Fifty taels.

195
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,320
Take it.

196
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:35,900
Young Master.

197
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:41,840
I've bought the stone as you ordered.

198
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,620
They imitate the writing...

199
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:52,460
The matter in palace is settled too.

200
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:58,210
Nong Nong and Ruyi Pavilion are safe.

201
00:12:58,210 --> 00:12:59,400
That makes me happy.

202
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:11,980
Young Master.

203
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,400
The word "nong"...

204
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,300
Is it wrong?

205
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,540
[Farmer]

206
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:21,920
You didn't know...

207
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,210
but the name of Farmer Ju Shui...

208
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,340
was created because of Nong Nong.

209
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:29,450
I'm willing to care for Nong Nong,

210
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:30,990
think of her...

211
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:32,970
and protect her.

212
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,700
I really didn't expect Consort Shu
to be so kind.

213
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,520
We can go pick up master tomorrow.

214
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,940
So, it has nothing to do
with Consort Duan?

215
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:42,960
That's right.

216
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,580
It has nothing to do
with Consort Shu.

217
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,180
Not to mention Consort Duan.

218
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:49,400
It's the handmaiden of Consort Shu
who acted on her own.

219
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:50,790
But it's not her fault,

220
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:52,330
she did it for Consort Shu.

221
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:54,790
In short, it's all a misunderstanding.

222
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,100
So, it really has nothing to do with him.

223
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,180
What is it?

224
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,080
Nothing.

225
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:06,010
Come.

226
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,360
I'll go with you tomorrow
to fetch Ms Liu.

227
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,100

00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,450
Mr Dong told me everything
that you did.

237
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:36,680
Thank you.

If not for your patient teaching,

00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,810
also my sister and Yuan's help,

241
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:46,490
I might not be able to make a jewellery
that satisfied Consort Shu.

242
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:48,380
You two are close.

243
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,880
Be careful in everything from now on.

I'll not forget your teaching.

Thank you for your kindness, Mr Dong.

246
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:58,900
You gave us a chance to make up for it.

247
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,090
Instead of thanking me,

248
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:01,890
it's better to thank Duke Su.

249
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,180

I came to apologize to you.

277
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,610
I didn't find out the reason...

278
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:48,380
and misunderstood you.

279
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,000
I'm at wrong.

280

Please be generous...

281
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:54,090
and forgive my rudeness.

282

Forget it.

283
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:59,590
I also misunderstood
that you copied Feng Lai Yi's work.

284
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:01,320
I guess this is my retribution.

00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,220
Why are you looking at me?
Take it.

00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,530
I've promised...

288
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:13,720
to compensate you.

289
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,260
I can't break my promise.

290
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:18,339
But I took some time to collect these.

291
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:21,810
Just now, you said...

292

I can't accept this.

295
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:35,060
The brush is made with bamboo
from Nanshan...

296
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,020
and fur from sheep in Zhejiang.

297

Fur of old rabbit on the stone.

298

The paper is from Xuancheng.

300

The inkstone is from Duanzhou.

301

It's all hard to get it.

302
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,120
That's why...

303
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,060
it took some time.

304
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,800
You really don't want it?

305
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:58,600
Forget it then.

306
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,210
I can't use it anyway,
I'll just throw it away.

307

These are precious things.

308
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,030
You can't throw it away.

309
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,040
Alright, you keep it.

310
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:09,990
I know that giving you valuable things
is an insult to you.

311
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:11,270
Brush, ink, paper and inkstone
are more suitable.

312

00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:03,030
It's enough.

341
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:07,340
My brother must have known that
Xu Jin overturned the candlestick...

342
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,320
and caused the fire in Hong Fu Temple.

343
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:12,880
But in order to cover the truth,
he sent Xu Jin away in a hurry.

344
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,200
If so,

345
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,270
who should we find now?

346
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,420
Of course is the person who knew
about the incident.

347
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,300
Yes.

348
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:48,790
What's wrong?

349
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:50,810
This is hard for you?

350
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:58,690
By the way,

351
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:01,500
your birthday is in a few days.

352
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:03,400
What do you want?

353
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,150
Ten years ago,

354
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,290
I thought if I solved the chess puzzle,

355
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:12,910
my mother would return.

356
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:16,120
I didn't expect that...

357
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:18,280
after I solved the chess problem,

358
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:21,130
I would be told of my mother's death.

359
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,130
I thought what's wrong.

360
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:29,840
I don't want to mention
about Queen Dowager Wen...

361
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:32,300
because I'm afraid
you'll mourn the past...

362
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,110
-and overthink it.
-Forget it.

363
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:37,630
It has long past, just let it be.

364
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:39,830
Back then,

365
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,820
my mother was hurriedly buried
outside of Jichang City.

366
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:45,720
I didn't get to see her for one last time.

367
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,660
Whenever I think of this,

368
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:50,480
I feel guilty.

369
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:53,880
Rumours are spreading
like wildfire back then.

370
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:54,950
The officials...

371
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:58,880
disagreed to bury her
in the imperial mausoleum.

372
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,520
Furthermore,
she had left the palace earlier.

373
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,980
Her identity was awkward.

374
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:06,480
Therefore she was buried
outside of Jichang City.

375
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,620
I remember that...

376
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:14,100
Eunuch Wang was not in the palace
for a while back then.

377
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:16,570
Did you go out to hold the funeral

378
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,550
for my mother?

379
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:23,560
Yes.

380
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:26,780
His Majesty took pity that
Queen Dowager Wen died unexpectedly

381
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:28,800
and couldn't be buried
in the royal cemetery,

382
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,180
so His Majesty
ordered me to oversee the funeral.

383
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:33,020
The funeral had to be done well.

384
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,890
Thanks for all these years,

385
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,100
brother.

386
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,560
Don't mention it.

387
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:47,150
Everyone in the palace

388
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,300
avoided us back then.

389
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,340
Only you took care of us.

390
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,280
And because of this,

391
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:58,370
I never asked if you,
like the others,

392
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:01,670
also thought that my mother's eyes
of different colour are ominous.

393
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:03,400
What eyes of different colour?

394
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:05,360
I dislike hearing about this.

395
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:10,560
Back then,

396
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:13,860
Queen Dowager Wen
took good care of me.

397
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:18,480
That's why I love you so much.

398
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:22,960
It has long passed.

399
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:25,390
Don't mention it again.

400
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,880
Of course I know you don't believe these.

401
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,580
Your son, Duke Su,

402
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:54,780
was also said to be
a bane of other's existence.

403
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,620
But you still entrust him
with important tasks.

404
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:02,170
So what if you help me?

405
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,070
So what if you take care of me?

406
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:09,250
To cover up your son's mistake,

407
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:14,660

Zhu'er loves to eat this.

432

We went to get dates together
when we were young.

433

Who are you?

438
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:17,150
That folding fan...

439
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:23,760
When Huang Ze passed through Shu,

440
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:26,480
he saw the beautiful scenery of Shu

441
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:29,300
and settled down in Shu.

442
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,650
He left twelve folding fans.

443
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:36,430
Each of his folding fans

444
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:40,920
is breath-taking.

445
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:44,800
Not to mention when twelve fans
are connected together,

446
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:48,050
it's a beautiful map of Shu.

447
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,050
Twenty-five years ago,

448
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:52,670
a new magistrate
was appointed in Yizhou.

449
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:53,770
He liked Huang Ze.

450
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:57,640
He was fortunate enough to see the elegance
of these twelve holding fans.

451
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,640
He offered a lot of money to buy them.

452
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:03,270
However, the descendants of the
Huang Family were unwilling to sell it.

453
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:04,150
Enough!

454
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,360
Mr Dong.

455
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:09,920
Do you still remember
the treachery incident

456
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,760
in Yizhou 25 years ago?

457
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:15,330
It's just some scholars
who wrote a few novels...

458
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:16,820
to make a living.

459
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,440
Someone tampered with the contents

460
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,660
and they were convicted of treason.

461
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:24,130
Everyone involved in the case
was beheaded in public.

462
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:26,460
All property were confiscated.

463
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,140
I didn't accept those holding fans.

464
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:31,260
What has it got to do with me?

465
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,480
You didn't kill them

466
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:37,900
but you caused their deaths.

467
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,090
In these 25 years,

468
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,440
these 12 folding fans were separated.

469
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:48,680
In the end, ten of the folding fans
fell into the hand of Wu You, the profiteer.

00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,120
it's up to you.

507
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:29,840
After that,

508
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:32,120
you can rest assured.

509
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:37,140
For you to collect all 12 folding fans,

510
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:39,960
I specially bought these two folding fans.

511
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,240
Now these 12 folding fans are united.

512
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:44,440
Mr Dong.

513
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:46,860
Don't let me down.

514
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:52,850
I made a mistake back then.

515
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,170
Since I became an official,

516
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:57,170
I'm cautious and conscientious.

517
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,160
I've never taken any bribes.

518
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:02,350
But why did you find me?

519
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:07,720
Mr Dong.

520
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:10,180
Everyone should bear the consequences

521
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:11,460
of their mistakes.

522
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:13,790
My only son is born sick.

523
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,610
It's still not clear
if he can live past ten years old.

524
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:18,410
Is this punishment not enough?

525
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,660
You're cautious and conscientious,
and you serve the public wholeheartedly.

526
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:26,380
This is your duty.

527
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:29,050
It's not enough to make up
for your mistake.

528
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:29,930
However,

529
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:33,370
I know you're an upright official.

530
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,200
So, I don't want to
make it difficult for you.

531
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:45,650
If you're unwilling to cooperate,

532
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:48,110
and your crime is exposed,

533
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:52,640
your good name will be ruined.

534
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:56,470
Your sister and two nephews
may still have a way out.

535
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,870
However,
for your weak young son,

536
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:03,420
how can he live?

[Dong Fang Li]

539
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:15,230
Mr Dong.

540
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:18,050
Wu You kept saying he's not feeling well
since this morning.

541
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:20,780
I thought he was just
making up excuses to escape.

542
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:22,050
So, I ignored him.

543
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:24,870
But he suddenly foamed at the mouth

544
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,140
and died.

545
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:29,400
[Ruyi Pavilion.]

546
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:32,440
[You're really ruthless.]

547
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,780
Dong Fang Li?

548
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:50,880
That Dong Fang Li who is in charge of
the imperial storehouse?

549
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:51,800
That's right.

550
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:55,540
When I first received news
from Ruyi Pavilion,

551
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:57,150
I didn’t believe it either.

552
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,750
But look at this.

553
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:17,230
Dong Fang Li has always been upright

554
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:19,520
and uncorrupted.

555
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:21,100
For such a person,

556
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,840
what weakness does he have?

557
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:27,570
This is the greatness of Ruyi Pavilion.

558
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:31,700
It's indeed satisfying
as the rumours say.

559
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:34,250
You've met the people
from Ruyi Pavilion?

560
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:37,030
He asked me

561
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,180
to write what I want on a paper.

562
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:40,940
Then, put the letter

563
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:44,160
under the stone chair of Yunlang Pavilion
in the suburbs.

564
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,180
I must leave after putting the letter.

565
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:47,150
If I don't leave,

566
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,520
he won't accept this deal.

567
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:53,480
The people of Ruyi Pavilion

568
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,920
are indeed cautious.

569
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:59,200
I don't dare to take any risk.

570
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,620
I left after putting the letter.

571
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:02,720
And then,

572
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:06,730
this letter was left outside
my residence two days ago.

573
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:08,739
In the letter was this...

574
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,610
and what he wants.

575
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:19,489
[Tell the hidden details of Huxiao Camp
and give half of the gold mine]

576
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:23,230
He wants information about Huxiao Camp

577
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:26,219
and half of the gold mine?

578
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:27,719
Mao'er.

579
00:34:27,889 --> 00:34:29,219
Have you promised them?

580
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,020
You think it's not worth it?

581
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:33,900
It's not about worthy or not,

582
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:36,429
but if Ruyi Pavilion

583
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,449
knows about the incident
in Huxiao Camp,

584
00:34:38,449 --> 00:34:41,179
with their abilities,
they can follow the clue

585
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:43,860
and find out more things.

586
00:34:45,489 --> 00:34:48,130
Don't worry about the incident
in Huxiao Camp.

587
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,510
With the support of my mother and I,

588
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,929
it won't implicate you.

589
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,550
These things

590
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:00,680
have always been your favourite.

591
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,520
I'm reluctant too.

592
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,200
But when I think about it,

593
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:11,720
Ruyi Pavilion...

594
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:16,340
can even get the official document
from imperial storehouse.

595
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:18,710
If we make connections with him,

596
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:22,720
this relationship itself is worth a lot.

597
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,400
As for that half of the gold mine,

598
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:26,990
if he dares to accept it,

599
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:28,300
in the future,

600
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:32,000
I will have my way to influence
Ruyi Pavilion.

601
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:38,340
Just like Huxiao Camp and the prosecutor,

602
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:42,250
didn't I spend a lot of money
to settle it?

603
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:45,990
Now, it has become my way
of making money.

604
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,950
Wherever the money goes,

605
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:55,630
that's where I am.

606
00:35:55,890 --> 00:35:56,990
Well said.

607
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,270
I just hope that...

608
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,780
they really know...

609
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:03,280
where should they go.

610
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:09,490
Let's drink.

611
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:14,590
This is from Mr Dong.

612
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:51,730
Mr Dong.

613
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:54,060
Are these sulphurs?

614
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:58,260
His Majesty's birthday
will be in two days.

615
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,780
These sulphur...

616
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:02,330
must be used to make fireworks.

617
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,030
Since I took over...

618
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:23,680
and reorganized the army,

619
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:25,610
I can see...

620
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,240
everyone's changes.

621
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:30,930
Now, the imperial guards have changed.

622
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:36,040
No more laziness like before.

623
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:37,970
Because of this,

624
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,960
you should be persistent.

625
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:41,270
Now,

626
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,040
I want to appoint a martial general.

627
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,070
When I'm not here,

628
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,360

630
00:37:56,940 --> 00:38:00,320
There's a condition to participate
in the selection of martial general.

631
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,230
Some people never absent
in big trainings...

632
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:05,600
but he came in late...

633
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,940
half of the time.

634
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,050
If you're not disciplined,

635
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:11,710
how do you discipline others?

636
00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:13,810
If you don't make up
for these times,

637
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,230
you'll not be eligible for selection.

I've calculated it,
you can still make it.

641
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:31,610

in the beginning of next month.

642
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:32,610
With two hours...

643
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:33,760
Why do you calculate it?

644
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,260
No need to calculate it,
I won't participate.

645
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:36,230
Why not?

646
00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:39,000
I've done a lot for the commander
and I quite admire him.

647
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,110
But he make things difficult
for me this time.

648
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:43,310
Self-discipline?
It's just an excuse.

649
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,420
Since he doesn't want me
to be the martial general,

650
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:46,300
I won't do it.

651
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:47,590
I can be more relaxed.

652
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,650
Think about it.

653
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:52,020
-Who else is suitable for this position?
-I've something else to do.

654
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:54,220

00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,900
might come here to buy accessories.

674
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:07,290
I've looked at your design,
it's extremely luxurious.

675
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:09,030
Is that not good?

676
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:11,050
It's good to make money,

677
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:13,120
but everyone wants to be pretty.

678
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,140
Can't poor women...

679
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,430
also have accessories?

680
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:19,400
I think that Ruyi Pavilion...

681
00:40:19,410 --> 00:40:20,640
should make everyone happy.

682
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,500
Only then we can be called "ru yi".

683
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:26,890
Is this how you think
of the word "ru yi"?

684
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:29,090
I just say it.

685
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:33,310
It's well said.

686
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,600
[Fu Residence]

687
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,940
[Please drink tea.]

688
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,760
[You're really daring.]

689
00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:54,780
[On your first day
of serving tea,]

690
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:56,240
[you served a cold one.]

691
00:40:58,220 --> 00:40:59,350
[What's this?]

692
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:00,860
[Are you mocking me?]

693
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:04,860
[Please don't be mad.]

694
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:05,920
[It's my fault.]

695
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:07,780
[I'll change a new one for you.]

696
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:16,120
[Please drink tea.]

697
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:23,030
-[Do you want to scald me?]
-[Are you alright?]

698
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:24,310
-[Are you alright?]
-[You...]

699
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:25,360
[What happened?]

700
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:30,640
[My lord.]

701
00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:34,030
[Your concubine bullied me.]

702
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,480
[On her first day
of serving tea,]

703
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:38,210
[she wanted to use the hottest water
to scald me.]

704
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:41,830
[What else would she do
in the daily morning visits after this?]

705
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:46,620
[Don't need to come for
morning visits anymore.]

706
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,040
[Yes.]

707
00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:54,450
[My lord!]

708
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:57,550
Aren't you afraid of her scalding you?

709
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:03,420
[So, you're caring about me.]

710
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:04,480
[Alright.]

711
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:18,490
[As a pheasant, don't think that
by putting a few colourful feathers,]

712
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:22,040
[you can become a phoenix.]
