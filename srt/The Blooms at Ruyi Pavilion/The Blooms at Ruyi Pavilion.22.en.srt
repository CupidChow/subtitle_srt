5
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:46,539
Your Majesty,

6
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:48,990
Is Young Lady Yao so ill?

7
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:52,110
Should we wait a few more days?

8
00:01:52,509 --> 00:01:53,990
Perhaps she'll get better.

9
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:55,789
I've sent someone to look at her.

10
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:57,420
She's very ill,

11
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:58,970
couldn't meet anyone.

12
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:02,790
The Yao Family's preparing the funeral.

13
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:06,310
Heavens have pity!

14
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:07,750
Why...

15
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:11,230
I've met Young Lady Yao twice.

16
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:14,510
She looked high in spirit then,

17
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:16,110
she was friendly too.

18
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:20,190
This is so sudden...

19
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:23,270
What do you think?

20
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,070
Beauty born unlucky.

21
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:27,340
It's a pity.

22
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,500
First, was He Family,

23
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:31,829
then Yao Family.

24
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:35,910
Who knows what taboo they've crossed...

25
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:39,780
Do you know that several
families of consort candidates

26
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,030
wrote to me?

27
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:42,860
They're either sick or weak.

28
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,180
Why's this?

29
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:48,750
Is there a plague in Hengjing City?

30
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,070
What plague?

31
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:54,300
They're just scared of Duke Su.

32
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:56,470
This...

33
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,370
Your Majesty,

34
00:02:58,590 --> 00:02:59,790
Wan'er is slow

35
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,520
for not understanding.

36
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:02,520
Your Majesty,

37
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:06,830
it's absurd to say
Jin'er brings bad luck to his wife.

38
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:09,470
When Jin'er was young,

39
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,230
the Imperial Astronomer said

40
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:13,490
he's born the bane of other's existence.

41
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:16,210
It was also when the late empress passed.

42
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:17,520
I...

43
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:20,230
don't believe in birth telling

44
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:23,150
but overwhelmed with grief,

45
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:25,480
I could only send him to the border.

46
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:27,210
All these years...

47
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,760
You both have suffered a lot.

48
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:34,880
I summon Jin'er back to the capital
with a notable position.

49
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,030
I planned to find a good lady

50
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:39,510
to be married to him as a compensation.

51
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:41,270
Unexpectedly,

52
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:44,090
rumours of him being bad luck to his wife
spread.

53
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:45,550
Now,

54
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:48,340
which minster wouldn't be afraid?

55
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,180
Duke Su would not bring
bad luck to his wife!

56
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,710
It's just a coincidence.

57
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:56,040
If other ladies are reluctant,

58
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:59,540
Wan'er is willing to marry Duke Su!

59
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,950
Please approve, Your Majesty, my lady.

60
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,260
You're not afraid?

61
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:06,830
Of course I'm not.

62
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,140
Really, Princess?

63
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:10,010
Even when

64
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:13,590
Young Lady He and Yao
are already gravely ill...

65
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:14,910
I'm not scared.

66
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:17,529
The sincerity of Wan'er

67
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:19,060
is truly moving.

68
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:20,600
Moving, indeed.

69
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:23,220
Father, Mother,

70
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,950
I already have someone in mind

71
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:29,820
and will come tomorrow to announce it.

72
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:36,100
Why are the rumours getting out of hand?

73
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,790
I didn't expect an elope in stories

74
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,070
would happen to me.

75
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:43,210
Young Lady Yao's fallen sick too.

76
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:44,540
Madam.

77
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:45,780
Madam?

78
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:47,030
Madam,

79
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:49,270
did you hear what I said?

80
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,400
What did you say?

81
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,580
I said that Young Lady Yao is ill too,

82
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:53,909
gravely ill.

83
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,600
Heated talks in the capital are saying

84
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:59,680
that His Highness is
the rebirthed Tanlang Star.

85
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,480
He's too belligerent,

86
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:02,670
an especially

87
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:04,150
bad luck to his wife.

88
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:06,190
The rumours are worsening,

89
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:08,220
saying that you're ill too.

90
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:10,980
These are building up to something.

91
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:13,680
Sure, just assume that I'm ill.

92
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,950
It feels freeing to read stories
in the residence.

93
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,980
Madam, you mean...

94
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:21,320
someone's after His Highness?

95
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,230
About this...

96
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:27,230
let His Highness speak for himself.

97
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:30,500
[The highest goodness is like water]

98
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,100
Your Highness.

99
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:35,890
Regarding the pick of the duchess...

100
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:41,930
We have to inform His Majesty
and Consort Shu tomorrow.

101
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,420
Have you decided?

102
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,330
Forget it.

103
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,540
It's trouble whoever I pick.

104
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:51,510
Tomorrow,

105
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:54,150
let Princess of Xihe come in.

106
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,920
After twists and turns,

107
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:59,840
it's still Princess of Xihe.

108
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,610
[Why is it, despite all,]

109
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:04,830
[still Cui Wan?]

110
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:07,540
[Why did nothing change?]

111
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,960
[From the first day
I had the dream till now,]

112
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:13,080
[all my effort now seems]

113
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:15,190
[like a joke.]

114
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,440
Congrats, Princess.

115
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,940
What you've mentioned,

116
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,230
what good news is it?

117
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,260
Princess must've guessed it.

118
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,580
When I sent tea today,

119
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:38,070
I heard Duke Su speaking of
marrying Princess

120
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:40,930
and will tell His Majesty and Consort Shu
tomorrow.

121
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:42,370
That's great.

122
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:43,470
I knew it.

123
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:44,690
Finally...

124
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:46,550
Finally.

125
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:47,790
Duke Su.

126
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:57,670
Your Highness.

127
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:03,610
Qiu Nan,

128
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,180
as a residence servant,

129
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:09,440
you leak confidential information
to outsiders repeatedly.

130
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:11,440
Your act is punishable.

131
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,990
Punish her as the rules dictate

132
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:15,410
and as example to all.

133
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,370
My lord, I'm wrong.

134
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:18,580
Qiu Nan is wrong.

135
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,900
Xu Jia, take her away.

136
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,580
Yes.

137
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:26,360
Let's go.

138
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:28,790
Duke Su,

139
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:30,870
I didn't do it purposely.

140
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,460
I don't mean harm.

141
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,540
I just want to know about you.

142
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:36,120
I just thought that

143
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:38,060
if I could marry into the household...

144
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,060
You haven't,

145
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:42,110
yet you've bought my servant.

146
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:44,500
No, Duke Su.

147
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:46,420
It's not like that. I...

148
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,420
Duke Su,

149
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,960
are you being deliberate?

150
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:56,700
Cui Wan,

151
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:59,520
the issue isn't you.

152
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:02,030
It's me.

153
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,020
I've never liked you.

154
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,960
That's okay, Duke Su.

155
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,560
You don't like me but

156
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,440
you can grow to like me slowly.

157
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:22,860
It suffices that I like you.

158
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:23,780
Duke Su...

159
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,540
I don't hate you

160
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:29,080
but I promised Rong'er that

161
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,460
I'll only marry her in this life.

162
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,940
My lady, Young Master is...

163
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:26,340
Why has madam
gone on Ju Shui Pavilion's carriage?

164
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:51,220
Your Highness.

165
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:54,980
My lord.

166
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,420
It's late. Who are you waiting for?

167
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,460
Where's madam?

168
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:33,620
Ping Lake's water is so pretty!

169
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,980
A poet once said

170
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,040
so much Ping Lake,

171
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,980
take only a scoop.

172
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,780
It's so much water.

173
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,140
Little Follower,

174
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,660
you're talented in literature.

175
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,860
You can make a living out of it next time.

176
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,130
Don't look at me,

177
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,550
look at the fishing rod.

178
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:52,820
The fish in Ping Lake

179
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:55,500
tastes better
than any grilled fish out there.

180
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,220
Little Follower!

181
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:07,640
It's fine.

182
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:10,610
Let's go, let's bandage your wound.

183
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,540
It's a small wound.

184
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,820
I want to have the grilled fish you said.

185
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,180
Coming right up.

186
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:27,010
The fish will be done soon.

187
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,380
Here, try it.

188
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:33,900
Is it good?

189
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:36,100
It's delicious.

190
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:38,010
Have a bite too.

191
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:39,010
Okay.

192
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,460
Little Follower.

193
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:50,770
Wen Xing rushed to me.

194
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:52,500
I thought something got to you.

195
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:53,620
I'm fine.

196
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,300
Duke Su allows you to be out late?

197
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:59,620
You know that
I'm the best in sneaking out.

198
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,110
No way, why are you grilling a fish?

199
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,620
Where is it from?

200
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:07,900
I fished it from Ping Lake.

201
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:11,180
I was worried that it'd die
on the way back,

202
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,170
so I hurried you here.

203
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,300
You went to Ping Lake all the way?

204
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:18,840
That's why I don't really see you around.

205
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,910
The lantern went out. Let me fix it.

206
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:38,620
Rong'er!

207
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:49,770
I'll take care of my consort myself.

208
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,420
Thanks, Royal Uncle.

209
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:54,900
-Let's go.
-Hold on.

210
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:56,980
She's reluctant to leave.

211
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:57,860
Go back first,

212
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,460
I can take care of her.

213
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,830
Put me down!

214
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:08,690
Put me down.

215
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:12,410
Put me down!

216
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:27,460
Do you have nothing to explain?

217
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:30,710
Your Highness can marry another girl,

218
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,980
yet I can't even talk to an old friend.

219
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:36,810
Since when are you and Royal Uncle
old friends?

220
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:38,820
It's a long story.

221
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:44,300
You're meeting His Majesty and Consort Shu
tomorrow

222
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,020
to declare your legitimate wife.

223
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,220
We'll talk next time.

224
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,050
And if I want to know now?

225
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:55,980
You don't even have the slightest
trust in me now.

226
00:13:58,620 --> 00:13:59,680
If this is the case,

227
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,070
don't hesitate about the divorce.

228
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,950
Marry your Princess of Xihe

229
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,740
and live happily ever after.

230
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,600
Mutual love and respect, as you wish.

231
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,160
As for me, I'll live well.

232
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:13,310
I'll take care of my family
and my Ruyi Pavilion.

233
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:16,140
Repeat it.

234
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,060
No.

235
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:19,710
It's the same anyway.

236
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,500
I'll give you an answer tomorrow.

237
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,000
His Majesty is here.

238
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:52,850
-Father.
-Your Majesty.

239
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:54,990
Where's Wan'er?

240
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:58,780
Your Majesty,
Su Yu came reporting in the morning.

241
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,050
Wan'er was coming.

242
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:01,420
Who knows...

243
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:04,180
She caught a cold and fright last night

244
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:06,180
and has fallen sick too.

245
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,900
Wan'er is ill too? Is it serious?

246
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,780
It's said that
she needs to rest for some time.

247
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:15,100
Father,

248
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,830
what happened recently

249
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:18,770
can't be explained.

250
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,350
Perhaps, it's true that

251
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:23,250
my birth is singular.

252
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:25,870
Father,

253
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,300
Mother,

254
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:30,770
I don't want to marry my wife
and see it go from

255
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:33,390
a happy occasion to a funeral.

256
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,630
What are you saying!

257
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,940
For your betrothal recently,

258
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,170
I'm fatigued as well.

259
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:45,730
Never mind.

260
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:47,270
Since it's yet

261
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:49,740
the time for a legitimate wife,

262
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:51,010
we'll hold on for now.

263
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:53,460
Fu Rong, however,

264
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:54,970
you have to sort her out.

265
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:56,910
Father,

266
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,890
Rong'er isn't uncouth.

267
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:02,210
When I go back,

268
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:04,670
I'll teach her properly.

269
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:07,370
Go on back then.

270
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:10,880
Yes.

271
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:29,530
Your Majesty,

272
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:32,040
Jin'er admits himself that

273
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:34,530
his concubine is lacking refinement.

274
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:38,850
I have an idea.

275
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,150
Madam!

276
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:49,940
Madam!

277
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:52,250
Pack up quickly, madam.

278
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:59,780
Has the letter of divorce come so soon?

279
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:00,930
Letter of divorce?

280
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:02,340
What letter of divorce?

281
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:03,900
Those from the palace came,

282
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,900
cited that you're staying with
Consort Shu for now.

283
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,730
Are they still thinking

284
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:15,130
that I'll stop His Highness from marrying?

285
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:17,980
No, Princess of Xihe is ill too.

286
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:19,369
She's the third one.

287
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,170
His Highness said that he shouldn't marry
lest a life's lost.

288
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:24,170
His Majesty and Consort Shu agreed.

289
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,210
You're asked to learn in the palace.

290
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:31,130
He's not marrying?

291
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,080
He's not.

292
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,060
But,

293
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:37,020
you'll have to enter the palace alone

294
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:38,570
and serve Consort Shu.

295
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:42,860
No big deal.

296
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,260
Pack up quickly, let's go!

297
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,450
Let's go.

298
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:49,690
Madam, slow down.

299
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:55,180
Consort, stop crying.

300
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:56,570
Seeing you cry,

301
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:58,490
this servant feels bad too.

302
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:00,650
My Jin'er...

303
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:02,610
How could I not feel upset?

304
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,120
Who would've thought,

305
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,330
His Highness' injury in the wedding

306
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:11,390
caused the cold toxin
he got at the border to resurface.

307
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:14,610
Jin'er is innately cold in body.

308
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:17,640
The cold toxin finally cleared so much

309
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:19,850
but it came back again,

310
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,140
much worse this time.

311
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:23,410
According to Mr Ge,

312
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:25,300
Jin'er...

313
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:29,130
is left with one month's time.

314
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:30,530
My lady...

315
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:36,460
My lady,

316
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:38,570
you mentioned one month left,

317
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:39,570
what did you mean?

318
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:41,410
What cold toxin?

319
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:46,650
Since you've heard it,

320
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:48,540
it's fine that I tell you.

321
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:50,670
You should remember

322
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:53,940
that Jin'er was badly injured on his way
back to capital.

323
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:56,200
He got better after a long recuperation.

324
00:18:58,090 --> 00:18:59,550
But the arrow that shot him

325
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:02,370
was only an inch away from his heart,

326
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:04,210
nearly costing his life.

327
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:07,770
It's fortunate that Mr Ge's skilled

328
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:09,340
and managed to save him.

329
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:11,830
Yet, the arrow had cold toxin,

330
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:15,170
a poison that's hard to get rid of.

331
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:18,160
Even when Jin'er is healthy

332
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:19,510
and could suppress it,

333
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:22,490
he was recently stabbed

334
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:26,130
and it caused the cold toxin
to flare up again.

335
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:37,020
Am I the cause
of His Highness' death in the dream?

336
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,060
What did you say?

337
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:45,290
My lady,

338
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:47,310
Fu Rong pleads guilty.

339
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:50,450
His Highness got hurt by me.

340
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:54,260
You're admitting it directly?

341
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:55,640
I'm guilty.

342
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,300
I'm fine however you punish me

343
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,300
but I hope you give me time.

344
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,460
His Highness can surely be cured.

345
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:09,730
Get up quickly.

346
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,370
Mr Ge's been searching for

347
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:17,130
a remedy to cure this toxin

348
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,450
but it's been fruitless so far.

349
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:22,780
Never mind,

350
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:25,930
it's futile to talk about it now.

351
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:28,290
Go to Jin'er for company.

352
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:30,530
Do not let him know about it.

353
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:32,010
If he worries,

354
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:34,490
I'm afraid the toxin will spread faster.

355
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,820
His Highness will be alright.

356
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:39,290
Any poison will have its antidote.

357
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:41,970
His Highness is blessed.

358
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:43,290
He won't die.

359
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:44,580
Alright.

360
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,710
I'm sending a nanny

361
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:48,290
to care for Jin'er.

362
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:49,950
Just in time today.

363
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,410
Go with the nanny.

364
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,730
Just say that I sent her
to teach you etiquette.

365
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:58,230
Rong'er understands.

366
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,910
Don't worry, my lady.
His Highness will be fine.

367
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:12,190
Zhi Hui.

368
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:14,330
-Quick, bring me water.
-Yes.

369
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:23,650
My lady, what are you doing?

370
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,490
I'm spitting ill-intentioned words,

371
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:29,240
in case the heavens hear it

372
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:30,970
and assume it to be true.

373
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:35,410
You really go to great lengths
for His Highness.

374
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:39,840
Mr Ge, why did you insist on
an acupuncture today?

375
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,820
Your Highness, it's for your old injury

376
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:45,390
and recent exhaustion.

377
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,850
It's rare that you aren't busy these days,

378
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,260
it's to relax you.

379
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:56,210
Forgive me Your Highness. My carelessness.

380
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:57,940
I've poked your numbing point.

381
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,090
Mr Ge, your lack of practice

382
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:02,090
has declined your skill.

383
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:04,810
I shall practice harder.

384
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,420
Your Highness.

385
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:13,840
Greetings, Your Highness.

386
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:17,600
Nanny Yan is sent by Consort Shu
to teach me.

387
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:19,750
She may stay in the residence for now.

388
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:22,220
Mother asked for you

389
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,300
for this?

390
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,020
I argued with Your Highness last night,

391
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:31,090
so I asked for a training nanny
to teach me etiquette.

392
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:33,290
Troubles, Nanny Yan.

393
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:36,080
Your Highness, no fret

394
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,400
for Consort was friendly.

395
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,450
She gave reminders,

396
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:39,330
nothing else.

397
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:49,770
[Jin'er is left with one month's time.]

398
00:22:57,890 --> 00:22:59,740
Your Highness, I just came back.

399
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:02,460
The headpiece is heavy.
I'll head back now.

400
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,680
Mr Ge.

401
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,520
My lady.

402
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,560
Did Consort Shu tell you something?

403
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,960
What poison is the cold toxin?

404
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:33,430
What's the aftermath?

405
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:36,900
Literally,

406
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,740
it's the extreme cold.

407
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:40,460
The poisoned will

408
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:43,120
have it worse as time passes.

409
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,190
First, limbs turn icy.

410
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:47,890
Then, the body freezes.

411
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:49,210
Finally,

412
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,130
the organs fail and he dies.

413
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:54,650
Is there no remedy?

414
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,270
I haven't found one for now.

415
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:01,800
I went through many medical books

416
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,930
in hopes to see relevant records.

417
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,520
I dare not tell anyone about this,

418
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:09,080
I can only search slowly.

419
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,130
I can help.

420
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,890
You have more books?

421
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:12,850
Give some to me.

422
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,970
I'll look for you. We'll find a way.

423
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:17,610
Okay.

424
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,130
But this matter
must be kept from His Highness.

425
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:22,570
Don't worry, Mr Ge.

426
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,010
I didn't tell Lan Xiang,

427
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:25,410
His Highness won't know.

428
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:26,950
Alright.

429
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,410
Is there more?

430
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,680
Your Highness,

431
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,550
this dossier was just sent in.

432
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:41,390
[The highest goodness is like water]

433
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:42,360
Concubine Rong.

434
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:51,110
Your Highness, I made you soup.

435
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,330
Drink while it's hot

436
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,400
Weather's so hot

437
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,600
yet drink it hot?

438
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:12,640
It tastes average

439
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,550
but it's effective.

440
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:17,600
It's nourishing,
makes one strong and high-spirited.

441
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,690
High-spirited?

442
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,490
Shut up.

443
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:25,300
Your Highness, my lady,

444
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:27,060
we're taking our leave.

445
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:29,080
Let's go, let's go.

446
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,800
Come on.

447
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:34,290
Move!

448
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:37,260
Let's go.

449
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,920
You don't have to.

450
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,680
What do you mean by you don't have to?

451
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,600
Your Highness works hard.

452
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,000
As your consort,

453
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,410
this is what I should do.

454
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,850
Your Highness wouldn't assume

455
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,720
it's because
I misunderstood you last night

456
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,330
and do this out of guilt?

457
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:04,550
Is it not?

458
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,920
I do feel guilty

459
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,570
but it can't be resolved with soup.

460
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,120
I just think you've worked hard

461
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,480
and made you the soup.

462
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,200
Look at your documents.

463
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,160
Day or night,

464
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,500
they'll read the same.

465
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:23,810
I think,

466
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,720
you should rest earlier tonight.

467
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,320
I'll wait for you in the room.

468
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:30,410
Wait for me?

469
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,780
I won't sleep if you don't return.

470
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:42,840
[The highest goodness is like water]

471
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:48,670
Wait for me?

472
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,290
Nourishing soup?

473
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,350
Ms Fu knew that it's me

474
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,570
but you didn't turn.

475
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:52,370
Are you going back on your words
after losing the bet with me?

476
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,440
Since when did I agree to the bet?

477
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,800
What did I say?

478
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:59,560
Ms Fu wants to back-track.

479
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:00,890
I...

480
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:05,400
Never mind.

481
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,760
It's just a martial arts competition.

482
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,960
Rong'er is going too.

483
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,080
I'll be there.

484
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,120
This has nothing to do
with Concubine Rong.

485
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,400
You're promising me.

486
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,850
You'll have to watch me when you're there.

487
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,160
Little Marquis.

488
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,240
Don't ask for too much.

489
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:29,000
The rumours of Duke Su
are making rounds recently.

490
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,000
What's going on?

491
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,160
From your confident tone previously,

492
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,960
did Duke Su plan all of it?

493
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,760
Ms Fu is clever indeed.

494
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:48,080
Duke Su is very nice to Rong'er.

495
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,360
I told you,

496
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,000
there are womanizers

497
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:53,040
and there are romantic men too.

498
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,360
For someone they love,

499
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,760
they'd come up with ways.

500
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:02,440
I'm just like His Highness.

501
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,230
Ms Fu,

502
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,000
are you leaving already?

503
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,810
You...

504
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,480
got hurt?

505
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:28,320
Other than your head,

506
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:30,080
where else did you get hurt?

507
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,480
Your arms...

508
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,440
or your legs?

509
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,690
I really can't hide anything from you.

510
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:42,720
I tripped mounting the horse
in training today.

511
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,050
Injured my knee a bit

512
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,140
but it's fine.

513
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,080
The martial arts competition is nearing.

514
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,320
You aren't resting

515
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,990
but you're here.

516
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:54,520
Wait.

517
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,440
If you're injured,

518
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:58,170
how did you get up there?

519
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,990
To make sure you keep the promise,

520
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,050
I must come even if I'm hurt.

521
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,190
It's just a twinge.

522
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:07,720
Ms Fu,

523
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,040
take pity on me.

524
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,530
Are you really leaving?

525
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:12,440
Chat with me for a bit.

526
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:21,780
Sure.

527
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:23,880
Do speak.

528
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,480
Little Marquis,

529
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,150
how much longer?

530
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:35,860
I can't hold it anymore.

531
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,260
You're back.

532
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,570
I was thinking to urge you to rest.

533
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,590
Let me.

534
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:00,970
I'll do it.

535
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,490
Why are you in a hurry today?

536
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,310
Uh, that...

537
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:32,730
I accidentally spilled water there.

538
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,040
It's hard and cold,

539
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:35,350
come and sleep here.

540
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:00,730
Sleep inside,

541
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:02,430
in case I wake you up at night.

542
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,840
Why did you pat my leg?

543
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:17,270
Your body is cold.

544
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:18,920
Wear more when you sleep.

545
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,100
I'll have you know,

546
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:21,400
cold starts from the feet.

547
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,000
You have to take care of them.

548
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:33,310
Let's sleep.

549
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,960
Why are you acting strange today?

550
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,730
I'm worried you'd catch a cold.

551
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,200
Do you think I'd harm you?

552
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,950
Even if that's the case,

553
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:48,360
I'd take it willingly.

554
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,420
Rest.

555
00:32:58,350 --> 00:32:59,370
Move inside.

556
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,760
Do you know that

557
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,340
a son will elevate you?

558
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:17,880
My lady.

559
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,889
Did you stay here the entire night?

560
00:34:21,889 --> 00:34:23,350
Mr Ge, you're timely.

561
00:34:23,659 --> 00:34:26,150
None of these books
mentioned the cold toxin.

562
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:27,270
Do you have more?

563
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:29,260
I do.

564
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:37,150
Do you want to go back and rest first?

565
00:34:37,389 --> 00:34:39,050
I'll take a break after these.

566
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,030
Mr Ge,

567
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:53,699
look at this.

568
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,090
This is blood transfusion.

569
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:06,000
It's odd.

570
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,500
It's never been heard of.

571
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:10,630
This is the only description

572
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:12,490
fitting His Highness' symptoms.

573
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:14,680
This is exchanging life for a life.

574
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,400
His Highness will not agree.

575
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:17,560
Besides,

576
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:20,430
to seek one who offers blood

577
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:22,830
will not be easy.

578
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:24,200
Me.

579
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:33,700
My lady, this is a life for a life.

580
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:35,750
This cannot do.

581
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:38,730
I'll look for another method.

582
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,080
Please forget this one quickly,

583
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:43,710
don't do something reckless.

584
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,510
[I brought this upon him.]

585
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,520
[I must save him.]

586
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:52,640
[Fu Residence]

587
00:35:57,510 --> 00:36:00,180
Sister, this Ruyi date is crisp and sweet.

588
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:01,230
Have it.

589
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:05,950
Guan Ge is so nice to me,

590
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:08,690
tasting it first and offering it
when it's good.

591
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:09,690
Here.

592
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:15,760
Rong'er.

593
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:20,270
Why isn't Duke Su coming back with you?

594
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:24,480
He's busy at work.
I don't want to trouble him.

595
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:27,100
Father, you have back problems.

596
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:28,900
I got you some protection.

597
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:31,550
Here are some padded pants,
knee-guards and such.

598
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:33,210
Your knees hurt when it rains,

599
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:34,180
do use them.

600
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:36,110
I know, I know.

601
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:37,590
But...

602
00:36:37,790 --> 00:36:38,670
these...

603
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,950
Don't you think you bought too much?

604
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:43,870
For spares,

605
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:45,240
in case you need them.

606
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:50,470
Sister,
go to Ruyi Pavilion some time soon.

607
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,830
I asked Gu Yuan to melt
some stock there

608
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:54,350
to make two new sets of jewellery.

609
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:55,420
One for Mother

610
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:57,270
and one's for your dowry.

611
00:36:58,420 --> 00:36:59,410
Oh, and

612
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:01,590
the goods I asked Xiao Qi and Xiao Ba
to seek

613
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:02,840
will be sent here too.

614
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:04,320
Rong'er,

615
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:07,710
but why are you preparing so much?

616
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:10,240
Right.

617
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:13,030
What are you doing?

618
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:15,230
Sending so many things...

619
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:17,960
We won't be able to go through them.

620
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:20,510
It's nothing.

621
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:22,830
Just to show that His Highness
is very nice.

622
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:23,890
I'm super rich now.

623
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,940
We all know that he's very good to you.

624
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:28,480
You don't have to send these.

625
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,590
Yes, exactly.

626
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:32,500
Consort's presence in our residence

627
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:34,700
is already our utmost honour.

628
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:36,320
-I...
-What are you saying.

629
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:41,950
We just hope for the two of you

630
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:43,390
to be safe

631
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:45,250
and happy with each other.

632
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:47,200
Compared to giving us gifts,

633
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:48,650
it'll make us happier.

634
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:49,560
That's right.

635
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:51,040
That’s exactly it.

636
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:57,790
Rong'er,

637
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:01,390
why do I still think
you're acting strange?

638
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:03,390
What happened?

639
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,350
Strangely good looking?

640
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:11,470
Sister, you're just suspicious.

641
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:14,650
I couldn't come back with His Highness
previously.

642
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:16,150
Now that we're done with that,

643
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:17,880
I wanted to come back and visit.

644
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:22,310
I'll be safe with him

645
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:23,380
and stay happy.

646
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:24,360
Good.

647
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:28,350
Allowing you to come back alone, Duke Su

648
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:29,950
is truly generous.

649
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:32,450
Don't take it for granted.

650
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:34,210
You mustn't be spoiled

651
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:36,470
in the Su Residence.

652
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:39,700
I know.

653
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:43,470
Luckily you didn't marry off far away.

654
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:46,030
And Duke Su is so nice to you,

655
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:47,990
allowing you to come back home.

656
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:50,190
I'm so happy.

657
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:51,660
It's great.

658
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:56,430
It's great...

659
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:00,710
Cheers.

660
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:03,230
What day is it today

661
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:04,820
to drink with me?

662
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:12,620
I just want to thank you
for my visit home.

663
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:14,170
I'm happy to see my family.

664
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,030
Next time,

665
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:17,470
I'll go back with you.

666
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:22,070
The last time we drank
under the moon like this,

667
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:23,730
we were still in Hong Village.

668
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:25,950
It's my first time drunk in front of you.

669
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:29,170
That wasn't the first.

670
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:30,670
It was not?

671
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:43,690
I want to change my destiny!

672
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:47,070
You were the one who brought me home

673
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:48,600
from Drunken Spring Court?

674
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:50,910
You still remember?

675
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:52,380
I don't,

676
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:54,070
and Sister doesn't divulge.

677
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:55,830
Why didn't you say anything?

678
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:58,200
You keep making me misunderstand.

679
00:40:07,610 --> 00:40:10,280
What troubles you is related to
Royal Uncle.

680
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:13,710
You're still on this?

681
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,280
There's nothing between Duke An and me.

682
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:21,110
I saved him in the date forest
when we were young

683
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:23,100
and we reunited earlier.

684
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:24,350
That's all to it.

685
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:25,670
Believe me.

686
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:30,540
Have another drink if you do.

687
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:47,390
Getting me drunk,

688
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:49,100
what are you up to?

689
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:53,630
Of course I'm doing

690
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:56,720
something I dare not do when you're sober.

691
00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:00,410
Uncalled for.

692
00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:04,910
When I fought with you last time,

693
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:08,400
I said that I shouldn't set up the stall
at Ju Shui Pavilion,

694
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:09,790
it's all out of spite.

695
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:11,990
If I have to do it again,

696
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:13,720
countless times more,

697
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:17,480
I'll still be there waiting for you
to tell your fortune.

698
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:19,840
Rong'er,

699
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:22,790
what are you trying to say?

700
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:39,100
And I'd still tell you that

701
00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:41,180
you'll be rich

702
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:42,750
and have a long life.

703
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:07,730
-My lady!
-My lady!

704
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:09,380
-My lady!
-My lady!

705
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:11,380
Mr Ge,

706
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:13,210
His Highness is yours.
