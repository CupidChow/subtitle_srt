This will be enough.

20
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,160
What's the situation?

21
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,640
Seventh Young Master.

22
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,040
Behind you.

23
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:09,880
Your left side.

24
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,480
Leave now.

25
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,920
You fool, how dare you come back?

26
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,320
You've made a mess of it!

27
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,840
I will strangle you.

28
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,000
No need to be angry.

29
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,320
We couldn't take him down in one move
this time.

30
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,960
Next time, we just need to plan it out.

31
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,720
I'm exhausted.

32
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:56,960
Let him investigate.

33
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,960
Back then, we did it without a trace.

34
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,120
Let's see what he can find out.

35
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,200
Still, it's better to be careful.

36
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,200
Get this dirty thing out of here.

37
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,320
Calamitous!

38
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:11,880
Someone.

39
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,360
Try to open your eyes.
Do you feel better?

40
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:08,520
Young Master, it's my fault
that you suffered.

41
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,480
I've been so careless

42
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,000
to let you get hurt again.

43
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:16,720
The world outside is too perilous,
while I am too naive, Young Master.

44
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,360
Have I come at a bad time?

45
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,680
I will go prepare
the banquet for Ms. Jia.

46
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,680
You can wipe it yourself.

47
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,400
I...

48
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:52,800
This is...

49
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,640
Cool and smooth, it melts upon
entering the mouth.

50
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,880
There's a hint of fragrance
amidst the sweetness.

51
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,800
In terms of ingredients,

52
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,920
it's indeed not made from beans.

53
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,080
How exactly is this made?

54
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,760
Bring the Royal Chef who made this dish.

55
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:22,880
Yes.

56
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,120
I've heard

57
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,360
that the Bean-not-bean has always been
a specialty of Royal Kitchen,

58
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,800
but it has been lost for many years.

59
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,320
I didn't expect
that I could taste it today.

60
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,680
I am very satisfied.

61
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,880
But how is this tofu made?

62
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,880
A Cha, it's for you to answer.

63
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,480
The tofu in this dish
is not made from soybeans,

64
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,600
but from mulberry leaves.

65
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,520
Mulberry leaves?

66
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,520
Crush the washed young leaves,
filter the juice,

67
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,800
and then mix it with plant ash water
and glutinous rice flour.

68
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,680
Since these ingredients are not beans,

69
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,160
it's called Bean-not-bean.

70
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,760
You are a young kitchen maid,
but you are quite insightful.

71
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,680
Aunt, I have a request.

72
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,680
Just say it.

73
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,720
I've had little appetite these days,
since I came to the palace.

74
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,040
But the dishes prepared
by this young kitchen maid

75
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,400
are very much to my taste.

76
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,600
I would like her
to take care of my meals.

77
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,160
Such a small matter, surely I'll agree.

78
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,400
Since that's the case,

79
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,960
then make mine along with it.

80
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:37,120
What? You can prepare meals for her,
but not me?

81
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,120
I'm very satisfied with the dishes
you prepared.

82
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,800
I reward you with this token.

83
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,000
From now on, as you walk
around the palace,

84
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,120
no one dares to obstruct you. Take it.

85
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,680
Say "thank you" to Seventh Young Master.

86
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,800
Take it.

87
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,520
Thanks, Seventh Young Master.

88
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,560
(He treats this little kitchen maid
quite special.)

89
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,480
Seventh Young Master.

90
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,440
Why are you here?

91
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,720
Thank you, Seventh Young Master,
for your appreciation.

92
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,920
But this token...

93
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,120
Once I give something away,

94
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,400
you need to return it?

95
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,920
Are your eyes getting better?

96
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,160
Unharmed.

97
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,320
I know you don't want to have too much
interaction with me.

98
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,400
But that day, you broke rules
of the palace,

99
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,960
saved me and brought me back.

100
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,800
There are criticisms in the palace.

101
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,880
If you have this token,
those who want to bully you

102
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,480
will have to think twice.

103
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,000
I'm leaving now.

104
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,440
A Cha got rewarded
for the cooking skills.

105
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,200
You've earned honor for Royal Kitchen.

106
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:21,360
From now on, you're promoted
from kitchen aid to Royal Chef.

107
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,120
The menial tasks like washing dishes
and cleaning vegetables,

108
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,160
you don't need to do them.

109
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,120
You'll only take care

110
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,920
of the meals of Seventh Young Master
and Princess Gongsun.

111
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:34,880
Understood.

112
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,640
Good. Everyone, go get to your work now.

113
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,560
Why are you looking at me?

114
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,440
By the way, thanks for giving me a hand.

115
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,600
Young Master, as I see,
your meals are quite monotonous.

116
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,000
I've made some adjustment for you.

117
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,720
Have a look and see which you like.

118
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,720
I'll adjust it for you in the future.

119
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,880
As long as it's made by you,
I have no problem with it.

120
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,760
There are too many dishes here.

121
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:56,760
Join me.

122
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,280
This is against the rules.

123
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,640
In my palace,

124
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,400
this is the rule.

125
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,720
According to the rules,

126
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,040
you need to taste the food for me first.

127
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,600
(Why are you now
talking about rules again?)

128
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,960
This is also delicious.

129
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,560
Try this one.

130
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,200
Okay.

131
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,840
