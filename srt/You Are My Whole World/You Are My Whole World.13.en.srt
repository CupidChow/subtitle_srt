(Reconciliation)

(Dossier)

20
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:14,520
Young Master,

21
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,120
I have asked people to look into it.

22
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,840
The people in the list

23
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,000
are all dead or gone missing.

24
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,200
The only exception is the mad Mr. Cao.

25
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:27,120
It seems we can only start with him.

26
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,720
Understood.

27
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,720
(Made by A Cha)

28
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,840
The note is personally written by A Cha.

29
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,480
She wants you to know

30
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,480
she made this dish for you.

31
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,960
Why didn't she deliver it herself?

32
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,880
As far as I know,

33
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,520
Vermilion Bird City has sent a batch of
fine shrimps and crabs

34
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,720
as a gift for the ten-year relation
between two cities.

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,240
A Cha is preparing
for tonight's banquet.

36
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,160
What happened?

37
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,120
Head Chef, the shrimps and crabs
you asked A Yin to prepare

38
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,800
were all suffocated by her.

39
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,240
A Yin, do you realize

40
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,320
the gift symbolizes the dear relations

41
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,040
of Black Tortoise
and Vermilion Bird Cities.

42
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,760
I know I made a mistake.

43
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,640
There are still eight hours
before the dinner banquet.

44
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,280
If we steam the dead shrimps and crabs,

45
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,400
they will taste differently.

46
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,960
If we can't solve it,

47
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,720
everyone, including myself,

48
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:41,120
will be beaten up
and kicked out of the palace.

49
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,200
I have an idea.

50
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,600
A Yin, prepare some Huadiao wine.

51
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,320
Luo Bei, prepare some dried orange peel
and preserved plums.

52
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,840
I know a type of marinade

53
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,880
that can save the fresh taste
of shrimps and crabs

54
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,600
and can impart a unique flavor to them.

55
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,800
Do we still have enough time?

56
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I got this. Don't worry.

57
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,360
Get moving.

58
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:14,000
One monk, two monks, three monks.

59
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,680
One monk, two monks,

60
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,800
three monks, four monks.

61
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,160
Mr. Cao, have you recalled anything?

62
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,760
No drinking water at all.

63
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:28,920
Cao Rui.

64
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,040
Idiot.

65
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,440
You're the idiot.

66
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:31,960
You idiot.

67
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,800
You madman.

68
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,360
Idiot, idiot.

69
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,080
You're crazy and mad. You freeloader!

70
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,640
You're shameless. I'd slap you.

71
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,840
Alright, Mr. Dayuan.

72
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,120
Send Mr. Cao back.

73
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,040
Go back.

74
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:43,800
No.

75
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,200
I said "go back".

76
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,840
I said no!

77
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:58,720
The smell is so good. Crabs, shrimps.

78
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,920
Don't run around.

79
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,440
A Cha, thanks for your help this time.

80
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,160
It's nothing.

81
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,000
Yummy food.

82
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,520
Are you alright?

83
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,720
I am not alright.

84
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,960
We're doomed.

85
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,680
We will all be beaten up
and driven out of the palace.

86
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,800
I'll find a way out for you.

87
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,640
This is Royal Kitchen's problem.

88
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,480
We will think of our own solutions.

89
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,280
But we don't have enough time now.

90
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,240
I got it. Though only half of
the shrimps and crabs are left,

91
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,400
we can focus on the presentation
and symbolic meanings of the dish.

92
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,440
A different approach.

93
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,640
I want it all.

94
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:27,720
Which chef made these two dishes?

95
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,960
Let me ask you.

96
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,120
Why are these dishes
made in such a style?

97
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,960
This one is called Pine Wave Crab.

98
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:48,200
The pine on the mountain
and the crab in the sea are independent,

99
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,560
representing Black Tortoise
and Vermilion Bird Cities

100
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,200
support each other.

101
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,520
The other is called
Dragon King Rides the Sea.

102
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,080
Now that you have recovered, City Lord,

103
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,560
you will be like a dragon,

104
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,840
leading the people towards
prosperity and health.

105
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,640
Well said.

106
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,800
Let me have a look.

107
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,560
These shrimp antennas are crisp,
and the shells are glowing.

108
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:24,880
The flesh is plump,
and the aroma of wine is full-bodied.

109
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,520
I like it. Reward her.

110
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,280
Thank you, City Lord.

111
00:06:32,826 --> 00:06:36,192
(Royal Kitchen)

112
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,160
The City Lord and the nobles
have enjoyed the meal.

113
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,320
They generously rewarded us.

114
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,600
Starting this month,

115
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,440
everyone's salary will be doubled.

116
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,920
Thank you, Head Chef.

117
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,920
A Cha, you deserve
the most credit this time.

118
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,280
What reward would you like?

119
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,200
It's not my achievement alone.
The credit belongs to everyone.

120
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,600
Humble and patient.
You truly are promising.

121
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,320
These are the recipes and insights
I've accumulated over many years.

122
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,240
(Royal Kitchen Notebook)
It's yours now.

123
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,040
Thank you, Head Chef.

124
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,040
What is this?

125
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,080
This is called fragrance tea.

126
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,480
It's Pu'er tea with milk and osmanthus.

127
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,680
Thanks for today.

128
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,120
I really want to ask you.

129
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,400
Why were you always targeting me before?

130
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,040
Do you really not know?

131
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,720
Then do you remember Dadouzi?

132
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:24,760
I know about Xiaodouzi, but not Dadouzi.

133
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,480
It was the year we entered the palace.

134
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,720
You made a dish called chicken stew.

135
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,800
I remember now.

136
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:42,400
I picked up a chicken that had fainted.

137
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:43,800
Wait.

138
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,880
That chicken was yours?

139
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,960
It was my only friend.

140
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:54,240
Not only did you stew it,
but you also fed it to me.

141
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,120
I'm sorry, so sorry.

142
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,040
How was I supposed to know
someone kept a chicken as a pet?

143
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,800
Poor Dadouzi. I just entered the palace.

144
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:12,400
Here I was. Burying a chicken
that had died too young.

145
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,000
I'm sorry.

146
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,600
What do I have to do to make up for you?

147
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:21,160
Never mind. You saved me today.

148
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,440
Let's call it even.

149
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,520
Then drink this

150
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,480
and stop being mad at me, okay?

151
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:46,080
I'd never expected
our great Seventh Young Master

152
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,080
to be taken by A Cha...

153
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:53,040
Exactly. Otherwise, I'd try to
seduce Seventh Young Master too.

154
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,320
Perhaps I would have been promoted.

155
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,480
What are you talking about?

156
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,400
A Cha got promoted on her own merit.

157
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,800
If you dare to gossip again,

158
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,800
