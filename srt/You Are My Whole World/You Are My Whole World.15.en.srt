(Birthday Banquet)

19
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,920
Do you want to eat something else?

20
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,440
I still want to eat

21
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,760
imperial pumpkin, eight-treasure tofu,

22
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,000
snowy soup, crab-stuffed oranges,
wheat-scented chicken,

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,640
yingyang yam, hundred birds' nest,
crystal stew,

24
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,040
crab roe pastry,
Buddha Jumps Over the Wall Soup,

25
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,440
Tele-Rhino, lotus steamed fish...

26
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,840
You remember
what happened back then, right?

27
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,880
Those were the twelve dishes
at the banquet.

28
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,320
You remember all of them, huh?

29
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,160
Stop playing the fool and speak up.

30
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,600
Let him go.

31
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,960
He wants to kill me.

32
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,000
Don't be scared.
No one here wants to kill you.

33
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,960
He is my friend.

34
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,640
We're here to make you some tasty food.

35
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,640
Tasty food?

36
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,000
Yay. I love the dishes
you make the most.

37
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,640
Well, after eating the dishes I make,

38
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,640
you will tell us what happened, right?

39
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,680
You need to make them first.

40
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,040
But let me be clear.

41
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,240
I'll only eat

42
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,840
one of the twelve dishes
each day, each time.

43
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,800
I won't eat if it's too much
or not tasty.

44
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,360
I won't eat if I don't have an appetite.

45
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,960
Cao Rui, don't go too far.

46
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,600
It's a deal.

47
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,600
Great.

48
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,200
There will be tasty food!

49
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,280
After finishing the twelve dishes,

50
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,280
we'll coax him into talking.

51
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,320
Let's see if he can give us any clues.

52
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,920
That's our only choice.

53
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,360
Did I forget something?

54
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,080
I can't recall.

55
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,560
It's so late. Why are you here?

56
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,400
I couldn't sleep, so I came to see you.

57
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:11,920
Don't worry.

58
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,200
I've been working
on the first dish for Mr. Cao,

59
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,560
imperial pumpkin.

60
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,320
I believe I'll figure it out soon.

61
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,680
Thank you.

62
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,880
Not a problem.

63
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:20,960
By the way,

64
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,640
I heard the City Lord is going to
hold a birthday banquet for you.

65
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,360
That's right.

66
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,160
Father said that it had been many years
since I had a birthday banquet.

67
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,360
It must be done this time.

68
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,560
Then I'll have to show off my skills.

69
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:35,840
By the way,

70
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,000
about the night I got drunk...

71
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,480
Never mind.

72
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,400
Never mind? How could you not mind it?

73
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,680
You're being so weird.

74
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,120
I...

75
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:57,920
Go away.

76
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,480
What's wrong? You're a bit off.

77
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,360
I'm annoyed.

78
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,280
Go away.

79
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,600
Come back.

80
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,760
What are you doing?

81
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,600
What's wrong?

82
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,160
Why are you suddenly unhappy?

83
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,160
How can I be happy?

84
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,920
Ever since my seventh brother came back,

85
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,120
these court ministers who supported me

86
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,440
have changed their attitudes.

87
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,080
That Princess Gongsun

88
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,120
didn't even look at me before.

89
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,240
But she went on a blind date with him.

90
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,240
If this continues,

91
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,000
can I be the City Lord in the future?

92
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,760
I have a plan

93
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,440
that'll drive him out of the competition
of the City Lord position.

94
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,000
What plan? Speak up.

95
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,760
Isn't Seventh Young Master's birthday
coming up?

96
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,440
We could do this.

97
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,120
Alright then.

98
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,320
Let me dote on you one more time.

99
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,040
Everyone, take a break from your work.

100
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,840
Today is Seventh Young Master's
birthday banquet.

101
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,160
Ms. Jia has asked
the experienced Royal Chef Li

102
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,800
to arrange tonight's menu.

103
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,720
Everyone has to follow his instructions.

104
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,080
Yes.

105
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,400
Get back to work.

106
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:03,880
Everyone,

107
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,120
today is Lianyu's birthday.

108
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,960
He has won great military merits

109
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,360
for Black Tortoise City
in the northern borders.

110
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,640
I am very gratified.

111
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:20,920
Come on, everyone.
Let's make a toast to Lianyu.

112
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,880
Thank you, Father.

113
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,200
Let the feast begin.

114
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:15,240
Your Highness.

115
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,360
What's wrong, Your Highness?

116
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,120
Call the royal physician!

117
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:19,880
Your Highness.

118
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,640
Father.

119
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,400
Your Highness.

120
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,880
Father, what's wrong? Father.

121
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,360
Second Young Master, your face...

122
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:32,600
My face? My...

123
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,080
Second Young Master.

124
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,120
Second Young Master.

125
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,840
Why has this rice turned black?

126
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,080
Why has the wine turned red?

127
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,720
Jinx.

128
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,480
The jinx has appeared again.

129
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,440
He Lianyu, it really is you!

130
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,440
There are odd signs in the sky.

131
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,440
The City Lord and Second Young Master
are struck by misfortune.

132
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,280
He Lianyu, you truly are a born jinx.

133
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,480
Grand Master is right.

134
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,400
You will bring fatal misfortune
to everyone around you.

135
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,760
At the birthday banquet ten years ago,

136
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,440
Ms. Wang died because of you.

137
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,400
Ten years later, you came back.

138
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,200
You'll bring deadly fate
to the City Lord too.

139
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,120
You are the one who should die.

140
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,760
You are the one who should die.
