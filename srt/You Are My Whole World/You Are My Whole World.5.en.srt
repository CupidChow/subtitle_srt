My master is calling me.

30
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,080
I must go. See you next time.

31
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,160
Did you make this soup?

32
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,160
Yes, Madam.

33
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,640
What kind of meat is in it?

34
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,040
This is West Lake Beef Soup.

35
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,080
Naturally, it contains beef.

36
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,720
How dare you!

37
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,160
You dare to let me break my vow
of not eating beef.

38
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,000
After the prayers end,

39
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,080
Ms. Jia wants a bowl of soup.

40
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,360
Chef Huang wants you to prepare it.

00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:48,960
(A Yin.)

42
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,040
Madam, I know I was wrong.

43
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,960
I didn't know you didn't eat beef.

44
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,880
Guards, punishment.

45
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,080
I was wrong, Madam.

46
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,680
Madam, spare my life.

47
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,720
I was wrong, Madam.

48
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,520
Spare me, Madam!

49
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,400
The City Lord let
the second young master

50
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,560
close the poisoning case
from ten years ago.

51
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,320
Why do you want to look into it again?

52
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,320
Who was decided as the criminal?

53
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,560
What was the poison?
Was it thoroughly investigated?

54
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,160
Since the head chef

55
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,960
Dong Lingniang went missing,

56
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,720
all leads of this case were lost.

57
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,040
Who the murderer was
and what the poison was,

58
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,600
nothing has yet been clarified.

59
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,440
The case was hastily closed
without clarifying anything.

60
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,720
This time, I return not just to meet
with the City Lord.

61
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,600
This case must
be thoroughly investigated.

62
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,840
Dayuan, are you willing to assist me?

63
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,320
Yes.

64
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,400
Ms. Wang was my lifesaver.

65
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,960
If you wish to investigate,
I will help with all my might.

66
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,280
By the way,

67
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,680
please also help me check
about a palace maid

68
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,200
called Doubao.

69
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,120
Yes.

70
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,760
Something happened, Mr. Dayuan.

71
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,800
The kitchen maid A Cha
you asked me to look after

72
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,920
has had an accident.

73
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,720
It wasn't me.

74
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,480
It wasn't my fault.

75
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,240
Why did you stop? Continue.

76
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,400
Who are you?

77
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,240
How dare you obstruct my execution!

78
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,600
Take him down!

79
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,240
Yes.

80
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:56,800
I'm late.

81
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,800
Where are they?

82
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,520
Where are they?

83
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,720
They are gone? Chase after them!

84
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,240
Who was that just now? Pretty skilled.

85
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,200
If I'm not mistaken,

86
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,000
it should be him who has come back.

87
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,040
You're awake.

88
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,360
Stool.

89
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,720
Stool,

90
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,080
thank you for today.

91
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,320
If it weren't for you,

92
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,400
I would have lost my life.

93
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,400
It's alright.

94
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,120
You saved my life
outside the palace before.

95
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,640
Besides,

96
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,760
if you were to die,

97
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,360
who would cook for me?

98
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,440
Still saying such things
at a time like this.

99
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,960
What's wrong with you?

100
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:45,880
I...

101
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,400
I've managed to survive,

102
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,520
but I have offended Ms. Jia.

103
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,440
I'm afraid I can't go back anymore.

104
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,920
It's fine not to go back to that place.

105
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,240
You don't understand.

106
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,600
The Royal Kitchen is there.

107
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,280
It's my biggest dream in life.

108
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,440
Dream?

109
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,360
I love cooking.

110
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,760
I want to become the best chef
in the Royal Kitchen

111
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,720
and find
the supreme flavor in the world.

112
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,800
The supreme flavor in the world?

113
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,920
What is that?

114
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,440
My master told me

115
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,640
a chef's greatest aspiration was to find

116
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,640
the supreme flavor in the world.

117
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,880
But now I have nothing.

118
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,800
Perhaps you still have a chance
to return to the palace

119
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,400
to fulfill your dream.

120
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,920
Don't comfort me anymore.

121
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,160
I'm certain I can't go back.

122
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,800
You can choose to trust me once.

123
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,280
Well, what about your dream?

124
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,600
I...

125
00:08:23,904 --> 00:08:24,840
(Black Tortoise Hall)
Jinx,

126
00:08:25,824 --> 00:08:27,920
a disaster star
has descended from heaven!

127
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,560
Bringing misfortune to father, mother,
wife, and child.

128
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:35,760
Mother.

129
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,680
Jinx, a disaster star
has descended from heaven!

130
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,320
I don't have a dream.

131
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,760
I only have a goal.

132
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,040
(I must find out)

133
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,720
(who killed my mother that year)

134
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,720
(to avenge her.)

135
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,960
I feel like I could eat
a whole cow right now.

136
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,680
When you return to the palace,

137
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,440
no, when we return to the palace,

138
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,040
I'll treat you to a good meal.

139
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,040
(He's still comforting me.)

140
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,560
(We can't go back.)

141
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,000
(We might not even be able
to save our lives.)

142
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,720
What do you feel like eating now?

143
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,840
I'll make you a meal.

144
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,240
There's nothing here.
How are you going to cook?

145
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,120
Close your eyes.

146
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,960
Are they closed?

147
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,080
Just imagine

148
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,880
there is much delicious food
in front of us.

149
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,160
What do you want to eat?

150
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,040
I kind of miss the mutton
from outside the pass.

151
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,000
Well, that's simple.

152
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:19,360
I'll cook you a dish
called Sweet Mutton.

153
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,160
Sweet Mutton?

154
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,600
That doesn't sound like mutton,

155
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,320
but a dessert.

156
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,240
Of course, it's mutton.

157
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,600
It has to be the lean meat
from the hind leg of the sheep.

158
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,160
Fatty meat won't do.

159
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,360
Remember to cut it on the bias.

160
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,840
What can I do?

161
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,360
Separate the egg whites

162
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,640
and mix them into the meat.

163
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:44,840
Okay.

164
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,480
Let me do it.

165
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,760
Okay.

166
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,040
Add some salt.

167
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,920
Shouldn't Sweet Mutton

168
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,080
be sweet?

169
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,640
Although it has a sweet flavor,

170
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,280
it is mainly stir-fried with salt.

171
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,520
If there's no salt,

172
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,840
the sweetness won't be prominent.

173
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,040
Have a taste.

174
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,320
Sweet Mutton.

175
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,720
Oh, no. The more I talk,
the hungrier I get.

176
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,200
I've made you so many delicious meals.

177
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,920
When will you cook a meal for me?

178
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,440
Cooking is simple.

179
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,880
I'll do it when we're back.

180
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,760
You should first learn how to use a wok.

181
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,600
