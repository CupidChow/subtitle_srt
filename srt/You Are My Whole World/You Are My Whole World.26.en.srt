(The Truth)

19
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:16,760
I think

20
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,360
the assassin was sent

21
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,120
by Lianbin and Ms. Jia.

22
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,120
Why did they do this?

23
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,840
Perhaps they already know

24
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,080
that I asked you to cook for Mr. Cao

25
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,440
to find out the truth.

26
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,960
Actually, I suspect that they are

27
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,560
behind the poisoning

28
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,680
at the birthday banquet.

29
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,080
But I have no evidence.

30
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,520
Now the truth will soon come to light,

31
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,240
forcing them to make a move.

32
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,720
I see. Then...

33
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,040
Young Master.

34
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,280
Should I go up and talk to you?

35
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,920
No need. You stand there and talk.

36
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,480
Yes.

37
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,760
In the imperial court,

38
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,320
all ministers jointly

39
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,240
recommended Second Young Master
to be the Lineal Master.

40
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,920
I'm afraid City Lord has agreed.

41
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,080
Your current situation...

42
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,880
Don't worry. I can handle it.

43
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:07,160
Tomorrow, we will make
the last dish together.

44
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,040
Young Master, why aren't you worried?

45
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,840
You can leave. I'm going to rest.

46
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,320
What's wrong with him?

47
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,800
I found a way in the book

48
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,160
to restore his memories.

49
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,160
By stimulating his eyes,
ears, mouth, and nose

50
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,920
to connect the five senses
with his past,

51
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,960
Mr. Cao might remember what happened
back then.

52
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,640
Imperial pumpkin, eight-treasure tofu,

53
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,720
xueji soup, crab-stuffed oranges,
wheat-scented chicken,

54
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,520
Bagua yam, birds' nest,

55
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,080
crystal stew,

56
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,680
crabmeat crisps,
Buddha Jumps Over the Wall,

57
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,000
Hearts Resonate As One,

58
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,800
and Hibiscus Steamed Fish.

59
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,520
(Ten years ago)
Mister.

60
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,400
The Royal Kitchen

61
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,600
prepared 12 dishes

62
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,680
for Seventh Young Master's birthday.

63
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,960
This is the last one.

64
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,560
Ms. Wang was poisoned.

65
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,920
Ms. Wang was poisoned.

66
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,480
- Imperial physician.
- Ms. Wang.

67
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,000
Somebody.

68
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,960
A jinx!

69
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,400
Bringing misfortune to father, mother,
wife, and child.

70
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,480
Chef Dong.

71
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,000
Dong Linglang.

72
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:45,240
A well.

73
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,400
Chef Dong, Dong Linglang, a well.

74
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,640
I know nothing at all.

75
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,040
Don't kill me.

76
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,800
I know nothing.

77
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,400
I know nothing.

78
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,520
Don't kill me.

79
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,000
I know nothing.

80
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,360
I don't know.

81
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,332
(Dong Linglang)

82
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,280
A Cha.

83
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,240
She is my master.

84
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,720
A Cha, I'm so sorry for your loss.

85
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,960
If she were alive,

86
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,400
she wouldn't wanna see you like this.

87
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,880
Young Master.

88
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,360
It's a letter written in her blood.

89
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,760
It must be her last words.

90
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,960
I knew I could not escape death.

91
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:13,320
So I'm writing this to expose the truth.

92
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,840
(City Lord fears Ms. Wang's influence
in the army)

93
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,960
(and resents Ms. Wang
for overshadowing him.)

94
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,280
(After Ms. Wang
had the Seventh Young Master,)

95
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,120
(City Lord grew more and more anxious.)

96
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,000
(He fears Ms. Wang's power)

97
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,440
(and this child.)

98
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,240
(He's afraid the country established
with Ms. Wang's help)

99
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,160
(will fall into Ms. Wang's hands.)

100
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:36,400
(So she had me put poison in the food.)

101
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,520
Dear, I toast to you.

102
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,200
You eat.

103
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,000
Okay.

104
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,000
Mother, you eat first.

105
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,200
Okay.

106
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,400
Good boy.

107
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,760
Eat more.

108
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,080
I didn't dare
disobey City Lord's command.

109
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:37,440
I know my sin,
and I'll pay for my crime with my death.

110
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,560
So the culprits

111
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:45,400
are not Ms. Jia or Mr. Lianbin.
It's the City Lord.

112
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,520
All of you leave and close the door.

113
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,200
Yu, what are you doing?

114
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,960
Do you remember how my mother died here

115
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,320
ten years ago?

116
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:09,400
He Lianyu, are you trying to rebel?

117
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,200
Will you kill your father?

118
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,760
Did you think of this day
when you killed my mother?

119
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,960
Did you have the slightest vestige
of affection for her?

120
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,000
Be careful of ambushes.

121
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,800
He Lianyu, I know you are inside.

122
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,360
Don't be impulsive.

123
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,280
He Lianyu, Ms. Wang has been dead
for ten years.

124
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,240
No matter what you do,

125
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,840
you can't bring the dead back to life.

126
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,560
You come out.

127
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,360
Perhaps in consideration of your mother,

128
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,000
City Lord might spare your life.

129
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,600
Both of you, shut up.

130
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,080
He Lianyu.

131
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,800
This is a trap they set up.

132
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,520
Don't fall for it.

133
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,680
Guards!

134
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,520
Seize this maid.

135
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,080
She defies me.

136
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:23,280
He Lianyu, listen. Give up now.

137
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,200
He Lianyu.

138
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,960
Father.

139
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,840
He Lianyu, you are so ruthless.
