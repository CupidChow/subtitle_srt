I'm lamenting the lost relationship
of my childhood friend.

170
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,480
The other day, I heard from Mr. Dayuan

171
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,560
that Seventh Young Master was afraid

172
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,320
that the curse
on him would bring misfortune

173
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,400
upon A Cha,

174
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,480
so he ruthlessly drove A Cha
out of the palace.

175
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,040
Curse?

176
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,120
Tell me in detail.

177
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,520
That's ridiculous.

178
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,120
I can't believe

179
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,880

180
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,080

00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,560

186

I must eat her dishes.

189
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,480
Her dishes.

190
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,960
I want to eat the dishes she makes.

191
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,680
Cao Rui, how dare you!

192
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:43,720
Shut up.

193
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,440
Young Master, if only A Cha were here.

194
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,000
He Lianyu.

195
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,200
Dayuan, take him away.

196
00:10:59,440 --> 00:10:59,920
Yes.

197
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,600
Please. Let me go.

198
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,040
You're getting me killed by him.

199
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,400
He Lianyu, go away.

200
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,600
He Lianyu, did you make A Cha leave

201
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,720
because of a stupid curse?

202
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,400
You are the world's biggest idiot

203
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,960
and loser.

204
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,280
Are you frightening me?

205
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,960
You think you can scare me?

206
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,800
I know you are nothing

207
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,600
but a useless paper tiger.

208
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,880
As the Young Master
of Black Tortoise City,

209
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,240
you hurt a woman's heart

210
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,480
because of a stupid curse.

211
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,160
You don't deserve the title
of War God in Red.

212
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,120
Have you finished?

213
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,320
No, not yet.

214
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,840
I knew that an arrogant man like you

215
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,920
would say that whatever you do

216
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,080
is for her own good.

217
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,920
Have you ever asked what she thinks,

218
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,640
decides, and feels?

219
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,680
I haven't known A Cha for long,

220
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,000
but I know

221
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,480
she is definitely not your plaything,

222
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,160
attachment, or burden.

223
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,000
If you truly care for her,

224
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,160
seeing her as your beloved woman,

225
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,960
you should convey your inner thoughts

226
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,120
to her

227
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,200
and discuss and decide with her

228
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,960
instead of what you're doing now.

229
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,320
You acted behind her back
and hurt her feelings,

230
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,800
but claimed it was for her own good.

231
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,240
He Lianyu, you don't know...

232
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,160
Your Highness.

233
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,000
Let's go, Your Highness.

234
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,200
Don't pull me.

235
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,600
He Lianyu, you idiot.

236
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,600
Let's go.

237
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,840
Stop pulling me.
