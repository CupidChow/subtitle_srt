(Meeting Parents)

19
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,400
Father. Mother.

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,480
A Cha, my precious daughter.

21
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,800
You're finally back.

22
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,520
Is my daughter back?

23
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,280
You're acting

24
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,920
as if you could never see
each other again.

25
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,880
So what?

26
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,320
Liu, you're back too.

27
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,280
Your parents and I
often talked about you.

28
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,560
We said when you come back,

29
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,840
we'll finalize
your wedding arrangements.

30
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,640
They are...

31
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,040
They are...

32
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,320
(He's a young master
and she's a princess.)

33
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,320
(My mother will freak out if she knows.)

34
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,920
They are my friends in the palace.

35
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,720
Your friends.

36
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,960
Uncle. Auntie.

37
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,000
This girl is really sensible.

38
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,240
Hello.

39
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,640
Introverted.

40
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,000
Don't just stand here.

41
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,840
Sit.

42
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,520
I'm going to get you something to eat.

43
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,920
Come. This way please.

44
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,160
Wait. Let me use the kitchen first.

45
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,760
What do you need the kitchen for?

46
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,800
It's a secret.

47
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,320
- Well.
- What's she up to?

48
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:33,960
A waxberry?

49
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,160
Shrimp.

50
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,480
Crispy outside, soft inside.

51
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,360
And there's filling.

52
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,160
Sourness and sweetness are just right.

53
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,320
So delicious.

54
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,000
So the recipe...

55
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,120
A promise is a promise.

56
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,560
I'm going to get it for you now.

57
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,720
So tasty.

58
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,760
Great.

59
00:03:21,632 --> 00:03:24,058
(Revelry Tavern)

60
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,240
Dive in.

61
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,400
Everyone, help yourselves.

62
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,840
Liu, you too.

63
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,000
Why are you so reserved?

64
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,720
I should thank you

65
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,760
for taking care of A Cha in the palace.

66
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,760
Not at all.
I often went to A Cha to ask for food.

67
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,040
So you often had dates in the palace?

68
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,440
Why aren't you eating?

69
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,680
They don't suit your taste?

70
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:50,200
Eat more. This is tasty.

71
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,240
Try this.

72
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,320
This is also tasty.

73
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,280
A prawn.

74
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,200
Here.

75
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,320
My father made this. Eat.

76
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,400
He's an adult.

77
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,280
Doesn't he have hands?

78
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,600
Why are you picking food for him?

79
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,240
That's right.

80
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,680
Alright, what are you doing?

81
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,640
How did you know A Cha?

82
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,360
This is easy to explain.

83
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,920
I was outside the palace.

84
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,720
I met some people and fought with them.

85
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,840
A Cha saved me.

86
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,120
Young man, you look decent.

87
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,040
It's not good to get into trouble.

88
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,600
You are right.

89
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,040
I was just about to ask.

90
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,360
What do you do?

91
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,840
I'm currently unemployed.

92
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,640
Young man.

93
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,680
You should work hard while you can.

94
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:44,960
Yes.

95
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,960
You can't live your life

96
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,960
in a muddle.

97
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,080
Yes. You're right.

98
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,440
Liu is young

99
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,360
and already an imperial physician.

100
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,040
He works for the government.

101
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,920
It's a well-paid job, understand?

102
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,640
Absolutely.

103
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,360
Enough.

104
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,120
I heard

105
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,000
girls in the palace
have a new list of dream boys.

106
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,720
Mr. Liu ranks first on that list.

107
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:05,920
Me?

108
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:06,880
- Him?
- Him?

109
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,400
Mr. Liu is honest, mature, and composed.

110
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,800
He's reliable and gentle.

111
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,200
He is very meticulous

112
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,120
when taking care of patients.

113
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,000
Especially his well-paid job.

114
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,600
That's a job for life.

115
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,880
Eat.

116
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,760
Eat, everyone.

117
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,760
Come on.

118
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,200
Have some dishes.

119
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,440
Don't just sit here.

120
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,040
You've never seen so many dishes, right?

121
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,760
Indeed, I haven't.

122
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,400
Father, you eat too.

123
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,400
I'm coming in.

124
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,480
Come in.

125
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,400
Sorry for what happened today,

126
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,280
Grand General.

127
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,600
Have a piece of sweet bunny cake

128
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,960
and you'll have a good mood.

129
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,480
Actually, you said this to me before.

130
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,080
So sour!

131
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,320
Why do you believe everything?

132
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,760
Wait.

133
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,720
You're that little crybaby?

134
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,920
You've changed a lot.

135
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,640
A Cha.

136
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,040
We can't let my mother
find out I'm here.

137
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,920
I'm off now.

138
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,920
See you tomorrow, little crybaby.

139
00:07:38,522 --> 00:07:40,768
(Revelry Tavern)

140
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,800
A Cha.

141
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,880
Take good care of yourself
in the palace.

142
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:44,920
Mind your step.

143
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:45,640
Okay.

144
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,320
Got it, Mother.

145
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,560
Liu.

146
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,720
Take good care of A Cha.

147
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,240
Take good care of yourself too.

148
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,320
Rest assured, Auntie.

149
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,120
You must eat on time.

150
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,520
Mubai.

151
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,840
Thank you.

152
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,400
You can't stay up late.

153
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,440
A Cha

154
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,040
likes you a lot.

155
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,880
But you should win credit for yourself.

156
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,600
Take this.

157
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,720
Go make a better living,

158
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,680
so that after A Cha leaves the palace,

159
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,440
you'll have the confidence
to marry her, right?

160
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,520
Okay.

161
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,480
Make way.

162
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,560
Make way.

163
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,360
Make way.

164
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,920
Seventh Young Master, Princess Gongsun,
please return to the palace.

165
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,560
Keep a low profile outside the palace.
Get up.

166
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,280
Get up.

167
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:07,000
Princess? Young Master?

168
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,040
Auntie.

169
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,720
- Mother.
- Auntie.

170
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,840
Are you okay?

171
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,640
Are you okay?

172
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,960
She's fine. She just got startled.

173
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,640
Are you okay, Mother?

174
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,920
Give it back.

175
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,600
Seventh Young Master,

176
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,600
it's my private savings
I've kept for many years.

177
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,880
Auntie, are you okay?

178
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,160
Go away.

179
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,640
How dare you keep private savings!
Where is the money?

180
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,160
Many people are watching.

181
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,000
How much more do you have?
Give it to me.

182
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,280
This is all of it.

183
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,720
How dare you run away!

184
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,400
I'd like to see where you can go.
