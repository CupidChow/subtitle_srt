Scoundrel!

21
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,440
What are you performing over there?

22
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:29,200
I just said there were stink bugs.

23
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,400
All right.

24
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,120
I got something for you.

25
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:32,920
Come over here.

26
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,080
Why stand there still?

27
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,160
Seventh Young Master.

28
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,440
You said you prepared something.

29
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,720
This is it?

30
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,440
Yes.

31
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,360
I promised you before

32
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,760
to prepare a table of food for you.

33
00:01:59,080 --> 00:01:59,880
Please sit.

34
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:00,960
Well.

35
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,520
Sit, as I told you.

36
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,160
Take a look.

37
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,760
This is...

38
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,360
A soup with tomato and egg.

39
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,200
Fine.

40
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,040
All right.

41
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:23,680
Come on.

42
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,800
And this, a roast chicken.

43
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,520
You call this a roast chicken?

44
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,600
Yes, it's a roast chicken.

45
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,600
It's pretty good.

46
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,320
This wouldn't be a fish soup, would it?

47
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,480
You've actually guessed it right.

48
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,280
I could smell the fishiness far away.

49
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,240
Have a taste.

50
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,080
This one looks average,

51
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,400
but it might taste quite good.

52
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,480
It's quite good.

53
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,560
Really?

54
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,000
Come, let me serve you a bowl of this.

55
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,160
Enjoy it.

56
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:25,960
Come on.

57
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,080
Come on.

58
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,400
Oh, I just remembered

59
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,800
there's still a pot on the stove
in the Royal Kitchen.

60
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,200
Seventh Young Master,
I'll leave and do my job.

61
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,880
You haven't had the soup yet.

62
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,360
Seventh Young Master
is really out of line.

63
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,600
Just as he came back,

64
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,240
he's got a kitchen maid
from Royal Kitchen

65
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,600
as his exclusive property.

66
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,480
Is it the girl

67
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,240
who often brought food for Liu?

68
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,320
Yes, it's her.

69
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,000
A Cha?

70
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,360
A Yin.

71
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,760
The Seventh Young Master
called A Cha over last night.

72
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,320
Do you think
she might be our future mistress?

73
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,000
A Yin.

74
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,640
You got angry with her quite often.

75
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,480
Now...

76
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,920
Shut up. It's so annoying.

77
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:03,880
A Yin.

78
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:12,800
A Cha, let me help you, come on.

79
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,600
A Cha, why do you look so pale?

80
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,120
Did you stay up all night?

81
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,400
The Seventh Young Master is valiant
on battlefields.

82
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,720
He must have performed
quite well last night.

83
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,440
His capability

84
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,560
is not even as good as Xiaodouzi
from the Royal Kitchen.

85
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,120
Xiaodouzi?

86
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,480
Thank you, Mr. Liu.

87
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,440
Promote it when go back.

88
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,080
Okay.

89
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,440
Mr. Liu, this pearl cream...

90
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,720
Can it keep my beauty and youth?

91
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,880
Of course.

92
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,880
If you want this pearl cream,

93
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,560
what should you do?

94
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,720
A Cha only cooks and doesn't hype.

95
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,760
Everyone should get closer to her dishes

96
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,200
and stay away from her private life.

97
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,160
Very good, just say that
when you go back.

98
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:08,800
Don't forget it.

99
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,360
Thank you.

100
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,560
Next.

101
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,360
A Cha is single
and not looking for a date.

102
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,400
Don't let people come and try it.

103
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,160
Not any one.

104
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,320
Very good, just say it like that.

105
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:19,720
Thank you.

106
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,960
Don't forget to tell others.

107
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,240
Next.

108
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,520
A Cha and Mr. Liu
are childhood sweethearts,

109
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,280
innocent playmates, perfect match,
and nobody can beat that.

110
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,960
Let's guard the official couple.

111
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,120
Guard the official couple.

112
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:31,640
Okay.

113
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,360
I'm a palace maid from
Seventh Young Master's residence.

114
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,120
Make sure to spread it when you go back.

115
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,160
I'll give you two.

116
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:38,960
Don't forget it.

117
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:39,880
Next.

118
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,320
Let's guard the official couple.

119
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,640
Guard the official couple.

120
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:46,040
In recent years, the power in the court
has gradually lost it balance.

121
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,240
Second Young Master and Ms. Jia

122
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,640
almost dominate the court.

123
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,040
This time, Father summoned me back.

124
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,640
He must want me to counterbalance
my second brother

125
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,640
to stabilize his status as City Lord.

126
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,720
Young Master, about what happened
at the birthday banquet,

127
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,320
I discovered some people.

128
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,080
This is the list of people

129
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,120
who showed up there that year.

130
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,360
But they have left the palace
one after another.

131
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,840
Only one person is still in the palace.

132
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,280
This Mr. Cao

133
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,840
once was a eunuch by City Lord's side.

134
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,440
He went mad after the poisoning case.

135
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,360
Cao Rui.

136
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,800
Demon, take a rake from me.

137
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,800
Take another rake.

138
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,920
Stop pretending to be mad.

139
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,800
About the poisoning case that year,

140
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,720
how much do you actually know?
Spit it out.

141
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:19,840
Jade Emperor, even if you ask me
many more times,

142
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,760
I won't tell you the whereabouts
of Monkey King.

143
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,000
I won't tell you.

144
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:34,440
(Mr. Cao used to be the steward eunuch
by my father's side.)

145
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,320
(Now he's been placed here
to recuperate.)

146
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,000
(How did he go mad like this?)

147
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,440
I will not tell you.

148
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,360
Why are you here?

149
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,160
I won't speak even if
the Jade Emperor is here.

150
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,560
The Royal Kitchen sent me
to deliver food.

151
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,080
Master, why did you come so late?

152
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,360
I've been waiting for you so hard.

153
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,160
Master,

154
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,160
you brought me food.

155
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:12,920
Mr. Cao.

156
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,440
Master, you've come to bring
your disciple food.

157
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,680
Give it to me.

158
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,440
I will leave first.

159
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,160
Master, why did you leave? Master.

160
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,560
This duck is delicious.

161
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,280
It's wrapped with lychee jam outside,

162
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,360
crispy, and the duck is tasty.

163
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,400
Nice.

164
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,080
Cao Rui,

165
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,400
do you remember who I am?

166
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,760
Seventh Young Master.

167
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,560
Then do you remember

168
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,760
what happened that year?

169
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,120
Queen of the Women's Kingdom,

170
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,160
my master was captured by a demon.

171
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,880
What should we do, Master? Queen.

172
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,840
Yummy.
