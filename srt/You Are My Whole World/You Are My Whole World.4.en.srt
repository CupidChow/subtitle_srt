(Seeking Medical Help)

19
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,720
It looks a bit like an allergy.

20
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:24,960
Allergy?

21
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,720
Who is he?

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,160
Why are you so concerned
about a young eunuch?

23
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,960
Just don't worry about who he is.

24
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,880
Hurry up and give him a diagnosis.

25
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,520
He seems to have been
through many battles.

26
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,800
Isn't he a eunuch?

27
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,880
Why so many injuries?

28
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,160
What are you doing?

29
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,920
Help! Someone is killing me!

30
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,000
I won't treat him.

31
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,400
Don't go.

32
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,400
You...

33
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,200
Braised pork trotters, pork tripe
and snake pot, spicy locusts,

34
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,000
and roasted scorpions,
all your favorites.

35
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,400
Such delicious pork trotters!

36
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:00,400
Don't take it out on the food
even if you're angry.

37
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,160
Don't be angry.

38
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,840
He's just that annoying.

39
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,760
Please be the bigger person.

40
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,840
Fine.

41
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,680
For the sake
of our childhood friendship,

42
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,880
I'll forgive him.

43
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,200
Hurry up and eat. It'll get cold soon.

44
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,600
Only A Cha understands my stomach best
in the whole world.

45
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,560
No kidding.

46
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,600
I think his wound is an arrow injury.

47
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,680
The arrow was poisoned.

48
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,520
Although the wound has been treated,
there's still some toxin residue.

49
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,000
I'll prescribe some medicine.

50
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,120
Just take it back. I won't go over.

51
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,360
Eat less of food
that can cause inflammation.

52
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,480
Rest for a while and he will be fine.

53
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,240
Alright, start eating. Eat this.

54
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,000
Here you go.

55
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,320
This is way too strong-flavored.

56
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,680
I eat it? You eat first.

57
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,120
I'll have one too.

58
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:04,560
Not bad.

59
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,880
Why did you put your clothes on?

60
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,280
The medicine hasn't been applied.

61
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:19,440
The imperial physician
isn't angry, is he?

62
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,320
How could he not be angry with you?

63
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,840
But no worries, I've taken care of it.

64
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,120
But next time, you can't be so reckless.

65
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,080
If other people in the palace find out,

66
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,520
both of us will...

67
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,640
I got it.

68
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,480
I've put the medicine here.

69
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,880
Remember to apply it.
I have things to do, so I'm leaving.

70
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,160
A Cha.

71
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:43,920
Thank you.

72
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,640
Mr. Dayuan.

73
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,720
Recently, I've been having
some indigestion.

74
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,240
Give me a good massage.

75
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,400
Alright, please take a seat.
I'll be right there.

76
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,680
(Good. I'll ask Mr. Dayuan)

77
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,240
(about that young eunuch.)

78
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:31,840
Mr. Dayuan,

79
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,320
I heard that a new young eunuch
has come to our palace.

80
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,680
There are many new ones.
Which one are you referring to?

81
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,840
There's a kitchen aide named A Cha.

82
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,480
I heard that she was quite close
to this young eunuch.

83
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,280
Why are you asking about him?

84
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,320
I am sort of like a brother to A Cha.

85
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,400
Suddenly, there's a stranger
by her side.

86
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,520
I'm just worried
that he might have ulterior motives.

87
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,600
I think there's something going on
between A Cha and the young eunuch.

88
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,320
You, as her brother,

89
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,440
might as well get ready
to meet your brother-in-law.

90
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,720
But he's a eunuch.

91
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,280
What's wrong with that?

92
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,920
Good, very good.

93
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,840
I'm sorry, Mr. Dayuan.

94
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,080
A Cha is really something.

95
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,240
Not only does she cook well,

96
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,720
but her dancing is also not bad.

97
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,440
How did she do it?

98
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:34,840
Also...

99
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,960
Sorry, Mr. Dayuan.

100
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,800
I-I slipped up.

101
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,400
What do you take me for?

102
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,720
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

103
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,040
Calm down. Take it easy.

104
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,000
I'll be careful.

105
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,120
I'm sorry.

106
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,480
A Yin, A Cha, starting from today,

107
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,520
you two

108
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,960
are officially members
of the Royal Kitchen.

109
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,280
Chef Huang,

110
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,600
I heard there was
only one position available.

111
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,680
Who did you hear that from?
In the future, ask fewer questions.

112
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,920
Wash those dishes in the kitchen.

113
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,240
Why doesn't she have to wash them?

114
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,480
Do I need to explain

115
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,880
how I assign tasks
to a kitchen aide like you?

116
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,760
A Yin, come with me.

117
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:26,920
You...

118
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,120
What are you doing? What do you want?

119
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,640
No.

120
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,280
Which palace are you from?
You're so handsome.

121
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,240
How come I've never seen you before?

122
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,760
I...

123
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,520
It's an earthquake.

124
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,640
Turns out it's a tremor in my heart.

125
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,520
Charming, can't get enough...

126
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,560
Don't.

127
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,680
A spicy boy.

128
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,720
The spicier, the more thrilling.

129
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,280
No.

130
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,680
Ladies,

131
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,240
he...

132
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,160
He's my distant cousin.

133
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,560
He is a bit off his trolley.

134
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:43,640
I...

135
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,880
You guys should stop teasing him.

136
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,560
Slow down.

137
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,360
What a pity. Didn't expect him
to be a handsome fool.

138
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,280
What are you doing?

139
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,720
Isn't this what you like?

140
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,320
I...

141
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,440
Don't hang around
with those palace maids.

142
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,640
What if they were

143
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,400
to find out you were not a eunuch?

144
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,640
Boys have to protect themselves.

145
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,440
Do you understand?

146
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,640
(This palace maid is quite interesting.
I'll tease her a bit.)

147
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,240
What are you going to do?

148
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,800
I'll pay attention to what you've said.

149
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,040
But recently,

150
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,280
you haven't been cooking
properly for me in time.

151
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,800
If I can't eat well,

152
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,280
my wound won't heal.

153
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,200
If my wound doesn't heal,

154
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,240
you'll have to keep calling me cousin.

155
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,280
Alright.

156
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,920
I'll cook for you.

157
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,480
Oh, in three days, Ms. Jia
and the second young master

158
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,160
will leave the palace
to pray for the City Lord.

159
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,120
We all have to go with them.

160
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,560
