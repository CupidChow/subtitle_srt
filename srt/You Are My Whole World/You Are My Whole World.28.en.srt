Turns out you set me up together.

21
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,560
You're being a smart aleck.

22
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,200
That's why we could find solid evidence.

23
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,160
Now, you've handed yourselves over.

24
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:32,160
It's time to pay for what you did.

25
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:39,560
My lord.

26
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,640
Given I've been with you for many years,

27
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,360
I beg you to spare me.

28
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,240
Father, you promised
their lives are in my hands.

29
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,760
No, please.

30
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,200
I'm already three months pregnant.

31
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,160

If you didn't bring this up,

34
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,360
I might spare your life.

35
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,200
Since that's the case,

36
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,320
no one can save you today.

37
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,040
Guards!

38
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,880
Take them away
and give them the poisoned alcohol.

39
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,760
Who dares to touch me?

40
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,040
You old man.

41
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,000
How cruel you are.

42
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,520
I'm cruel?

43
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,160
I've always known about the dirty things

44
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,160
you and Lianbin did.

45
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,240
Back when I was ill in bed,

46
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,720
you two did nasty things in my room.

47
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,960
Be gentle.

48
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,720
You smell nice.

49
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,400
Come on.

50
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,120
I didn't want to make it public.

51
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,360
I never expected you'd carry his child.

52
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,280
My family

53
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,000
is completely disgraced by you.

54
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,120
Guards, take them both away

55
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,480
to be executed right now.

56
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,000
I'm the Lady of City Lord.

57
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,720
Who dares to lay a hand on me?

58
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,680
You old man.

59
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,320
I learned that the mix
of cercis chinensis

60
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,200
and fish soup could be fatal

61
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,080
because I read it
in the book on your desk.

62
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,040
Don't tell me it was unintentional.

63
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,440
Your whole family is evil.

64
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,680
You're slinging mud at me
before you die.

65
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,720
Drag her out.

66
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,720
Don't touch me.

67
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,720
Yu.

68
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,040
You've suffered a lot over the years.

69
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,720
I'm already an old man.

70
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,720
So the Black Tortoise City

71
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,920
will be yours.

72
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,960
Father, I am a bit tired.

73
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,320
I want to go back and rest.

74
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,360
(A few days later)
You're unreasonable.

75
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,680
You are heartless.

76
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,520
You are irrational.

77
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,240
You are hypocritical.

78
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,160
You...

79
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,600
What?

80
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,160
What's going on?

81
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,880
(Imperial Hospital)

82
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,680
I am leaving.

83
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,720
What happened? Why did you quarrel?

84
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,160
A Cha, I am a princess,

85
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,320
while he's just an imperial physician.

86
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,480
Shouldn't he marry
into the Vermilion Bird?

87
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,760
I'm a man.
How can I marry into my wife's family?

88
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,400
What's wrong
with marrying into Vermilion Bird?

89
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,080
Those wishing to marry
into Vermilion Bird

90
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,280
are lined up from here to White Tiger.

91
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,000
I can't believe he rejected me.

92
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,480
She's a princess, but so what?

93
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,800
Can't I marry a princess?

94
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,240
If she looks down on me,

95
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,440
marry another man.

96
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,320
Why does she marry me?

97
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,440
What do you want?

98
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,600
I...

99
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,920
You go back and think it over carefully.

100
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,400
Leave me alone.

101
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,600
I don't want to stay anyway.

102
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,840
So what are you going to do?
You'll give up on Liu Mubai

103
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,920
and find someone else?

104
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,760
How could I?

105
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,000
You know what to do.

106
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,520
Men always have stubborn pride.

107
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,120
If you want him to marry into your family,
you must make him happy.

108
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,520
You guys talk. I'm leaving.

109
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,040

110
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,280

114
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:49,920
Sure.

115
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,480
You marry me

116
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,520
which means I marry you?

117
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,040
Sure.

118
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,720
Wait, that's not right.

119
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,880

120
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,400
Yeah, I'm willing to.

121
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,840
You marry into my family.

122
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,400
No way.

123
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,240
Enough. I'm trying to be gentle,

124

You...

128
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,080
What? Do you disagree?

129
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,520
You still can't get over A Cha?

How is that possible?

131
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,120

Modesty, wellness,
prosperity, and peace.

198

loyalty and filial piety.
