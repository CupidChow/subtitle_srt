(Joyful Foes)

19
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,040
Young Master, are you okay?

20
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,640
Well.

21
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,040
Is childhood sweetheart a big deal?

22
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,160
Yeah, kinda.

23
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,480
Growing up together,

24
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,320
they must be quite close to each other.

25
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,000
Am I not good enough to her?

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,760
To whom?

27
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,280
Young Master, you had a fight

28
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,360
with A Cha, didn't you?

29
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,360
According to my years of experience,

30
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,520
you should apologize for this matter.

31
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,360
I apologize?

32
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,640
She's flirting
with the imperial physician,

33
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,360
giving me attitude.

34
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,360
And I should apologize?

35
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,640
You can never reason

36
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,560
with each other in relationships.

37
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,760
A Cha is like a wild horse.

38
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,760
The more you reason with her,

39
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,320
the farther she'll run away.

40
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,800
Then what should I do?

41
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,400
Take a seat.

42
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,160
Young Master,

43
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,600
you just need to remember three rules.

44
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,280
Which three?

45
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,920
First, a woman is never wrong.

46
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,960
Second, if she is wrong,

47
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,520
then refer to the first rule.

48
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,520
Third...

49
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,280
If she is at fault,

50
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,600
it's my fault?

51
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,480
You're truly wise.

52
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,400
Young Master, please calm your anger.

53
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,400
I'll excuse myself now.

54
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:57,920
Wait.

55
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,040
As a eunuch,

56
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,080
how come you know so much
about these matters?

57
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,000
When I was young,

58
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,000
for ten years in a row, I've been
the most handsome man in our unit.

59
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,760
The number of women
who were paired up with me,

60
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,440
if not a hundred,

61
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,520
then eighty.

62
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,080
(Why is she here?)

63
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,560
(Come to ask for advice)

64
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,880
(on how to pursue He Lianyu again?)

65
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,280
What took you so long?

66
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,640
Weren't you on a blind date
with Seventh Young Master?

67
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,280
Why, should I be congratulating you?

68
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:31,120
Why do I detect
a hint of jealousy in your words?

69
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,760
How was your chat with He Lianyu?

70
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,320
Not so good.

71
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,120
He's so boring.

72
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,680
Not interesting at all.

73
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,840
Yeah, he's not as good as me.

74
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,400
What about you and
your little childhood sweetheart then?

75
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,880
How's that going?

76
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,720
A Cha and I have nothing going on.

77
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,800
Really?

78
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,480
Really.

79
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,520
I've always treated her
like my little sister.

80
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,040
I've realized I don't have that kind of

81
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,280
romantic interest in her.

82
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,760
I made this for you.

83
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,080
What's this?

84
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:33,920
Lover's Soup.

85
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:38,840
For me?

86
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,640
Not for him?

87
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,560
He doesn't deserve my soup.

88
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,400
Lover's Soup
is made for the beloved one.

89
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,600
Now, drink up.

90
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,560
And you must finish it.

91
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,800
If you don't, I'll stew you instead.

92
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,800
Hurry up and drink.

93
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,960
Okay, I'll try it.

94
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:19,880
Does it taste good?

95
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,480
It's-it's okay, I guess.

96
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,360
Don't like it? I'll take it away then.

97
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,480
No, I'm kidding. It tastes delicious.

98
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,160
Stinky man, bad man.

99
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,960
Going on a blind date? A blind date?

100
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,560
Blind date, blind date.

101
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,080
Stinky man.

102
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,680
Falling for everyone.

103
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,400
Bad man.

104
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,720
Stinky man.

105
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,560
You hate me that much?

106
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,200
Alright, it's my bad.

107
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,360
I shouldn't have yelled
at you like that.

108
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,440
It was my fault.

109
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,720
Please don't be angry, okay?

110
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,480
Angry?

111
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,160
Why would I be angry?

112
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,720
Are you drunk
from that Lover's Soup, huh?

113
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,440
So, you're angry with me
because of this.

114
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,000
And all that fuss with Liu Mubai.

115
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,920
Was that just to annoy me?

116
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,080
Go and get married to your princess.

117
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,880
What blind date banquet?

118
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,920
Don't listen to the nonsense
people say outside.

119
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,400
Black Tortoise City hasn't yet reached

120
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,520
the point of marrying off sons.

121
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,800
All these things were arranged
by the City Lord.

122
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,040
I didn't know.

123
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,520
Besides,

124
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,400
that bowl of soup wasn't made for me.

125
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,440
It was made for Liu Mubai.

126
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,920
Asking me to go into battle
to kill enemies is fine.

127
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,360
Asking me to drink scorpion soup?
I cannot do that.

128
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,000
No longer angry?

129
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,160
So, it turns out
that the ingredients of Lover's Soup

130
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,880
are chosen
according to the beloved's preferences.

131
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,640
So, your mother must have also chosen

132
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,160
the things you love to eat the most.

133
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,840
How does it taste?

134
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,840
Exactly this flavor.

135
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,520
Let me try this one.

136
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,440
The lotus root is severed
yet still connected.

137
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,280
It's waxy, fragrant, and sweet.

138
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,440
I shouldn't have
taken out my anger on you using Mubai.

139
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,880
Between us,

140
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,640
trust is the most important.

141
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,160
Getting angry without listening to you

142
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,720
is my bad.

143
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:08,040
This incident shows
that we lack communication.

144
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,280
We should meet more often in the future.

145
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,400
Haven't we met enough?

146
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,120
No, not enough.

147
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:16,960
A Cha,

148
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,600
after the birthday banquet case,

149
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,240
I have something to say to you.

150
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,440
Madam, calm down, please calm down.

151
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,200
My lady, what's wrong?

152
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:37,000
Get out. Now!

153
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,920
What's the matter? Tell me.

154
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,960
It's He Lianyu.

155
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,400
Why are you worrying about him again?

156
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,320
Is it because of that incident
at the last birthday banquet?

157
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,240
The show you put on was disrupted
by that kitchen maid.

158
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,960
But Father
has already grown suspicious of him,

159
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,160
right?

160
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,200
Furthermore,

161
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,280
those ministers,

162
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,800
aren't they all half-doubting?

163
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,440
If this continues,

164
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,920
he can forget about
inheriting the position of City Lord.

165
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,360
But I only found out today

166
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,720
that Mr. Cao is in his hands.

167
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,360
That lunatic?

168
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,840
What's the harm being in his hands?

169
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,040
He's just
an insignificant little eunuch.

170
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,320
Back then,

171
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,760
we handled that matter so meticulously.

172
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,240
Even if he doesn't go crazy,

173
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,160
what could he possibly know?

174
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,280
Better safe than sorry.

175
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,320
Anyway, we can't let them go further.

176
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,160
And as far as I know,

177
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,200
A Cha has been helping him all along.

178
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,760
She cooked for Mr. Cao,

179
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,640
trying to get information out of him.

180
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,800
Honey, then what do you want to do?

181
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,200
Doesn't he
rely heavily on that kitchen maid?

182
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,440
You want to kill her?

183
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,600
Absolutely not.

184
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,800
That's not okay.

185
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,080
Let me tell you.

186

00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,320
We can't lay a finger on her.

189

Why bother to kill her?

195
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,160
We shall just...
