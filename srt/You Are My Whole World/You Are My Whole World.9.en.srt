(Sesame Rice)

19
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,720
(I didn't expect him
to be so shameless.)

20
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,000
Okay, I'll make it for him now.

21
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:34,880
It's overcooked.

22
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,800
Overcooked? What do you mean by that?

23
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,520
A Cha, please make another one.

24
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,560
Overcooked, right? Fine.

25
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,080
Undercooked.

26
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,520
Alright.

27
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,080
Too salty.

28
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,320
Young Master, don't worry.
There is another that isn't salty.

29
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,320
Salty, not salty.

30
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,400
Overcooked, undercooked.

31
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,840

A Cha

33
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,160
is busy preparing for the promotion
to Royal Chef.

34
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,360
She suggested you
have the food as it is.

35
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,120
But A Cha did say

36
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,880
that you must have this.

37
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,080
Sesame rice.

38
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,000
Troublesome?
[*Sounds like sesame ice in Chinese]

39
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:02,880
By the way,

40
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,480
what is A Cha doing now?

41
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,520
She's

42
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,680
busy having Mr. Liu
taste-test her dishes.

43
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,800
Dayuan.

44
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,840
Go get me a squad of soldiers.

45
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,000
What do you need them for?

46
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,680
Mr. Liu! Mr. Liu!

47
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,760
Coming!

48
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,560
Wait a minute.

49
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,600
I'll be right there!

50
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,240
Right away.

51
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,480
I'm coming!

52
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,360
Mr. Liu,

53
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,240
uncouth men like us

54
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,480
are out in the sun and rain
every day at the border.

55
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,040
You've got to take good care
of our skin.

56
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,640
Rest assured. You can count on it.

57
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,040
Mr. Liu.

58
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,120
Coming! Bro, I'll be right back!

59
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,080
Wait for me, one second.

60
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,840
You said it'd take a quarter hour

61
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,760
before taking this off?

62
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,920
Almost half an hour now. Peel it off!

63
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,120
I'm sorry!

64
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,920
Mr. Liu.

65
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,000
Coming!

66
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,320
Mr. Liu.

67
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:40,840
Mr. Liu.

68
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,200
Sorry, I'll be back right away.

69
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,600
Mr. Liu, hurry up!

70
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,760
I came earlier.

71
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,760
Why not my turn yet?

72
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,760
I'm so sorry!

73
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,760
A good massage for you.

74
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,000
My back is hurting.

75
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,040
Mr. Liu.

76
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,560
- Mr. Liu.
- Mr. Liu.

77
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,280
I'll be right there.

78
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,840
Can I take off the facial, Mr. Liu?

79
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,600
Hurry up!

80
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,760
Right away.

81
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,720
I want a facial mask, Mr. Liu.

82
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,520
Coming!

83
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,120
Don't worry. I am coming!

84
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,040
Be gentle.

85
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,600
Wait a minute.

86
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,720
Today, the daughter of the Lord
of Vermilion Bird City,

87
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,120
Princess Gongsun comes to visit.

88
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,720
I heard she is your niece.

89
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,880
What, you're planning to hit on her?

90
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,800
Of course not.

91
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,840
Behind her is the Vermilion Bird City.

92
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,960
If she offers me her support,

93
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:47,560
then my seizing the lordship
will proceed even more smoothly, right?

94
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,560
Moreover,

95
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:54,280
if you and your niece serve me together,

96
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,120
wouldn't that be wonderful, right?

97
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,000
Yes, exceedingly wonderful.

98
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,200
Very good.

99
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,400
(You think of hitting on her,)

100
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,920
(but you don't know if she would agree.)

101
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,680
Move aside.

102
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,560
Princess Gongsun.

103
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,040
Second Young Master.

104
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,720
How about give it a try?

105
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,640
(Is there anything wrong
with He Lianbin?)

106
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,480
(I'm so beautifully dressed,)

107
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,480
(coming here after a tiring journey,)

108
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,640
(just to outshine everyone else.)

109
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,120
(Didn't expect
not to see a single pretty girl,)

110
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,080
(and yet he brought me here
to play Cuju.)

111
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,200
Then let's try it.

112
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,680
Come on.

113
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,960
What's all that?

114
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,720
Over these years,

115
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,880
no one from your city dared
to accept the challenge in Cuju games.

116
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,920
The strongest turns out to be a woman.

117
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,120
Princess, great kicking power!

118
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,520
Not bad.

119
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,400
How do you like it?

120
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,880
Comfortable.

121
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,680
Mr. Liu,

122
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,680
as you see, we have been here

123
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,880
for a while.

124
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,360
We feel like getting dispirited.

125
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,480
Do you have any ideas

126
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,960
that can help us restore vitality?

127
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,080
- Right.
- Right.

128
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,120
Restore vitality?

129
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,240
Yes.

130
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,480
There is a session of fitness exercise.

131
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:39,680
- Come on, let's do it.
- Show us.
