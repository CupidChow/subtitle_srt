(Niu Dali)

19
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,280
On the day I got drunk,

20
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,080
what exactly happened?

21
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,000
Pretty handsome.

22
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,240
Let me ask you.

23
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:39,040
If my dishes and I fell into the water,

24
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,560
who would you save first?

25
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:48,400
Of course I'd save...

26
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,720
A Cha.

27
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,640
You have ruined your reputation.

28
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,960
The imperial pumpkin.

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,080
I bet it tastes good this time.

30
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,920
It smells good and tastes sweet.
This is the flavor.

31
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,720
The eight-treasure tofu.

32
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,240
The snowy soup.

33
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,480
Not bad. Delicious.

34
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,880
The crab-stuffed oranges.

35
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,160
Delicious.

36
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,640
The wheat-scented chicken.

37
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,040
This is the wheat-scented chicken?

38
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,960
Listen.

39
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:38,880
In this city,
there is a master of making sugar.

40
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,800
The sugar she makes
is sweet but not cloying.

41
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:48,120
The sweetness
can burst forth in the mouth.

42
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,960
Who is this master?

43
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,040
Niu Dali.

44
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,480
If I want to make
the authentic wheat-scented chicken,

45
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,320
I'll have to go outside the palace
to look for Niu Dali.

46
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,240
Let me refill it.

47
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,160
It's tasty and not sticky.

48
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,200
It's quite lively here.

49
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,520
Brother,

50
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,520
buy a bouquet for your wife.

51
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,320
She must like flowers.

52
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,200
Little girl, I'm not his wife.

53
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,760
Little girl,

54
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,680
do you know someone named Niu Dali?

55
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,000
I know Dali.
The sugar she makes is very tasty.

56
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,160
She's over there.

57
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,360
Thank you.

58
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,160
This is for you.

59
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,520
Thank you.

60
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,720
I'll take this.

61
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,240
Thank you.

62
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,200
No big deal.

63
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,520
It's for you.

64
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,160
The flower is not worth that much money.

65
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,520
She's honey-mouthed.

66
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:21,080
I didn't expect Seventh Young Master
to do something like this.

67
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,960
I thought he was a nerd.

68
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,000
A Cha

69
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,720
is not reserved at all.

70
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,120
Are you jealous?

71
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,080
Don't forget our plan.

72
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,640
Of course I remember.

73
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,120
To forbid them to be together alone.

74
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,480
But Your Highness,

75
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,240
do we really need to buy so many things?

76
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,640
What? Has shopping delayed your plan?

77
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,520
Your Highness.

78
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,040
What's wrong?

79
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,280
We're being followed.

80
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,960
Followed?

81
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,880
Why are you here?

82
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,440
What a coincidence. You're shopping too.

83
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:19,160
How did they end up together?

84
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,360
What are you doing?

85
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,640
Men and women shouldn't be too close.

86
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,000
Why are you standing so close?

87
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,880
A Cha. Let's go.

88
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,200
Let's go somewhere else.

89
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,000
I think there are
mosquitoes buzzing here.

90
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,840
They...

91
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,040
Go ahead.

92
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,160
Your Highness.

93
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,640
Let's go too.

94
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:58,746
(Dali Sugar Painting)

95
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,800
Dali Sugar Painting?

96
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,080
Niu Dali.

97
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,400
Who's looking for me?

98
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,720
You are Niu Dali?

99
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,800
What? Is there a problem?

100
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,360
No.

101
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,360
We heard you have
an exclusive sugar-making recipe.

102
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,920
So we specially came for it.

103
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,360
That's my exclusive recipe.

104
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,840
How can I just give it to you?

105
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:02,920
Well...

106
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,120
Is it enough?

107
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:21,880
Go.

108
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,080
It's time to impress her.

109
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,640
I'll give you extra 50 taels.

110
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,840
I'll give 100 taels.

111
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:30,760
200 taels.

112
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,120
300 taels.

113
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:35,880
Keep bidding.

114
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:36,680
400 taels.

115
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,760
600 taels.

116
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,160
Enough.

117
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,480
Stop bidding.

118
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,720
Even if you offer 1,000 taels,
I won't sell it.

119
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,800
Wait.

120
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,400
What on earth do you want?

121
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,600
It's easy. Promise me one thing.

122
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,560
I'll set a question.

123
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,880
If you can answer it,

124
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,640
I will sell the recipe to you

125
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,520
at 1,500 taels.

126
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,040
1,500 taels?

127
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,800
You're so greedy.

128
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,560
Here. It's exactly 1,500 taels.

129
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,800
What's the question?

130
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,240
The question is simple.

131
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,760
Which of you can make a dish

132
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,760
that looks vegetarian
but tastes like meat?

133
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,120
What kind of dish is that?

134
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,720
Waxberries. Fresh waxberries.

135
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,520
Here you are.

136
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,320
Waxberries, come and take a look.

137
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,120
Fresh waxberries.

138
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,760
I have an idea.

A Cha.

142
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,840
Boys and girls

143
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,440
working in the palace are back.

144
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,800
It's obvious they work in the palace.

145
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,440
They've become more imposing.

146
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,560
Look at their chubby faces.

147
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,680
It's true
the life in the palace is better.

148
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,200
Mubai. You've grown more handsome.

149

150
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,360
That's right.

151
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,920
Look how well-matched they are.

152
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,800
