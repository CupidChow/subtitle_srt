=Episode 1=
(Encounter)

19
00:01:10,176 --> 00:01:12,512
(Royal Kitchen)

20
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,800
(Once, a hundred cities stood in rivalry
across the Midland.)

21
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:30,560
(Each city fought the other,
bringing calamity to the living.)

22
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,040
(In the midst of chaos,)

23
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,710
(the city lords, Vermilion Bird,
Black Tortoise,)

24
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:37,400
(Azure Dragon, and White Tiger,)

25
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,200
(pacified the country
and formed alliance through feasts,)

26
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,080
(bringing a century of peace
to the Midland.)

27
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,960
(Black Tortoise City in Midland's north
revered gourmet food above all.)

28
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,200
(The Royal Kitchen in the palace was
known for producing legendary chefs.)

29
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,080
(Among them was a young palace maid
named A Cha.)

30
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,280
Duckie, whether I can
join the Royal Kitchen

31
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,360
is all up to you now.

32
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,600
Mr. Dayuan, please taste it.

33
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:53,960
(The rice is soft and tender,
and the duck meat is fresh and tasty,)

34
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,520
(rich but not greasy.)

35
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,720
(This is the finest of duck dishes.)

36
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,800
Mr. Dayuan, how is it?

37
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,160
A Cha, your culinary skills
have indeed improved greatly.

38
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,920
Thank you, Mr. Dayuan.

39
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,120
But currently,
there is only one position available

40
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,520
in the Royal Kitchen.

41
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,440
Yet there are two candidates.

42
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,800
Two?

43
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,440
Mr. Dayuan,

44
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,520
this is the food my father asked me
to bring to you.

45
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,560
Please accept it.

46
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:41,120
One of you has talent
and the other has wealth.

47
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,440
I cannot bear to fail either of you.

48
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,760
How about this?
You two have a competition.

49
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,480
Competition?

50
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,280
Now is the time when bamboo fungus
breaks through the soil.

51
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,240
I would like to have some soup.

52
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,200
You two take this as your challenge.

53
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,120
The winner will join the Royal Kitchen.

54
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,040
Stop it. You're hurting me.

55
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,760
You didn't get hurt, did you?

56
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,440
Come on.

57
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,240
Shall we go somewhere else?

58
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,120
Your father is still lying in there.

59
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,560
No way!

60
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,120
He snatched you from me.
I have put up with him

61
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,840
for over a decade.

62
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,440
This position of City Lord

63
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,120
will soon be mine.

64
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,400
At this moment,

65
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,680
why shouldn't we just have some fun?

66
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,400
Right?

67
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,600
Give me a kiss.

68
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,440
Don't take this lightly.

69
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,080
The old man issued a decree
before he fell ill,

70
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,760
ordering the northern border guardian
to return to the palace.

71
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,680
Why did this old fool

72
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,280
summon that jinx back to the palace?

73
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,040
What is this?

74
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,520
Route map.

75
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:57,960
What route map?

76
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,080
You're awesome.

77
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,360
Truly worthy of being my little babe.

78
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,640
Come on, let me reward you.

79
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,800
Cut it out.

80
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,960
Found it.

81
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,120
Here's another one.

82
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,800
The general has always
enjoyed eating raw meat?

83
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,680
He has no sense of taste.

84
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,080
Everything tastes the same to him.

85
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,600
For him, this meat with blood

86
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,800
could actually replenish some vitality.

87
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,600
You can't eat raw meat.

88
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,120
Sir, although beef is good,

89
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,320
it should not be eaten raw.

90
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,720
It hurts your spleen and stomach.

91
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,280
And it might breed worms in the belly.

92
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,520
It's better to eat less of it.

93
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,960
Who is this peasant girl?

94
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,440
Don't dawdle. Go away.

95
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,640
I'm not dawdling.

96
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,840
I'm just trying to help.

97
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:05,920
You are not aware

98
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,720
how many worms are in this raw meat.

99
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,480
If someone gets sick from eating it,

100
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,840
the disease might kill them.

101
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,720
I told you to go away.

102
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,480
Stop the nonsense and leave.

103
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,200
There's an ambush.

104
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:32,920
Attack.

105
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,040
Who are you?

106
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,480
Why do they want to kill you?

107
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:53,920
I...

108
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,840
Wake up.

109
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,800
Come on, wake up.

110
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,480
Pretty skillful.

111
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,160
Nice and clean.

112
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,560
You're awake?

113
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,080
Don't worry. I shaved you pretty nicely.

114
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,200
No stubble left.

115
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,560
What's wrong?

116
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,920
