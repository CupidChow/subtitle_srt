(Falling into a Trap)

19
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,640
Father.

20
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,520
He Lianyu, you are so ruthless.

21
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,560
Lianbin, are you happy now?

22
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,160
What do you mean?

23
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,240
I killed our father for you.

24
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,520
Isn't that what you wanted?

25
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,560
No, what are you talking about?

26
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,480
It was you who killed our father.

27
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,360
City Lord summoned He Lianyu back

28
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,320
because he would give his position

29
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,120
to He Lianyu, not a loser like you.

30
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,040
That's why you lured us

31
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,160
to uncover the truth of that year

32
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,440
and made He Lianyu kill his father.

33
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,560
You shut up.

34
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,800
That's true, isn't it?

35
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,640
You're such a loser.

36
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,520
I have to wonder
what Ms. Jia sees in you.

37
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,320
Let me guess.

38
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,800
He Lianyu was tempted to kill his father

39
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,040
and Ms. Wang was poisoned.

40
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,320
I bet they were Ms. Jia's tricks.

41
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,400
I don't think you're smart enough
to come up with them.

42
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,480
What? Are you insulting me?

43
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,800
Let me tell you.

44
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,560
Without me,

45
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,040
Ms. Jia wouldn't have had the guts
to do it all.

46
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,080
Alright, enough.

47
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,600
You are so obedient to her.

48
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:40,720
I...

49
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,800
He Lianbin.

50
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,440
Let me ask you something.

51
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,720
If you become the City Lord,

52
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,080
what will happen to Ms. Jia?

53
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,200
Ms. Jia has no children.

54
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,680
So she will move to the Grand Temple.

55
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,840
Ms. Jia.

56
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,040
Don't you want
to be the Lady of the City Lord?

57
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,520
You mean Ms. Jia and Mr. Lianbin?

58
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:13,120
My goodness,
they are nominally mother and son.

59
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,760
If others come to know of this,

60
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,040
how is he going to hold onto the seat

61
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,520
of the City Lord?

62
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,560
Think about the bigger picture.

63
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,160
After two years,
you can leave Grand Temple.

64
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,760
Just two years.

65
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,520
Two years?

66
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,320
It's long enough for you
to marry the Princess

67
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,120
and have a child.

68
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,680
He Lianbin, without my help,

69
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,000
could you be what you are now?

70
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,840
You want to send me to the Grand Temple?

71
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,640
What's wrong with that?

72
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,040
Moreover,

73
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,000
why did you say you helped me succeed?

74
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,880
I fabricated Chef Dong's letter.

75
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,360
If I didn't frame He Lianbo

76
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,680
for murder

77
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,280
and lured He Lianyu to kill his father,

78
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,320
could you contend with He Lianyu?

79
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,640
Go on. And then?

80
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,240
You are eloquent enough

81
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,520
to provoke me.

82
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,200
Anyway, City Lord is already dead.

83
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,400
It's okay to let you know the truth.

84
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,920
Tell me.

85
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,680
Did you kill my mother?

86
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,160
Yes, but so what?

87
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,080
She was in my way back then.

88
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,600
Ms. Wang.

89
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,320
You look beautiful today.

90
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,800
Wish Lianyu a happy birthday.

91
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,400
Thank you.

92
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,240
Ms. Wang.

93
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,960
I just picked a flower in the garden.

94
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,920
It suits you.

95
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,920
According to the medical book,

96
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,600
cercis chinensis is against donkey meat
and fish without scales.

97
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,640
Ten years ago, there was a dish
called Hibiscus Steamed Fish.

98
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,920
Eating cercis chinensis pollen with fish
will cause severe poisoning.

99
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,960
Ms. Wang wore a cercis chinensis
in her hair

100
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,600
and its pollen fell into the food,

101
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,440
causing fatal poisoning.

102
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,440
How dare you.

103
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,680
Today, I'll make you pay with your life.

104
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,720
Guards!

105
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,760
Seize He Lianyu.

106
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,520
What are you doing?

107
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,800
Didn't you see him kill the City Lord?

108
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,280
Do you also want to rebel?

109
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,560
Yu.

110
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,040
You unfilial creature.

111
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,680
I am very disappointed in you.

112
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,800
No, father.

113
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,520
Weren't you killed by...

114
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,960
Who is lying on the ground?

115
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,920
My acting is not bad, right?

116
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,800
It's profound but not extreme,

117
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,400
mild yet not mediocre.

118
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,720
You just

119
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,760
had a good performance.

120
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,720
It's a trap. We're fooled.

121
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,080
Lianbin, if I didn't set you up,

122
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,520
you would not have revealed the truth.

123
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,640
When did you start leading us
into this trap?

124
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,960
You had a good plan.

125
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,200
When you learned

126
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,200
that I used Mr. Cao
to find out the truth,

127
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,440
you forged this letter

128
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,000
and put it on Dong Linglang's body.

129
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,520
You tried to let me believe
that my father poisoned my mother

130
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,680
and led me to overthrow
and kill my father,

131
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,920
making me a jinx to my parents.

132
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,880
And you will take this chance

133
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,000
to get rid of me, a rebellious son,

134
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,840
and rightfully take the seat
of the City Lord.

135
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,920
Am I right, Ms. Jia?

136
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,520
I guess

137
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,720
even if Mr. Cao hadn't found

138
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,080
Dong Linglang's body back then,

139
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,200
you would have used other ways

140
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,600
to let us know

141
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,920
and lead us to find this forged letter.

142
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,880
How did you know the letter was forged?

143
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,040
What if it was real?

144
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,520
You planned it all,

145
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,440
but there's one thing you ignored.

146
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,240
What is it?

147
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,000
The Head Chef Dong Linglang

148
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,520
was my master.

149
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,240
Before Dong Linglang
became a Royal Chef,

150
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,080
she once worked as a cook

151
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,920
in a tavern for a while.

152
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,560
And that tavern

153
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,600
is A Cha's Revelry Tavern.

154
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,240
My master

155
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,680
gave me this recipe notebook

156
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,880
when I was ten.

157
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,480
It contains recipes
she accumulated over the years,

158
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,800
studies of delicacies
from different places,

159
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,200
as well as her culinary insights.

160
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,680
Over the years, I have read it
over and over again

161
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,960
No one knows my master's handwriting
better than I do.

162
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,200
No, this isn't my master's handwriting.

163
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,920
The letter has been aged,

164
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,760
but I've read my master's notebook

165
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,400
a million times,

166
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,720
so I'm sure it's not her handwriting.

167
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,280
It means

168
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,600
someone forged this letter

169
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,360
and put it on her body.

170
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:47,680
So they aim to make me...

171
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:49,880
Kill your father.

172
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,800
Since they want me to do that,

173
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,120
I will do as they wish.

174
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,080
Yu, this letter says

175
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,440
I feared your mother's power
and prestige,

176
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,760
so I poisoned her. Do you believe that?

177
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,280
If I do,

178
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:33,240
I won't be here
only to deliver a letter.

179
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,840
That's my good son.

180
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:47,680
Father, if I can find out the culprits,

181
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,200
will you punish them?

182
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:54,080
Of course. They forged this letter

183
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,600
and used your mother's death

184
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,120
to sow discord between you and me.

185
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,760
They're so malicious and ruthless.

186
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:05,320
They should be sentenced to death
by a thousand cuts.

187
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,120
What if the people

188
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,000
behind this are Lianbin and Ms. Jia?

189
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,800
What did you say?

190
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,280
Why do you suspect them?

191
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,240
Any evidence?

192
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,520
Whether it is true or not,
I think the truth will come out soon.

193
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,320
I hope

194
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,160
you can do a play with me.

195
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,120
I'm doomed.

196
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,200
Turns out

197
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,400
you set me up together.
