(Royal Kitchen)

20
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,840
Anybody inside?

21
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,520
Anybody? Help!

22
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,120
It's on fire! Somebody!

23
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,360
Anybody?

24
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,440
Somebody!

25
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,920
A Cha, is that you? A Cha!

26
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,320
A Cha, wait for me!

27
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,640
I'll get people to save you.

28
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,640
Why hasn't she woken up?

29
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,160
No need to worry, Young Master.

30
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,920
A Cha inhaled smoke

31
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:29,880
and got frightened.

32
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,240
She will wake up in a moment.

33
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,520
Why did the Royal Kitchen catch fire?

34
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,640
The firewood
in the Royal Kitchen is changed daily.

35
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,560
And it is kept at a certain distance
from the stove.

36
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,000
A Cha is not a newcomer.

37
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,800
I don't think
she would accidentally start a fire.

38
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,680
I heard that the firewood was ignited

39
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,720
by a will-o'-the-wisp.

40
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,120
Nonsense.

41
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,880
The Royal Kitchen was closed that day.

42
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,120
By the hour of You,
all Royal Chefs have left.

43
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,320
Why was only A Cha there?

44
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,320
Yeah, everything was fine when I left.

45
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,800
The door lock wasn't broken.

46
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,840
How could such a weird thing happen?

47
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:22,640
(A jinx!)

48
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:27,200
(Bringing misfortune to father, mother,
wife, and child.)

49
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,000
(Could it be because A Cha
and I are growing closer)

50
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,680
(that she had this accident?)

51
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,440
Young Master.

52
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,160
Young Master.

53
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,520
A Cha has been frightened.

54
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,000
She might have nightmares at night.

55
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,240
Since you have fallen for each other,

56
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,840
you should take good care of her.

57
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,320
How about you stay tonight?

58
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,040
(No.)

59
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,600
(I can't get her involved anymore.)

60
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,440
A Yin.

61
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,560
I have something else to do tonight.

62
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,600
You stay and take care of A Cha.

63
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,240
Yes, Young Master.

64
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,840
How indifferent he is.

65
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,880
His woman has been hurt,

66
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,720
but he seems so cold.

67
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,600
He's so unreliable.

68
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,000
No.

69
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,280
A Cha absolutely cannot be with him.

70
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,920
Mr. Dayuan.

71
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,000
A Cha.

72
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,440
Have you recovered?

73
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,320
I'm fine now.

74
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,960
Young Master has important matters
to deal with

75
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,000
and can't see visitors.

76
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,360
A Cha, please leave.

77
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,360
But I have urgent things too.

78
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,360
I need to make the last dish for him.

79
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,240
Please announce my visit.

80
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,640
Young Master, A Cha is waiting outside.

81
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,320
She refuses to leave.

82
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:34,480
Young Master, could you see her?

83
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,640
Tell her to leave.

84
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,920
Regarding anything about her,

85
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,320
do not inform me anymore.

86
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,880
Young Master is busy.

87
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,560
A Cha, please leave.

88
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,800
What has he been busy with lately?

89
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,840
Young Master.

90
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:58,840
Open the door.

91
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,360
Yes.

92
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,600
A Cha.

93
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,040
Mister.

94
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,240
Young Master let you in.

95
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,120
What have you been doing all day?

96
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,640
You've worked so late.

97
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:32,720
By the way,

98
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,080
I've already figured out

99
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,560
the last dish Hibiscus Steamed Fish.

100
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,040
After Mr. Cao tries it,

101
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,360
the truth could be revealed.

102
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,120
A Cha.

103
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,800
Do you remember what I told you before?

104
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,200
After the birthday case,

105
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,920
I have something to say to you.

106
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,240
I want to tell you right now.

107
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,520
Wait for me a moment.

108
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,520
Is he going to give me a surprise?

109
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:22,960
A Cha.

110
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,880
Actually,

111
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,720
I have liked you for a long time.

112
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,880
From the first time I saw you,

113
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,400
I knew

114
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,280
you were the only one
who I wanted to marry.

115
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:43,360
I'm into you
and I don't want to miss you.

116
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,400
Will you marry me?

117
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,360
Yes, I will.

118
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,280
What?

119
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,360
Nothing.

120
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,400
What on earth do you want to tell me?

121
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,520
This is the reward
for your work during this time.

122
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,240
It's enough for you

123
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,080
and your parents
to live a well-off life.

124
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,480
Take the money

125
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,240
