(Bad Idea)

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,320
(Liu Mubai was right.)

20
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,160
(All men would fall for this.)

21
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,360
Princess Gongsun?
Sorry, I didn't recognize you.

22
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,320
Don't just stand there. Help me up.

23
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,720
Sorry. My apologies.

24
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,360
I thought a lunatic came in just now.

25
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,160
It hurts so much.

26
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,080
First, men like gentle women.

27
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:16,440
Second, men like reserved women.

28
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,200
Now you're not reserved or sedate.

29
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,320
Do you...

30
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,720
What's the first rule?

31
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,160
You should walk like this

32
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,600
in front of men.

33
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,440
And you should speak

34
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,960
like this.

35
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,640
Like this.

36
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,840
Be casual.

37
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,680
Be casual.

38
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,120
Yes.

39
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,680
Seventh Young Master,

40
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,160
I know A Cha

41
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,840
is making medicinal food for you.

42
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,960
I heard from Mr. Liu
you need hundred-year-old ginseng.

43
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,880
I happen to have one.

44
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,720
Princess Gongsun.

45
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,000
Can you speak in a normal way?

46
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,840
(I'm a princess.)

47
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,280
(Others can never see me like this.)

48
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,840
Just tell me if you want it or not.

49
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,160
I want it.

50
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,800
What's your condition?

51
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,280
Condition?

52
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,800
Seventh Young Master,

53
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,840
considering our relationship,

54
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,160
don't you think
you're being too distant?

55
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,840
A toast to you with tea.

56
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,480
Here.

57
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,240
Make tea with this ginseng
for He Lianyu.

58
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,640
I'm sure he'll be happy.

59
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,600
Remember.

60
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,600
Don't let him drink too much.

61
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,040
Just a little bit is enough.

62
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,400
It'd be terrible

63
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,440
if he drinks too much.

64
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,880
Got it.

65
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,600
Liu Mubai is really stingy.

66
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,960
It's just hundred-year-old ginseng.

67
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,000
When I return to Vermilion Bird City,

68
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,640
I can just give him some.

69
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,080
Take a look at this ginseng.

70
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,400
Is it what you want?

71
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,560
How come just a little of it is left?

72
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,840
Seventh Young Master,
you have a nosebleed.

73
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,080
This...

74
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,920
Today, I'm going to make you

75
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,840
my man.

76
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,920
Where is he?

77
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,280
Where is my man?

78
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,040
Mubai, I know why your stomach aches.

79
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,600
When I went out just now,

80
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,040
I met Mr. Sun from Imperial Hospital.
He said

81
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,760
weak people like you

82
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,280
should exercise more

83
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,640
to remove the harmful substances

84
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,640
from your bodies.

85
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,880
Come with me to exercise.

86
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:56,000
997. 998.

87
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,000
I can't do this again.

88
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,240
You can't? Get up and take the medicine

89
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,200
(Royal Kitchen)
to strengthen your body.

90
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,400
Drink more.

91
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,600
Get up.

92
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,040
Why are you here?

93
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,160
Come with me. Step aside.

94
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,640
- Seventh Young Master.
- Seventh Young Master.

95
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,440
Let go of me.

96
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,640
You...

97
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,680
Your body feels so hot.

98
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,840
(Royal Kitchen)
Where's Young Master?

99
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,560
What kind of martial art is this?

100
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,880
Are you crazy?

101
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,360
Yes, I'm crazy.

102
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,080
Young Master.

103
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,160
I brought the medical book

104
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,040
you asked me to look for.

105
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,520
I'm leaving.

106
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,680
Wait.

107
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,840
The ginseng for the imperial pumpkin.

109
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,960
