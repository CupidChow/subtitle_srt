(Hearts Resonate as One)

19
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,440
You useless thing.

20
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,440
I told you to break them up.

21
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,320
Instead, you let him
become the son-in-law.

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,800
You were not able to make He Lianyu

23
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,840
to fall for you, weren't you?

24
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,800
A-After all, I am the princess
of Vermilion Bird City.

25
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,320
In what way am I inferior to A Cha?

26
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,120
It's not like I got nothing out of it.

27
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:44,920
I bought it for you.

28
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,040
You don't want it? Then I'll eat it.

29
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,000
I'll eat it.

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,800
Never mind.

31
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,120
We'll have to look for another chance.

32
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,680
Alright.

33
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,480
Here you are, eat.

34
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,200
Take it.

35
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,480
Eat it.

36
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,760
Chicken represents phoenix,

37
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,080
symbolizing good fortune.

38
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,800
Maltose is sweet.

39
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,400
After eating this,

40
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,440
the master and the queen's life

41
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,960
will be both sweet and auspicious.

42
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,040
The rest is mine.

43
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,240
No one takes it from me.

44
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,440
It's mine, yeah!

45
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,880
I have a feeling

46
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,800
that we will know the truth soon.

47
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,920
Allow me a few days.

48
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,160
I'll improve the remaining dishes
a bit more

49
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,840
to see if Mr. Cao is satisfied.

50
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,600
Help yourself.

51
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,440
About this Hearts Resonate as One,

52
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,640
there's no specific recipe
in the Notebook.

53
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,040
How exactly should I cook this dish?

54
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,320
Master, where is your "wife"?

55
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,280
He's occupied with official duties
and he's not here.

56
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,600
How dare he!

57
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,760
Even if he is
the Queen of the Women's Kingdom,

58
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,000
once married, he must honor you
and value righteousness,

59
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,080
abiding by
the Three Obedience and Four Virtues.

60
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,400
And what are those?

61
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,760
Follow the master,

62
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,920
obey the master's orders,

63
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,760
and follow the master blindly
even if she's wrong.

64
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,040
Wait when the master is busy.

65
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,360
Be generous with the master.

66
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,640
Endure when the master is angry.

67
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:20,280
Remember the master's birthday.

68
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,360
Am I right?

69
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,120
Yes, you are.

70
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,800
Miss A Cha.

71
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,360
What's everyone busy with?

72
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,640
What's wrong with them?

73
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,720
You really don't know?

74
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:06,000
Today's the matchmaking banquet between
the Seventh Young Master and Princess.

75
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,040
(This atmosphere is weird.)

76
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,920
(Maybe I should say something.)

77
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,080
What do you usually like to eat?

78
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,400
Anything.

79
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:40,840
Anything...

80
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,040
What music are you into?

81
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,160
I don't listen to music.

82
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,480
Then don't you have a hobby?

83
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,200
Usually, I stay in the military camp,

84
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,560
and I especially like to
watch soldiers lift heavy stones.

85
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,000
I wonder if you're interested.

86
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,880
No, no, not really.

87
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,840
(He's so dull.)

88
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,520
(I know the City Lord forced him
to attend this banquet.)

89
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,120
(But there's no need
to treat me like this.)

90
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,080
(This is no fun at all.)

91
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,160
(It's more interesting with Liu Mubai.)

92
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,160
This is Lotus Seed and Lily Soup.

93
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,520
It symbolizes sweet love
and a happy and fulfilling life.

94
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,800
It's a traditional soup
of the Vermilion Bird City.

95
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,320
Also known as Hearts Resonate as One.

96
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,560
Also called Lover's Soup.

97
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,800
Lover's Soup?

98
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,320
Princess, I don't know
you can make this dish.

99
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,440
Of course I can.

100
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,480
My cooking skills

101
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,000
are just as better as A Cha's.

102
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,120
How dare you!

103
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,480
You want to rush in like this?

104
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,440
Yeah, of course.

105
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,280
He dared to go on a date behind my back!

106
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,680
I'll teach him a lesson!

107
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,520
Dear A Cha,

108
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,680
you fear him not, but I do.

109
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,200
He would kill me

110
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,160
like squashing a bug.

111
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,440
The only difference

112
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,280
is that the bug can still have
a complete corpse.

113
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,840
Actually, the Lover's Soup

114
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,920
does not have any special ingredients.

115
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,760
It's made by the women of our city

116
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,320
for their beloved ones.

117
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,000
Therefore, what's put inside

118
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,200
is all the food that the beloved likes.

119
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,160
I really didn't expect

120
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,520
it's not enough for him to bother you.

121
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,160
He even flirted with the princess?

122
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,360
He's such a bad guy.

123
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,240
Why are you cursing him?

124
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,080
That princess said
she came to visit relatives.

125
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,760
Why is she around He Lianyu
all the time?

126
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,960
She's not here to visit relatives.

127
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,320
It's for a marriage alliance.

128
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,240
Marriage alliance?

129
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,640
Don't you know?
Gongsun Shu told me all about it.

130
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,200
She came here this time,

131
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,440
ostensibly to visit relatives.

132
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,480
But in fact,
she's here for a marriage alliance.

133
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,800
Now the Second Young Master
are competing for power with him.

134
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,360
I'm afraid

135
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,920
he will use Gongsun Shu
to gain an advantage for himself.

136
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,720
The worst part

137
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,680
is that the Seventh Young Master
obviously has feelings for you.

138
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,160
Yet he'll marry the princess.

139
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,800
How unfair it is to the princess!

140
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,960
Unfair? Unfair?

141
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,840
- Unfair?
- Aw, why?

142
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,840
Talking nonsense.

143
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,680
Talking nonsense.

144
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,680
Won't you try it?

145
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:42,880
Princess Gongsun,

146
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,600
just save it for your beloved one.

147
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,680
Although, Princess Gongsun,

148
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,960
could you tell me the secret recipe
of this Lover's Soup?

149
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,160
A Cha, I have some good news.

150
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,960
Mubai, is the fire adjusted properly?

151
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,200
Yeah, it is.

152
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,040
Young Master.

153
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,600
You clearly know my taste.

154
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,000
Why do you still
make such heavy-tasting food?

155
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,120
It's not for you.

156
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,680
Don't just stand there.

157
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,160
Come and eat. Come on.

158
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,640
Young Master.

159
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:26,920
Here.

160
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,240
How is it? Flavorful enough?

161
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,160
I saved the original broth
from boiling the intestines for you.

162
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,920
Original flavor, so good!

163
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,440
Have some more. Is it enough?

164
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,080
If it's not enough, I'll make more.

165
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,760
I'm hungry too. I want to eat as well.

166
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,840
You haven't had enough at the banquet?

167
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,800
(Oh, she's jealous over this matter.)

168
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,640
A Cha, actually...

169
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,560
Mubai, what else would you like to eat?

170
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,520
I'll make it for you.

171
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,320
What are you doing?

172
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,360
This is the Royal Kitchen.

173
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,520
The kitchen is vital.

174
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,760
What's with this tugging
between you two?

175
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,000
The Seventh Young Master
does have an imposing presence.

176
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,320
If you can't stand it, we'll go.

177
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,560
No need, I'll go.

178
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,960
Every time this person loses his temper,

179
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,800
I get terribly nervous.

180
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,040
Why are you so easily scared?

181
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,840
How dare he lost his temper at me?

182
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,720
I'm so angry.
