There are few customers tonight
due to bad weather.

21

Let's close up early.

22
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,200
Okay.

23
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:52,880
A Cha.

24
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,960
Could you open the door for me?

25
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,960
I know you don't want to see me.

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,680
But I have something important

27
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,600
to say to you.

28
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,880
A Cha, please open the door.

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,320
Let me see you.

30
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,480
A Cha.

31
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,520
- Why are you here?
- I...

32
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,520
We had a deal.

33
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,040
We are even now.

34
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,840
You are the Young Master,

35
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,080
and I'm a cook.

36
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,600
So what are you doing here?

37
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,040
I'm sorry, I...

38
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:22,920
Stop.

39
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,400
I don't want you to say anything.

40
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,360
And I don't want to see you.

41
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,920
What are you doing?

42
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,120
Here you are.

43
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,960
I've brought the vegetable

44
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,000
you ordered from the market.

45
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:03,800
In addition,

46
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,720
I'll go and buy fish later.

47
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,200
The fish is particularly fresh.

48
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,320
Get out of here.

49
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,680
I know that no matter what,

50
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,840
you won't forgive me.

51
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,640
But I want to prove by my actions

52
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,600
that I said something
that I never meant.

53
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,640
You can hate me

54
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,680
or don't forgive me.

55
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,720
I deserve it.

56
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,960
I am asking you to leave now.

57
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:35,960
Young Master.

58
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,600
Are you really going to work here
as a waiter?

59
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,840
Come on.

60
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,280
Think of another way.

61
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,040
Think about how to pursue a girl.

62
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:44,920
Exactly.

63
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,440
I...

64
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,640
I've never pursued a girl.

65
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,120
That's true.

66
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,200
You were a general at the border.

67
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,720
Now, you're the Young Master.

68
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,080
You're pursued by girls.

69
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,600
I mean,

70
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,400
as the Seventh Young Master,

71
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,360
show us your ability.

72
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,000
My ability?

73
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,800
So you mean

74
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,720
I should perform martial arts for A Cha?

75
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:20,160
Your strength is that you have money.

76
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,880
Money?

77
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,640
One red glazed vase.

78
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,880
One Ruyao blue glazed pot.

79
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,360
One jade Ruyi.

80
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,600
A painting of vigorous pines
by a famous artist.

81
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,000
What are you up to now?

82
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,680
A Cha, I got you some gifts.

83
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,800
Take them away.

84
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,920
Leave now.

85
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,760
You and I have been over.

86
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,560
There's no way to turn back.

87
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,080
I don't want to see you buzz around me
like a fly.

88
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,840
I don't want to see you.

89
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,360
Get out of here.

90
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,200
Leave.

91
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,360
Fine, I'll leave.

92
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,120
Just don't be angry.

93
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,000
You offended her,

94
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,200
but why did she kick me out?

95
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,520
You can't judge him.

96
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,120
Without you,

97
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,200
we could have stayed at Revelry Tavern.

98
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,320
You can only work as a waitress.

99
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,320
This time,

100
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,440
why haven't I seen A Cha's parents?

101
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,080
Exactly.

102
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,080
They've already left.

103
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,360
Good.

104
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,800
I did as you said.

105
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,360
What should I do

106
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,800
to let you release my parents?

107
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,480
Since I'm here,

108
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,160
I'll let your family stay together.

109
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,000
When night falls,

110
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,640
I'll let it happen.

111
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,800
Stop.

112
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,600
A Cha, I'm late.

113
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,560
Are you hurt?

114
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,960
Are you really the best assassin
in White Tiger?

115
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,760
You disappointed me

116
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,200
but charged me so much.

117
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,000
Where did you find the assassin?

118
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,040
Info from the black market.

119
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,160
Here.

120
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:34,880

Numerous assassins,
full range of services.

One client at a time.
No refund if assassination fails.

125
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,600
If you want a refund,
please come to the Cheat Mountain

126
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,880
in Azure Dragon on the thirtieth day
of the second month.

127
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,520
Cheat Mountain?

128
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,680
I was fooled?

129
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,280
The characters are too small to be seen.

130
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:09,520
So what should we do now?

131
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,960
Let that kitchen maid come back
to the palace?

132
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,120
If something is discovered, then...

133
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,720
Since she wants to investigate it,

134
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,440
why don't we help her?

135
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:23,960
Help her?

136
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,480
I'm sorry.

137
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,160
It was all my fault.

138
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,960
I shouldn't have been self-righteous

139
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,520
and acted on my own.

140
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,080
I shouldn't have said harsh words
and thought

141
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,680
it was for your good.

142
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:43,080
I shouldn't have pushed you away
and made you sad.

143
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,400
We don't belong in the same world.

144
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,840
Why do you say that

145
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,920
to a kitchen maid like me?

146
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,160
Can you forget what I said before?

147
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,160
That's not what I meant.

148
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,080

We should cherish the present.

188
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,120
For our present and future,

189
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,400
you make up for your past.

190
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,600
If you push me away

191
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,120
because of elusive things,

192
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,160
and I cut ties with you,

193
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,080
we will ruin the fate
that we're meant to be together.

194
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:42,960
I...

195
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,240
I'm afraid of losing you.

196
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,000
What are you afraid of?

197
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,920
My love for you is more

198
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,000
than yours for me.

199
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,120
I'm willing to stay by your side.

200
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,960
I don't need you to decide for my life.

201
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,240
You are depriving me
of the right to like you.

202
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,800
Please

203
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:08,120
always choose me without hesitation

204
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:13,520

212
