(Twelve Dishes)

19
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,760
It's gone.

20
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,880
Mr. Cao, slow down.

21
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:17,360
- It's gone.
- Mr. Cao, slow down.

22
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,040
Mr. Cao, slow down.

23
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:24,280
Mr. Cao, slow down.

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,320
Why exactly are you looking for

25
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,720
this mad eunuch?

26
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,880
And you are even
keeping a close watch on him.

27
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,880
Back at my birthday banquet,

28
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,160
my mother died of poisoning.

29
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,320
He is the only one
who knows the truth now.

30
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,400
I want to know the truth.

31
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,680
I have to find clues from him.

32
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,720
So you want me to help you?

33
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,120
He likes the dishes you make.

34
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,680
Perhaps you can get him to talk.

35
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,280
(His long-time worry
is the birthday poisoning case.)

36
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,160
(If I can help him find the truth,)

37
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,680
(perhaps I can help him resolve
his emotional distress.)

38
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,360
A Cha,

39
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,800
I really didn't want to
get you involved,

40
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,440
but I have no other choice.

41
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,240
So I thought...

42
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,120
Say no more.

43
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,960
You've helped me so many times already.

44
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,000
Let me help you this time.

45
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,560
It's gone.

46
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,000
Mr. Cao, this is my specialty dish.

47
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,640
What do you like? I'll make it tomorrow.

48
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,360
This one.
The white wine braised trotters.

49
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,680
Okay, no problem.

50
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,720
By the way.

51
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,160
Do you know

52
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,600
what day it is today?

53
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,480
What day?

54
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,320
Today is the wedding day of the master
and the Queen of the Women's Kingdom.

55
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,880
Wedding day. Wedding day.

56
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,160
Yes.

57
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,760
Queen of the Women's Kingdom?

58
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,720
He always calls me that.

59
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,600
There's food and drinks.

60
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,840
Come on, drink up.

61
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,160
Us?

62
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,160
Of course.

63
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,360
It's your wedding day.

64
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,280
You have to drink eighty-one cups
of cross-cupped wine.

65
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,520
Otherwise, I won't eat
the dishes you make.

66
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,760
Cao Rui, don't go too far.

67
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,600
Hold on, Seventh Young Master.

68
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,600
Don't you remember what I told you?

69
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,360
Drink up. Let's drink.

70
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,600
Great.

71
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,040
Eighty-one cups of cross-cupped wine.

72
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,280
You will love each other forever.

73
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:42,000
Great. Come on.

74
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,000
How many cups have we already drunk?

75
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,200
I'm not quite sure.

76
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,800
Slow down.

77
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,560
My butt.

78
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,080
Your eyelashes are pretty long, huh?

79
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,640
Your nose bridge

80
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,480
is also quite high.

81
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,640
You look quite handsome.

82
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,440
You're drunk.

83
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,600
Answer me.

84
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,560
If my dish and I

85
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,400
fell into the water at the same time,

86
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,920
who would you save first?

87
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,760
I would of course save...

88
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,600
Of course, I would save you first.

89
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,000
Come on.

90
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,200
Mr. Cao

91
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,880
will love the dish I make this time.

92
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:26,200
I didn't expect you to be so proactive.

93
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,720
Proactive? What?

94
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,560
Don't you remember what happened

95
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,240
last night?

96
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,120
Last night?

97
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,880
I had a sound sleep last night.

98
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,360
I don't even remember how I got back.

99
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,280
Drink. I want to drink more.

100
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,400
Stop it.

101
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,160
Come on. Lie down.

102
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,320
I still want to drink.

103
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,160
No more drinks. You're drunk now.

104
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:16,360
I still want more.
I can drink another thousand cups.

105
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,800
You're drunk.

106
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,560
A Cha.

107
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,440
Why are you still here?

108
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,960
Don't tell me.

109
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,320
A Cha.

110
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,800
Let's see if you can run again.

111
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,080
Go to sleep now.

112
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,280
Drink, drink.

113
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,640
What are you laughing at?

114
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,640
I am laughing at Mr. Cao.

115
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,480
Is it good?

116
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,320
The trotters are tender.
The aroma of wine is wonderful.

117
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,240
It's so good.

118
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,400
Master,

119
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,760
you and the Queen
of the Women's Kingdom...

120
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,520
We are already married.

121
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,120
That's true.
One can't get married twice, right?

122
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,560
Ten years ago,

123
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,680
what happened at the banquet
of Seventh Young Master?

124
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,720
Do you still remember?

125
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,400
I'll let you eat if you can answer me.

126
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,880
No, I want to eat meat first.

127
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,080
I want to eat meat first.

128
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,600
This eunuch is crazy.

129
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,040
Even if he speaks,

130
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,080
he wouldn't be clear about
what happened then.

131
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,280
Do you want to eat something else?

132
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,080
I still want to eat

133
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,120
imperial pumpkin, eight-treasure tofu,

134
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,360
snowy soup, crab-stuffed oranges,
wheat-scented chicken,

135
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,200
yingyang yam, hundred birds' nest,

136
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,400
crystal stew, crab roe pastry,
Buddha Jumps Over the Wall Soup,

137
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,800
Tele-Rhino, lotus steamed fish...

138
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,200
You remember
what happened back then, right?

139
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,240
Those were the twelve dishes
at the banquet.

140
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,680
You remember all of them, huh?

141
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,520
