(The Supreme Flavor in the World)

19
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,120
About which of you
can join the Royal Kitchen,

20
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,800
I haven't made up my mind yet.

21
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:16,600
Sir,

22
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,560
I've prepared something for you.

23
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,280
Mr. Dayuan not only loves
delicious food,

24
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,080
but he is also quite knowledgeable
about dance and music.

25
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,240
Dance and music.

26
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:31,800
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

27
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,240
A Cha, you're amazing.

28
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,120
Get up.

29
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,560
How wonderful.

30
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:44,000
Ten years ago, my dance moves also
ranked first in the competition.

31
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,800
Come and report tomorrow.

32
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,600
Thank you, Mr. Dayuan.

33
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,440
It's a culinary competition.
Why performed a dance?

34
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,680
I was cheering Mr. Dayuan up

35
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,120
and making him eat with more joy.

36
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,760
Is there any problem?

37
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:14,304
(Royal Kitchen Notebook)

38
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,520
Master,

39
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,040
I have already entered
the Royal Kitchen.

40
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,720
I will follow your footsteps

41
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,200
and become the best Royal Chef.

42
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,240
Master, I want to become

43
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,040
the best Royal Chef
in Black Tortoise City like you.

44
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,640
If you want to take this path,

45
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,880
becoming the best Royal Chef

46
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,400
should not be your goal.

47
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,800
Then what should it be?

48
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,760
To find the supreme flavor in the world.

49
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,920
(Master, I will find
the supreme flavor in the world.)

50
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,600
(I believe that one day,
we will meet again.)

51
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,160
What are you doing?

52
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,880
How can you just casually enter
a girl's room?

53
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,560
Do you really take yourself as a eunuch?

54
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,720
Hurry up and get out.

55
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,800
Where is my late-night snack?

56
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,720
Sir, how many meals do you eat in a day?

57
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,280
In the morning, layered oil cake
and emerald shaomai.

58
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,000
At noon, stewed fish soup, tofu
with egg white, and bamboo shoot shreds.

59
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,120
In the afternoon,
snow crisps with jade dew tea.

60
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,640
You just finished eating
braised pork feet with soybeans.

61
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,120
Aren't you full?

62
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,880
It was agreed before.

63
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,400
I provide you with intelligence
to help you win the competition.

64
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,880
Whatever I want to eat,
you have to cook it for me.

65
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,320
Well, you want to go back
on your word now?

66
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,800
Yes.

67
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,480
I'm going to take a stroll.

68
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,840
When I come back,

69
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,960
I hope the dishes I want to eat

70
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,720
will be on my table.

71
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:49,920
You...

72
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,640
I'll stuff you to death.

73
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,120
Who is it? Come in.

74
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,800
What's up?

75
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,320
Speak up. I'm busy.

76
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,320
Young Master.

77
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,840
Mr. Dayuan, no need for formalities.
Please rise.

78
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,240
It's been over a decade
since our last meeting.

79
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,360
I really missed you.

80
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,720
Young Master,
how have you entered the palace?

81
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,840
How can you be dressed like this?

82
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,840
I was attacked on my way back.

83
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,560
A Cha brought me into the palace.

84
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,680
A Cha?

85
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,240
No more talking about this.

86
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,520
How is the City Lord?

87
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,440
A few months ago, the City Lord
summoned you back.

88
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,680
Since then, he has fallen ill
and been bedridden.

89
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,120
Now, only a few imperial physicians
and Ms. Jia

90
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,000
can enter his bedroom.

91
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,200
Ms. Jia?

92
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,480
Keep an eye on it.

93
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,120
Once my wounds are healed,
I will investigate personally.

94
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,720
Young Master, you've been injured?

95
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,560
It's alright.
A Cha has treated my wounds.

96
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,240
Please sit, Young Master.

97
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,840
I will go prepare tea for you.

98
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,360
Trash.

99
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,160
A bunch of trash.

100
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,080
Don't be angry.

101
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,760
How can I not be angry?

102
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,080
Just look around.

103
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,240
In the entire Black Tortoise City,

104
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,800
the only one who can compete with me

105
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,960
is him, isn't it?

106
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,960
It was such a good chance.

107
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,760
Yet he managed to escape.

108
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,320
As long as the old man doesn't wake up,

109
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,400
it's still under our control.

110
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,480
Step up the search.

111
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,040
He must not enter the palace.

112
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,080
Once the old man dies,

113
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:15,880
you will naturally be the City Lord.

114
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,640
Stool.

115
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,920
Stool.

116
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,120
Sleeping after eating,
and eating after sleeping.

117
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,040
Such a guy.

118
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,120
One day, I'll turn you
into a roast suckling pig.

119
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,080
Stool.

120
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,200
Why are you still not up?

121
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,280
Stool.

122
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,880
What's wrong with you?

123
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,320
So hot.

124
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,280
I just added
some extra seasoning yesterday?

125
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,280
It won't kill a man, right?

126
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,520
Eat and eat, that's all you know.

127
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:27,000
I'll add more seasoning
to make you feel awful.

128
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,480
Awful, awful.

129
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,360
Oh, no.

130
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,200
What should I do now?

131
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,880
I forgot he was still recovering.

132
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,480
Mubai.

134

Mubai, help!

135
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,040
A Cha, what brings you here?

136
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,760
I'm making bunched pork feet.

137
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,560
Wanna taste it?

138
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,560
It's an emergency. Come!

139
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,840
Tell me what's going on first.

140
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,720
- I have three more to go.
- Hurry up.

141
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,360
Quick!

142
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,760
