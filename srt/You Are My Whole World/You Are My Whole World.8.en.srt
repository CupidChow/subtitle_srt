(A Pipe Dream)

19
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,160
Young Master, Mr. Cao has already been
settled properly.

20
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,160
I've assigned people to guard him.
He's absolutely safe.

21
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,360
Mr. Cao is in a state of madness.

22
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,000
It's hard to talk to him.

23
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,520
Investigate the others
as soon as possible.

24
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,920
I have started already.

25
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,640
These people will soon be found.

26
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,600
Besides,

27
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,680
Young Master,

28
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,360
the girl nicknamed Doubao,
you asked me to look into,

29
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,440
I have found her.

30
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,240
Who is she?

31
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,240
I carefully went through the registry
of the maids in the palace.

32
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,040
What are you laughing at? Just say it.

33
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,640
Guess who she is?

34
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,560
Speak!

35
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:05,880
A Cha.

36
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,960
Try this, black plum sauce.

37
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,520
With the sweet bunny cakes,

38
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,560
it's super delicious.

39
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,800
So sour!

40
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,000
Why do you believe everything I say?

41
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,920
Young Master.

42
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,440
But now A Cha is in trouble.

43
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,720
What trouble?

44
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,280
Isn't it because of you?

45
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,080
Me?

46
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,120
But indeed, it is because of you.

47
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,320
You're dilly-dallying. What's going on?

48
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,880
There're bad comments about A Cha
in Royal Kitchen now.

49
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,320
It's the gossip
between Seventh Young Master and her.

50
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,680
Haven't you done talking?

51
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,040
No one's talking about you.
Don't flatter yourself.

52
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,320
But, your affair with
the Seventh Young Master,

53
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,240
is it true or not?

54
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,280
What are you talking about?

55
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,600
Me and him, how could that be possible?

56
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,560
He is the Seventh Young Master,
and I am just a kitchen aid.

57
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,440
What relationship could we have?

58
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:39,000
So, you're dating Mr. Liu?

59
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,920
Liu Mubai and I are like sisters.

60
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,200
Would you get engaged with your bestie?

61
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,120
Seventh Young Master is here.

62
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,600
Come to be my private chef.

63
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,000
Be my private chef,

64
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,520
and you can make these people know

65
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,120
I simply admire your cooking skills.

66
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,880
What do you say?

67
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,440
Seventh Young Master, could you
give me some time?

68
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,200
I'll reply to you tonight.

69
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:32,360
Say no, or yes, no, or yes.

70
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,400
In front of so many people,

71
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,960
he said that I was just a cook.

72
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,600
Who cares to have anything to do
with him?

73
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,720
Say yes, or no.

74
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,080
But he's the noble Seventh Young Master.

75
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,320
If I say no, would it be too snubbing
for him?

76
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:10,160
Seventh Young Master, A Cha said
this was her response.

77
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:15,280
What does it mean? She agreed?

78
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:25,120
This is fish head with green
and red chopped chilies,

79
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,200
symbolizing you being red and her green.

80
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,320
The fish head is split in two,

81
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,520
having a head but no tail,

82
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,320
meaning have a beginning but no end.

83
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,200
This smashed cucumber

84
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,320
clearly signifies a sudden separation.

85
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,880
This isn't just a bowl of ordinary rice.

86
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,720
This is millet steamed with sorghum.

87
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,480
I guess A Cha is trying to say,

88
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,160
the thing between you two,

89
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,400
is but a pipe dream.

90
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,600
Alright, stop talking.

91
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,480
I have spoken out of turn.

92
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,960
About the news that A Cha refused to be
my private chef,

93
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,240
spread it out.

94
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,360
Young Master, this...

95
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,680
I see, Young Master.

96
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,000
You want to protect A Cha.

97
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,560
If she agrees to be your private chef,

98
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,680
then naturally,

99
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,200
who would dare to bully her?

100
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,360
If you spread the news
of her rejecting you,

101
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,280
that's to restore her reputation.

102
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,880
Isn't it, Young Master?

103
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:38,360
After all, she has saved my life

104
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,240
and cooked for me.

105
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,000
Now she's fallen into needless trouble
because of me.

106
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,840
It's only right that I help her
out of it.

107
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,160
If push comes to shove,
we'll just be strangers.

108
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,760
So wise of you, Young Master.

109
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,600
Annoying.

110
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,240
(My great vengeance is unrequited.)

111
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,680
(Involving her in it is meaningless.)

112
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,000
I'm planning to retire
and return to my hometown this year.

113
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,240
I have petitioned to City Lord

114
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,400
to hold a palace gourmet competition.

115
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,760
Only the first place winner
can succeed my position.

116
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,240
Only Royal Chefs may enter
the competition.

117
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,240
Alright, everyone, get to work.

118
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,960
As I see,

119
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,120
do you also wish to become
the Head Royal Chef?

120
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,480
If life were without dreams,

121
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,240
what difference would it make
from the salted fish?

122
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,080
Even if the salted fish turns over,

123
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,840
isn't it still a salted fish?

124
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:08,360
Sir, I heard that Seventh Young Master
made a special trip to Royal Kitchen,

125
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,880
to sever ties with A Cha.

126
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,160
Don't be like those maids and eunuchs,

127
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,400
always prying into the master's affairs.

128
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,400
Sir, you are the hub of the palace.

129
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,440
If not you, then whom should I ask?

130
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,640
That is true.

131
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:26,760
I don't see any future between
A Cha and Seventh Young Master.

132
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,760
You haven't messed up again
like last time, have you?

133
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,000
Absolutely not.

134
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,960
I've heard

135
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,480
that you and A Cha were
childhood sweethearts.

136
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,040
That's true.

137
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,400
And I've heard that you two
were betrothed when young.

138
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,280
Young Master, the imperial meal
has been reheated three times.

139
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,760
At least have something.

140
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,760
Take it out.

141
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:35,280
Young Master, even if you know A Cha

142
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,040
was betrothed to Mr. Liu,

143
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,120
there's no need for you to fast.

144
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:39,840
Dayuan,

145
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,480
go order some dishes from Royal Kitchen.

00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,080
