(Soybeans and Mung Beans)

19
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,320
(I don't know what Liu Mubai
is busy with.)

20
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,960
(I have no one to taste the dishes.)

21
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,400
Why is she still carving?

22
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,360
How long has she been carving?

23
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,360
Apart from doing her job,

24
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,200
she's been practicing carving
all day long.

25
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,680
It seems she's not just kidding around.

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,520
I see. You may go now.

27
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:18,240
These are the ingredients the Head Chef
had you prepare, right?

28
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,600
What are you doing?

29
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,160
I'm really sorry, A Cha.

30
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,560
I'm afraid I'll have to trouble you

31
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,240
to pick them all out one by one.

32
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,520
A Cha, you won't blame me, will you?

33
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,320
You...

34
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,120
What?

35
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:52,240
Don't tell me you want to go
tell Seventh Young Master.

36
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,360
After all, no one else has seen it.

37
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,200
I'm not afraid.

38
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,160
You...

39
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,720
Retribution!

40
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,920
Dayuan, how is it going with Liu Mubai?

41
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,040
I heard

42
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,720
that all our warriors

43
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,240
are lining up there,

44
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,720
waiting to learn the fitness exercises
from him.

45
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,920
Mr. Liu has got his hands full.

46
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,440
He's now like a small bird in a cage,

47
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,640
unable to walk out or fly high.

48
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,040
Enough to give him a hard time.

49
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,800
Young Master, the physicians are busy.

50
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,800
Let me serve you then.

51
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,560
Alright, it's getting late.

52
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,920
You may get back and rest.

53
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,560
Yes, Young Master.

54
00:07:03,098 --> 00:07:09,344
(Royal Kitchen)

55
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,600
When did I finish picking them?

56
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,040
Did I sleepwalk yesterday?

57
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,640
Young Master.

58
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,720
What happened to your hand?

59
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,200
I practiced swordsmanship all night.
It's nothing serious.

60
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,640
Young Master, you are really diligent.

61
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,000
I've received some news.

62
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,120
The servant who used to
procure ingredients

63
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,560
is now settled in Xishan.

64
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,240
Settled in Xishan?

65
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,920
We haven't seen each other
for a long time.

66
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,400
Tomorrow, I'll treat you
to a counter meal.

67
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,800
And I'll invite Seventh Young Master
as well, to introduce you to him.

68
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,400
(Second Young Master seems a bit off.)

69
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,840
(It just happens that I haven't met
Seventh Young Master yet.)

70
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,480
(Might as well go have a look.)

71
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,080
Shu, what are you thinking about?

72
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,240
Then thank you, Aunt.

73
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,520
Shu, what would you like
to eat tomorrow?

74
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:12,160
I've heard that there's a famous dish
in Royal Kitchen of Black Tortoise City.

75
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,560
It's called Bean-not-bean.

76
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,520
It's a kind of tofu made from
non-bean foodstuff.

77
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,840
I wonder if I may have the chance
to try it.

78
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,360
Bean-not-bean?

79
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,640
Without beans, how can one make tofu?

80
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,960
If we can't make the Bean-not-bean,

81
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,360
how shameful will Royal Kitchen be?

82
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,120
Everyone, think about it.

83
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,240
Bean-not-bean.

84
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,240
A Cha, what's your idea?

85
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,240
Head Chef, in the recipes I inherited
from my father,

86
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,800
there is the cooking method for it.

87
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,760
It's worth a try.

88
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,440
But I need to go out of the city
to collect ingredients.

89
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:02,880
