(The Past)

19
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,680
Reporting, Second Young Master.

20
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,320
Speak up.

21
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,680
The Princess is here.

22
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,360
What?

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,280
Come on.

24
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,480
Hurry up, here.

25
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,800
Up there. Hurry up.

26
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,480
Make it quick.

27
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,760
I'm sure

28
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,760
after seeing my physique,

29
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,880
the Princess will definitely be charmed.

30
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,240
What a beanpole!

31
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,960
Princess, look at
my physique and muscles.

32
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,040
Hope I didn't scare you.

33
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,800
You are all skin and bones.

34
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,280
What?

35
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,520
I mean,

36
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,040
it's familiar.

37
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,560
Familiar?

38
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,840
You remind me

39
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,280
of those brave and valiant soldiers

40
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,000
in our Vermilion Bird City.

41
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,560
In Vermilion Bird City,

42
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,080
all the soldiers are lucky

43
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,880
to have a princess like yourself.

44
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,320
You didn't invite me here today

45
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,520
to appreciate your body, did you?

46
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,880
Of course not.

47
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:10,760
I,

48
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,200
as the top swordsman
of Black Tortoise City,

49
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,520
have a contest

50
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,200
with my seventh brother, He Lianyu.

51
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,520
So I humbly invite you
to offer me some guidance, Princess.

52
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,600
Okay.

53
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:21,880
Please.

54
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,360
You ruptured your old wounds last time.

55
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,600
Why are you still acting tough now?

56
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,040
I just wanted to show him
who's the boss.

57
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,800
It takes so long for your wound to heal.

58
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,600
Shall I invite
an imperial physician over?

59
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,720
No.

60
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,720
No one should know about my wound.

61
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,040
Or...

62
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,160
Can you change it for me?

63
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,400
Me?

64
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,560
It looks so bad.

65
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,360
Sir.

66
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,160
How is the Young Master doing?

67
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,920
He is taking a rest
after being medicated.

68
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:06,320
I can tell he treats you differently.

69
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,800
Don't you feel strange?

70
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,200
There are so many chefs
in Royal Kitchen.

71
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:12,720
He only likes the dishes you make.

72
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,040
Please enlighten me, sir.

73
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:23,760
Ten years ago, at Seventh Young Master's
birthday banquet...

74
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,680
Mother, you eat first.

75
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,200
Okay.

76
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,840
Good boy.

77
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,160
Ms. Wang has been poisoned!

78
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,760
Ms. Wang has been poisoned!

79
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,280
Mother, Mother!

80
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,160
- A jinx.
- What's wrong with you, Mother?

81
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:01,400
Bringing misfortune to father, mother,
wife, and child.

82
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,120
Ms. Wang, the young master's mother,

83
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,200
is not only wife of the City Lord,

84
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,320
but also an undefeated figure
on the battlefield.

85
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,840
She helped the City Lord
in quelling troubles

86
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,800
and is the glory of Black Tortoise City.

87
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:22,200
However, at Seventh Young Master's
birthday banquet,

88
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,120
a poisoning took place.

89
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,280
Ms. Wang died in front of him.

90
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,120
From then on,

91
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,960
he is known as a jinx to everyone

92
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,160
and was sent to the city border.

93
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,640
He was only 12 years old at the time.

94
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:43,680
He lost his sense of taste since then.

95
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,000
What?

96
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,440
The food he ate before had no taste?

97
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,280
Then why does he like the dishes I make?

98
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,840
After he came back to the palace

99
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,520
and ate the dishes you prepared,

100
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,080
he tasted the flavor.

101
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,240
Now you know

102
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,200
why he has a special fondness

103
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,440
for your cooking.

104
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,360
That explains.

105
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,760
About the case happened back then,

106
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,320
was the murderer ever found?

107
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,840
No.

108
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,640
In the future,

109
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,320
don't ask questions about the case.

110
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,600
You're being talkative.

111
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,760
Young Master, I'm sorry.

112
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,160
You may leave.

113
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:32,840
Yes.

114
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,120
No wonder you were eating raw meat

115
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,840
when I first saw you.

116
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,200
I didn't know you had been struggling
for all these years.

117
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,160
But it's okay.

118
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,480
Now that you have met me,

119
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,680
I'll take care of your meals
in the future.

120
00:08:58,714 --> 00:09:01,984
(Imperial Hospital)

121
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,560
Mubai, I have a friend.

122
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:09,360
He can't taste any flavor

123
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:12,800
except the food made by a specific chef.

124
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,280
I know what you mean.

125
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,960
I've read about it in a medical book.

126
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,280
It's either a physical disorder
or an emotional one.

127
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,600
Emotional disorder?
How can it be treated?

128
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:53,040
Emotional disorders
are the hardest illness to cure.

129
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,120
If one wants to treat it,

130
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,920
the only way is
to unravel his emotional knots.

131
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,920
I have another friend. She...

132
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,520
You have too many friends.

133
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,880
It's not important.

134
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,680
This friend of mine is a great cook.

135
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,080
And she looks

136
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,720
gorgeous.

137
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,560
She knows a man

138
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,240
who loves the meals she makes.

139
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:17,880
Do you think

140
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:21,760
that man only likes her meals,

141
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,480
or does he also have some feelings

142
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,160
for her?

143
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,120
(The man A Cha is talking about)

144
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,680
(seems to be me.)

145
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,840
I think this man

146
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:40,280
not only has feelings for your friend,

147
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,920
but also has been in deep love with you.

148
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,040
What are you talking about?

149
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,600

in deep love with me?)
