(Imperial Pumpkin)

19
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:10,720
Mr. Cao.

20
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,840
The imperial pumpkin's done.

21
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:12,920
Have a taste.

22
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,560
Tasty food.

23
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,280
What do you think?

24
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,240
It tastes bad.

25
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:24,680
Take it away.

26
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,200
It's not tasty at all.

27
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,600
It tastes bad.

28
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,240
I won't eat it.

29
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,280
It tastes bad.

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,120
It tastes bad.

31
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,920
It tastes bad.

32
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,400
Did I use too many medicinal herbs?

33
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,280
I'll work on it again.

34
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:39,600
He Lianyu, I will help you.

35
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,160
My neck is going to be broken.

36
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,240
Didn't we agree to help each other?

37
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,480
Have you done anything helpful?

38
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,680
A Cha has been busy with medicinal food.

39
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,280
I don't want to disturb her.

40
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,800
Medicinal food?

41
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,400
A Cha.

42
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,280
Let me help you.

43
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,600
It's so hot!

44
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,200
Are you okay?

45
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,720
I'll get you some medicine.

46
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,000
A Cha.

47
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,160
I brought some in my medicine box.

48
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,240
Is it necessary to wrap it like this?

49
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,240
This shows I was severely hurt.

50
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,400
What did you say?

51
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,840
I said I was severely hurt.

52
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,280
This can make it heal faster.

53
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,600
You just talk too much.

54
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,640
Asking for a beating?

55
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,040
Better cover your mouth.

56
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,000
Go back if there's nothing else.

57
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,120
I'm busy.

58
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,080
Don't disturb me.

59
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,360
There is something.

60
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,960
Sit.

61
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,600
Let me ask you.

62
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,000
Do you know which insect is the richest?

63
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:25,880
Answer me.

64
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:27,880
Crickets.

65
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,000
No. Silkworms.

66
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,160
Why?

67
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,960
Because silkworms spin cocoons.
[*"Spin cocoon" sounds like "saving"]

68
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,600
Sorry. I won't joke again.

69
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,800
I don't have time for jokes.

70
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,280
I need to work on medicinal food.

71
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,920
Medicinal food? You can ask me for help.

72
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,760
What do I do?

73
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,920
I'm an imperial physician.

74
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,000
Medicinal food's core

75
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,200
lies on the herbs, right?

76
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,960
It's my area of expertise.

77
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,800
I'm sure I'll be helpful.

78
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,520
You're right. Why didn't I realize this?

79
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,080
Help me check.

80
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,000
Is it okay to use these herbs together?

81
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,400
Does it taste that bad?

82
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,960
(I can't give He Lianyu a chance.)

83
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,000
M-My stomach hurts.

84
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,560
W-What's wrong?
Why does your stomach hurt?

85
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,680
Is it because of my medicine?

86
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,560
It worked right away?

87
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,120
I don't think
it can work right away, either.

88
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,560
Why don't you feed me more?

89
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,840
I'll check again.

90
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,560
One more spoon.

91
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,560
One more.

92
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,000
(I wonder
how things are going with Gongsun Shu.)

93
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,960
