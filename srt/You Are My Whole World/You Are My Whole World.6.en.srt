(Return to the Palace)

19
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,680
Surround the house.

20
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,280
I'll go have a look.

21
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,960
It really is you, Seventh Brother.

22
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,400
Second Brother, long time no see.

23
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,240
War God in Red!

24
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,200
- War God in Red!
- War God in Red!

25
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,440
It's the War God in Red!

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Shut your mouth!

27
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,080
How can you talk so much every day?

28
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:53,080
Seventh Brother, our father summoned you
back to the palace.

29
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,760
But you play hide and seek all day.

30
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,360
Not a trace of you.

31
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,080
Now look at the way you're dressed.

32
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,640
What are you wearing? So strange.

33
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,280
Could it possibly be

34
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,520
that you're plotting a rebellion?

35
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,040
If you want to detain me,

36
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,720
no need to find so many excuses.

37
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,680
Fine. Guards, seize Seventh Young Master

38
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,720
and let him await a trial in prison.

39
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,560
If anyone dares to resist, kill

40
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,440
every single of them.

41
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,880
The order from the City Lord.

42
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,280
An oral proclamation from the City Lord.

43
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:32,360
Summon the Second and Seventh
Young Masters to return to the palace.

44
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,880
Young Masters, the City Lord is awake.

45
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,920
He summoned you back.

46
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,800
Second Young Master, Seventh Young
Master's 50000 Black-armor Guards

47
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,360
are now stationed north of the city.

48
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,080
This is all the City Lord's intent.

49
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,000
Second Brother,

50
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,720
do you still intend to seize me.

51
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,600
If that's the case, Seventh Brother,

52
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,160
let's return to the palace together
to see our father.

53
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:09,920
Let's go.

54
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,480
Seventh Brother,

55
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,800
not that I want to scold you.

56
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,680
Look at you.

57
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,080
Truly a jinx sent from the heaven.

58
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,160
Again, you nearly harmed

59
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,280
this beautiful young lady, right?

60
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,280
What are you talking about?
He's not a jinx.

61
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,640
"He's not..."

62
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,640
Eventually, I'll extract all your teeth.

63
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,760
Just wait and see. Back to the palace.

64
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,200
Let's go. Let's go back to the palace.

65
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,240
Young Master.

66
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,520
Young Master.

67
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,880
It's already dawn.

68
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,240
City Lord stayed up all night,

69
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,640
just waiting to see you.

70
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,800
(I didn't expect him to stay
with me all night.)

71
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,680
(But he is the Seventh Young Master.)

72
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,640
(How should I face him from now on?)

73
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,720
Greetings, Father.

74
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,960
With a blink,

75
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,000
you've grown so tall.

76
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,160
I remember when you left,

77
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,440
you were not taller than my shoulder.

78
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,240
I wonder why you have summoned
me back this time.

79
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,240
It's been a long time.

80
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,920
I just wanted you to come back
and keep me company.

81
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,120
Thanks for your concern, Father.

82
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,680
I've heard

83
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,560
you and your second brother had
a conflict over some misunderstandings.

84
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,520
Yes.

85
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,880
Brothers should not
hold grudges overnight.

86
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:09,200
After all, I will eventually entrust
the future of Black Tortoise City

87
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,760
to you and your brother.

88
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,800
I will heed your teachings.

89
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,560
- I'm telling you.
- I'll...

90
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,680
I have to leave now.

91
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,520
Where are you going?

92
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,160
The old man already woke up

93
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,480
and he has the help from He Lianyu now.

94
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,320
We must be cautious
when we meet in the future.

95
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,000
I don't care.

96
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,720
Get away.

97
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,320
You're really leaving?

98
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,280
This darn old man.

99
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:02,000
What's wrong?
What is everyone running for?

100
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,000
A Yin, what happened to your butt?

101
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,600
Lin A Cha,

102
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:21,840
- Fifteen, sixteen, seventeen.
- I dare not.

103
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,680
I dare not.

104
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,680
Young Master, your tea must be cold now.

105
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:40,880
- Fifteen, sixteen, seventeen.
- I was wrong. I don't dare anymore.

106
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,760
I dare not.

107
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,800
Dayuan, the tea is indeed a bit cold.

108
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,360
Understood.

109
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,640
Twelve.

110
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,880
Why is it back to twelve again?

111
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:54,800
Thirteen.

112
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,200
Great, now you've got a backer.

113
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,920
That really is something.

114
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,520
A Cha's status is not ordinary nowadays.

115
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,400
She has a backer, the War God in Red.

116
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,760
She really is lucky.

117
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,680
Perhaps the Seventh Young Master
will favor her soon.

118
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,440
She won't have to be a cook anymore.

119
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,880
Seventh Young Master.

120
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,000
What brings you here?

121
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,960
Come to my place tonight.

122
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,800
(What's happening tonight?)

123
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:39,560
(He really wants to...
What am I thinking?)

124
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,800
I've prepared everything.

125
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,960
No need to bring anything.

126
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,400
Just show up.

127
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,160
Why is he taking off his clothes?

128
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,880
He couldn't possibly want to...

129
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,840
No, no, no.

130
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,640
You scoundrel!

131
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,480
What is that?

132
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,120
Scoundrel!

133
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,560
I'll crush you!

134
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,200
