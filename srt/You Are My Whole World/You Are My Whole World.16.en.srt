(Dispelling Superstitions)

19
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,040
There odd signs in the sky.

20
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,040
The City Lord and Second Young Master
are struck by misfortune.

21
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,880
He Lianyu, you truly are a born jinx.

22
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,040
Grand Master is right.

23
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,000
You will bring fatal misfortune
to everyone around you.

24
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,360
At the birthday banquet ten years ago,

25
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,040
Ms. Wang died because of you.

26
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,000
Ten years later, you came back.

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,800
You'll bring deadly fate
to the City Lord too.

28
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,720
You are the one who should die.

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,360
You are the one who should die.

30
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,040
A Cha.

31
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,160
No, you are not a jinx.

32
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,840
Since when did a servant like you
get a say?

33
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,800
Let her talk.

34
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:03,120
The inside and bottom of this wine cup
have been brushed with a layer of syrup.

35
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,160
Some litmus flower leaves are sealed
underneath the syrup.

36
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,200
When the syrup dissolved,

37
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,440
it combined with
the litmus flower leaves

38
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,440
and the wine turned red.

39
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,640
What about this black rice?

40
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,680
This is white and black rice
from a foreign country, Siam.

41
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,240
Its appearance is indistinguishable
from that of regular rice.

42
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,440
After being cooked,
it will have a white husk.

43
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,040
Once the white husk dissolves,

44
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,880
the black rice inside will show.

45
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,440
I have indeed heard

46
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,240
of the white and black rice
in Vermilion Bird City.

47
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,640
What about the City Lord
and Second Young Master?

48
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,000
Isn't it the troubles brought to us

49
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,920
by He Lianyu?

50
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,680
Excuse me.

51
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,520
Why so late?

52
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,280
Ms. Jia, do you
not want to know the truth

53
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,960
or are you afraid of the truth?

54
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,120
I believe it's
due to the pathogenic wind.

55
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,920
They should be fine

56
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,960
after I perform acupuncture.

57
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,360
Though they will be fine,

58
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,520
among so many people on the scene,

59
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,880
why only those related by blood
to Seventh Young Master,

60
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,840
the City Lord and Second Young Master,
passed out?

61
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,720
Only the jinx
is responsible for all these.

62
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,040
Servants have tasted all these dishes.

63
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,200
They are not poisoned.

64
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:43,960
Only He Lianyu can cause all these.

65
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,480
I got it.

66
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,880
The problem lies
with the hundred-flower cake.

67
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,600
It is made from crushed rice
and twelve kinds of flowers.

68
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,800
One of them is the peach blossom.

69
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,920
Peach blossoms mixed with wine

70
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,240
may cause no harm to most people,

71
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,440
but for those with allergies,

72
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,080
at best they faint
and at worst they collapse.

73
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,040
The City Lord and Second Young Master
do have allergic constitutions.

74
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,440
Luckily, they didn't eat much,
so they will be fine.

75
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,280
That explains.

76
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,120
This little kitchen maid
is really impressive.

77
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,560
She's indeed insightful.

78
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,840
Quite knowledgeable.

79
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,000
Now that the truth has come to light,

80
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,800
Ms. Jia is the mistress
of the inner palace.

81
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,160
You wouldn't believe in
such an absurd notion as a jinx, right?

82
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,960
How could I believe
such an absurd thing?

83
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:34,400
Perhaps today's accident has nothing
to do with Seventh Young Master.

84
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,080
Bring the royal chef
who arranged the meals.

85
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,720
Bad news.
Royal Chef Li has taken his own life.

86
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,720
Royal Chef Li has killed himself.

87
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,680
The culprit is dead.

88
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,160
Let today's episode end here.

89
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,880
Take City Lord and Second Young Master
back and take good care of them.

90
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,000
Yes.

91
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,080
We consulted the Royal Observatory
about the sky signs

92
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,120
and have planned for so long.

93
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,560
It's even at the cost of my face.

94
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,800
But for what?

95
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,880
Lianyu still got away with it.

96
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,120
What's so funny?

97
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:31,880
Second Young Master,
we have achieved our aim actually.

98
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,920
About the notion of the prophecy,

99
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,120
it's better to believe it than not,

100
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,400
especially for the powerful and rich.

101
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,200
Even if the kitchen maid
has unraveled the secret,

102
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,680
you and your old man
have suffered after all.

103
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,560
After tomorrow,

104
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,520
people will only become more convinced
about the jinx thing.

105
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,600
Really?

106
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,800
Just wait and see.

107
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,920
I dare say even He Lianyu himself

108
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:58,000
will suspect whether he is a jinx.

109
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,640
If that were the case,

110
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,080
my handsome face would be sacrificed

111
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,720
for a good reason.

112
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,360
(This child brings misfortune
to his father and mother.)

113
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,640
(Ms. Wang died because of you.)

114
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,600
(Ten years later, you came back.)

115
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,400
(You'll bring deadly fate
to the City Lord too.)

116
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:19,160
Bringing misfortune to father, mother,
wife, and child.

117
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,640
A born jinx.

118
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:33,440
The palace is unlike the outside world.
One slightest misstep

119
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,520
- will lead to big trouble.
- Where's A Cha?

120
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,760
How would I know?

121
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,400
Don't you normally know everything?

122
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,960
Where did she go?

123
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,800
Didn't you ask me not to gossip?

124
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,640
What's on your mind?

125
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,560
A Cha,

126
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,560
thank you for everything

127
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,800
you've done for me.

128
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,600
I'm owing you more favor.

129
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,800
You don't believe in that curse, do you?

130
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,120
(Everyone close to me)

131
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,960
(got hurt one by one.)

132
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,360
You already told me it was fake.

133
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,960
How would I believe it?

134
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,360
Great.

135
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,480
Do you remember a few days ago

136
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,160
we have confirmed those twelve dishes?

137
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,680
I remember you said

138
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,520
that the twelve dishes
were not poisoned.

139
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,480
Yes.

140
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,560
Every dish went through Mr. Cao's
poison screening and verification.

141
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,520
If there was poison,
it should have been detected then.

142
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:03,120
But what if it was like
last night's banquet?

143
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,960
Do you mean...

144
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,440
Perhaps someone used the trick
to mix something in the food,

145
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,920
put poison in the banquet,

146
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,320
and killed your mother.

147
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,640
But these are all my guesses.

148
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,040
I should hurry up
and prepare the twelve dishes.

149
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,520
Then maybe we can get something

150
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,560
out of Mr. Cao.

151
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,800
Thank you.

152
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,520
What's with the formality?

153
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,000
You talk like a scholar.

154
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,280
I prefer
your proud and uninhibited manner.

155
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,320
Put yourself together.

156
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,120
(A Cha is more and more concerned
about He Lianyu.)

157
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,200
(I need to think of a plan.)

158
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,360
Your Highness. Greetings.

159
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,400
Little physician.

160
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,640
Do you need me for something?

161
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,760
I heard

162
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,960
you and A Cha grew up together

163
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,560
and were betrothed when young.

164
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,800
We did grow up together,

165
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,280
but we were

166
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,120
not betrothed.

167
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,280
Very good.

168
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:27,240
With truth and falsehood,
we can muddy the waters.

169
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,120
Listen,

170
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,280
I'd like

171
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,640
to be straightforward.

172
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,440
I know you like A Cha.

173
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,880
And I have feelings for He Lianyu.

174
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,320
You are suggesting...

175
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,520
How about we help each other out?

176
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,400
(Although the princess is willful,)

177
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,880
(she is cute
and comes from a noble background.)

178
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,160
(She's indeed
a good choice for stirring things up.)

179
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,480
Deal.

180
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,520
Deal.
