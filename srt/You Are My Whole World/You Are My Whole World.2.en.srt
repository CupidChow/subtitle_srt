(Competition)

19
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:10,600
What's wrong?

20
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,480
What exactly did you do to me?

21
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,720
Where is this place?

22
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,920
The Royal Palace of Black Tortoise City.

23
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,640
Royal Palace?

24
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,720
Why am I in the Royal Palace?

25
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,520
After you passed out...

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,440
Make sure you do it cleanly.

27
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,120
A Cha, don't worry.

28
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,240
It is what happened.

29
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,680
Let go.

30
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,520
Are you trying to strangle me?

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,840
After all, I saved your life.

32
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,600
I treated your wounds.

33
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,440
Come on. I even spent my own money

34
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,440
and made you a eunuch.

35
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,200
You didn't even thank me.

36
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,960
(Father summoned me back to the palace.)

37
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,440
(It has to be for something important.)

38
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,120
(Showing up rashly
will only bring trouble.)

39
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,560
(I should heal my wounds first,)

40
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,120
(and investigate
who is behind those assassins.)

41
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,520
If it weren't for you,

42
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,240
I wouldn't have been wounded.

43
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,640
Besides, if I weren't there,

44
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,400
you would have died in the woods.

45
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:44,040
Speaking of favors,
you need to cure me first.

46
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,520
Then we can call it even.

47
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,280
I'm hungry. I want food.

48
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,800
You...

49
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,600
Fine, I always
keep the good and bad straight.

50
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,120
Once your wounds are healed,
I'll send you out of here.

51
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,760
And then we'll be even.

52
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,080
My lifesaver.

53
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,320
By the way,

54
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,040
what's your name?

55
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,440
My name is...

56
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,560
Come on.

57
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,080
From now on, your name is Stool.

58
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,480
Mr. Dayuan.

59
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:46,880
Come in.

60
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:59,880
Mr. Dayuan, this is the bamboo fungus
I bought in the city for a hefty sum.

61
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,600
I am not sure about the quality.
Can you take a look at it?

62
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,560
The quality?

63
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,320
It's clearly top-notch produce.

64
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,320
Don't worry.

65
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,600
About your competition,

66
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,040
I will handle it impartially.

67
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,720
Thank you, Mr. Dayuan.

68
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,920
(How despicable!)

69
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,000
(A Yin really has deep pockets.)

70
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,720
(My bamboo fungus
got trampled like that.)

71
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,640
(What should I do now?)

72
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,120
Stool, I'm coming in.

73
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:51,960
Come on in.

74
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,280
This is all we have for tonight.

75
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,680
Help yourself.

76
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,240
Is it good?

77
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,440
When you're feeling down,

78
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,480
just eat a piece of sweet bunny cake.

79
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,600
It will cheer you up.

80
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,840
What are you waiting for?

81
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,600
Whatever. I'll eat it myself.

82
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,120
Did you make this?

83
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,080
(How come she can make this too?)

84
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,200
(So sweet.)

85
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,240
(Why can I taste flavor)

86
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,800
(of the food she makes?)

87
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,800
Why are you sighing?

88
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,280
You dare ask?

89
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,720
My bamboo fungus got flattened
because of you.

90
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,400
Bamboo fungus? What's that?

91
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,720
It's the ingredient for the competition.

92
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:47,840
Competition?

93
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,800
You better kneel
and beg for my mercy now.

94
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,040
Then when I become a Royal Chef,

95
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,840
I might be generous
and let you do some odd jobs.

96
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,320
You want to be a Royal Chef?

97
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,960
What else do you have besides money?

98
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:02,640
You...

99
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,320
What?

100
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,240
What are you babbling about?

101
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:11,920
Show me.

102
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,880
Sir, this dish is called
"Screened Moon Gazing".

103
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,440
I heard from the imperial physician

104
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,360
that you often eat rare delicacies,

105
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,280
which has led to obesity
and lack of energy.

106
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:26,280
You should eat less
greasy and fatty food.

107
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,920
This dish tastes light.

108
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,440
It is nutritious and refreshing.

109
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:44,720
It's rich but not greasy,
light but not thin. Great.

110
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,720
A Cha, what about yours?

111
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,920
This dish is called
"Butterfly Bamboo Fungus Liver Soup"

112
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,440
The liver paste is made from
high-quality pork liver.

113
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,640
Through pounding, mixing, and steaming,

114
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,320
it's made into a smooth paste.

115
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,320
It's fragrant and tender,
with rich and savory paste.

116
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,720
A Cha,

117
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,720
didn't you hear what A Yin just said?

118
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,600
I am obese.

119
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,200
The fatty food is bad for my health.

120
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,680
But I'm sure compared to the bland soup,

121
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,400
you like this more.

122
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,760
Twenty years ago,

123
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,200
you suffered a serious injury
after saving

124
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,800
Ms. City Lord, Ms. Wang.

125
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,720
Although he recovered,

126
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,880
he can only live to his fifties.

127
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,280
He vowed to try
all the supreme flavors in the world.

128
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,040
I think you can focus on that.

129
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,640
Sir, you are now in your mid-forties.

130
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,080
Instead of worrying about your health,

131
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,240
it's better to eat
all the delicacies in the world.

132
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,720
Then you will leave no regrets.

133
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,320
You...

134
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:13,120
You do know me well.

135
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,120
About which of you
can join the Royal Kitchen,

136
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,240
I haven't made up my mind yet.

137
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,080
Sir,

138
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,640
