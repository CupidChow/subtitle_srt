1
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:06,649
Someone has been calling you.

2
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:07,984
What? Who?

3
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:13,156
RDU-90.

4
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:16,743
Isn't that the researcher?

5
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:09,707
Dad.

6
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:14,420
Dad!

7
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:19,133
Dad!

8
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,636
No…

9
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:39,529
Dad…

10
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:11,644
Hong, a civil rights lawyer,
passed away due to an accident

11
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,271
in Geumga-dong, Sangcheon-gu.

12
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:15,982
He was revealed to have violated
the attorneys-at-law act

13
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:19,444
and of committing subornation of perjury,
shocking the public.

14
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:22,905
Hong was a civil rights lawyer
who had defended

15
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,824
the Babel Pharmaceuticals' victims

16
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:26,826
and had given voice to the weak.

17
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:30,038
Due to this accident, however,
his true face was revealed.

18
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,915
While undergoing the recent trial,

19
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:36,294
Hong demanded money and bribed
those who were involved.

20
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:39,047
He also convinced Lee,
a deliveryman, to commit perjury.

21
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:42,759
He had been under investigation
after violating the attorneys-at-law act.

22
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:45,511
This news has shocked the victims

23
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:48,556
and many others who revered him
as a civil rights activist.

24
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:20,004
LAW FIRM JIPURAGI
LAWYER HONG YU-CHAN

25
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:35,645
Mr. Hong, I forgot…

26
00:06:36,395 --> 00:06:38,314
I forgot my keys.

27
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,744
LAWYER HONG YU-CHAN

28
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:04,048
TO LAWYER HONG YU-CHAN
THANK YOU FOR YOUR COUNSEL

29
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:21,774
THANK YOU FOR BEING THE LAST STRAW
I COULD GRAB ONTO 10 YEARS AGO

30
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:26,779
DECEASED HONG YU-CHAN
WE WILL CHERISH YOUR MEMORIES

31
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:21,584
I'M SORRY
I LOVE YOU

32
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,669
I COULD PROTECT MY FAMILY
THANKS TO YOU

33
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:26,964
I WILL NEVER FORGET YOU
YOU'VE TAUGHT ME WHAT HOPE IS

34
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:41,395
This is the medical report.

35
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:45,483
Babel Pharmaceuticals' new drug,
RDU-90, has been approved

36
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:47,527
and will be released soon.

37
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,988
RDU-90 is considered
the perfect painkiller

38
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:53,658
due to its lack of side effects
and lasting effects.

39
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:55,117
A lawsuit regarding the death

40
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,453
of one of its test subjects
had been filed,

41
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:01,499
but it has been confirmed that it wasn't
directly related to the drug.

42
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:10,633
THANK YOU
I WON'T FORGET ABOUT YOU

43
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:13,344
I DON'T BELIEVE WHAT THEY'RE SAYING
ABOUT YOU

44
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:15,846
THE RICE SOUP YOU BOUGHT ME
WAS THE BEST MEAL I HAD

45
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,015
REST IN PEACE

46
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:20,851
YOU WERE MY ONE AND ONLY
FAMILY AND FRIEND

47
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:23,896
THANK YOU FOR HELPING ME
YOUR DEATH WILL NOT BE IN VAIN

48
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:27,066
I COULD GET OUT OF THAT LONG DARK TUNNEL
THANKS TO YOU

49
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:38,661
EPISODE 4

50
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:09,400
LAW FIRM JIPURAGI

51
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:25,583
Cha-young's first time fishing.

52
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:28,169
She was good but never wanted
to do it again.

53
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:38,012
High school graduation.
She didn't want flowers.

54
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:42,058
Had four servings of ribs by herself.
February 20, 2008.

55
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:45,936
45TH JUDICIAL TRAINEES'
GRADUATION CEREMONY

56
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:54,320
January 12, 2014.

57
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:56,322
Graduated from the training institute.

58
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,283
My dear beloved daughter, Cha-young.

59
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:02,912
I hope you won't become
an awful lawyer like me.

60
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:05,873
I love you, Cha-young.

61
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:35,361
Pungho.

62
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:37,613
Maru.

63
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:40,741
Sijin. Eunseom.

64
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:43,661
This is my first time watering you.

65
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:51,377
I'll be your new dad from today on.

66
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:53,212
Let's go to my…

67
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:57,174
Water has been leaking
from an apartment in Mapo-gu

68
00:11:57,258 --> 00:12:00,553
although it had been built
less than a year ago.

69
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:03,431
Poor construction has been suspected
as the cause.

70
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:04,974
You're really closing down

71
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:07,101
this law firm, right?

72
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:08,519
There had been issues…

73
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:09,437
Yes.

74
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:12,731
The residents are preparing

75
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:17,945
to file a lawsuit against the constructor
and the company due to the water leakage,

76
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:21,740
cracks on the walls, and the frequent
malfunctioning of the elevator.

77
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:25,119
There has been an increasing number
of complaints regarding apartments,

78
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:30,666
and people have asked the government
to come up with an effective solution.

79
00:12:30,749 --> 00:12:31,959
Next news.

80
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:34,795
This morning,
an unidentified male body was found

81
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:37,840
in the coastal waters of Gijang, Busan.

82
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:40,384
The police are currently trying
to identify the man…

83
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,847
They've decided

84
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:47,850
to close the law firm.

85
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:52,771
You seem quite despondent.

86
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:57,526
Damn it. I haven't done anything for him.

87
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,904
What could you have done?

88
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:02,406
Were you going to beat up those bastards?

89
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,325
Why not? I could have if I wanted.

90
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:08,537
Then who will take care
of our plaza's issue?

91
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:12,249
Didn't Mr. Cassano say he'd buy a building
and let us move there?

92
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,918
Do you actually believe him?

93
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:17,004
I wonder how he's doing.

94
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:19,048
They said he'd wake up in a week.

95
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:22,051
He has been unconscious
for 9 days and 13 hours.

96
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:23,802
Mr. An.

97
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:27,681
Why would you count the days
he's been hospitalized?

98
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:30,392
I just enjoy counting time.

99
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:31,810
One hour, two hours…

100
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:35,064
I also don't believe
that he'll move us to another building.

101
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:37,858
-I think he was just bluffing.
-Bluffing?

102
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:40,903
He's not the type to bluff.

103
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:44,114
You're wrong. He bluffs quite a bit.

104
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:47,117
He criticizes my dishes
as if he was a connoisseur.

105
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:51,372
He's been in a huge accident.
He must hate this country now.

106
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:53,541
So he'll probably return to Italy.

107
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:55,626
You're right.

108
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:58,546
He has no time to think
about other people like us.

109
00:13:58,629 --> 00:13:59,797
Did you know?

110
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:06,804
Mr. Cassano installed electric pads
at the temple for the monks.

111
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:09,848
He also taught some boys
who were smoking around here a lesson.

112
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:12,309
Goodness. Really?

113
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:15,854
I believe you're making him out to be
more selfish than he actually is.

114
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:18,774
That's how I feel.

115
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:26,866
It's been ten days

116
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:29,994
since Dad passed away.

117
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:35,583
The media has painted him
as a crooked lawyer.

118
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:40,421
I've closed down Law Firm Jipuragi today.

119
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,049
But I have yet to find closure.

120
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:48,971
I don't believe
that it was a mere freak accident.

121
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:54,476
So I want to do something about this.

122
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:57,605
But I have no evidence.

123
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:00,316
I don't know where to start…

124
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,535
I must be crazy.

125
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:15,581
I said I wouldn't cry.

126
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,543
Don't be an idiot.

127
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:25,299
Get up and say something already.

128
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:27,301
I'm so frustrated.

129
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:30,387
I'm paying for this private room
and your hospital bills

130
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:32,056
just to hear your story.

131
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,475
Do you even know how much it costs?

132
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:37,728
-Then let's go to the bank first.
-Just wire it to me.

133
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,745
You woke up so randomly.

134
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:55,955
What is going on?

135
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:01,043
Let's go.

136
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:04,463
Where do you think you're going?
We need to see if you're all right.

137
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:07,466
Let's check for any numbness
or cognitive disorder.

138
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,844
The numbness subsided last night.

139
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,054
You woke up last night?

140
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:13,389
I remember everything.

141
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:17,601
And I recognize you,
so I'm fine, aren't I?

142
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,735
Then did you hear me cry just now?

143
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:30,739
You didn't sound like an idiot at all,

144
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:33,742
so don't worry.

145
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:37,162
Hey.

146
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:41,750
Why didn't he tell me that he was awake?

147
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:17,244
What are you looking at?

148
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:21,123
I sent this to my daughter recently
as a wake-up call.

149
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:22,624
RELINQUISHMENT OF PARENTAL RIGHTS

150
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:27,463
She'd become an incredible lawyer
if only she could think straight.

151
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:31,341
Times have changed.

152
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:35,095
Earnest, upright,
and old-fashioned lawyers like me

153
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:37,514
can never beat the people who are corrupt.

154
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:39,475
You need someone

155
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,144
who's strong and brazen.

156
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:45,439
Cha-young fits that criteria perfectly.

157
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:49,818
Then you should've told her so yourself.

158
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,487
She would never listen to me.

159
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,239
Maybe later. When the time's right.

160
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:58,827
If I don't get the chance to tell her,
you should do it for me.

161
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:13,634
Why do you carry around that lighter
when you don't smoke?

162
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:20,140
Because the sound helps me
focus and calm down.

163
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:25,062
What's your plan?

164
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:27,689
Something smells fishy.

165
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:33,987
I'm going to look into the accident
and the driver himself again.

166
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:36,990
It's all over.

167
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:40,285
I'm aware of that.

168
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,664
I just want to double-check.

169
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:47,709
Why?

170
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:51,505
Is this your way
of paying your father back?

171
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,466
That's not it.

172
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:57,052
I may discover something new.

173
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:02,015
Until two weeks ago, you were his enemy.

174
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:04,434
But not anymore?

175
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:08,480
You should've done that sooner.

176
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:11,024
Are head injuries known

177
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,360
to make people rude?

178
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:15,112
Anyway, don't do anything.

179
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:16,655
Nothing will change.

180
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:19,074
How can you say that
to a bereaved family member?

181
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,951
I've always wanted to tell you this.

182
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,328
Goodbye.

183
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:37,467
I'm so dumbfounded.

184
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:41,013
How dare he make me out to be
a horrible daughter?

185
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:43,432
…a countermeasure is said
to be in the works.

186
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:47,060
Next news. The unidentified body
found in Gijang this morning

187
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:50,397
turned out to be a researcher
from a pharmaceutical company.

188
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:55,777
The police have notified
the family members of his death and…

189
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:09,917
Yu, a researcher, sent his will
to his company through a scheduled email.

190
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,294
The police believe it was suicide.

191
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:14,671
The company had been interrogating him

192
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:18,091
for siphoning pharmaceutical ingredients,
putting the victim under stress.

193
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:20,928
The police believe he committed suicide
due to the pressure.

194
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:23,680
The police will hand over his will
to his family

195
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:26,558
and investigate the incident
more thoroughly.

196
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:28,477
I'm Choi Yu-bin from YSN News.

197
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:36,818
Detective Gu.

198
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:40,239
There's a pressing matter
you must look into right now.

199
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:41,990
Mr. Nam.

200
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:47,537
I'll be your bodyguard
and do chores around the office for you.

201
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:49,331
Please don't close it down.

202
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:53,168
We can't keep the place for long.
Our registration will expire soon.

203
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,087
If this is about money,

204
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:57,839
sell anything you have to my pawnshop.

205
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,967
I'll give you a good price.

206
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:02,052
Don't be ridiculous.

207
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:03,679
We have no money.

208
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,639
-Well…
-Gosh.

209
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:07,015
Sir!

210
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,809
-What?
-Sir!

211
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:10,352
You're back!

212
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:13,188
-Mr. Cassano.
-Sir.

213
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:17,442
I was worried.

214
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,319
Thank you.

215
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:22,406
You look better than I thought you'd be.

216
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:27,244
-Well, then.
-Wait.

217
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:31,581
About what you said about helping us
move to another building…

218
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:33,375
Let's talk about it next time.

219
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:37,004
-I need some rest.
-But…

220
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:40,132
By "talk about it next time,"

221
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:42,968
do you mean you'll reconsider it?

222
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:48,682
I mean we should talk about it again
next time.

223
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:51,435
Did you change your mind?

224
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:57,274
Aren't Italians known for being punctual
and keeping their promises?

225
00:21:57,858 --> 00:21:58,817
Aren't they?

226
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,736
You can't do that.

227
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:03,113
We've put our trust in you.

228
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:04,656
We have nothing.

229
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,117
You shouldn't confuse people like us.

230
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,702
-You're right.
-Right.

231
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:10,662
-Come on, now.
-Let's go in.

232
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:12,414
We need food on our table!

233
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:14,791
-I told you, didn't I?
-This can't be.

234
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,710
-This is unfair.
-I knew it.

235
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:18,670
-Why won't he tell us?
-He can't do that.

236
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:20,047
Listen!

237
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:23,633
Don't you think you're being rude?

238
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:25,802
You're receiving free help from me,

239
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:29,348
and all you can do is suspect me
and complain?

240
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:31,641
Is it because we didn't pay him?

241
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:33,060
What I mean is,

242
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:35,645
you should at least
have an ounce of faith!

243
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,525
Since we've been betrayed so many times,

244
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:42,652
it's not easy for us to trust anyone.

245
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:45,989
You should walk in our shoes for once.

246
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:47,074
Keep this up,

247
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:49,701
and I'll have no desire
to keep my promise.

248
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:51,912
So you're going back on your words.

249
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:55,040
That's not what he meant!

250
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:56,833
Damn it! I'm so frustrated!

251
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:59,461
If you keep being wishy-washy,

252
00:23:01,254 --> 00:23:03,340
we won't be able to trust you.

253
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:06,343
Fine.

254
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:10,263
If you can't trust me,
you should look for another lawyer.

255
00:23:11,848 --> 00:23:13,141
But…

256
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:15,769
What a wonderful sight.

257
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:17,187
It is, isn't it?

258
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:20,982
Goodness.

259
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:25,070
I came here thinking you could be making
Molotov cocktails together.

260
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:27,030
I love how you've fallen apart.

261
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:29,574
This was exactly what I was hoping to see.

262
00:23:30,408 --> 00:23:31,952
Let's see.

263
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:34,579
That geezer of a lawyer is dead now.

264
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,791
And they've ousted the Italian lawyer.

265
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:41,628
All right, then.
Let's talk compensation, shall we?

266
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:42,921
I'll be generous.

267
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:45,841
Generous, my foot.
He's not running a charity.

268
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:47,592
I can hear you.

269
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:49,052
Isn't it too hot for a beanie?

270
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:52,097
Your face is like a heat wave.
Your face suffocates me.

271
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:55,016
Then is your face the rainy season?
It's so dark and gloomy.

272
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,102
What? What did you just say?

273
00:23:57,185 --> 00:23:59,062
Cut the nonsense and leave.

274
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:01,106
How obnoxious. This doesn't involve you.

275
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:03,191
Stop trying to act cool.

276
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:05,652
How do we negotiate with you?

277
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:08,572
-Larry?
-We should at least discuss it.

278
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:10,532
Come to my office with your seal,

279
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:12,868
and we'll get it all sorted out at once.

280
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:18,832
Hey, Mr. Italian Lawyer.

281
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:25,547
What did you do to Mr. Na
that he's acting all scared?

282
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:27,716
What's it to you?

283
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:28,884
You little bastard!

284
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:30,927
Your bluffing is on another level!

285
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:34,014
Shut up. Adults are trying to talk here.

286
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:36,725
He was being way obnoxious.
I couldn't help it.

287
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,435
I'm sorry.

288
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:42,355
Listen carefully.

289
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:46,776
The day we demolish this place
and pour our first cement,

290
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,028
you will be under it.

291
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:54,492
Then you'll be there with me,

292
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:57,329
since I enjoy people's company.

293
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:04,252
Why you…

294
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:06,421
-He hit him.
-He got hit.

295
00:25:06,504 --> 00:25:08,465
-He hit him.
-He slapped his face.

296
00:25:08,548 --> 00:25:11,051
I swear he has a few screws loose.

297
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:13,011
He's not scared of anything.

298
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:15,972
It's all over now.

299
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:18,808
I'm not this generous usually.

300
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:21,603
-Hurry up and go.
-Let's go.

301
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:25,649
All right. You first, Larry.

302
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:27,817
You can use your thumbprint as well.

303
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:29,319
-Well…
-Let's go right away.

304
00:25:29,402 --> 00:25:32,155
-What about an unofficial seal?
-That's fine too.

305
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:34,699
Your guess was correct.

306
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:37,327
It was Yu Min-chul,
the researcher for Babel, who died.

307
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:38,578
Cha-young.

308
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:41,915
Cha-young.

309
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,128
Hey, Cha-young.

310
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:49,547
Weren't you coming back tomorrow?

311
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:54,010
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

312
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:56,888
Why?

313
00:25:56,972 --> 00:26:00,642
Mr. Yu Min-chul, the researcher,
and my father passed away.

314
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:02,936
-Was it a coincidence?
-What do you mean?

315
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:06,231
Did Babel Pharmaceuticals scheme this
along with Wusang?

316
00:26:06,314 --> 00:26:07,691
Without my knowing.

317
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:12,737
I know you're not really yourself
right now,

318
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:15,365
but such a conjecture is inexcusable.

319
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:19,119
-Come back first.
-Please process my resignation.

320
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:21,788
Come on, Cha-young. What's with you?

321
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:25,417
Let her do what she wants. Let her resign.

322
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:31,923
There's no use keeping a hound
that bites the hand that feeds.

323
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:38,346
There are no bad dogs to begin with.

324
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:41,433
-It's mostly their owners' fault.
-Be honest.

325
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:45,437
You planned to double-cross us,
but things went awry, right?

326
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:51,651
That's such a lousy story you have.

327
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:55,947
I was going easy on you until now
since we were a family.

328
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:58,366
But not anymore.

329
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,285
Thank you for the encouragement.

330
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:06,458
Cha-young!

331
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:09,419
Are you seriously leaving?
You have to return everything.

332
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:12,630
Your car keys,
and what about your studio apartment?

333
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:18,553
Here are my car keys.

334
00:27:18,636 --> 00:27:20,722
I'll give you my house key
after I move out.

335
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:22,557
Cha-young.

336
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,100
Know your place.

337
00:27:36,863 --> 00:27:38,907
I don't even have to lift a finger

338
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:41,951
to snap your neck like a twig.

339
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:48,958
Thank you for motivating me.

340
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:01,679
ATTORNEY HONG CHA-YOUNG

341
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:05,350
Hey, you're overreacting.

342
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:06,684
This isn't right.

343
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:08,395
You're being awfully casual today.

344
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:10,480
That's not the issue here.

345
00:28:10,563 --> 00:28:11,564
Cha-young.

346
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:13,775
No, I won't let you go.

347
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,403
Tell the boss

348
00:28:17,904 --> 00:28:20,323
that you made a mistake
because you were grieving.

349
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:22,325
And beg.

350
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:24,786
Koreans forgive you when you beg, right?

351
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:29,749
If you're too out of line,
even begging doesn't work.

352
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:31,709
No. Still, don't go.

353
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:36,047
I'll help you with everything.

354
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:37,340
I…

355
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:39,926
I can be your spy. Like James Bond.

356
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:41,845
Joon-woo.

357
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:44,139
Cha-young.

358
00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:51,646
You're like glue.
Move. I need to move out of my house.

359
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,231
No.

360
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:56,151
Cha-young. If you leave like this,

361
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:58,695
I'll never see you again. Never.

362
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:01,990
Make your choice.

363
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:13,376
Cha-young!

364
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:18,381
It's over for us. Over!

365
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:05,386
The public has shown great interest

366
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:08,348
in Babel Pharmaceuticals' new drug,
RDU-90.

367
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:11,434
Thanks to its lasting effects
and the lack of side effects,

368
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:14,771
it was known to be an innovative drug
since it was under clinical trial.

369
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:17,899
After learning about its upcoming release,

370
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:22,362
many countries such as Vietnam
and Mongolia have shown interest.

371
00:30:22,445 --> 00:30:26,407
Babel Pharmaceuticals is willing
to do anything with open arms

372
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:30,119
if it's pertaining to the people's health.

373
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:34,457
During the testing period,
the company was involved in a lawsuit.

374
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:37,210
However, after the illegal activities

375
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:41,047
of a righteous civil rights lawyer
were exposed,

376
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:43,883
the manufacturing of RDU-90
was resumed once again.

377
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:49,138
Through this incident, we were able
to see clearly who was in the wrong.

378
00:30:57,063 --> 00:31:00,608
NAMDO AUNTIE'S RESTAURANT

379
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:05,864
DO NOT CROSS

380
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,210
How dare you?

381
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:07,550
How…

382
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:39,123
I need to ask you a favor.

383
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:41,751
I keep asking you for favors.

384
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:44,045
Goodness, don't say that.

385
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:49,926
If it wasn't for you, I would have been
compost in a vineyard in Milano.

386
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:53,262
Tell me what you need.

387
00:33:31,592 --> 00:33:34,721
Damn it! What the hell is that?

388
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:38,683
Who the hell could've done that?

389
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:43,855
What is certain is that
it wasn't the work of some small fry.

390
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:46,149
I agree.

391
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:48,234
It's Chairman Jang's house
for Pete's sake.

392
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:53,031
It's not easy to break into his room
with the security system and the guards.

393
00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:57,785
I really don't know any opponents of ours

394
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:59,662
who'd hire such experts.

395
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:00,997
What are you doing there?

396
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,165
-What?
-Sorry?

397
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:03,249
REP. ATTORNEY

398
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:05,752
Oh, I'm formatting and reinstalling.

399
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:08,463
The computer was damaged by a virus.

400
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:11,674
-Why not call the tech team?
-He's not good at his job,

401
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:13,843
-but quite tech-savvy.
-Right.

402
00:34:13,926 --> 00:34:15,511
Get it done and leave already.

403
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:19,849
My goodness.

404
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:24,687
We need to give Chairman Jang something
if we want to placate him.

405
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:28,524
How about her for the time being?

406
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:30,943
-Who?
-Someone who has a motive.

407
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:33,112
Her?

408
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:37,575
Come on, that's not right. How could you?

409
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:39,786
God, you're really evil.

410
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:43,706
We believe Ms. Hong Cha-young
is the most ideal suspect.

411
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:47,585
I knew it was that lawyer!

412
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:51,589
She's blaming my company
for her father's death!

413
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:56,135
Whatever. Put her behind bars
this instant.

414
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,525
All right.

415
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:13,945
Keep smiling.

416
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:18,825
Pretty soon, you'll be shedding
tears of blood.

417
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:22,161
NOTHING'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR BABEL

418
00:35:42,598 --> 00:35:43,558
Dad.

419
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:48,062
I don't think I can be a wonderful lawyer
like you.

420
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:51,983
But, instead,
I'll be one hell of a tenacious lawyer.

421
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:03,119
I hope we get along.

422
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:06,330
I hope we get along.

423
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:10,334
Sir, I hope we get along.

424
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:12,837
I hope we get along.

425
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,338
You're so beautiful.

426
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:16,215
-I hope we get along.
-Okay.

427
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:18,259
You're also beautiful.

428
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:31,689
Law Firm Jipuragi has come back to life!

429
00:36:37,403 --> 00:36:39,864
Feel free to ask me for help.

430
00:36:39,947 --> 00:36:45,036
Does this mean we'll resume
what we've been working on?

431
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:48,247
Yes. I will continue my dad's work
regarding the lawsuit

432
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:50,082
related to this building's tenants.

433
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:53,628
Then what about Mr. Cassano?

434
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:56,964
Forget about him.
He can do whatever he likes.

435
00:36:57,924 --> 00:36:59,592
We have her now.

436
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:02,094
I hope we get along.

437
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:05,890
Congratulations.

438
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:10,853
In any case,
I'll help you guys from now on.

439
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:15,066
Word has it that you were working
in opposition to your father.

440
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:19,028
That's all in the past.

441
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:21,614
I've been born again.

442
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:25,952
I will fight against corruption
and injustice while obeying the law.

443
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:28,162
With warmth and benevolence,

444
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:31,165
-I will embrace you--
-Ms. Hong Cha-young.

445
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:33,960
Hello, sir. How may I help you?

446
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:38,214
You're under arrest
for trespassing and blackmail.

447
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:40,716
-Let's make this easy.
-What do you mean?

448
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,760
Stay still.

449
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:44,637
-Ms. Hong.
-What are you doing?

450
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,514
-Come on.
-Don't cause a scene.

451
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:47,890
-No!
-Stop.

452
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:49,141
Come on!

453
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:52,270
I've been home since 7 p.m. last night.

454
00:37:52,853 --> 00:37:56,399
For now, we can't verify
that you went home and stayed there.

455
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:59,568
Then check my phone's location
during the time of the incident.

456
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:02,154
Then you'll be able to verify that.

457
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:04,740
You could've left your phone at home
and gone out.

458
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:11,205
Are you saying I singlehandedly penetrated
Chairman Jang's security,

459
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:14,250
broke into his bedroom,
and put 50 syringes in his pillow?

460
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:16,335
Do you think I'm Black Widow?

461
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:17,962
-She was arrested?
-Yes.

462
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:20,172
They suddenly came and took her.

463
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:23,843
Did she break into someone's house
and threaten them?

464
00:38:23,926 --> 00:38:24,760
She did.

465
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,972
How did you know that?

466
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:31,017
I didn't. I was just guessing.

467
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:33,561
I can't get her out.

468
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:36,314
-So if you could help--
-She's competent enough

469
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:39,066
to get out of there before evening.
Don't worry.

470
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,484
Wait, sir.

471
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:42,570
We'd appreciate a bit of help.

472
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:43,654
Please?

473
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:47,533
I…

474
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:52,038
I have an opera to watch.

475
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:54,248
What? An opera?

476
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:16,020
I don't need to worry about her.
She'll get out on her own.

477
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:20,775
AM I EVIL?

478
00:39:30,117 --> 00:39:32,828
"If I am indeed evil,

479
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:36,665
it's because…

480
00:39:39,001 --> 00:39:40,378
of you."

481
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:05,694
I called the police station,
and things aren't looking good.

482
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:08,989
Why can't she get out of there?

483
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:11,409
Jeez.

484
00:40:15,162 --> 00:40:16,664
Come on!

485
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:21,877
Can you please be quiet? Please?

486
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:27,299
Her records are clean,
and her alibi checks out.

487
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:31,178
Her second-floor neighbor confirmed
seeing her through the window.

488
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:32,847
This is driving me crazy.

489
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:35,850
Wusang already paid us.

490
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:38,853
First, let's order some breakfast for her.

491
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:40,271
Okay.

492
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:55,411
-Cha-young.
-What? Hey.

493
00:40:56,996 --> 00:41:00,207
You should've called sooner.
Wasn't I your only hope?

494
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:02,251
No, you were the 57th person I called.

495
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:03,377
What?

496
00:41:06,505 --> 00:41:07,673
Who are you?

497
00:41:10,092 --> 00:41:11,427
I'm from Law Firm Wusang.

498
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:13,512
I'm Lawyer Jang Joon-woo.

499
00:41:14,096 --> 00:41:16,724
Why did you come here, sir?

500
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:18,726
I'll sue if you've broken any rules

501
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:20,811
-while investigating.
-Stop embarrassing me.

502
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:22,855
Do you have proof?

503
00:41:22,938 --> 00:41:24,482
You don't, right? Right?

504
00:41:25,232 --> 00:41:27,109
That's enough.

505
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:28,486
So why is she still here?

506
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:30,946
I want to see your commanding officer.

507
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,239
This instant.

508
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:36,160
You should know better
than to throw a tantrum like this!

509
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:37,536
"A tantrum"?

510
00:41:41,123 --> 00:41:42,958
Did he just curse at me?

511
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:45,920
Yes, he did.
He pretty much said, "You son of a…"

512
00:41:47,546 --> 00:41:49,590
-How dare you?
-Here's your proof.

513
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:59,350
This is CCTV footage taken from
a convenience store in front of her house.

514
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:03,771
It shows that she came home from work

515
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:06,357
at 6:27 p.m. two nights ago

516
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:09,527
and stayed home until 8:12 a.m.
yesterday morning.

517
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:10,903
And who are you?

518
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:14,323
I'm a lawyer and her legal representative.

519
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:16,367
What's gotten into him?

520
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:22,790
Now, show me a irrefutable proof
that she had an accomplice.

521
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:29,088
If you don't have anything,

522
00:42:30,464 --> 00:42:32,591
she has every right to be released.

523
00:42:33,467 --> 00:42:35,970
I was going to get you out of here. Right?

524
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:38,889
Do you have proof?

525
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:41,976
Do you?

526
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:56,991
Gosh, I knew it.

527
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:58,909
I'm hungry now that I feel better.

528
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:01,036
Order me some food before I go.

529
00:43:03,205 --> 00:43:04,957
Who ordered the cheeseburgers
from BurgerJura?

530
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,292
Here!

531
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:14,383
Please calm down

532
00:43:15,509 --> 00:43:17,386
and have some food.

533
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:20,514
You should've ordered some seolleongtang.

534
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:24,768
Did you only bring one ketchup?

535
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:26,770
Enjoy your meal.

536
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:37,114
I was going to have that.

537
00:43:37,197 --> 00:43:39,199
Never mind. Go ahead.

538
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:41,785
Order some more burgers.

539
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:46,707
-Isn't it too greasy?
-No.

540
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:52,838
I just can't have fries without ketchup.

541
00:43:52,921 --> 00:43:54,298
It's so greasy.

542
00:43:54,381 --> 00:43:56,717
Why didn't I think
of that convenience store?

543
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:02,640
POLICE

544
00:44:03,557 --> 00:44:04,683
Yes, we're done here.

545
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:09,563
Okay. I'll leave as soon as I'm done here.

546
00:44:15,235 --> 00:44:16,987
It's fine. Yes.

547
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:19,573
I'll see you later. All right.

548
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:25,037
Tell me the truth. It was you, wasn't it?

549
00:44:25,704 --> 00:44:29,249
You only came out of guilt
because they arrested me. Right?

550
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:31,418
You felt guilty.

551
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:32,878
What are you talking about?

552
00:44:35,422 --> 00:44:37,549
Lawyer Vincenzo Cassano?

553
00:44:41,428 --> 00:44:45,474
You're the first Korean
to pronounce my name correctly.

554
00:44:47,142 --> 00:44:50,813
I used to be her assistant back in Wusang.
I'm Jang Joon-woo.

555
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:53,941
How do you know me?

556
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:58,237
Because I did a background check
on you for Cha-young.

557
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:03,534
I was relieved to see
that you had no priors.

558
00:45:04,993 --> 00:45:06,203
I should get going.

559
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:08,539
-Go. I'm leaving too.
-What?

560
00:45:08,622 --> 00:45:10,082
Wait up!

561
00:45:10,165 --> 00:45:11,625
But I just got here.

562
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:14,378
You can't just leave.

563
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:17,131
Gosh, it hurts.

564
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:19,466
I should get to work.

565
00:45:25,472 --> 00:45:26,890
Welcome.

566
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:31,186
A double shot of espresso to have here.

567
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:34,398
Just have a cool, iced Americano.

568
00:45:37,818 --> 00:45:41,071
In Italy, Americano is no better
than sewage waste.

569
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:44,616
One iced sewage waste for me.

570
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:56,128
I'm the most sharp-witted person in Asia,

571
00:45:56,211 --> 00:45:57,546
so come clean already.

572
00:46:01,884 --> 00:46:04,803
You must be the best
at feigning ignorance.

573
00:46:04,887 --> 00:46:08,515
Don't you think this is a bit harsh
after what you put me through?

574
00:46:09,516 --> 00:46:11,685
I thought you'd find your way out.

575
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:18,192
I apologize.

576
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:21,945
-I'm sorry for the inconvenience.
-Are you really?

577
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:25,824
It's as if you're apologizing
for canceling my song at a karaoke.

578
00:46:25,908 --> 00:46:29,161
I get pretty upset
when someone does that to me.

579
00:46:29,244 --> 00:46:30,746
Why the hell did you do it?

580
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:32,122
Because I was furious.

581
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:33,749
-What?
-That's how I operate.

582
00:46:33,832 --> 00:46:35,375
"An eye for an eye."

583
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:39,588
Who do you think you are? Hammurabi?

584
00:46:40,172 --> 00:46:42,508
"An eye for an eye," my foot.

585
00:46:42,591 --> 00:46:44,718
I had to suffer because of you.

586
00:46:44,801 --> 00:46:46,261
I'll be careful from now on.

587
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:47,721
There's more?

588
00:46:48,805 --> 00:46:50,140
Close down your law firm.

589
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:54,811
Who are you to tell me to do that?

590
00:46:54,895 --> 00:46:57,689
Don't involve yourself with Wusang
or the Babel Group.

591
00:46:57,773 --> 00:47:00,734
I refuse to accept such stupid advice.

592
00:47:06,198 --> 00:47:09,159
Do you know who called your father
before he died?

593
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:12,704
The caller ID was RDU.

594
00:47:13,288 --> 00:47:14,790
It was Mr. Yu Min-chul.

595
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:17,501
That's when I knew

596
00:47:17,584 --> 00:47:20,045
that he and your father were connected.

597
00:47:20,128 --> 00:47:22,464
Why didn't you tell me this sooner?

598
00:47:22,548 --> 00:47:24,633
That's such important information.

599
00:47:24,716 --> 00:47:27,427
-I could've brought down Babel and--
-Nothing will change.

600
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:32,307
You may be able to prove
that Mr. Hong and Mr. Yu were connected.

601
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:36,103
But the fact that someone intentionally
killed them off?

602
00:47:37,312 --> 00:47:38,647
You can't prove that.

603
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:42,568
It will take time, but it's possible
if I gather the evidence.

604
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:48,699
You should know best…

605
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:53,537
that Wusang and Babel are invincible.

606
00:47:56,373 --> 00:47:58,750
Giving up on a hopeless war will give you

607
00:47:59,751 --> 00:48:01,086
a new opportunity.

608
00:48:13,932 --> 00:48:15,100
Yes.

609
00:48:15,183 --> 00:48:18,562
If I can't do this alone,
I'm sure someone will help me.

610
00:48:21,481 --> 00:48:23,066
I've helped out so many people.

611
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:36,538
What's this? Gosh, I'm sorry.

612
00:48:43,795 --> 00:48:47,007
Put your faith in God.
He will show you the way.

613
00:48:54,056 --> 00:48:57,267
The person you have called is unavailable,
so please leave a voicemail.

614
00:48:57,351 --> 00:49:00,103
Your call will be charged after the beep.

615
00:49:06,026 --> 00:49:07,235
Cha-young.

616
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:10,614
A rumor's been going around
that you were on Ms. Choi's blacklist.

617
00:49:10,697 --> 00:49:12,658
Who do you think is going to help you?

618
00:49:12,741 --> 00:49:14,534
I don't want to cut my career short.

619
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:19,331
Gosh!

620
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:26,421
What is this about?

621
00:49:30,842 --> 00:49:31,718
LAW FIRM JIPURAGI

622
00:49:37,557 --> 00:49:39,976
They're all similar lawsuits
that I've won.

623
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:42,187
Real estate redemption
for small businesses

624
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:45,315
that have lost their ownership
due to large companies.

625
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:48,235
I did it without Wusang's knowledge.

626
00:49:49,111 --> 00:49:50,445
I got a hefty sum for them.

627
00:49:55,784 --> 00:49:57,911
I'll help you get back Geumga Plaza.

628
00:49:57,994 --> 00:49:59,996
I don't care why you want it,

629
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:02,541
but I just know
that you need it desperately.

630
00:50:02,624 --> 00:50:04,793
No, you need it at all costs.

631
00:50:04,876 --> 00:50:06,545
You're the real owner, right?

632
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:16,430
Why are you giving me this offer?

633
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:18,557
Let me in on whatever you're scheming.

634
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:19,891
Why should I?

635
00:50:19,975 --> 00:50:22,561
Shouldn't I be the one
who's upset the most?

636
00:50:24,396 --> 00:50:26,106
It was my dad who died wrongfully.

637
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:32,404
Even still,

638
00:50:32,487 --> 00:50:34,948
I can't let you.
It's not something a lawyer should do.

639
00:50:37,743 --> 00:50:41,705
Right now, I'm not speaking to you
as a lawyer,

640
00:50:41,788 --> 00:50:44,833
but as Hong Yu-chan's undutiful daughter.

641
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:56,928
Promise me you'll quit
if you cause a hindrance.

642
00:50:58,096 --> 00:50:59,139
Deal.

643
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:03,435
Grab one.

644
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:06,897
-Why?
-We'll clink these instead of glasses.

645
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:08,857
-No, thanks.
-Hurry up.

646
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:11,026
Don't you want Geumga Plaza back?

647
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:22,370
Are you ready to turn the tables on them?

648
00:51:56,488 --> 00:52:00,116
Gosh, had those brakes not malfunctioned,

649
00:52:00,992 --> 00:52:03,829
he wouldn't have died,
and you wouldn't have gotten injured.

650
00:52:04,329 --> 00:52:06,331
They should do a better job
assembling cars.

651
00:52:06,915 --> 00:52:11,294
You're just as insincere as you were
when you were interrogated.

652
00:52:12,254 --> 00:52:14,881
I'm here to serve my time, aren't I?

653
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:17,259
Isn't that because

654
00:52:17,342 --> 00:52:20,679
you made and circulated videos
that sexually exploited minors?

655
00:52:20,762 --> 00:52:23,473
Why would you bring that up right now?

656
00:52:23,557 --> 00:52:26,685
Did they promise to reduce your sentence
if you killed him

657
00:52:26,768 --> 00:52:29,020
-and disguised it as an accident?
-What?

658
00:52:29,604 --> 00:52:31,940
That's ridiculous.

659
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:33,567
But then again,

660
00:52:34,651 --> 00:52:39,114
Wusang could give you a sentence
of two years or less

661
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:43,201
thanks to Korea's lousy
and ludicrous sentencing guidelines.

662
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:47,163
I have no idea what you're on about.

663
00:52:47,747 --> 00:52:51,459
I'm going to stand trial for what I did.

664
00:52:56,673 --> 00:52:58,091
Shut up and listen carefully.

665
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:03,179
Tell me the truth from now on.

666
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:06,641
If you don't, you'll die tonight

667
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:10,228
just by brushing shoulders with someone.

668
00:53:16,985 --> 00:53:17,944
What?

669
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:20,530
Did you think I'd be intimidated?

670
00:53:22,991 --> 00:53:24,117
Who ordered you

671
00:53:24,618 --> 00:53:26,244
to kill him with the truck?

672
00:53:34,419 --> 00:53:35,795
This is your last chance.

673
00:53:37,297 --> 00:53:39,966
Who ordered you?

674
00:53:42,093 --> 00:53:44,262
Spill it, you asshole.

675
00:53:51,311 --> 00:53:52,562
Let's go.

676
00:53:56,775 --> 00:53:57,734
Wait.

677
00:54:04,282 --> 00:54:05,408
Mr. Pyo.

678
00:54:06,618 --> 00:54:07,953
I don't know his full name.

679
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:14,459
Mr. Pyo?

680
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:16,544
Just him?

681
00:54:16,628 --> 00:54:19,005
There was someone who looked like
his boss,

682
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:20,507
but I only know his number.

683
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:22,008
What does he do?

684
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:23,301
I don't know.

685
00:54:23,385 --> 00:54:27,263
He came to the police station
where I was at and promised me

686
00:54:27,347 --> 00:54:29,891
that Wusang would reduce my sentence
if I did as told.

687
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:33,144
-I'm going to kill you all.
-I'm sorry.

688
00:54:34,604 --> 00:54:35,647
I'm truly sorry.

689
00:54:36,982 --> 00:54:39,067
-What's the number?
-Sorry?

690
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:56,626
That's enough. Let's go.

691
00:55:01,756 --> 00:55:03,925
He's the one who did it.

692
00:55:06,761 --> 00:55:09,097
But I can't do anything to him.

693
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:16,354
I can't leave here empty-handed.

694
00:55:28,116 --> 00:55:29,451
Mr. Lee!

695
00:55:30,744 --> 00:55:32,954
Thank you so much for your cooperation.

696
00:55:34,247 --> 00:55:38,543
I'm very relieved to hear
that you'll side with us!

697
00:55:38,626 --> 00:55:39,878
What are you doing?

698
00:55:42,088 --> 00:55:44,424
We'll re-investigate the incident

699
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:46,176
according to your testimony

700
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:48,720
and get to the bottom of this.

701
00:55:48,803 --> 00:55:50,346
Why are you doing this?

702
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:52,474
That's not true. He's lying.

703
00:55:52,557 --> 00:55:53,850
Mr. Lee!

704
00:55:54,809 --> 00:55:57,812
Your sense of justice will prevail.
Thank you so much!

705
00:55:57,896 --> 00:55:59,064
-What?
-Let's go.

706
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:04,319
-Wait.
-Thank you.

707
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:08,156
Wait! Hey!

708
00:56:08,823 --> 00:56:09,908
Damn it!

709
00:56:23,421 --> 00:56:26,508
Is this how lawyers in Italy
get their jobs done?

710
00:56:27,175 --> 00:56:31,012
There are more heinous criminals there
than here.

711
00:56:32,097 --> 00:56:34,140
I'm very satisfied right now.

712
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:36,684
I think we have great teamwork as well.

713
00:56:37,393 --> 00:56:38,853
You didn't chip in at all.

714
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:40,438
What do you mean?

715
00:56:40,522 --> 00:56:43,358
I stayed emotional
and maintained the tension.

716
00:56:43,441 --> 00:56:45,068
I said all the lines.

717
00:56:45,151 --> 00:56:46,653
Talking is important,

718
00:56:46,736 --> 00:56:48,905
but setting the mood is also important.

719
00:56:48,988 --> 00:56:50,406
How could you not know that?

720
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:54,119
Anyway, I loved the noir vibe as well.

721
00:56:54,953 --> 00:56:57,497
That wasn't even the tip of the iceberg.

722
00:56:58,706 --> 00:56:59,707
Don't tell me

723
00:57:00,834 --> 00:57:02,127
you'll shoot someone.

724
00:57:03,128 --> 00:57:05,088
You can't own guns in Korea.

725
00:57:05,588 --> 00:57:06,673
That won't happen.

726
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:08,675
Good. We're not filming a movie.

727
00:57:10,218 --> 00:57:12,137
Let's go find Mr. Pyo.

728
00:57:17,851 --> 00:57:19,978
What do you mean? An unexpected situation?

729
00:57:20,562 --> 00:57:21,396
Yes.

730
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:24,607
It looks like the truck driver
is going to jump ship.

731
00:57:24,691 --> 00:57:25,859
Elaborate.

732
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:30,572
Hong Cha-young and that Italian lawyer
stopped by.

733
00:57:30,655 --> 00:57:32,657
It seemed like they were colluding.

734
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:33,950
Damn it.

735
00:57:57,974 --> 00:57:58,975
I'm sorry.

736
00:58:01,853 --> 00:58:03,480
Sorry doesn't cut it.

737
00:58:03,563 --> 00:58:05,607
You've dislocated my shoulder.

738
00:58:06,274 --> 00:58:08,193
You'll die tonight

739
00:58:08,276 --> 00:58:10,028
just by brushing shoulders with someone.

740
00:58:10,945 --> 00:58:13,740
How dare you ignore me when I'm talking?

741
00:58:16,743 --> 00:58:19,621
-Get him!
-Come here!

742
00:58:25,752 --> 00:58:28,963
-Run!
-Run! Hurry!

743
00:58:29,047 --> 00:58:30,048
Damn it!

744
00:58:39,724 --> 00:58:41,768
Okay. I see.

745
00:58:43,228 --> 00:58:44,562
Thank you for telling me.

746
00:59:05,625 --> 00:59:06,584
Lee Chung-il

747
00:59:08,586 --> 00:59:11,798
got himself into a fight
and was stabbed to death.

748
00:59:23,017 --> 00:59:24,102
Are you glad?

749
00:59:27,939 --> 00:59:30,358
It's annoying, and I feel like shit.

750
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:33,778
This isn't what I imagined.

751
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:36,781
You can quit now if you want.

752
00:59:36,864 --> 00:59:37,865
No.

753
00:59:39,617 --> 00:59:40,952
I stand by my decision.

754
00:59:43,913 --> 00:59:45,665
Let's promise one thing.

755
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:49,627
We'll do whatever it takes,

756
00:59:50,837 --> 00:59:53,381
but let's not do anything
that takes people's lives.

757
01:00:16,779 --> 01:00:18,865
Mr. Pyo's full name is Pyo Hyeok-pil.

758
01:00:19,532 --> 01:00:21,701
I've located his whereabouts. See you.

759
01:00:21,784 --> 01:00:22,785
Let me come with you.

760
01:00:22,869 --> 01:00:24,787
Stay here. He may be dangerous.

761
01:00:24,871 --> 01:00:26,623
Victory and quantity go hand in hand.

762
01:00:27,332 --> 01:00:28,791
There's no harm in me coming.

763
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:29,834
Sir.

764
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:36,549
Let me come with you.

765
01:00:38,426 --> 01:00:42,430
I've finally learned about your plan.

766
01:00:44,015 --> 01:00:46,184
What are you doing there?

767
01:00:46,267 --> 01:00:48,811
I drank during the day
and fell asleep here.

768
01:00:48,895 --> 01:00:51,147
You two woke me up.

769
01:00:51,230 --> 01:00:52,231
You heard everything?

770
01:00:52,315 --> 01:00:55,777
Yes, but I didn't mean to eavesdrop.

771
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:59,781
Anyway, I'd like to avenge Mr. Hong.

772
01:01:01,366 --> 01:01:02,617
I'll do anything.

773
01:01:23,054 --> 01:01:25,223
I've kept my skills hidden
for a long time.

774
01:01:27,058 --> 01:01:30,019
Just tell me if you need them.

775
01:01:31,437 --> 01:01:32,397
Skills?

776
01:02:54,312 --> 01:02:58,149
When you make dirty money,
you're bound to lose them gambling.

777
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:05,156
Hey. Were you talking to me?

778
01:03:09,076 --> 01:03:11,245
You're the only one here
who abetted murder.

779
01:03:15,374 --> 01:03:16,542
Who are you?

780
01:03:21,214 --> 01:03:23,758
I hate to admit it,
but I'm someone who needs you.

781
01:04:01,546 --> 01:04:02,755
The floor is filthy.

782
01:04:03,464 --> 01:04:06,676
My hands will get dirty moving him.

783
01:04:08,219 --> 01:04:09,887
You two take care of this.

784
01:04:09,971 --> 01:04:13,140
Please hold his arms,
and I'll hold his legs.

785
01:04:15,142 --> 01:04:17,895
I don't think I've recovered fully
from my head injury.

786
01:04:19,021 --> 01:04:22,108
Right, you need to recuperate.

787
01:04:30,616 --> 01:04:33,411
PUNGMI RESTAURANT

788
01:04:33,494 --> 01:04:34,871
-Yes?
-Hello, sir.

789
01:04:34,954 --> 01:04:36,372
You should come here right now.

790
01:04:36,455 --> 01:04:37,748
What's wrong?

791
01:04:37,832 --> 01:04:41,502
The prison guard who tipped us off
is demanding more money.

792
01:04:41,586 --> 01:04:44,505
I've tried talking to him,
but he just won't listen.

793
01:04:45,089 --> 01:04:47,300
Damn it. Where are you right now?

794
01:04:57,393 --> 01:04:59,395
Hey, where's that guard?

795
01:04:59,478 --> 01:05:00,980
We're in huge trouble.

796
01:05:01,063 --> 01:05:02,273
What do you mean?

797
01:05:15,703 --> 01:05:16,662
He's not dead, is he?

798
01:05:18,289 --> 01:05:19,790
His stomach is moving.

799
01:05:21,334 --> 01:05:23,461
He has a bit of abdominal fat.

800
01:05:28,341 --> 01:05:29,425
Come on.

801
01:05:48,986 --> 01:05:50,279
This is a Russian pistol.

802
01:05:51,864 --> 01:05:53,824
Tokarev TT-33.

803
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:59,747
Neither the military
nor the NIS uses this model.

804
01:06:01,248 --> 01:06:03,626
So how did a civilian obtain this gun?

805
01:06:10,299 --> 01:06:13,344
Then again, you both served
in the military's intelligence division.

806
01:06:15,012 --> 01:06:17,598
It must be a cakewalk
to obtain a gun illegally.

807
01:06:24,814 --> 01:06:26,232
Hurry up and answer me.

808
01:06:26,315 --> 01:06:29,860
Who ordered you to kill
Mr. Hong and Mr. Yu?

809
01:06:45,042 --> 01:06:47,420
I hate wasting time as much as I hate

810
01:06:48,921 --> 01:06:50,297
uncooked macaroni.

811
01:06:50,881 --> 01:06:52,466
If you refuse to spill,

812
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:55,177
you'll end up just like Lee Chung-il did.

813
01:06:56,721 --> 01:06:59,098
Nod your head if you're willing to talk,

814
01:06:59,181 --> 01:07:00,933
and I'll spare you.

815
01:07:03,227 --> 01:07:05,771
If you don't talk,
I'll ram this into your head.

816
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:06,897
Talk!

817
01:07:23,330 --> 01:07:24,874
This is your last chance.

818
01:07:27,376 --> 01:07:28,461
Who was it?

819
01:07:31,005 --> 01:07:33,424
Tell us. Hurry!

820
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,242
Sir.

821
01:08:00,951 --> 01:08:02,453
Be careful

822
01:08:03,829 --> 01:08:04,997
with that gun.

823
01:08:14,507 --> 01:08:17,468
You have to talk now! This isn't a joke!

824
01:08:17,551 --> 01:08:18,594
Hurry!

825
01:08:43,786 --> 01:08:45,538
Did you think I wouldn't shoot?

826
01:08:46,497 --> 01:08:48,249
A gun is a murder weapon.

827
01:08:50,334 --> 01:08:52,795
Why did you do that?

828
01:08:53,712 --> 01:08:56,048
We agreed not to kill anyone.

829
01:08:58,300 --> 01:08:59,385
What if

830
01:09:01,303 --> 01:09:03,347
he tells everyone about this?

831
01:09:12,523 --> 01:09:13,983
In that case,

832
01:09:17,361 --> 01:09:18,320
we should kill him.

RESTRICTED NUMBER

837
01:10:52,873 --> 01:10:53,832
Yes?

838
01:10:53,916 --> 01:10:56,752
There's only one way humans are born,

839
01:10:57,544 --> 01:11:00,547
-but there are countless ways to die.
-Who are you?

840
01:11:00,631 --> 01:11:03,467
-Do you even know who I am?
-Ms. Choi, I wonder which way

841
01:11:03,550 --> 01:11:06,220
-would suit you the best.
-Who the hell are you?

842
01:11:06,303 --> 01:11:08,347
Someone you should fear.

843
01:11:16,438 --> 01:11:18,232
It looks familiar, doesn't it?

844
01:11:19,066 --> 01:11:21,610
Why are you doing this?
At least tell me the reason.

845
01:11:22,152 --> 01:11:24,321
The owners of those bloody clothes told me

846
01:11:25,322 --> 01:11:29,326
that you ordered them to kill
Mr. Hong and Mr. Yu.

847
01:11:29,410 --> 01:11:31,203
That's ludicrous.

848
01:11:31,287 --> 01:11:32,788
Who'd believe them?

849
01:11:32,871 --> 01:11:34,707
I don't care what people believe.

850
01:11:35,541 --> 01:11:36,917
All that matters is that I do.

851
01:11:37,001 --> 01:11:38,752
It really has nothing to do with me.

852
01:11:45,384 --> 01:11:46,802
I'm a patient man,

853
01:11:48,137 --> 01:11:50,681
but I'm afraid I can't say the same
for that driver.

854
01:11:57,980 --> 01:11:59,440
What do you want from me?

855
01:12:04,028 --> 01:12:05,988
Why is negotiating so difficult?

856
01:12:06,071 --> 01:12:07,406
What do you want?

857
01:12:07,489 --> 01:12:10,617
Restore your victim Mr. Hong's honor

858
01:12:10,701 --> 01:12:13,495
and those of the late test subjects
by tomorrow.

859
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:15,122
To do that,

860
01:12:16,290 --> 01:12:19,251
you'll have to come clean
about what you did first.

861
01:12:21,628 --> 01:12:23,339
Just kill me instead.

862
01:12:23,422 --> 01:12:26,925
Restoring their honor matters
much more than your worthless lives.

863
01:12:27,009 --> 01:12:28,969
Do you think I'll listen to you?

864
01:12:32,473 --> 01:12:34,141
That's up to you.

865
01:12:34,975 --> 01:12:38,187
But you should remember
that freedom comes with a price.

866
01:13:20,396 --> 01:13:22,022
That darn punk…

867
01:13:23,607 --> 01:13:25,234
You better stay well hidden.

868
01:13:26,193 --> 01:13:29,738
The moment I find you,
you're as good as dead.

-There's a fire!
-Call 911!

882
01:18:00,592 --> 01:18:02,052
Hurry!

883
01:18:02,135 --> 01:18:03,804
-Get out of there!
-Put out the fire!

884
01:18:04,638 --> 01:18:08,684
Hurry up and call 911!

885
01:18:29,287 --> 01:18:32,416
Do you mind giving me a hand?

886
01:18:37,921 --> 01:18:39,464
One, two…

887
01:18:49,725 --> 01:18:51,643
You were almost late.

888
01:18:51,727 --> 01:18:53,478
You should've pulled him faster.

889
01:18:53,562 --> 01:18:56,815
It's not easy
to grab onto the piano string.

890
01:18:56,898 --> 01:18:59,484
Mr. Nam's former profession paid off.

891
01:18:59,568 --> 01:19:01,903
Who knew he used to be
a special effects makeup artist?

892
01:19:18,628 --> 01:19:20,130
I'll spare you,

893
01:19:21,965 --> 01:19:24,092
but you have to do as I say from now on.

894
01:19:24,801 --> 01:19:25,761
Okay.

895
01:19:26,928 --> 01:19:31,475
We need information on
Babel Pharmaceuticals' supply warehouse.

896
01:19:50,118 --> 01:19:51,328
It's not hard at all.

897
01:19:51,828 --> 01:19:54,664
I have a knack for turning the tables.

898
01:19:55,707 --> 01:19:57,959
Please trust me on this. I can win this.

899
01:20:36,414 --> 01:20:38,416
Sir! We're in trouble!

900
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,169
There's been a fire at our warehouse!

901
01:20:43,088 --> 01:20:44,089
Move it!

902
01:20:44,756 --> 01:20:47,717
-Hey!
-Watch out!

903
01:20:47,801 --> 01:20:49,928
-Over here!
-What are you doing?

904
01:20:54,558 --> 01:20:55,976
You should get out of here, sir

905
01:20:56,059 --> 01:20:59,145
-There may be toxic gases.
-Did you call 911?

906
01:20:59,229 --> 01:21:01,314
-They're on their way.
-What?

907
01:21:01,398 --> 01:21:04,734
What about the sprinklers?
Why is the fire spreading so much?

908
01:21:05,527 --> 01:21:06,570
Well…

909
01:21:12,993 --> 01:21:14,995
AN HOUR AGO

910
01:21:29,384 --> 01:21:31,678
-Run!
-Run!

911
01:21:31,761 --> 01:21:33,305
Let's get out of here!

912
01:21:33,388 --> 01:21:34,264
Let's go!

913
01:22:27,442 --> 01:22:28,485
Sir.

914
01:22:35,033 --> 01:22:38,078
I saw this coming!

915
01:22:38,787 --> 01:22:41,748
I'm certain that the bastards
who broke into my room did this!

916
01:22:42,248 --> 01:22:43,124
Damn it!

917
01:22:43,917 --> 01:22:46,461
I'll catch them myself

918
01:22:47,128 --> 01:22:49,422
and make them kneel before you!

919
01:22:49,506 --> 01:22:50,882
Shut up.

920
01:23:31,673 --> 01:23:32,799
That's incredible.

921
01:23:40,682 --> 01:23:42,058
Goodbye!

922
01:23:51,568 --> 01:23:53,528
How could they make something like this?

923
01:23:54,195 --> 01:23:57,282
I don't care if I go to prison.
I want to burn them down.

924
01:23:57,365 --> 01:23:59,409
All of the drugs!

925
01:24:16,509 --> 01:24:19,846
"Set, stars.

926
01:24:21,723 --> 01:24:24,350
At dawn, I will win.

927
01:24:25,935 --> 01:24:27,645
I will win.

928
01:24:29,814 --> 01:24:31,941
I will win."

929
01:25:14,984 --> 01:25:18,071
Mr. Jang might not be the real boss.

930
01:25:18,780 --> 01:25:20,448
Then who could it be?

931
01:25:21,032 --> 01:25:23,201
He must be Vincenzo.

932
01:25:25,495 --> 01:25:27,163
That's why we need to change our approach.

933
01:25:27,247 --> 01:25:30,708
We'll use the law and the court,
two things we know best.

934
01:25:30,792 --> 01:25:33,503
I'll take all the cases
related to the Babel Group.

935
01:25:33,586 --> 01:25:35,713
You have to follow my advice this time.

936
01:25:35,797 --> 01:25:38,842
I'm going to give you advice
on how to become a real villain.

937
01:25:38,925 --> 01:25:42,720
Cha-young. I can't keep going easy on you.

938
01:25:42,804 --> 01:25:44,806
You can't do that.
You'll be in deep trouble.

939
01:25:44,889 --> 01:25:48,351
Our goal is to keep fighting.

940
01:25:49,894 --> 01:25:54,816
