1
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:46,606
Ms. Hong.

2
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:50,819
Do you even want to win?

3
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:52,695
Definitely. Desperately.

4
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:03,540
Let's come up with a new witness.

5
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:07,585
We're already struggling as it is.
Where will we find a new one?

6
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:09,504
Me. Bring me in as a witness.

7
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:11,506
You?

8
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:15,176
To be a witness,
you must have direct ties to the case.

9
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:18,847
Just get me in the ring first.

10
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:21,474
If you do, I'll do the rest.

11
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:36,322
A while ago,

12
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:39,284
you promised to take my advice

13
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:41,494
if a situation demands it, right?

14
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:44,038
I did?

15
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:46,082
Yes, you did.

16
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:50,670
Now is the time.
Just do exactly what I tell you.

17
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:15,111
This is Vincenzo Cassano,
my surprise witness.

18
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,906
Vincenzo Cassano?

19
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:23,244
To be more exact,

20
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:27,999
he's a witness as well as an assailant.

21
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:31,669
What? An assailant?
That came out of nowhere.

22
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:35,298
He's the assailant that assaulted
employees of Babel Chemicals,

23
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:38,301
and the assault case is
relevant to this case.

24
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:42,472
You and I are the only ones
who know about the illegal activities

25
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:45,475
between Babel Chemicals
and Haemun Medical Center.

26
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:49,729
So you can get into the ring
as a surprise witness.

27
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:52,815
It won't work if the defendant
rejects your request.

28
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,318
Right. So we do need another plan.

29
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:07,080
Then, I must be a witness
that they cannot reject.

30
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:09,582
An assailant who has his hands on

31
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:11,918
a vital pieace of evidence.

32
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:17,173
I'm so sick of those victims' families.

33
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:20,885
Tell me about it.
They should've accepted the deal.

34
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:24,347
Those goddamn bastards are trying
to get more money out of this.

35
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:27,517
Hey!

36
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:34,399
You're the head of
the New Materials Development.

37
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:37,068
You're the team leader and
the associate team leader, right?

38
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:38,152
Who are you?

39
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:40,655
You blamed the researchers
for their illnesses,

40
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:44,325
but BLSD was leaked because of
the poor sewage disposal system.

41
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:45,994
What are you talking about?

42
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:48,913
Are you a reporter?

43
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:51,249
Do you know that guy?

44
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,293
-No.
-Me, neither.

45
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:56,337
-I'm going to beat you up.
-You bastard.

46
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:02,176
Hey! Damn it.

47
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,162
He's an advisor to the plaintiff
and assaulted the employees.

48
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:30,955
I refuse to let him testify.

49
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,458
Babel Chemicals did not equip their lab

50
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:37,420
with the proper sewage disposal system
for the toxic agent, BLSD, to cut costs.

51
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:40,798
As a result, the researchers
were exposed to BLSD.

52
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:42,967
-Your Honor.
-However, the company

53
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:46,971
distorted the truth, blaming
the researchers' past health problems.

54
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:49,265
The court has not allowed you to testify.

55
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:51,768
And you weren't even sworn in.
What are you doing?

56
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:52,769
Your Honor.

57
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:57,482
I present to you this critical evidence.

58
00:05:58,274 --> 00:05:59,150
What's that?

59
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:03,946
This cell phone belongs to the head
of the research team I assaulted.

60
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:06,324
The text messages saved here

61
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:12,038
clearly show that the company

62
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:18,086
covered up the incident
and threatened the victims.

63
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:23,549
-Gosh. What's that?
-Please, stop.

64
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:25,593
-What's that?
-Wait.

65
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:28,721
What is this?

66
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:32,308
Put your heads up.

67
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:34,393
-Freeze!
-Stop right now.

68
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:35,812
Did you call the police?

69
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:38,648
-Did you assault them?
-I did.

70
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:51,077
BABEL CHEMICALS

71
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:54,747
Goodness.

72
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:59,127
That almost gave me a heart attack.

73
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:01,963
My goodness.

74
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:04,549
After the commotion,

75
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:08,136
an employee of Babel Chemicals
picked up this cell phone.

76
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:10,847
When he went through it
to see whose phone it was,

77
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:14,433
he accidentally read the text messages.

78
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:17,311
And the employee gave us the phone
for public interest.

79
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:19,272
DEFENDANT

80
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:20,982
It's possible that he plotted this

81
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:24,235
with an accomplice
to illegally read the text messages.

82
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:27,572
We can ask the witness to elaborate.

83
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:30,116
WITNESS

84
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:33,786
PLAINTIFF

85
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,164
I'd like to submit the evidence.

86
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:47,049
Yes, sir. Stop them.

87
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:51,053
Well…

88
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:53,890
Your Honor.

89
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,935
-Please call an ambulance.
-Pardon?

90
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:00,062
When the trial is over,

91
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:03,149
I plan to beat the witness,
Director Gil Jong-moon, to a pulp.

92
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:05,485
Me?

93
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:10,198
If you make another threat,

94
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:13,075
you will be escorted out of my court.

95
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,368
Director Gil Jong-moon

96
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:17,580
gave the victims false information
about the cause of their sickness

97
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:21,000
when he was aware of the correlation
between BLSD and blood cancer.

98
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:27,548
Your Honor. The witness,
Vincenzo Cassano, is speaking

99
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:29,217
without any medical knowledge.

100
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:33,804
As a result, he is tarnishing
Director Gil's reputation severely.

101
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:35,014
Sustained.

102
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,602
I will only take opinions from experts
into consideration.

103
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,604
-Exactly.
-There she goes again.

104
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:44,857
That's why I call forth a medical expert
as my new surprise witness.

105
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,526
Another one?

106
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:47,902
A new surprise witness?

107
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:52,657
Witness, please come in.

108
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,751
-Honey.
-Is that your wife?

109
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:14,762
-Why…
-Hey.

110
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,764
Hey, there.

111
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:30,152
This is our expert witness.

112
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:33,489
She's Professor Kim Yeo-won, the director
of the Pediatric Cancer Center

113
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:36,826
at Sungwon University Hospital
and an expert in the field of leukemia.

114
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,494
Your Honor.

115
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:41,497
I'd like to reject this person
from speaking as a witness!

116
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:45,042
Our expert witness has
a very important piece of evidence

117
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:47,420
that can prove Director Gil
has committed perjury.

118
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,301
I will…

119
00:09:57,805 --> 00:09:58,681
allow it.

120
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,396
Honey!

121
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:07,773
You may stay out during her testimony!

122
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:10,651
Why are you doing this, honey?

123
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:13,779
Honey! Hey, let go of me.

124
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,656
-Honey!
-This way, please.

125
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,158
Honey.

126
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:20,119
Witness, you may take the oath.

127
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:24,415
I swear.

128
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:27,293
Befriend the enemy of my enemy.

129
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:32,882
Our enemy, who is also a key witness,
is Director Gil Jong-moon.

130
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:36,427
Who could be his enemy?

131
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:39,388
His subordinates
or other doctors at the hospital?

132
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:42,141
It'll be hard to persuade them
since their job is at stake.

133
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:45,061
But he wouldn't have enemies
outside the hospital.

134
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,855
There is someone. The most intimate enemy

135
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:50,066
that you share secrets with.

136
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:53,110
The enemy he fears the most.

137
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:57,365
Gosh, isn't it obvious who that is?

138
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:01,202
Once you lose their heart,
you become their worst enemy.

139
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:08,334
Look into Gil Jong-moon's personal life.

140
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,807
Someone once said

141
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,895
that one should look at art and war
from a distance.

142
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:35,403
You'll appreciate the painting more
if you take a few steps back.

143
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:57,883
The colors held by Liberty represent
freedom, equality, and fraternity.

144
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:00,928
Delacroix used these colors
in three different places.

145
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:03,472
One is in Liberty's hand.

146
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:06,767
The colors show up again
in that man's red belt,

147
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:09,395
white undershirt, and blue shirt.

148
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:11,772
And lastly,

149
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,900
it's also at the top
of Notre Dame Cathedral.

150
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:20,072
And the dress she's wearing doesn't
look like a regular French dress, either.

151
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,412
That's a Greek dress.

152
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:29,498
That's why she also symbolizes Libertas,

153
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,585
the goddess of freedom in mythology.

154
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:38,841
She reminds me of you

155
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:43,429
in how you've pushed forward with
the Pediatric Cancer Center

156
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:45,931
against the board of directors.

157
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:51,979
Do you know me?

158
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:55,399
It's an honor to meet you.

159
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:58,402
I'm Lawyer Vincenzo Cassano.

160
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,366
DIRECTOR GIL'S SLUSH FUND RECORDS

161
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:07,870
PERSONAL TRANSACTIONS

162
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:22,134
I knew that he was having an affair

163
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:24,762
and was secretly preparing to divorce me.

164
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:26,555
But…

165
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,518
I didn't know
he had hidden this much money.

166
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:33,103
More than anything,

167
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:35,898
I am furious that
he downplayed your intelligence.

168
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:38,651
What do you want from me?

169
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:47,660
I want you to be our expert witness
and refute Director Gil's claims.

170
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:51,914
When all you did was expose his secrets,

171
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:53,832
isn't this too much?

172
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,084
No, it's not.

173
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:59,004
Because our law firm will take care
of your divorce suit,

174
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:01,966
and Director Gil will lose
all of his assets to you.

175
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:17,231
-I have one more condition.
-Please.

176
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:20,234
Do you like opera?

177
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:27,491
Opera gives me
the biggest comfort in my life.

178
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,206
Then, take me to see an opera.

179
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:43,716
Cheers to your beautiful
and alluring eyes.

180
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:48,053
This contains Director Gil Jong-moon's
personal correspondence

181
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:53,392
with Dr. Ramos of the UCLA Medical Center
regarding how to treat BLSD.

182
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:57,313
Here, he admits that improper
sewage disposal was what caused the leak

183
00:14:57,396 --> 00:15:00,190
and identifies BLSD as the direct cause
of the blood cancer.

184
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:04,194
The emails clearly show he was
discussing the leak with Dr. Ramos.

185
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:06,155
Reading your spouse's emails
without consent

186
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:07,865
is a violation
of the telecommunications act.

187
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:09,491
Hence, this evidence
cannot be used in court.

188
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:12,786
She didn't read Director Gil's emails.
Dr. Ramos sent them to her.

189
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:16,624
-What?
-That's right.

190
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:18,709
Dr. Ramos is an old friend of mine.

191
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:22,713
He asked me about
what my husband had asked him.

192
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:27,176
And during this inquiry,
Dr. Ramos shared these emails with me.

193
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:32,222
What? Then why didn't you
talk to your husband about this?

194
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:36,060
I didn't want to hurt
my poor husband's pride.

195
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:40,105
If he had known it came from me,
his fragile ego would have been hurt.

196
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:44,276
In order to verify the witness' testimony

197
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,570
and to compare their medical opinions,

198
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:49,615
I will call the defendant's witness…
What's his name?

199
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:52,660
-Gil Jong-moon.
-I will call Gil Jong-moon to the stand.

200
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:56,538
So we can go over this one more time.

201
00:15:57,414 --> 00:15:59,249
Honey!

202
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:06,966
Go to the witness stand.

203
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:10,970
Darling, what's wrong with you?

204
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:22,314
Right.

205
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,441
I almost forgot.

206
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:27,987
Here's a bonus from your "darling."

207
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:32,992
I found this in the corner
of my husband's desk drawer.

208
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:35,953
I thought this was salt
that you have with sundae.

209
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:37,746
It turned out it was methamphetamine.

210
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:41,000
He's a doctor.
How could he be so reckless?

211
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,631
I suspect the defendant's witness
is a habitual drug user.

212
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:50,259
I find it difficult to accept
his expert opinion.

213
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:54,513
That's not mine! It's not!

214
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:55,806
Then is this mine?

215
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:57,891
-You junkie.
-What?

216
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:00,728
Let's roll up his sleeve.

217
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:03,522
It has been brought
to the court's attention

218
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:07,276
that Director Gil might have injected
Lee U-yeong with methamphetamines.

219
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,946
Lee U-yeong is hospitalized now,
but once his innocence is proven,

220
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:15,075
his testimony as a witness
must be also admissible.

221
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:16,368
That's right.

222
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:21,540
Components that make up a drug may differ
depending on who has manufactured it.

223
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:23,083
Your Honor!

224
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:25,169
I am sure that the components

225
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:29,214
that make up the drug found in
Lee U-yeong's blood will be identical

226
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:31,800
to that of Director Gil's.

227
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,470
You in the gallery. Be quiet!

228
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:35,679
Okay.

229
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:39,600
How dare you do this to
your own husband? My goodness!

230
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:41,477
Fine. I get that you're smart.

231
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,812
But how dare you destroy
the head of a family

232
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:47,441
who is brilliant and levelheaded?

233
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:48,650
Witness!

234
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:52,654
You're not allowed to speak
unless it's relevant to the case.

235
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,782
Be quiet and go back to your seat.

236
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:01,413
What are you doing?

237
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:04,625
Go back to your hussy, you prick.

238
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:05,834
And you know what?

239
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:09,004
You're dirt poor now, you asshole.

240
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:13,133
Please, refrain from using profanity
in the sacred court of law.

241
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:15,469
I get that you are pissed at me,

242
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:20,349
but how dare you tarnish our family's
reputation in this sacred courtroom?

243
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:24,645
You're going down anyway.
Do you want some more?

244
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:25,813
What?

245
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:36,073
-Hey.
-Calm down.

246
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:37,950
Let go of me. You come here.

247
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:47,876
Stop fighting.

248
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:02,850
What was his name?

249
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:04,977
Vinsingzo.

250
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:07,855
I've seen him before.

251
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:10,315
I think it was about two weeks ago.

252
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:12,651
He came to me when I was working out.

253
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:15,320
He talked about some strange things
and left.

254
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:20,284
Then he probably figured out
how stupid you are.

255
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:21,368
What?

256
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:24,371
I didn't respond to him at all.

257
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:26,665
I sensed that something was off.

258
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:27,624
Forget it.

259
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,334
Hold a press conference tomorrow.

260
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:30,752
A press conference?

261
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:34,173
Admit to everything
and announce we'll get rid of BLSD.

262
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:36,550
Punish everyone who's involved,

263
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:38,552
and tell the victims
we'll compensate them.

264
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:41,013
And don't forget to bow respectfully.

265
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:43,849
Okay.

266
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:45,601
How is Babel Tower going?

267
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:48,937
I think the supervising department
is experiencing some hiccups.

268
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:53,025
Just shut up and demolish it.

269
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,445
We're not building it for our own good.

270
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:58,864
Don't you know
it's for the prosecutors, the judges,

271
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:00,699
politicians, and government officials?

272
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:04,369
I'll personally see to it
as soon as I get back to the company.

273
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:06,413
I get that you're a fake,

274
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,749
but you still must do your best.

275
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:10,751
Yes, sir.

276
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,170
Bye.

277
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:17,549
Damn it!

278
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:26,600
If Babel is smart, they'll want to settle.

279
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:30,604
I agree. They'll try to settle this,
so it doesn't turn into a criminal case.

280
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:33,023
What's your plan?

281
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:35,025
Of course, victims should be compensated.

282
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:36,777
I'll sue them in criminal court.

283
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:41,990
This could've taken 5 to 6 years,
but we finished it in 2 weeks.

284
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,200
Good work.

285
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:47,454
Gosh, there's no need for that between us.

286
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:51,667
Right. Do you need anything?

287
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,960
Do I need anything?

288
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:55,879
Yes. You played a huge role
in winning this case.

289
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:58,215
As the CEO, I want to reward you.

290
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:02,261
Anything I want?

291
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:04,012
Yes. You name it.

292
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:07,808
Okay.

293
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:10,519
I'll show you how it's done!

294
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:25,742
Do you know how much
Babel will lose today?

295
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:33,125
I'm already past 200km per hour.

296
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:35,002
Should we jump over there

297
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:37,045
-to see what happens?
-Please, don't.

298
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:48,140
Even if it's a Booralro suit,
you can't wear it all year round.

299
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:51,852
And more importantly,
it makes you look out of style.

300
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:56,648
So I've been making up for that
with my good looks.

301
00:21:58,692 --> 00:21:59,818
So annoying.

302
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,071
So how many suits do you want?

303
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:05,615
We'll start with ten suits.

304
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:10,704
That many?

305
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:12,998
Let's leave now if you're not up for it.

306
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:15,167
No. Go ahead.

307
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:17,711
-Let's go.
-Get them.

308
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:30,182
By the way, you have such a great body.

309
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:33,060
I almost thought
I was measuring a mannequin.

310
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:37,522
Should I hold my breath for three seconds
like a real mannequin?

311
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:41,735
Then, can you hold your breath
for three seconds?

312
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:44,029
That would be an interesting experience.

313
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:54,831
I have some sample suits in your size.

314
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:56,541
-Would you like to try them on?
-Sure.

315
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:57,459
Okay.

316
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:48,176
Ms. Hong, what do you think?

317
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:03,400
Are you okay with a sample suit?

318
00:24:04,025 --> 00:24:06,611
This is perfect for me. Thanks.

319
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:15,120
Here.

320
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:18,540
-What is it?
-Open it.

321
00:24:26,047 --> 00:24:29,092
This is to celebrate our partnership.

322
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:35,182
I don't like the font,

323
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:38,059
-but I appreciate it.
-Such a smart-ass, aren't you?

324
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:40,645
You're so annoying. Just give it back.

325
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:43,148
Give it back. Give that to me.

326
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:45,066
Let's go.

327
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:47,569
We should get out of here.

328
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:02,459
Wait.

329
00:25:08,506 --> 00:25:09,549
I…

330
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:27,067
What's he doing? I mean, boss.

331
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:30,779
Hey. My gosh.

332
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:44,668
That crazy asshole.

333
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:12,696
Well…

334
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:20,745
Never in a million years did I think
they'd go after

335
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:22,289
Director Gil's wife.

336
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:25,250
I let my guard down
and failed to assess my enemy.

337
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:36,261
It's not that
you failed to assess your enemy.

338
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:38,805
It's that your method is old-fashioned.

339
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:41,766
You guys have no creativity.

340
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,393
-In Korean, it's--
-We know.

341
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:46,104
-Yes, you know.
-Yes.

342
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:49,232
We will start working creatively
from now on.

343
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:55,280
Creativity is something you're born with,

344
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:56,990
just like Vincenzo Cassano!

345
00:26:57,907 --> 00:27:01,661
Sir, do you know anything about Vincenzo?

346
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:03,371
Isn't he the perfect lawyer?

347
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:06,333
He's spotless
to the point of being invisible.

348
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:10,879
First, go after Hong Cha-young.

349
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:12,964
Take her for everything she has.

350
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:16,634
Money, her license, everything.

351
00:27:18,511 --> 00:27:19,804
I'll take care of Vincenzo.

352
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:22,932
And I will also take care of

353
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:25,935
-buying the Namdongbu office.
-No, I'll do it.

354
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:28,480
-Are you serious?
-Give me a chance to redeem myself.

355
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:29,939
A chance

356
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,859
is reserved for only those who are worthy.

357
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:35,904
I will prove myself to be worthy
of that chance again.

358
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:37,447
You have three days.

359
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:52,462
You want me to win
with this useless intel?

360
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:56,466
Tell me the truth. You assholes are trying
to destroy me, aren't you?

361
00:27:56,549 --> 00:27:58,134
-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry.

362
00:27:58,218 --> 00:28:00,178
You're sorry?

363
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:02,305
Will you say that at my funeral too?

364
00:28:03,556 --> 00:28:04,391
I'm sorry.

365
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:11,648
All of you, stop whatever you are doing
and get me everything on Cha-young.

366
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:15,151
Including her call history,
everything she ate and drank,

367
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:16,945
whatever she printed,

368
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:20,532
and the snacks she ate at the lounge.
Get me everything. Got it?

369
00:28:20,615 --> 00:28:21,741
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

370
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:23,827
Don't stand there. Get out!

371
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:47,225
Hello, sir.

372
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,102
It's me.

373
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:52,021
Thank you so much for your help.

374
00:28:52,605 --> 00:28:53,898
Thank you.

375
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:57,736
Our wishes and wisdom from Buddha

376
00:28:57,819 --> 00:28:59,946
must have reached your hearts.

377
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:03,992
This is amazing.
There's no other way to describe this.

378
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:06,953
-You finished them in one blow.
-But I prepared all the files.

379
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:09,748
Okay. You love taking the credit.

380
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:15,587
This man defeated Goliath.

381
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:17,505
Now, I can't even guess

382
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,591
the things he's able to accomplish.

383
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:21,009
You should come have dinner.

384
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:23,928
I'd like to serve
the new dishes I developed to you two.

385
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,725
Maybe I'll offer you
a nice cup of coffee instead.

386
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:31,686
Let's have a meeting tomorrow.

387
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,564
What meeting, Mr. Cassano?

388
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:36,191
A meeting about the plaza.

389
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:39,152
I am sure you will be happy
to hear the news.

390
00:29:43,531 --> 00:29:45,492
He said it's good news.

391
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:47,952
Why are you all so silent?

392
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:50,622
-That's great. Awesome.
-Yes. Nice.

393
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:54,751
-Tomorrow? Tomorrow is great.
-Yes.

394
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:55,919
-Good.
-Yes.

395
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:58,087
Let's meet at 11 a.m. tomorrow.

396
00:29:58,171 --> 00:29:59,547
-At 11 a.m.
-I see.

397
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:02,342
-Around that time…
-Then…

398
00:30:02,425 --> 00:30:04,594
Didn't we have an appointment?

399
00:30:04,677 --> 00:30:06,513
-I think we did.
-Right.

400
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:10,433
-I'm sure we had plans at that time.
-Right.

401
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:14,813
TEAM LEADER NA OF BABEL E&C

402
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:16,314
I did everything I could,

403
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:18,525
but I cannot stall this project anymore.

404
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:21,402
Make it happen.

405
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,696
I really can't.

406
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:27,200
The order came directly from the chairman.

407
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:29,035
If I don't demolish it in a week,

408
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:31,830
he'll fire me and take over the project.

409
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:38,294
-A week?
-Yes. A week.

410
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:40,088
Seven days. One week.

411
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:42,590
And, for your information,

412
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:47,095
I ended it with my mistress.
I'm devoted to my family now.

413
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:51,015
I've been going camping with an RV
with my wife every weekend.

414
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:54,644
And we make gambas by the bonfire.
We also play the guitar.

415
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:56,145
So what should I do?

416
00:30:57,063 --> 00:30:59,148
Keep going camping with your wife.

417
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:02,944
If you cheat on her again,

418
00:31:03,736 --> 00:31:05,488
you'll be dead for real.

419
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:08,533
-Gosh.
-Yes, Mr. Cho.

420
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:11,619
We went to Eurwangni last week.

421
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:14,831
Are you sure?

422
00:31:14,914 --> 00:31:15,832
Yes.

423
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:20,295
He's a Korean-Japanese
architecture professor in Tokyo.

424
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:24,215
He said there might be a way to get into
the basement while minimizing the impact.

425
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:26,175
Does he know about the plaza's condition?

426
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:30,555
Of course. He's done it before
on buildings that are over 100 years old.

427
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:32,223
-And you can trust him?
-Yes.

428
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:34,601
I can vouch for him.

429
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:36,436
When will he be in Korea?

430
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:39,439
As this is urgent,
I asked him to come by tonight.

431
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:41,357
Great.

432
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:44,402
Good work. Bye.

433
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,489
What?

434
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:53,202
How dare you?

435
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:56,748
You think I'm a joke because
you have a few judges on your payroll?

436
00:31:58,291 --> 00:31:59,542
That's a misunderstanding.

437
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:03,379
I know that I can't move you with money.

438
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:06,758
We are here because we would like to

439
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:08,885
help your future in politics.

440
00:32:08,968 --> 00:32:10,094
What is it?

441
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:12,263
Will Babel help me become the president?

442
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:16,893
Gosh. As long as we have you,
anything is possible.

443
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:18,353
Shut your mouth.

444
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:22,357
Why would assholes like you
care about my future?

445
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:24,442
Babel is unbelievable.

446
00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:25,985
Sir.

447
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:29,572
Our chairman truly respects you.

448
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:30,990
Hey!

449
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:32,659
I told you to shut up.

450
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:36,537
If you call me again
for something like this…

451
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:40,416
I don't care if it's Wusang or Babel.
I'll throw all of you in jail! Got it?

452
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:43,920
Don't forget that.

453
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:45,171
Sir.

454
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:49,300
Myung-hee, you should know your place.

455
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:51,052
You can't leave like this.

456
00:33:09,737 --> 00:33:10,738
It was a bust, right?

457
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:15,451
Damn it.

458
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:39,100
BEAUTY SALON

459
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:44,939
FOR RENT OR SALE

460
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:12,383
Gosh, this is crazy.

461
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:27,815
No! Get away!

462
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:29,984
-Don't come near!
-I'm Yeong-ho!

463
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,486
It's me, Yeong-ho.

464
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:32,945
-No, you're not!
-I'm Yeong-ho.

465
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:34,614
-You're not him!
-What's wrong?

466
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:35,656
I'm Yeong-ho.

467
00:34:36,365 --> 00:34:37,867
-My gosh.
-Yeong-ho?

468
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:38,826
Yes.

469
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:42,288
What's wrong with your face?

470
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:44,290
I started my own bizarre comedy channel.

471
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:45,333
What?

472
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:47,794
What are you talking about?

473
00:34:48,294 --> 00:34:51,964
If you liked today's video, please
subscribe and press the like button.

474
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:55,051
And I'll be back with a better video
next week. Bye.

475
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:58,888
Why this, of all things?

476
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:02,517
I'm being productive. I even quit smoking.

477
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,727
Then you should focus on your studies!

478
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:07,563
I'm better suited for this than studying.

479
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:08,940
So let me be.

480
00:35:10,983 --> 00:35:12,443
You get scared so easily.

481
00:35:14,987 --> 00:35:16,489
This is so cool.

482
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:21,494
This is so cool.

483
00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:26,124
Coach Giuseppe Rossi of BC Milano,
a world-renowned Italian football team,

484
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:28,751
has started his four-day visit in Korea.

485
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:31,462
Coach Rossi who landed in Korea
this morning

486
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:34,882
watched the matches
between youth soccer teams in person

487
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:37,844
and announced that he's looking
for the next Son Heung-min.

488
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:42,056
According to a source from BC Milano,
they plan to scout promising players,

489
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,851
put them through
a one-month tryout in Milan,

490
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:47,895
and train the selected players.

491
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:51,566
This has grabbed the attention of
soccer fans worldwide

492
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:56,070
who are looking forward to
the discovery of the next Son Heung-min.

493
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:25,516
Yes, Mr. Cho.

494
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,603
The architecture professor
has arrived at the airport now.

495
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:29,979
Should we meet tomorrow?

496
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:32,648
No, let's meet now.

497
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:38,070
Mr. Cho.

498
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:40,740
Yes?

499
00:36:40,823 --> 00:36:42,617
Why did you want to meet this late?

500
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:50,082
I wanted to see the moonlight
reflected on your heads.

501
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:51,584
Pardon?

502
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:54,462
I was joking.

503
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:57,673
I'm sorry.

504
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:02,261
Actually,
I wanted to ask you a few questions.

505
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:03,679
Come to our temple, then.

506
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:04,972
No!

507
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:10,978
I've become allergic
to basements recently,

508
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:13,147
so I can't even take the subway now.

509
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:15,942
-Let us talk here, then.
-Yes.

510
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:17,735
So what are your questions?

511
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:21,781
What should people who want
to be vegetarian be careful with?

512
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:23,574
And…

513
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:27,245
if you forget the words of the scriptures
while reciting them,

514
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:29,747
do you improvise?

515
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:33,167
Girls like guys who go to church,
but how come they don't fall for monks?

516
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:38,089
I wanted to ask these three questions.

517
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:51,978
What do you think?

518
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:54,897
My gosh. I didn't know it'd be this bad.

519
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:58,067
The workers did a shoddy job.
The beams and columns are the worst.

520
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:01,529
Then, is it impossible
to get into the basement?

521
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:03,406
I'm afraid so.

522
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:07,118
Drilling 30cm will be enough
to bring down the whole building.

523
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:50,036
All right. More.

524
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:52,788
-Drink some more.
-Yes, sir.

525
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:55,416
Gosh.

526
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:57,376
There's no need for that. We're brothers.

527
00:38:58,127 --> 00:38:59,170
Okay.

528
00:39:01,922 --> 00:39:02,923
Thank you.

529
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:11,932
Are you ready?

530
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:14,101
There will be a storm tomorrow.

531
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:16,687
Yes. I'm ready.

532
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:19,190
I'm as ready as I'll ever be.

533
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:21,108
It's just you and me now.

534
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:23,486
You got the company,
and I got the legal world.

535
00:39:25,237 --> 00:39:26,405
Yes.

536
00:39:27,573 --> 00:39:29,867
I thought our old man was wrong,
but he was right.

537
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:33,746
Don't ever put your trust in anyone else

538
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:35,081
or give out compliments.

539
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,792
Yes, I don't trust anyone but you.

540
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:41,879
I won't listen to anyone but you.

541
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:44,715
Gosh, my little brother.

542
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:49,637
If you were just a tad bit smarter,
I would've adored you infinitely.

543
00:39:59,021 --> 00:40:00,606
I have a question.

544
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:04,693
If I keep disappointing you,

545
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:08,781
will you do me in like you did with Dad?

546
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:10,991
What?

547
00:40:13,452 --> 00:40:15,996
Like what you did to Dad that day.

548
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:34,181
This is what you told me
when I entered middle school.

549
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:38,644
"To become a successful businessman,

550
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:42,189
live a life that cannot end up
in a biography."

551
00:40:45,901 --> 00:40:47,111
I'll do exactly that, Dad.

552
00:41:33,365 --> 00:41:34,575
Die already.

553
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:38,704
Apologize to Mom when you…

554
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:43,125
You wouldn't be able to see Mom,

555
00:41:46,795 --> 00:41:48,672
because you'll dive head-first into hell.

556
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:11,278
Come on in. He's gone.

557
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:26,043
You knew?

558
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:28,087
That I sent him away?

559
00:42:29,588 --> 00:42:32,633
Yes. Of course, I knew.

560
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:38,305
You aren't that stupid after all.

561
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:42,685
You're quite smart, actually.

562
00:42:44,311 --> 00:42:46,814
I'm so proud of you, Han-seo.

563
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:51,110
Gosh, I was so wrong about my brother.

564
00:42:54,446 --> 00:42:55,906
Thank you

565
00:42:56,615 --> 00:42:57,992
for acknowledging that.

566
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:00,411
By the way, Han-seo.

567
00:43:01,453 --> 00:43:03,330
I don't like your eyes these days.

568
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:05,874
They remind me of Dad.

569
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:12,506
No, actually…

570
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:15,718
It's because I didn't get
much sleep lately.

571
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:18,887
It's just that my eyes are tired.

572
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:22,224
I was just joking, you fool.

573
00:43:25,227 --> 00:43:28,063
You're his son.
Of course, you resemble him.

574
00:43:36,363 --> 00:43:37,323
Here.

575
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:39,033
Eat it.

576
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:43,662
Eat it. Okay?

577
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:10,689
We've run out of options.

578
00:44:11,231 --> 00:44:13,275
And the plaza will be demolished
in a week.

579
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:15,778
We don't have any other ways
to get into the basement.

580
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:19,948
But we can't keep throwing parties.

581
00:44:20,032 --> 00:44:23,077
How about we demolish it at a random time?

582
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:28,540
Unless the police and the city office
are on our side, it's impossible.

583
00:44:30,876 --> 00:44:32,878
I guess the only thing we can do now

584
00:44:33,962 --> 00:44:35,506
is to stall for time.

585
00:44:36,298 --> 00:44:38,050
Do you have any other ideas?

586
00:44:39,426 --> 00:44:42,721
There's a card I can't help but play.

587
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:46,600
It's the most common method.

588
00:44:58,487 --> 00:44:59,988
Gosh, it's burnt!.

589
00:45:29,768 --> 00:45:32,980
TO NOT HAVE IS TO HAVE

590
00:45:43,866 --> 00:45:45,659
4 DAYS AGO

591
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:49,413
By the way,

592
00:45:49,496 --> 00:45:53,292
did you live abroad?
Why is your name Gilbert?

593
00:45:53,375 --> 00:45:56,086
It's not actually a name. It's gilbeot,

594
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:59,423
Korean for "a friend on the road."

595
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:02,801
-My goodness.
-I see.

596
00:46:02,885 --> 00:46:05,304
So it means, "a friend on the street"?

597
00:46:05,387 --> 00:46:07,431
I thought you were from the US.

598
00:46:07,514 --> 00:46:09,224
We gave you food. Now tell us.

599
00:46:09,308 --> 00:46:11,435
You said you'd tell us
something important.

600
00:46:11,518 --> 00:46:15,522
Right. There's gold inside this building.

601
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:17,816
A lot of it.

602
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:19,610
A lot of gold.

603
00:46:28,577 --> 00:46:29,995
It's true.

604
00:46:30,662 --> 00:46:33,248
-I saw it.
-What did you see?

605
00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:36,084
What was left behind by the people
who moved the gold when they died.

606
00:46:36,168 --> 00:46:38,295
What do you mean they died?

607
00:46:38,378 --> 00:46:39,588
Was it three years ago?

608
00:46:40,255 --> 00:46:42,841
I was hiding in a bar
to get some free food.

609
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:45,761
And the people
who moved gold into this plaza…

610
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:50,432
were drinking there.

611
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:53,560
And they said

612
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:57,231
that they moved
12 billion won's worth of gold bars

613
00:46:57,314 --> 00:46:58,899
to this plaza.

614
00:47:00,859 --> 00:47:03,111
-Good work.
-Good job.

615
00:47:09,826 --> 00:47:10,953
Hello.

616
00:47:34,851 --> 00:47:37,271
So, you're saying

617
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:39,856
that someone killed the workers
who moved the gold?

618
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:45,612
Yes. It was to keep it secret.

619
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:48,657
The person who hid the gold bars--

620
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:50,617
That's a load of crap.

621
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:53,745
What a load of bull.
Do you take us for fools?

622
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:55,581
I'm telling the truth.

623
00:47:55,664 --> 00:47:58,000
Hey, do you think I'm a joke? Seriously.

624
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:00,460
-All right.
-My goodness.

625
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:01,837
Let me see.

626
00:48:05,799 --> 00:48:08,885
This phone belonged to one of the workers
who died that night.

627
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:14,474
Gosh. Isn't that real gold behind him?

628
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:17,603
Right. What are they called?

629
00:48:17,686 --> 00:48:20,147
They're gold bars, aren't they?

630
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:22,441
The gold bars are inside this building.

631
00:48:22,524 --> 00:48:25,110
Fine. Let's say they are.

632
00:48:25,819 --> 00:48:27,195
Where did they hide them then?

633
00:48:27,946 --> 00:48:30,949
I didn't hear where.
If I knew, I would've gotten it myself.

634
00:48:31,033 --> 00:48:32,868
Come on. Goodness.

635
00:48:32,951 --> 00:48:34,661
Gosh, this is ridiculous.

636
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:36,622
Why are you taking him so seriously?

637
00:48:36,705 --> 00:48:40,375
I mean, he even has the photo
of the gold bars. Look.

638
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:43,962
There are a lot of studios
that take photos like that.

639
00:48:45,922 --> 00:48:47,424
Right. That makes no sense.

640
00:48:47,507 --> 00:48:50,802
How can there be
12 billion won's worth of gold here?

641
00:48:53,055 --> 00:48:55,474
I believe it's just a rumor.

642
00:48:56,808 --> 00:48:58,602
Probably, right?

643
00:48:58,685 --> 00:49:01,480
What a funny rumor that is.

644
00:49:01,563 --> 00:49:03,690
You're quite a character, Gilbert.

645
00:49:08,904 --> 00:49:10,781
I'm telling the truth. Damn it.

646
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:20,916
Next on the news.

647
00:49:20,999 --> 00:49:24,670
Chairman Jang Han-seo of Babel
issued an apology

648
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:29,216
to the victims of Babel Chemicals,
promised to compensate them

649
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:33,095
and to immediately start working on
preventive measures starting today.

650
00:49:33,178 --> 00:49:38,433
We were at the scene where he
issued his heart-felt apology.

651
00:49:38,517 --> 00:49:39,768
This was what he said.

652
00:49:39,851 --> 00:49:43,730
I would like to express
my deepest regret and apologies

653
00:49:45,524 --> 00:49:47,818
to all those who are concerned.

654
00:49:49,736 --> 00:49:52,739
The Babel Group

655
00:49:54,116 --> 00:49:57,202
feels a great sense of responsibility
for the recent incidents.

656
00:49:59,162 --> 00:50:02,207
-I would like to personally…
-He's an awful actor.

657
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:04,710
I agree. He should have taken
acting lessons.

658
00:50:04,793 --> 00:50:06,837
He doesn't sound sincere at all.

659
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:09,673
That's not for the victims anyway.

660
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:13,385
It's to lighten the sentence
in case he's charged with anything.

661
00:50:14,761 --> 00:50:17,514
My goodness. How embarrassing!

662
00:50:18,557 --> 00:50:21,685
This post was just uploaded
to the anonymous forum for lawyers.

663
00:50:21,768 --> 00:50:23,103
It's about Choi Myung-hee.

664
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:26,148
She tried to bribe Chief Prosecutor
Hwang Jin-tae and failed.

665
00:50:28,316 --> 00:50:30,944
How can such a secretive story
spread this fast?

666
00:50:31,027 --> 00:50:33,238
If you make a fool of yourself
in our industry,

667
00:50:33,321 --> 00:50:35,282
you get burnt twice with these rumors.

668
00:50:36,658 --> 00:50:39,453
She must've offered him a hefty sum,
but he didn't bite.

669
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:42,831
He's been on the Josam Group's payroll
for the last 20 years.

670
00:50:42,914 --> 00:50:45,625
He has a lot of money
and has no interest in bribes.

671
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:49,212
He just wants to set up his own cartel
to move up the ladder.

672
00:50:50,255 --> 00:50:53,216
It's 11 a.m. It's time
for our meeting with the tenants.

673
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:56,344
Right. Let's go.

674
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:01,600
I'm sure you've heard already.
Mr. Cassano is trying

675
00:51:01,683 --> 00:51:03,226
to make good on his promise.

676
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:05,729
He'll purchase a building in Sangchi-dong

677
00:51:05,812 --> 00:51:08,607
and will relocate you there.

678
00:51:09,691 --> 00:51:11,026
That's right.

679
00:51:11,109 --> 00:51:14,279
I will do my best to find a building
where you can

680
00:51:14,362 --> 00:51:16,156
work as well as live.

681
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:18,325
That's great. Awesome.

682
00:51:18,825 --> 00:51:19,659
Aren't you happy?

683
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:21,787
-Great.
-Sounds great.

684
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:22,996
Good.

685
00:51:25,832 --> 00:51:29,002
Oh, my. I've never seen
such a peaceful crowd.

686
00:51:29,085 --> 00:51:31,004
All you need are some doves flying around.

687
00:51:31,087 --> 00:51:33,632
Are you the delivery man?
You come here daily.

688
00:51:33,715 --> 00:51:36,635
If he was delivering something,
we'd at least be excited.

689
00:51:36,718 --> 00:51:38,720
The same goes for your face!

690
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:40,972
Stop cutting me off and move. Come on.

691
00:51:41,056 --> 00:51:43,475
I'm sorry.
The sight of him makes me lose my temper.

692
00:51:45,894 --> 00:51:48,605
I heard that you are all moving
to a nice place. Where?

693
00:51:48,688 --> 00:51:50,357
-Sangchi-dong.
-That's right.

694
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:51,525
How…

695
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:53,193
How did you know that?

696
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:55,612
Nothing gets past by me
in this neighborhood.

697
00:51:57,739 --> 00:52:01,034
Well, I wish you all the best.
But before you go,

698
00:52:01,117 --> 00:52:03,078
don't forget to sign the agreement.

699
00:52:04,496 --> 00:52:05,872
But we're not moving out.

700
00:52:06,832 --> 00:52:07,916
My gosh.

701
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:09,584
Why not?

702
00:52:09,668 --> 00:52:10,752
You're not?

703
00:52:11,837 --> 00:52:14,965
How should I put it?
This building is our home

704
00:52:15,048 --> 00:52:16,800
and a resting place for us.

705
00:52:16,883 --> 00:52:18,385
We must protect it.

706
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:20,303
This place is stained

707
00:52:21,179 --> 00:52:22,931
with the sweat from our brows.

708
00:52:23,014 --> 00:52:24,558
You know what?

709
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:28,103
This plaza is
like the heart of Geumga-dong.

710
00:52:28,186 --> 00:52:29,521
It's a sacred place!

711
00:52:29,604 --> 00:52:30,939
What's wrong with you?

712
00:52:31,022 --> 00:52:32,899
Sangchi-dong is a much better place.

713
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:36,611
And that's not my turf,
so I promise I won't even go near there.

714
00:52:36,695 --> 00:52:38,029
We're still not moving out!

715
00:52:38,113 --> 00:52:40,615
We will fight to our deaths
to protect this place.

716
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:42,701
-What? Why?
-We'll never leave!

717
00:52:42,784 --> 00:52:45,078
-What do you think happened?
-Why all of a sudden?

718
00:52:45,161 --> 00:52:47,539
-We'll never leave here!
-You said you'd sign it!

719
00:52:47,622 --> 00:52:49,332
-Come on. Hong-sik.
-Never!

720
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:50,834
Everyone!

721
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:54,588
Guys.

722
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:56,923
Until now,

723
00:52:57,883 --> 00:52:58,884
we have been too weak.

724
00:53:00,468 --> 00:53:02,804
It's time for us to join hands

725
00:53:04,723 --> 00:53:05,974
and fight.

726
00:53:06,766 --> 00:53:08,059
We are Geumga Plaza!

727
00:53:08,143 --> 00:53:11,021
Geumga Plaza is what we are!

728
00:53:11,104 --> 00:53:12,647
Let's fight!

729
00:53:12,731 --> 00:53:16,318
Let's protect this place
with everything we've got!

730
00:53:16,401 --> 00:53:17,611
Fight!

731
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:19,905
-We will fight.
-Fight!

732
00:53:19,988 --> 00:53:21,573
-Fight!
-Fight!

733
00:53:21,656 --> 00:53:23,658
-Fight!
-Fight!

734
00:53:23,742 --> 00:53:26,912
-Fight!
-Fight!

735
00:53:26,995 --> 00:53:29,122
-Fight!
-Fight!

736
00:53:29,205 --> 00:53:32,042
-We will fight!
-Fight!

737
00:53:32,125 --> 00:53:33,585
-Let's go!
-Fight!

738
00:53:33,668 --> 00:53:35,962
-Fight!
-Geumga!

739
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:38,381
-Fight!
-Fight!

740
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:41,801
They've got to be kidding.

741
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:44,512
Why do they always end up chanting
and trying to fight us?

742
00:53:44,596 --> 00:53:46,222
I really don't get it.

743
00:53:46,306 --> 00:53:48,725
What else are they going to do? Sing?

744
00:53:49,267 --> 00:53:52,604
Here comes the bird

745
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:55,357
Sing a song?

746
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:57,525
That was so lame.

747
00:53:58,109 --> 00:53:59,903
-My pride is hurt.
-I'll kill him.

748
00:53:59,986 --> 00:54:02,489
-Stop him.
-Sir, please.

749
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:05,825
Let go of me. Come on. Stop it.
I'm getting a call.

750
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:11,289
Yes, sir.

751
00:54:14,167 --> 00:54:15,335
Really?

752
00:54:17,253 --> 00:54:19,047
Then we can raid this place, right?

753
00:54:20,465 --> 00:54:23,301
Why are they so fickle?
What's gotten into them?

754
00:54:23,385 --> 00:54:25,470
They said they'd go!

755
00:54:26,054 --> 00:54:29,557
Why are they doing this to me? Why?

756
00:54:29,641 --> 00:54:32,310
-He's still handsome when he gets angry.
-Damn it!

757
00:54:37,315 --> 00:54:39,317
Show me your angry face, Mr. Nam.

758
00:54:46,408 --> 00:54:48,201
You should stick to smiling.

759
00:54:48,785 --> 00:54:49,828
Ms. Hong Cha-young.

760
00:54:49,911 --> 00:54:51,997
What is it now?

761
00:54:52,664 --> 00:54:55,041
You're under arrest
for malpractice, embezzlement,

762
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:58,586
violating the attorney-at-law act,
making threats and forgery.

763
00:54:58,670 --> 00:54:59,713
-Let's go.
-What?

764
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:03,174
She's not some professional criminal.
Those charges are ridiculous.

765
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:04,467
Step back.

766
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:06,386
Do you even have evidence?

767
00:55:07,929 --> 00:55:09,681
She'll find out at the station.

768
00:55:09,764 --> 00:55:11,099
Gosh, Choi Myung-hee.

769
00:55:11,182 --> 00:55:13,643
She must've launched
one of her vendetta operations.

770
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:17,522
-You startled me.
-What was that?

771
00:55:19,149 --> 00:55:21,818
You're very cooperative today.

772
00:55:21,901 --> 00:55:23,903
Let's go. Come with us.

773
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:37,751
Aren't these colorful?
It's like the Olympic flag.

774
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:41,296
We have evidence
of your illegal activities

775
00:55:41,379 --> 00:55:42,881
in these five flash drives.

776
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:48,928
People at Wusang are so diligent.
They worked so hard to fabricate evidence.

777
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:52,390
We object to the validity of the evidence.

778
00:55:52,474 --> 00:55:53,767
Hey!

779
00:55:55,101 --> 00:55:56,644
Object all you want.

780
00:55:56,728 --> 00:55:58,980
These are irrefutable.

781
00:56:00,106 --> 00:56:01,566
Hey. It's this one.

782
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:03,234
-Is that right?
-Yes.

783
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:25,924
Just in case

784
00:56:26,883 --> 00:56:29,594
I end up taking the fall
for all of those charges…

785
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:31,346
Let me see.

786
00:56:33,098 --> 00:56:36,601
I'll be released from prison
after three Olympic Games.

787
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:41,815
The flash drives in the Olympic
flag colors meant something.

788
00:56:44,859 --> 00:56:46,820
This isn't the time for that.

789
00:56:47,695 --> 00:56:49,906
This is way more serious than last time.

790
00:56:49,989 --> 00:56:52,951
I can laugh because I know
you'll get me out of here.

791
00:56:54,994 --> 00:56:56,121
It won't be easy.

792
00:56:56,663 --> 00:56:58,915
Their evidence seems to be
impenetrable this time.

793
00:57:01,042 --> 00:57:02,836
Then do something…

794
00:57:04,671 --> 00:57:06,965
Mr. Mafia Lawyer.

795
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:13,847
Handle this matter
like a member of the Mafia.

796
00:57:14,556 --> 00:57:15,849
Do it.

797
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:20,562
I'm not in the Mafia.

798
00:57:22,814 --> 00:57:24,482
Enough with your act.

799
00:57:25,525 --> 00:57:27,819
It's getting difficult playing dumb.

800
00:57:28,403 --> 00:57:30,321
I mean, what I meant was…

801
00:57:33,491 --> 00:57:34,868
How did you know?

802
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:43,710
You stabbed Jang's pillow with syringes,
burnt down their warehouse,

803
00:57:43,793 --> 00:57:46,838
fired guns, and found out
confidential information.

804
00:57:48,923 --> 00:57:51,050
How can an ordinary lawyer do all that?

805
00:57:52,218 --> 00:57:54,012
Do you think I'm a fool?

806
00:57:54,804 --> 00:57:57,891
You always brought up the Mafia
every chance you had.

807
00:57:58,391 --> 00:58:00,435
So how could I not know?

808
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:05,607
Hurry.

809
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:08,318
In 48 hours, I will be transferred
to a detention center

810
00:58:08,401 --> 00:58:10,069
and be in a prison uniform.

811
00:58:11,279 --> 00:58:12,864
Okay. I'll handle it.

812
00:58:12,947 --> 00:58:14,199
I'll do it my way.

813
00:58:16,951 --> 00:58:19,996
Great. That's what I wanted to hear.

814
00:58:22,832 --> 00:58:26,920
Don't come back
until you make this go away.

815
00:58:58,368 --> 00:58:59,911
It's about Choi Myung-hee.

816
00:58:59,994 --> 00:59:03,331
She tried to bribe Chief Prosecutor
Hwang Jin-tae and failed.

817
00:59:26,354 --> 00:59:29,065
-I'm going all-in.
-Going all-in.

818
01:00:06,519 --> 01:00:07,937
Bet on the player.

819
01:00:11,316 --> 01:00:12,150
I don't want to.

820
01:00:13,109 --> 01:00:15,737
I will keep betting on the banker.

821
01:00:19,657 --> 01:00:21,492
You're not good at games of chance.

822
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:24,746
People who are good at games of chance

823
01:00:25,663 --> 01:00:26,581
are con artists.

824
01:01:08,539 --> 01:01:10,416
Damn it.

825
01:01:27,558 --> 01:01:29,352
I wonder why you're here.

826
01:01:29,435 --> 01:01:34,023
Right, Cha-young will be thrown in jail
in two days.

827
01:01:34,899 --> 01:01:38,778
Don't you dare try to cut a deal with me
to get her out.

828
01:01:38,861 --> 01:01:40,697
You've got nothing I want.

829
01:01:46,244 --> 01:01:48,079
But I'm sure you do.

830
01:01:49,372 --> 01:01:51,833
How about Chief Prosecutor Hwang Jin-tae?

831
01:01:54,794 --> 01:01:57,380
I guess word travels fast.

832
01:01:59,674 --> 01:02:01,426
I'll deal with him for you.

833
01:02:02,176 --> 01:02:03,428
Release Ms. Hong.

834
01:02:12,770 --> 01:02:13,938
This is a contract.

835
01:02:14,981 --> 01:02:17,108
It states that you will release Ms. Hong

836
01:02:17,191 --> 01:02:19,736
if I help you with Chief Prosecutor Hwang.

837
01:02:19,819 --> 01:02:21,821
CONTRACT

838
01:02:27,034 --> 01:02:28,745
Do you want a fountain pen?

839
01:02:30,913 --> 01:02:32,248
Are you pulling my leg?

840
01:02:35,334 --> 01:02:39,046
I guess I haven't made
enough of an impression on you yet.

841
01:02:41,466 --> 01:02:44,469
Should we go and do some laundry?

842
01:02:50,933 --> 01:02:52,852
Why? Don't you believe me?

843
01:02:53,728 --> 01:02:55,563
I guess

844
01:02:56,230 --> 01:02:59,442
you have no problem
trusting someone who tried to kill you.

845
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:07,283
Sometimes, trusting your enemy
can bring you luck.

846
01:03:08,117 --> 01:03:10,745
Of course,
it's not an easy decision to make.

847
01:03:22,131 --> 01:03:23,216
-That's it.
-Over here.

848
01:03:28,095 --> 01:03:31,140
-Be faster when you pass.
-Go.

849
01:03:32,266 --> 01:03:33,184
Go.

850
01:03:35,645 --> 01:03:36,604
There you go.

851
01:03:40,608 --> 01:03:41,526
Great. Keep going.

852
01:03:41,609 --> 01:03:43,277
-Pass it.
-Pass.

853
01:03:43,361 --> 01:03:46,531
-Goal!
-Good.That was great.

854
01:04:00,419 --> 01:04:02,547
Put some distance there.

855
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:04,423
-Good.
-Pass it over.

856
01:04:08,261 --> 01:04:09,554
Did you know?

857
01:04:09,637 --> 01:04:10,471
Pardon?

858
01:04:10,555 --> 01:04:14,267
Coach Giuseppe Rossi
of BC Milano is in Korea now.

859
01:04:15,059 --> 01:04:17,103
Gosh. I know.

860
01:04:17,186 --> 01:04:22,400
I also know that he visited
all the other youth teams except ours.

861
01:04:22,483 --> 01:04:26,237
Goodness. This soccer club
can't do anything right.

862
01:04:27,405 --> 01:04:29,907
Number 21 is your son, isn't he?

863
01:04:29,991 --> 01:04:31,784
What? You know my son?

864
01:04:32,618 --> 01:04:33,703
He's good.

865
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:35,746
He is, right?

866
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:37,832
Are you a family too?

867
01:04:39,292 --> 01:04:41,419
I'm here because I need to talk to you,

868
01:04:42,003 --> 01:04:43,045
Chief Prosecutor Hwang.

869
01:04:45,006 --> 01:04:45,840
Who are you?

870
01:04:46,424 --> 01:04:48,301
I'm an acquaintance of Choi Myung-hee.

871
01:04:49,510 --> 01:04:52,346
You must be out of your mind.
How dare you come here?

872
01:04:52,430 --> 01:04:53,598
Hey. Leave.

873
01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:56,309
Just give me one minute.

874
01:04:56,392 --> 01:04:57,977
I can't even give you a second.

875
01:04:58,060 --> 01:05:00,479
If you accept Choi Myung-hee's offer,

876
01:05:00,563 --> 01:05:03,065
I'll give you the thing you want the most.

877
01:05:05,151 --> 01:05:06,861
What is it that I want the most?

878
01:05:10,323 --> 01:05:12,283
Isn't it your dream

879
01:05:12,366 --> 01:05:14,619
to send your son to the European league?

880
01:05:16,245 --> 01:05:17,622
I can make that happen

881
01:05:18,581 --> 01:05:20,207
within 24 hours.

882
01:05:21,167 --> 01:05:23,377
What kind of crap is that?

883
01:05:23,961 --> 01:05:25,296
Who the hell are you?

884
01:05:36,807 --> 01:05:37,850
Wait.

885
01:05:46,609 --> 01:05:48,110
Isn't that…

886
01:05:48,194 --> 01:05:51,072
Sir, I didn't know that
Coach Rossi of BC Milano

887
01:05:51,155 --> 01:05:52,823
was going to visit our club.

888
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:00,957
That's my son.

889
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:01,958
Vincenzo!

890
01:06:02,041 --> 01:06:03,042
Giuseppe!

891
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:05,711
-How are you?
-Very good. Thanks.

892
01:06:06,337 --> 01:06:09,048
Is this the guy? Number 21?

893
01:06:09,632 --> 01:06:10,466
Yes.

894
01:06:12,468 --> 01:06:14,762
He's the worst player here.

895
01:06:15,596 --> 01:06:17,598
Yes, it's him.

896
01:06:17,682 --> 01:06:18,766
I'm sorry.

897
01:06:18,849 --> 01:06:20,059
Don't worry about it.

898
01:06:23,729 --> 01:06:25,648
-I'm so jealous.
-I'm so jealous.

899
01:06:26,649 --> 01:06:27,650
We're friends.

900
01:06:39,036 --> 01:06:39,954
Yes!

901
01:06:46,377 --> 01:06:48,045
SNAKE HWANG

902
01:06:48,129 --> 01:06:51,465
ATTORNEY CHOI MYUNG-HEE

903
01:06:56,303 --> 01:06:57,555
Hello, Chief Hwang.

904
01:07:00,141 --> 01:07:03,477
About the discussion we had the other day…
Let's try that again.

905
01:07:04,103 --> 01:07:06,439
Do you really mean it?

906
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:08,357
Yes.

907
01:07:09,734 --> 01:07:11,485
Okay. I got it.

908
01:07:12,570 --> 01:07:14,238
Thank you, sir.

909
01:08:11,462 --> 01:08:13,714
How on earth did you do it? How?

910
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:15,966
Let's talk outside.

911
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:19,553
I hope we'll never see each other again.

912
01:08:20,054 --> 01:08:21,972
I should be saying that to you.

913
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:30,856
Come on.

914
01:08:32,108 --> 01:08:32,942
Let's go.

915
01:08:35,694 --> 01:08:39,448
Come on. How did you do it?

916
01:08:41,075 --> 01:08:42,618
I cut a deal with Choi Myung-hee.

917
01:08:44,912 --> 01:08:46,288
What deal?

918
01:08:52,795 --> 01:08:58,092
I got her to release you in exchange
for convincing Chief Prosecutor Hwang.

919
01:09:03,139 --> 01:09:03,973
So…

920
01:09:04,765 --> 01:09:07,893
you cut a deal with Choi Myung-hee
who I despise the most.

921
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:11,480
As if that wasn't enough, you gave
Chief Hwang to her on a silver platter?

922
01:09:12,189 --> 01:09:13,566
Just to get me out?

923
01:09:14,692 --> 01:09:15,943
I'm sorry.

924
01:09:16,694 --> 01:09:17,903
I had no choice.

925
01:09:24,451 --> 01:09:25,411
Good job.

926
01:09:25,494 --> 01:09:28,122
Well done. That's what I'm talking about!

927
01:09:28,205 --> 01:09:29,540
That's so Mafia-like.

928
01:09:29,623 --> 01:09:31,750
You made an offer
she couldn't resist, right?

929
01:09:32,710 --> 01:09:35,754
You really are Mr. Mafia Lawyer.
I knew you could do it.

930
01:09:35,838 --> 01:09:37,464
Well done.

931
01:09:37,548 --> 01:09:40,259
Be quiet and let's go. Come on.

932
01:09:41,051 --> 01:09:44,430
Police officers, he's in the Mafia.
Isn't that fascinating?

933
01:09:44,513 --> 01:09:45,681
It fascinates me, too.

934
01:09:45,764 --> 01:09:47,641
I'm taking her to the hospital.

935
01:09:47,725 --> 01:09:49,560
How is this possible in Korea?

936
01:09:56,650 --> 01:09:58,235
-Honey, this is heavy.
-Okay.

937
01:09:58,319 --> 01:09:59,445
-Take this for me.
-Here.

938
01:10:00,738 --> 01:10:02,072
What's all that?

939
01:10:02,156 --> 01:10:05,910
Oh, this? The protesters
at the next building used these.

940
01:10:05,993 --> 01:10:07,870
We'll need these if we're going to fight.

941
01:10:07,953 --> 01:10:10,497
It all comes down to
what you equip yourself with.

942
01:10:10,581 --> 01:10:13,459
They make me want to fight even more.

943
01:10:15,044 --> 01:10:17,504
My goodness. I see.

944
01:10:17,588 --> 01:10:19,798
Gosh. You look beautiful.

945
01:10:19,882 --> 01:10:21,592
You look like a goddess.

946
01:10:21,675 --> 01:10:23,219
Goodness.

947
01:10:23,302 --> 01:10:27,306
It's my birthday today,
so I gave myself a present.

948
01:10:28,390 --> 01:10:30,434
I didn't know it was your birthday today.

949
01:10:30,517 --> 01:10:32,561
It's all right.

950
01:10:32,645 --> 01:10:36,023
Everyone, close your businesses early
and let's drink until we drop

951
01:10:36,106 --> 01:10:37,942
at my snack bar.

952
01:10:38,025 --> 01:10:40,194
-Are we having a party?
-I love it.

953
01:10:40,277 --> 01:10:42,112
You look pretty.

954
01:10:42,196 --> 01:10:44,657
-Hello.
-Stop it. That's enough.

955
01:10:45,783 --> 01:10:48,035
Okay. This order is
from the team leader at Babel.

956
01:10:48,118 --> 01:10:50,621
Only an elite group of us will go
without any machinery.

957
01:10:50,704 --> 01:10:52,289
-Are the guys ready?
-Yes, sir.

958
01:10:52,373 --> 01:10:53,749
-Yes, sir.
-Okay, and

959
01:10:53,832 --> 01:10:56,085
the protesters will be
wearing red jackets.

960
01:10:56,168 --> 01:10:58,379
Only beat up the ones
wearing red jackets, okay?

961
01:10:58,462 --> 01:10:59,380
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

962
01:10:59,463 --> 01:11:02,716
All right. If you have your tools ready,
let's go!

963
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:03,842
Excuse me.

964
01:11:04,426 --> 01:11:07,596
I have to report surtaxes today.
I need receipts from your meal.

965
01:11:08,430 --> 01:11:10,808
Do we really have to do that right now?

966
01:11:10,891 --> 01:11:13,560
The deadline is tomorrow.
Give me the receipts.

967
01:11:13,644 --> 01:11:15,521
Come on. She has to report surtaxes.

968
01:11:15,604 --> 01:11:17,898
So just give her the receipts. Now.

969
01:11:17,982 --> 01:11:20,192
Who has the receipt for jjolmyeon
from yesterday?

970
01:11:20,276 --> 01:11:22,194
-That's it. Yes. That's it.
-This is it?

971
01:11:23,862 --> 01:11:25,281
Who ordered extra rice?

972
01:11:27,741 --> 01:11:31,412
WE OPPOSE DEMOLITION
FIGHT

973
01:11:59,732 --> 01:12:00,733
Slow down.

974
01:12:00,816 --> 01:12:02,735
We need to hurry. It's almost time.

975
01:12:02,818 --> 01:12:03,652
Time for what?

976
01:12:03,736 --> 01:12:06,322
-Park Seok-do will raid the plaza soon.
-What?

977
01:12:06,405 --> 01:12:09,616
We should come up with a plan
before we just rush there.

978
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:10,951
Don't worry.

979
01:12:11,035 --> 01:12:14,330
I'm the one who made Park Seok-do
raid the plaza.

980
01:12:17,166 --> 01:12:20,002
I'll make Park Seok-do and his men
assault the tenants

981
01:12:20,085 --> 01:12:22,087
and expose that to the public.

982
01:12:23,255 --> 01:12:25,966
It will cause quite a scandal
on social media.

983
01:12:26,050 --> 01:12:29,011
They'll have to postpone
once people start condemning them.

984
01:12:29,094 --> 01:12:30,929
But the business owners may get hurt.

985
01:12:31,013 --> 01:12:32,348
You're right.

986
01:12:32,848 --> 01:12:34,224
That's why we can't hurt them.

987
01:12:34,308 --> 01:12:36,101
Get me some sturdy men

988
01:12:36,185 --> 01:12:38,354
and make them look like protesters.

989
01:12:39,396 --> 01:12:40,856
Let them get beaten up a little.

990
01:12:40,939 --> 01:12:44,485
They can retreat once we get the footage.

991
01:12:47,738 --> 01:12:50,199
How will I know
if they can take a few punches?

992
01:12:52,826 --> 01:12:53,911
Yeong-ho.

993
01:12:56,747 --> 01:12:59,875
I want you to film something
and post it on social media right away.

994
01:13:00,459 --> 01:13:02,628
No, I don't want to. I'm busy.

995
01:13:15,557 --> 01:13:17,142
What do I need to film?

996
01:13:18,394 --> 01:13:20,771
Order Park Seok-do to raid Geumga Plaza.

997
01:13:20,854 --> 01:13:23,649
He's really dangerous.

998
01:13:24,233 --> 01:13:26,652
What if someone gets hurt or dies?

999
01:13:27,778 --> 01:13:29,196
They won't.

1000
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:33,450
Have him attack
people wearing red jackets.

1001
01:13:35,244 --> 01:13:38,414
You are indeed in the Mafia.
Your plan is thorough and original.

1002
01:13:39,665 --> 01:13:42,960
Can you stop mentioning
that I'm in the Mafia?

1003
01:13:43,043 --> 01:13:45,963
But that's what you are.
Should I call you a yakuza instead?

1004
01:13:46,755 --> 01:13:49,967
Mafia

1005
01:14:02,896 --> 01:14:03,814
Yes.

1006
01:14:04,898 --> 01:14:06,066
The health center?

1007
01:14:07,609 --> 01:14:08,569
What?

1008
01:14:09,486 --> 01:14:11,071
I was in contact with a carrier?

1009
01:14:15,284 --> 01:14:19,788
Thank you.

1010
01:14:20,789 --> 01:14:24,710
I want to bury my face

1011
01:14:24,793 --> 01:14:28,922
In your chest

1012
01:14:29,006 --> 01:14:33,260
And cry today

1013
01:14:33,343 --> 01:14:35,679
-What's taking him so long?
-Sailing across

1014
01:14:35,762 --> 01:14:37,598
-Where are the drinks?
-The river of time

1015
01:15:01,079 --> 01:15:02,122
Hey!

1016
01:15:05,209 --> 01:15:06,835
Don't you work at the pasta place?

1017
01:15:06,919 --> 01:15:07,920
Yes.

1018
01:15:09,129 --> 01:15:11,757
-What is it?
-How dare you talk back?

1019
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:14,218
Hey, it's a red jacket!

1020
01:15:14,301 --> 01:15:16,136
-Hey, he's wearing red!
-Hello.

1021
01:15:17,471 --> 01:15:19,306
-What? Get him!
-Hey! Get him!

1022
01:15:27,064 --> 01:15:29,942
In our dreams

1023
01:15:30,025 --> 01:15:32,528
-That's it. Go.
-Let's go!

1024
01:15:32,611 --> 01:15:35,113
-How long
-How long?

1025
01:15:35,197 --> 01:15:37,824
Must I wait

1026
01:15:38,575 --> 01:15:41,245
To see you?

1027
01:15:41,328 --> 01:15:42,329
Mom!

1028
01:15:43,038 --> 01:15:44,540
Mom, come on!

1029
01:15:44,623 --> 01:15:48,043
You brat. How dare you interrupt
your mom when she's singing?

1030
01:15:48,126 --> 01:15:50,295
You know those thugs that come here?

1031
01:15:50,379 --> 01:15:52,089
They are beating up Mr. An.

1032
01:15:52,172 --> 01:15:53,257
-What?
-What?

1033
01:15:53,340 --> 01:15:55,467
-Damn it.
-What?

1034
01:15:55,551 --> 01:15:58,554
Those assholes have
really asked for it now.

1035
01:15:58,637 --> 01:15:59,972
There will be blood!

1036
01:16:00,055 --> 01:16:02,015
They brought this upon themselves.

1037
01:16:02,099 --> 01:16:03,475
I'll kill them all.

1038
01:16:03,559 --> 01:16:06,478
-Let's go.
-Let's do this!

1039
01:16:06,562 --> 01:16:07,854
-Wait.
-Let's go.

1040
01:16:07,938 --> 01:16:10,691
-Let's go!
-Let's teach them a lesson!

1041
01:16:10,774 --> 01:16:12,818
-Let's go get them.
-Let's go.

1042
01:16:12,901 --> 01:16:15,237
-Are you wearing shoes?
-Go!

1043
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:17,197
Are you wearing shoes?

1044
01:16:17,281 --> 01:16:19,241
-Let's go!
-We'll get them!

1045
01:16:23,787 --> 01:16:25,038
What's this?

1046
01:17:37,527 --> 01:17:38,528
Are they fighting?

1047
01:17:43,825 --> 01:17:44,785
Mr. Cho.

1048
01:17:45,869 --> 01:17:49,081
Yes. It's going very smoothly.

1049
01:17:49,164 --> 01:17:50,040
What?

1050
01:17:50,666 --> 01:17:52,709
No. That can't be.

1051
01:17:52,793 --> 01:17:57,172
One of the people I hired
came in contact with an infected person.

1052
01:17:57,255 --> 01:18:01,385
They were afraid they might
end up infecting the others

1053
01:18:01,468 --> 01:18:03,095
so they all went to get tested.

1054
01:18:05,263 --> 01:18:07,557
Then who are these people fighting here?

1055
01:18:12,854 --> 01:18:14,690
My goodness. Oh, my.

1056
01:18:22,656 --> 01:18:24,491
I've seen this somewhere before.

1057
01:18:52,644 --> 01:18:54,730
SPECIAL THANKS TO CHA SOON-BAE
AND KIM BYUNG-JI

1058
01:19:19,588 --> 01:19:23,258
We have to stop this investment
at all costs.

1059
01:19:23,341 --> 01:19:26,511
You do know
that I still have your case, right?

1060
01:19:26,595 --> 01:19:29,514
Don't waste your breath.

1061
01:19:29,598 --> 01:19:31,057
Is there another way?

1062
01:19:31,141 --> 01:19:34,895
There is a way to stop the investment
and bring down the president.

1063
01:19:34,978 --> 01:19:37,355
And villains don't deserve to love.

1064
01:19:37,439 --> 01:19:39,065
Not everyone deserves to love.

1065
01:19:39,149 --> 01:19:42,778
I need someone who can be
the devil himself for me.

1066
01:19:42,861 --> 01:19:46,031
This is it! This is exactly what I wanted!

1067
01:19:46,114 --> 01:19:48,074
Looks like I'll have to
break the promise I made

1068
01:19:48,158 --> 01:19:49,993
that I wouldn't hurt anyone.

1069
01:19:51,536 --> 01:19:56,541
