1
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:13,239
Today…

2
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:16,993
We finally made it.

3
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:22,248
I still can't believe
that this is all gold.

4
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,642
There are cultural assets as well.

5
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:17,262
Thank you for everything, Mr. Cassano.

6
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:21,349
What a bitter price for a friendship.

7
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:23,810
If you don't move until I get out,

8
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:26,896
I won't harm you.

9
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:29,899
Why are you doing this?

10
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,568
I cannot tell you.

11
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:35,446
I just need to take one gold bar with me.

12
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,804
You're doing this for just one gold bar?

13
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:03,224
Step back.

14
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:08,980
When I'm completely out of here,

15
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:11,774
you can come up then.

16
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,454
And you're not going
to close the door on me?

17
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:27,081
I told you I will not harm you.

18
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:32,128
Can I take one as a souvenir?

19
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:12,126
I didn't know gold is this heavy.

20
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:14,963
Don't move until I get out.

21
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:17,090
If you follow me, I'll shoot you.

22
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:18,216
Okay.

23
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:20,969
By the way,

24
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:23,388
why are you taking only one?

25
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:25,014
This is enough for me.

26
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:28,935
It must be heavy.

27
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:32,647
Why didn't you just take
the Guillotine file?

28
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:37,568
How did you know that?

29
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:44,492
I know you've been helping me
all this time because of it.

30
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:47,870
-Don't come any closer.
-Anyway…

31
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:51,291
do you really think the file is in there?

32
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,169
Do you?

33
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:53,019
All right.

34
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:54,645
The best floors at Babel Tower.

35
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:58,149
I'll start with
the 120th and 121st floors.

36
00:05:58,232 --> 00:06:01,527
Not one but two floors will
belong to one person.

37
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:05,239
Go ahead and move me.

38
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:07,700
I'd like to try.

39
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:10,870
-Go ahead.
-As you all know,

40
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:15,083
many lawsuits are about to be filed
against Babel.

41
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:18,419
And I must take care of them all.

42
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:19,837
Why?

43
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:23,841
To ensure the power of Babel
remains undiminished!

44
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,974
I'll make sure Babel E&C wins the contract

45
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,685
to build new cities in Taesan and Jungsan.

46
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:37,772
I can get both political parties
and the Ministry of Land on board.

47
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:41,776
I'm getting excited.

48
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:44,445
Okay.

49
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:46,614
As you are already aware,

50
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:50,284
Daechang Daily are the leaders
of public opinion in Korea.

51
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:53,704
I'll make sure Babel is never criticized
by the press again.

52
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:58,126
I'll give you more than
just Babel Tower.

53
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:00,628
I'll sponsor Daechang Daily
for some ads too.

54
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:06,134
What is it?

55
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:11,681
Who are you?

56
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:14,767
I'm sorry I'm late.

57
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,936
I had an urgent meeting.

58
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,481
I'm Director Tae Jong-gu of
the International Organized Crime Bureau

59
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:22,650
at the International Security
Intelligence Service.

60
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:29,782
Welcome.

61
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:37,248
EPISODE 13

62
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:49,719
You should have loaded the gun
with at least one bullet.

63
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,062
I'll assume that
you still consider me your friend

64
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:02,440
and ask you this as your friend.

65
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:05,610
Who do you really work for?

66
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:11,032
I'm an agent at the International Security
Intelligence Service.

67
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,034
I see.

68
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:19,916
So you pretended to resign
to find the Guillotine file.

69
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:25,546
You pretended to be a corporate spy
and approached Mr. Wang, too. Right?

70
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:27,048
Yes.

71
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:32,595
What about me?

72
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,267
Meeting you was truly a coincidence.

73
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,437
When I almost died in Italy,

74
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:43,856
you saved me.

75
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:46,817
Right.

76
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:52,573
Mr. Wang's death wasn't natural, was it?

77
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:13,719
Thank you.

78
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:18,224
You bastard…

79
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:20,184
I've underestimated you.

80
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:29,110
Hurry!

81
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:31,070
Call an ambulance. Now!

82
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:39,370
I guess I was wrong about you.

83
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:41,956
You really are quite scary.

84
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:47,169
Right. I'm not really a good guy.

85
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:52,550
I knew from the start
that you were lying to me.

86
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:54,468
You said that Wang's museum

87
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:56,846
in Hangzhou had data on his iris.

88
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,641
But it turned out
that no such thing existed.

89
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:07,273
You went to your office in China
a while ago.

90
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:09,734
Why didn't you take it out then?

91
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:13,571
That was before I obtained
the data on Wang's iris.

92
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:17,116
I was still planning the operation then.

93
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:19,410
Then you shouldn't have rented it out.

94
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:20,828
Why did you let the monks move in?

95
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:23,331
I thought leaving it empty
would be riskier.

96
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:26,167
There could be someone
who knew about this place.

97
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:32,715
Did anyone see Mr. Vincenzo

98
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:35,718
and the previous building owner meeting
before we left?

99
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:38,304
-I saw them.
-Me too.

100
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:40,681
They came together from over there.

101
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:45,311
Is it just me or is anyone else wondering

102
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:47,980
why the two of them met
after sending us away?

103
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:51,817
I heard they had a meeting today.

104
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:55,363
I really don't want to accuse anyone,

105
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:57,073
but it really is rather suspicious.

106
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:59,950
Are you saying that they sent us away
to look for the gold?

107
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:08,125
Gosh, don't be like that.
I was just throwing it out there.

108
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:10,086
Let's not start suspecting each other.

109
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:12,338
We trust Mr. Vincenzo, don't we?

110
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:16,759
Maybe they're looking for the gold
so that Babel can't get to it first.

111
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:19,095
You're being quite unreasonable.

112
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:21,305
Right. Let's just enjoy the trip.

113
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:24,141
How about a singing contest
to lighten the mood?

114
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:25,518
-It's good, isn't it?
-Right.

115
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:26,811
One, two

116
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:29,313
-one, two, three
-But then again,

117
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:32,108
twenty million won for a photo
does sound pretty suspicious.

118
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,154
What is it now?

119
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:40,950
I can't say anything, can I?

120
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:44,495
The Guillotine file…

121
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:48,499
You weren't going to hand it over
to your agency, right?

122
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:50,376
You haven't even reported it in yet.

123
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:56,841
If you did, they would've forcibly opened
the basement and taken it.

124
00:11:58,092 --> 00:11:59,385
Why didn't you report it?

125
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:01,804
To make another deal?

126
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:05,099
Well, I get it.

127
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,768
That will be more profitable, right?

128
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:12,356
Who were you going to sell it to?

129
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:16,193
I haven't decided yet.

130
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:18,404
But how did you know about this file?

131
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:24,326
You're not the only informant I have.

132
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:34,962
Where to first?

133
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,257
-I'm going first!
-Come on.

134
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,342
Goodness. Don't run!

135
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:42,761
Hey!

136
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:44,847
I told you not to run!

137
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:48,767
-Gosh. Keep going!
-Honey. Wait up.

138
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:50,936
Where are you going?

139
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:57,234
It seems everyone is in agony
because of the gold.

140
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:58,486
I agree.

141
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:01,947
They do not know
that greed brings about pain.

142
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:04,241
How could they be so frivolous?

143
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:09,121
My gosh. If we get help from
Keum Gwang-jin, we'll find it right away.

144
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:13,584
You go upstairs.
And I'll check downstairs.

145
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:15,336
-Gosh, that's a lot of work.
-Wait.

146
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:20,007
Honey, hurry!

147
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:21,759
Don't run. You'll hurt yourself.

148
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:24,261
HONG CHA-YOUNG

149
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:30,184
-Yes?
-What didn't you pick up?

150
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:32,645
What is it?

151
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:36,565
The tenants are back at the plaza now
and on their way to the basement.

152
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:42,029
What's wrong?

153
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:44,990
The tenants are back.

154
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:50,329
-Close the hatch.
-We should clean this up.

155
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,626
No. Not my jacket.

156
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:57,044
Why put that in your pants?

157
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:11,517
Hold on.

158
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:13,936
-The gold!
-What gold?

159
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:15,813
The gold we took out. The gold!

160
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:18,232
Over there.

161
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:20,651
Hold it tight. Don't let go.

162
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,754
What?

163
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:42,631
Wait.

164
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:44,592
-Sir.
-Go that way.

165
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:02,401
I doubt there's anything down here.

166
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:05,779
Come to think of it,
we never searched this area.

167
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:07,990
Places like this is
where they probably hid it.

168
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,784
Slowly. There we go.

169
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:12,953
Now, over here.

170
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,668
-Mr. Tak!
-Mr. Tak!

171
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,882
What? Why did you two follow me here?

172
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:28,385
There's an important matter
I must discuss with you.

173
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:30,012
What important matter?

174
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:35,684
I think my father may have told me
a long time ago…

175
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:40,481
where the gold is.

176
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:43,192
-Really?
-Where is it?

177
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,569
Tell us.

178
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:49,156
It was…

179
00:15:57,831 --> 00:15:58,791
We need one more.

180
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:02,628
Where could that be?

181
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:05,714
Gosh. Just tell me already.

182
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:07,675
It's in our hearts.

183
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:09,718
I also heard him say that.

184
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:13,597
He said that the most precious treasure
is right here. A heart of gold.

185
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:15,683
That's a load of nonsense.

186
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:17,267
Are you distracting us?

187
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:19,436
No. No way.

188
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:23,649
Put your hands on your chest and feel it.

189
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,238
Over there. Hold on.

190
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:32,741
What was that sound?

191
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,619
-No.
-Someone is in the temple.

192
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:36,829
-It's--
-I heard a sound.

193
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:38,747
No. It was from me. I made that sound.

194
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:41,375
-I made the sound with my shoes like this.
-Yes.

195
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:45,379
With your hands on your chest,
close your eyes and feel your heart.

196
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:47,589
No. I'm sure the sound
came from the temple.

197
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,049
No. Go like this.

198
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,594
Where are you going?
You have to feel the gold in your heart!

199
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:05,024
Why did you guys come back?

200
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:09,236
What are you two doing here?

201
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,159
We're doing 108 bows.

202
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:16,994
All of a sudden?

203
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:19,496
You're doing the 108 bows? Why?

204
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:25,544
It's to rid our hearts
of greed and selfishness.

205
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,716
Help us, merciful Buddha.

206
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,426
Help us, merciful Buddha.

207
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:37,806
We must finish all the bows today.

208
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:39,933
Please give us some privacy.

209
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:48,442
All right. Let us all go now.

210
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:53,072
Let's look for the gold in our hearts.

211
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:03,248
-Mr. Cassano.
-Yes?

212
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,627
I believe we are in deep trouble.

213
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:09,171
What do you mean?

214
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:13,092
I think we left…

215
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:19,223
the recognition device for Wang's iris
in the basement earlier.

216
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,354
What are you talking about?

217
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:30,609
You threw my jacket
in the secret basement.

218
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,445
Yes, I did. What about it?

219
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:36,657
The device is in that jacket.

220
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:56,593
Hey!

221
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,053
Why you…

222
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:00,472
-Please, don't.
-Damn…

223
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:03,433
"Damn"? It was you
who threw my jacket in there.

224
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:05,435
Why would you put that in your jacket?

225
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:08,230
Then, where else?
Should I carry that around?

226
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:09,481
But you must have

227
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:12,359
more than one of them right?

228
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:17,447
There's only one.
The one and only in the entire universe!

229
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:19,449
-You!
-You're yelling again.

230
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:26,540
Now we must demolish this building
if we want to get the gold.

231
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:31,003
It feels like my heart is crumbling now.

232
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:38,594
What happened?

233
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:42,598
Doing 108 bows allowed us

234
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,809
to feel the presence
of the merciful Buddha in our hearts.

235
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,651
I've never seen anyone cry
while being enlightened.

236
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:57,279
If they achieve enlightenment
one more time,

237
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:59,031
our ears will not last.

238
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:06,455
How could you think I'd do that?

239
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:08,707
You know,

240
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:13,378
I considered you my family.

241
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:16,006
We've been through a lot together

242
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:17,341
and will stay together.

243
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:19,885
Isn't that right?

244
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:21,178
-Yes.
-Yes.

245
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:22,888
Then, should you…

246
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:27,184
Should you suspect me like that or not?

247
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:29,019
-We shouldn't.
-We shouldn't.

248
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:34,233
I believed that you all trusted me.

249
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:45,452
Mr. Nam.

250
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:47,079
You guys are so heartless.

251
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:50,040
We care so much about you all.

252
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:56,421
I'm sorry.

253
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:59,174
We were so thoughtless.

254
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:02,886
What really did it for me was
the prize money of 20 million won.

255
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:05,639
It was such an unbelievable offer.

256
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:13,855
Twenty million won is a lot of money.

257
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:18,318
But I made that money
from investing in the stock market,

258
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:20,195
so I wanted to share it with you!

259
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:22,406
Which company did you invest in?

260
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:24,825
-Hey.
-Gosh. What's wrong with you?

261
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,160
I'm deeply disappointed in you guys.

262
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:30,664
I think it will take some time

263
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:33,959
for my wound to heal.

264
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:36,336
Same here. It will take a long time

265
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:38,714
for my heart to heal.

266
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:47,139
Let me apologize to you
on behalf of the tenants.

267
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:48,890
Forget it.

268
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:50,976
I'll get going now.

269
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:53,937
We're sorry.

270
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:03,405
All right.

271
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:06,491
Now that we hashed it out,
let's go to the hot spring.

272
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:09,703
Forget about the hot spring.
Mr. Cassano is mad at us now.

273
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:12,581
All right. Everyone.

274
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:16,335
Let us look for the gold in our hearts.

275
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:18,045
I guess we're not going.

276
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:33,769
So? Is there really gold in there?

277
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:41,109
Gold bars and the Guillotine file as well?

278
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:42,778
Yes.

279
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:47,199
Including a huge gold statue of Buddha.

280
00:22:48,366 --> 00:22:50,494
-Oh, my!
-That hurts so much.

281
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:52,287
It hurts so much, but I'm so happy!

282
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:53,246
Mr. Nam!

283
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:58,126
Well done. Great job. Nicely done.

284
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,837
Good job!

285
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:03,673
All right. Let's see.

286
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:06,885
We'll send them to see
cherry blossoms this time.

287
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:08,220
We can open it again then.

288
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:09,971
Let's open it again.

289
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,348
Open it again.

290
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:12,933
We can't open it again.

291
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:14,643
We can't open it.

292
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:15,977
Great.

293
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,395
That's much better…

294
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:27,531
We can't open it now.

295
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:32,410
Mr. Nam!

296
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:43,255
I expected this,
but everyone is so brazen.

297
00:23:43,338 --> 00:23:44,506
They have no shame.

298
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:48,093
They don't find it shameful
as long as it stays hidden.

299
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:50,387
Forget about feeling ashamed.

300
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:53,723
They probably think
that they got a fair deal.

301
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:56,309
It should be enough to cover
the legal world, the press,

302
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:59,646
the National Assembly,
and an intelligence agency,

303
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:01,815
right?

304
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:04,818
Yes. It will be more than enough.

305
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:12,909
Are you disappointed?

306
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:17,664
No. You should definitely
take over the company.

307
00:24:17,747 --> 00:24:21,751
I will do my best to assist you
from now on.

308
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:23,003
No.

309
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:24,880
Just stay put if you want to help me.

310
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,675
Okay. I got it.

311
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:32,929
Since we're all here today,

312
00:24:33,763 --> 00:24:36,600
there's something I'd like to
bring your attention to.

313
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:39,811
I'm not sure if you heard of this.

314
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:43,148
It's called the Guillotine file.

315
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:47,110
-Mr. Han.
-We can't hide it forever, Ms. Choi.

316
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:53,533
What's that?

317
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:57,245
Well, it's a long story.

318
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:58,663
So it is…

319
00:24:59,497 --> 00:25:02,459
We must go back a few years.

320
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:17,140
Then, we can't take anything out now.

321
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:20,936
The gold, the Guillotine file,

322
00:25:21,811 --> 00:25:23,063
and the gold Buddha statue.

323
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:24,773
I even picked out a house,

324
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:27,317
a car,

325
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:32,155
and stocks to buy.

326
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:34,824
On top of that, the partner
you fully trusted turned out

327
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:37,953
to be an agent of the International
Security Intelligence Service.

328
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:40,372
He even betrayed you on top of that.

329
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:47,462
This is just the worst!

330
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:53,385
Tell me there's another way.

331
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:56,763
You're the consigliere.
You're smart and strategic.

332
00:25:56,846 --> 00:25:58,014
There's none.

333
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:01,142
None.

334
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:07,023
Except for demolishing this building,
there's no other way.

335
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:10,568
Cheetah.

336
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:14,239
Should we tear it down and die with
the gold to see them even for a moment?

337
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:15,865
I'll just forget about it.

338
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:18,285
That gold wasn't mine to begin with.

339
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:21,371
People ought to know their places.

340
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:28,753
My gold!

341
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:31,172
My gold!

342
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:33,091
-Stop it.
-My gold!

343
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:40,849
Mr. Nam. Wait.

344
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,396
Ms. Hong.

345
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:49,274
Tell me.

346
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:51,860
How much damage will that file do to us?

347
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:53,653
I don't know the details,

348
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:56,489
but it could damage the entire group.

349
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:58,908
Just how serious is it?

350
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:00,660
From what I've heard,

351
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:03,788
it even has information
on the late chairman's private life.

352
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:09,127
The auction went well today.

353
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:11,546
Can't they handle this?

354
00:27:11,629 --> 00:27:13,131
My guess is,

355
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:16,676
more than half of the people there
are probably in the file.

356
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:24,017
Then, there's no point bribing them
with my tower.

357
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,603
That's not true. Please give me some time.

358
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:31,566
Is there any way we can find that file
right now?

359
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:35,236
Why are you so incompetent?

360
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,404
I'm sorry.

361
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:38,823
For now, it's impossible to find it.

362
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:40,241
Find it even if it costs

363
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:41,618
as much as ten billion won.

364
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:45,580
Yes, sir.
I'll put our experts to work on this.

365
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:53,129
Goodness.

366
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,221
I told you not to tell him
until we had a solution.

367
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:05,350
I told him because we wouldn't
be able to find any solutions.

368
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:09,604
Besides, if we keep something like this
from him, it will be worse.

369
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,983
Hey, Han Seung-hyuk.

370
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:16,820
Yes, Myung-hee.

371
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:21,616
Did you tell Chairman Jang Han-seok
about the file to prove your loyalty?

372
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:24,160
What are you talking about?

373
00:28:24,744 --> 00:28:26,871
Or are you two-timing or something?

374
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:30,250
Because he'd kill you if he found out
you've sided with his brother?

375
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:32,001
My gosh.

376
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:35,713
Why are you making up stories about me?

377
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:38,174
-Seung-hyuk.
-Yes?

378
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:41,845
You know that if this two-timing stunt
goes wrong, it'll cost you.

379
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:47,475
And if it does,
it could end up costing you your life.

380
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:48,560
Okay?

381
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,937
Gosh. Come on.

382
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:52,939
Myung-hee.

383
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,816
Don't forget who I am.

384
00:28:56,317 --> 00:28:58,778
I wouldn't have made it this far
if I were that ballsy.

385
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:01,531
You did just fine,
but now you're going to have problems.

386
00:29:01,614 --> 00:29:03,199
Gosh.

387
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:06,327
Silly Myung-hee.

388
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:10,999
Don't you know that I'm loyal?
You know that.

389
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:14,753
Why are you scowling at me like that?
You're scaring me.

390
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:18,506
I'll be loyal and protect you always.

391
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:21,217
Gosh. I'm busy. I should go now.

392
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:22,844
Hello? Wait, no.

393
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:24,929
I'm not getting a call. Hey, open it.

394
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:27,640
Gosh.

395
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:31,644
If he keeps being reckless,
he really is going to end up dead.

396
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:35,398
WARD 16

397
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:37,567
-Wait.
-What is this?

398
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:38,735
-What?
-What are you doing?

399
00:29:38,818 --> 00:29:39,861
What?

400
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:46,659
Nam Sin-bae, you traitor!
Are you even human?

401
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:47,827
Sir!

402
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:49,370
-You can't leave us!
-No!

403
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:51,748
-Sir!
-Honey!

404
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:54,042
-Move back.
-That's my son!

405
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:56,169
I can't go! My son is right here!

406
00:29:56,252 --> 00:29:59,380
My gosh. What am I going to do?

407
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:05,595
BODY OF DECEASED UNION LEADER
TAKEN TO PREVENT UNION FUNERAL

408
00:30:05,678 --> 00:30:08,640
FOOTAGE PROVIDED
BY THE FAMILY OF THE DECEASED

409
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,768
What are those men doing?

410
00:30:11,851 --> 00:30:16,648
The company's union members are taking
the body of the late union leader,

411
00:30:16,731 --> 00:30:18,775
so they won't be able to
hold a union funeral.

412
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:30,995
They came to Geumga Plaza once.

413
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:34,040
The Gurkha knife tattoos.

414
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:36,960
Right. I heard about them.

415
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:39,963
Apparently, they are brutal.

416
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:42,298
But are they now in the company union?

417
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:44,968
Half of their members are thugs like them.

418
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:48,555
But what is this union funeral
that you mentioned earlier?

419
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:51,099
Like its name,

420
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:54,811
it is a huge funeral where every member
of the Babel Chemicals' union attends.

421
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:58,439
It will be covered by the press,
boosting the morale of the union.

422
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:01,276
They're not letting them hold a funeral

423
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:04,112
to keep the union's morale down.

424
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:08,157
Wusang must assume that I will postpone
summoning Chairman Jang Han-seok

425
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:11,786
because my key witness,
the union leader, died.

426
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:14,622
Then let's catch them off guard.
You should summon him.

427
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:16,624
But I don't have any hard evidence.

428
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:20,837
They hindered the investigation
in ways I can't even imagine.

429
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:24,757
So I really needed
the union leader's testimony.

430
00:31:25,758 --> 00:31:27,677
Did you question Choi Myung-hee?

431
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,887
Of course.

432
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:30,346
You haven't changed!

433
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:32,223
Did you have to get him killed?

434
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:33,850
You'd better watch your tongue.

435
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:36,144
How dare you accuse me without evidence?

436
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:38,605
Because you're not the type
to leave behind evidence.

437
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:40,231
But isn't this so obvious?

438
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:43,067
How could he die right after
having a meal with you?

439
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:46,195
I didn't get him killed!
It was the drunk driver!

440
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:50,199
I guess a coincidence is enough
to indict someone these days.

441
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:51,659
"A coincidence"?

442
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:54,871
Why do these "coincidences"
keep happening in your favor?

443
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:56,789
You can't even prove your claim.

444
00:31:56,873 --> 00:31:59,167
Talking crap doesn't make you
a prosecutor.

445
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:03,254
If you want to follow your hunches,
go and become a shaman!

446
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:07,175
I don't have to see it.
I can picture her so vividly.

447
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:09,552
Gosh. I hate her.

448
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:11,262
Given the cards we're dealt,

449
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:13,640
summoning Chairman Jang will be pointless.

450
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:15,058
I think so too.

451
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:17,268
If the first case against them
gets crushed,

452
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:19,729
the remaining five indictments
will crumble, too.

453
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:24,233
You know what they say.

454
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:27,737
It's all about the first punch, right?

455
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:31,157
We'll try to collect the evidence
in our own way.

456
00:32:35,536 --> 00:32:37,038
I am embarrassed as a prosecutor,

457
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:38,498
but I need your help.

458
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:43,711
JANG HAN-SEOK DIRECTLY SUPERVISES
THE VISION TEAM

459
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:47,632
All the union-related matters
with Babel's subsidiaries

460
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:51,010
are handled by the Vision Team,
who directly answers to the chairman.

461
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:00,561
It won't be easy.

462
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:02,563
They are highly loyal to their boss.

463
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:06,526
Right. People like them
aren't afraid of going to prison.

464
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:10,613
Then we must find something
that is scarier than prison to them.

465
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:14,909
It's probably better to go after
the company union than the Vision Team.

466
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:16,244
I did some research

467
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:18,705
and found that these punks
are just the worst.

468
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:21,624
And they take orders from the Vision Team.

469
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:24,419
Let's find out
who the company union leader is first.

470
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:32,218
All right.

471
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:35,805
Let's go and find out
who the king of the lackies is.

472
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:37,098
Gosh.

473
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:41,227
Why did you want to have a meeting here
instead of our office?

474
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:43,479
Exactly, my point. Can you help me?

475
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:44,647
Let me help you.

476
00:33:47,775 --> 00:33:50,361
All I wanted was a breath of fresh air.

477
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:07,837
Don't point a gun at me ever again.

478
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:11,716
I'm letting it slide this time

479
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:13,551
because I've thought of you
as a true friend.

480
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:15,428
I'm sorry for what happened,

481
00:34:16,095 --> 00:34:19,140
but I considered you
more than just a business partner.

482
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:21,893
You saved my life.

483
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:24,979
I believe you.

484
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:28,232
Please keep helping me
like you've been doing,

485
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:30,610
so we can figure this out.

486
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:49,295
You're here.

487
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:05,561
I'm sorry.

488
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:09,065
It's been a long time since I last drove,
so I got lost.

489
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:12,944
I did…

490
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:16,572
everything you told me to do.

491
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:22,120
But look what happened!

492
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:24,539
Nothing worked out in my favor!

493
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:27,750
Had you shot him accurately that day,
we wouldn't have been--

494
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:30,545
You said I didn't need to aim
because it was a shotgun!

495
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:31,462
Didn't you?

496
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:33,047
I'm sorry.

497
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:35,800
My brother is going to kill me.
It's only a matter of time.

498
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:39,554
He'll just keep me around for a while
then kill me out of nowhere.

499
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:43,307
I doubt that he will do that to you.

500
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:46,853
You are his family.

501
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:49,605
-Have you forgotten?
-What?

502
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:53,484
My brother even killed
his own father himself.

503
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:55,736
-Oh, right.
-"Oh, right"?

504
00:35:57,196 --> 00:36:01,033
That makes you the only family he has now.

505
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:04,495
Let's just think that way.
We should be positive.

506
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:08,541
Fine.

507
00:36:08,624 --> 00:36:11,252
Let's say that I get lucky
and somehow stay alive.

508
00:36:12,628 --> 00:36:14,213
Even if I'm alive,

509
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:15,590
there is

510
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:20,303
nothing I can do now. None whatsoever.

511
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:23,681
Are you sure? There's nothing? I'm sure
there has to be something. Think.

512
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:25,558
Yes!

513
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:29,270
This is a chance for you to take a break.

514
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:32,899
Then you can become a bigger idiot.

515
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:35,151
-What are you talking about?
-Listen.

516
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:37,486
You have to make him lower his guard.

517
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:41,657
You must show him
that you have no ulterior motive.

518
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:43,868
Remember Korean history.

519
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:45,912
To avoid
the Andong Kim clan's persecution,

520
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:49,290
Prince Heungseon pretended to be
an idiot and ruled the world in the end!

521
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:52,084
He was King Gojong's father.

522
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:54,545
-I know that.
-Exactly. Just like that prince,

523
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:57,757
you should turn into a total idiot.
Just do it.

524
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:02,845
You assholes.
It's my taxes that pays your salary.

525
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:04,931
Can't you do anything right?

526
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:06,557
-Hey, you.
-What?

527
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:08,809
Didn't I tell you
to get me a cheeseburger?

528
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:10,019
You're here.

529
00:37:10,102 --> 00:37:11,520
What's going on?

530
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:14,357
He assaulted an employee at a bar.
He's been making a scene.

531
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,150
We stopped the reporters for now.

532
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:17,401
You should take him now.

533
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:22,281
Let go of me. Let go!

534
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:26,494
Hey, I'll give you guys some pocket money.

535
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:29,622
I'll pay whoever locks those bastards up.

536
00:37:29,705 --> 00:37:31,123
All right. Take it.

537
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:33,084
Take it, you bums.

538
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:36,754
Mr. Jang.

539
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:40,758
Ms. Choi.

540
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:43,302
Ms. Choi. I'm glad that you're here.

541
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:49,058
Sue everyone in here. I don't care
if they are cops. Lock all of them up!

542
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:53,729
CHAIRMAN JANG HAN-SEOK
TO BE INAUGURATED TOMORROW

543
00:37:57,566 --> 00:37:58,401
FORMERLY EMPLOYED AT WUSANG

544
00:37:58,484 --> 00:38:01,737
He must think he's a K-pop idol.
This is so ridiculous.

545
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:02,905
CHAIRMAN JANG HAN-SEOK'S
LAID-BACK LIFESTYLE

546
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:04,907
People abroad call him the "Handsome CEO."

547
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:07,243
Reporters are having a field day.

548
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:10,663
This isn't an article but an entry
to the annual spring literary contest.

549
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:13,582
Anyway, this is what we wanted.

550
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:16,252
He'll reveal himself tomorrow.

551
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:20,214
Did Mr. Jung set a date
for the invitation?

552
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:21,173
What?

553
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:24,010
They'll summon and question him
for anti-union activities?

554
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:25,636
Chairman Jang Han-seok?

555
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:29,682
To stick it to us, they'll question him
the day after his inauguration ceremony.

556
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:35,813
We expected them to give up.

557
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:39,358
The union leader is dead.
I doubt he has any evidence.

558
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:41,694
Well, it's one or the other.

559
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:45,031
He's too embarrassed to give up,

560
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:47,533
or he actually has evidence.

561
00:38:47,616 --> 00:38:51,037
You should have planned something
before you had the leader killed.

562
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:52,621
Are you blaming me?

563
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:55,750
I'm not blaming you. Gosh, no way.

564
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:59,462
I'm just worried
that things might go wrong.

565
00:39:00,921 --> 00:39:02,548
I don't care…

566
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:05,760
as long as the Vision Team
doesn't get raided.

567
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:09,638
They can't get a warrant
unless they have something substantial.

568
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:11,432
And Mr. Hwang won't let them.

569
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:14,477
Well, I'll let them take a few photos
since they're summoning him.

570
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:17,688
Maybe I'll go to a salon in the morning.

571
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:25,446
You caused trouble when you knew
it's my inauguration ceremony today?

572
00:39:29,241 --> 00:39:30,409
I'm sorry.

573
00:39:32,161 --> 00:39:35,664
I was just so happy.
I drank a bit too much.

574
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:38,292
Please forgive me.

575
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:41,754
There's nothing to forgive.

576
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:46,592
It's nice to see the old you again.

577
00:39:47,676 --> 00:39:49,136
Keep that up, okay?

578
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:55,851
I think I was born to live recklessly
like this.

579
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:58,479
-I feel at ease, too.
-Here.

580
00:40:03,442 --> 00:40:05,569
It symbolizes
the union of our brotherhood.

581
00:40:15,996 --> 00:40:18,040
Let's never betray each other

582
00:40:18,707 --> 00:40:20,626
and work together to put Babel at the top.

583
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:29,593
We have to make people think

584
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:32,179
that this country will be in ruins
if Babel goes down.

585
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:35,224
Yes, sir.

586
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:45,234
Did I tell you…

587
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:48,654
why I let the shooting incident slide?

588
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:53,993
That…

589
00:40:55,077 --> 00:40:57,663
That really was an accident.

590
00:40:58,372 --> 00:41:00,624
How could I do such a thing to you?

591
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:05,045
I need you alive.

592
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:09,884
If you die, who will take the rap for me?

593
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:16,807
If I'm ever on the verge of going to jail
after the takeover,

594
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:19,477
you'll take the fall in my place.

595
00:41:20,394 --> 00:41:21,479
Don't you agree?

596
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:24,648
Yes.

597
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:27,902
Right.

598
00:41:28,777 --> 00:41:29,987
That's right.

599
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:32,698
I will go to jail for you.

600
00:41:32,781 --> 00:41:34,366
Right. Sir.

601
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:37,786
I can assure you
that I'll do well in prison.

602
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:40,706
Yes. That's right. Please don't worry.

603
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:43,334
I will do anything for you.

604
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:50,716
I knew I could count on you.

605
00:41:52,801 --> 00:41:54,220
Let's go to the ceremony.

606
00:42:53,612 --> 00:42:54,697
This way, sir.

607
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:01,161
Hold on. Wait. Let me fix that.

608
00:43:01,787 --> 00:43:03,372
Square your shoulders, sir.

609
00:43:03,455 --> 00:43:06,083
-Babel will be born again starting today,
-Smile.

610
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:08,460
-You look better with a smile.
-with the leadership

611
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:09,795
of Chairman Jang Han-seok!

612
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:12,298
This is quite nervous.

613
00:43:14,466 --> 00:43:15,384
Time for photos.

614
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:28,647
The ceremony will start soon.
Please go upstairs.

615
00:43:33,485 --> 00:43:36,280
You will become the true head of Babel
starting today.

616
00:43:39,491 --> 00:43:40,784
Congratulations, sir.

617
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:48,959
It's all thanks to my brother who did
a fine job running the company until now.

618
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:52,421
We should head upstairs.

619
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:10,856
Yes. Let's do this.

620
00:44:10,939 --> 00:44:12,941
Chairman Jang Han-seok.

621
00:44:34,713 --> 00:44:37,633
ILMIRI GOLD JJIMDAK

622
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:41,387
Look at all the cheese.

623
00:44:50,979 --> 00:44:52,523
Their food always tastes great.

624
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:59,279
Babel's Vision Team
has never faced a search and seizure.

625
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:00,656
They never got a warrant

626
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:02,991
due to insufficient grounds.

627
00:45:03,075 --> 00:45:06,662
That's why Mr. Jung is so upset,
since it's them he has to go after.

628
00:45:06,745 --> 00:45:08,831
If he could search their office,

629
00:45:08,914 --> 00:45:11,792
he'd find the evidence they were involved
in illegal activities.

630
00:45:12,709 --> 00:45:15,921
We'll just set a trap for
the company union as we planned.

631
00:45:16,004 --> 00:45:18,048
Did you look into
the company union leader?

632
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:22,136
Yes. He used to be the right-hand man
of the deceased union leader.

633
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:25,848
But one day, he betrayed the union
and joined the company's side.

634
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:29,101
He's the epitome of a traitor.

635
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:32,062
Well, I'm sure they bought him off.

636
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:34,314
But he did more than switch sides.

637
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:36,358
He and the leader
used to be close friends,

638
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:38,735
but he made false accusations
against the leader.

639
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:40,779
Gosh, he's quite the traitor.

640
00:45:41,363 --> 00:45:43,574
What is the team leader
of the Vision Team like?

641
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:45,701
Mr. Park. Ms. Yoon.

642
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:48,829
You can't be sloppy like this.

643
00:45:49,746 --> 00:45:52,916
He's known as a perfectionist
who works meticulously.

644
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,377
He'd come to Wusang
and rip their lawyers apart

645
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:57,713
saying they did a sloppy job.

646
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:01,717
Any good restaurants?
Let's just have something cheap.

647
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,218
Hello, sir.

648
00:46:04,511 --> 00:46:06,263
I see. Hi, Mr. Park.

649
00:46:06,346 --> 00:46:08,348
-Order the food now.
-Okay.

650
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:13,145
And more importantly,
he's as loyal as a Golden Retriever.

651
00:46:13,729 --> 00:46:17,107
Traitors and loyal subordinates
have the best chemistry.

652
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:20,444
How can they have good chemistry?

653
00:46:20,527 --> 00:46:23,614
Loyal subordinates' biggest fear
is losing the trust of their boss.

654
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:26,742
And bosses fear betrayal the most.

655
00:46:26,825 --> 00:46:30,746
Preventing betrayal is
the loyal subordinates' biggest mission.

656
00:46:31,997 --> 00:46:35,876
And when there's a betrayal,
the loyal subordinates show a weakness.

657
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:38,212
And we can take advantage of that.

658
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:41,340
They don't teach you this stuff
in schools, do they?

659
00:46:41,423 --> 00:46:43,800
I'll give you a crash course
for 300,000 won a month.

660
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:46,553
-No. I need at least 400,000 won.
-Forget I asked.

661
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:48,096
I'll take up Pilates instead.

662
00:46:49,556 --> 00:46:51,975
-Jang will be summoned tomorrow, right?
-Yes.

663
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:54,478
But let's take care of the traitor today.

664
00:47:11,828 --> 00:47:13,038
Gosh.

665
00:47:25,467 --> 00:47:27,261
What? What's this?

666
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:29,054
Stop it!

667
00:47:29,137 --> 00:47:30,806
Who are you? Let go of me.

668
00:47:30,889 --> 00:47:32,349
Help me!

669
00:47:39,439 --> 00:47:40,482
The Twin Swords Gang?

670
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:44,444
You really scared me. Goodness.

671
00:47:45,112 --> 00:47:47,406
The Twin Swords Gang. You're on our side.

672
00:47:47,489 --> 00:47:50,534
By the way, what brings you here?

673
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:56,164
If you want to beatbox, repeat after me.

674
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:57,124
What?

675
00:47:57,207 --> 00:47:58,333
Boots, cats

676
00:47:59,918 --> 00:48:01,211
Boots, cats

677
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:02,379
Boots, cats

678
00:48:02,462 --> 00:48:03,839
Boots, cats

679
00:48:03,922 --> 00:48:06,091
-Boots, cats
-Boots, cats

680
00:48:06,174 --> 00:48:08,135
-Boots, cats
-Boots, cats

681
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:09,845
-Boots, cats
-Boots, cats

682
00:48:09,928 --> 00:48:11,680
Boots, cats

683
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:15,517
…cats.

684
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:40,417
What?

685
00:48:45,505 --> 00:48:47,674
Are you sure this cement will harden fast?

686
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:49,176
What's taking so long?

687
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:51,219
-Hey.
-Did you get the wrong kind?

688
00:48:51,303 --> 00:48:52,429
Hey.

689
00:48:52,512 --> 00:48:54,473
It takes three hours. It's not chocolate.

690
00:48:54,556 --> 00:48:56,600
-Hey.
-If we're throwing him with the cement,

691
00:48:56,683 --> 00:48:57,976
won't the ocean be better?

692
00:48:58,060 --> 00:48:59,978
Right. Besides, sharks will eat him up.

693
00:49:00,062 --> 00:49:02,356
-It's nice and neat that way.
-Hey.

694
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:04,232
Why are you doing this to me?

695
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:07,194
Why? I thought the Twin Swords Gang
was like family.

696
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,242
Family, my foot.

697
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:15,911
How are we your family?

698
00:49:15,994 --> 00:49:17,788
How come there's a woman in the gang?

699
00:49:17,871 --> 00:49:19,831
Aren't women allowed to join gangs?

700
00:49:19,915 --> 00:49:21,458
This jerk is a sexist.

701
00:49:21,541 --> 00:49:22,584
I'm sorry.

702
00:49:23,335 --> 00:49:26,713
By the way,
there must be a misunderstanding.

703
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:28,715
I didn't do anything wrong.

704
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:32,469
You betrayed and hassled
the union members.

705
00:49:32,552 --> 00:49:36,682
You falsely accused union executives
of embezzlement and sexual harassment.

706
00:49:36,765 --> 00:49:39,893
You even drove one of them
to commit suicide.

707
00:49:39,976 --> 00:49:42,229
You're lucky
that I'm a true martial artist.

708
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:44,731
Otherwise, I would have crushed you.

709
00:49:45,982 --> 00:49:46,983
So, you're an artist?

710
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:50,028
No, a "martial" artist.

711
00:49:50,112 --> 00:49:52,406
If you lived
during the Japanese colonial era,

712
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:54,157
you would've sold your country.

713
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:57,035
Is it obvious?
My grandfather was pro-Japan.

714
00:49:57,828 --> 00:49:59,913
So even your ancestors were traitors.

715
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:02,374
The cement's hardened.

716
00:50:03,959 --> 00:50:04,960
What is?

717
00:50:05,043 --> 00:50:06,378
-No way.
-At last.

718
00:50:06,962 --> 00:50:08,714
-Is it ready?
-Yes, it's hard.

719
00:50:08,797 --> 00:50:09,715
Wait.

720
00:50:09,798 --> 00:50:12,300
It's nothing personal.
We're just following orders.

721
00:50:12,384 --> 00:50:13,719
Wait. Hold on.

722
00:50:14,302 --> 00:50:16,430
But who told you to do this to me?

723
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:19,808
Isn't it obvious?
I guess they don't need you anymore.

724
00:50:19,891 --> 00:50:21,893
Those bastards at Babel…

725
00:50:23,019 --> 00:50:24,730
Should we put them together now?

726
00:50:24,813 --> 00:50:25,981
What?

727
00:50:26,064 --> 00:50:27,149
Let's do it.

728
00:50:27,232 --> 00:50:28,525
-Wait. Hold on.
-What?

729
00:50:28,608 --> 00:50:30,944
-What are you doing?
-Don't move.

730
00:50:31,027 --> 00:50:32,112
-Wait.
-Do it.

731
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:34,114
-Take him.
-Hold on. Wait.

732
00:50:34,197 --> 00:50:37,200
Please spare me.
I'll do anything you want me to do.

733
00:50:37,284 --> 00:50:38,952
Please. I'll do anything you want.

734
00:50:39,035 --> 00:50:40,620
You're not even that rich.

735
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:41,955
No. I can make it!

736
00:50:42,038 --> 00:50:44,958
I'll use all my brainpower
to get whatever you want.

737
00:50:45,041 --> 00:50:47,461
Like that's going to be any good.
Tie him to the can.

738
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:48,837
-What? No.
-Tie him.

739
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:50,839
-That's real cement.
-Put him in.

740
00:50:50,922 --> 00:50:53,091
-Why are you doing this to me?
-One, two, three.

741
00:50:53,175 --> 00:50:54,468
-No!
-One, two.

742
00:50:54,551 --> 00:50:55,886
-One, two, three.
-Let go!

743
00:50:55,969 --> 00:50:57,262
-Tie him.
-Help me!

744
00:50:57,345 --> 00:50:58,388
-Somebody help me!
-Hey.

745
00:50:58,472 --> 00:50:59,639
-Do it.
-Lord!

746
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:02,017
Hey, I'm going to die!

747
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:04,227
-Tie him.
-Oh, Lord

748
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:05,896
-One, two, three.
-Your words

749
00:51:05,979 --> 00:51:07,189
-comfort me
-Lift him.

750
00:51:07,272 --> 00:51:08,523
Wait!

751
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:17,407
Did you get any orders
from the headquarters?

752
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:19,534
Like what you must do
to destroy the union?

753
00:51:19,618 --> 00:51:22,996
Of course. They email me
what I need to do every morning.

754
00:51:23,079 --> 00:51:24,414
-Is that true?
-Yes.

755
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:26,750
-Are you telling me the truth?
-Yes.

756
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:30,587
Everyone, huddle up.

757
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:32,088
-One, two. Yes!
-One, two. Yes!

758
00:51:41,556 --> 00:51:42,849
Those lunatics.

759
00:51:48,021 --> 00:51:50,148
Help me. Somebody help me!

760
00:51:52,442 --> 00:51:54,945
You said you'd do anything
we tell you to, right?

761
00:51:55,028 --> 00:51:56,279
Of course.

762
00:51:58,782 --> 00:51:59,991
Deal!

763
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:11,086
VISION TEAM
TEAM LEADER PARK CHAN-KI

764
00:52:11,169 --> 00:52:12,754
What? Two billion won?

765
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:14,923
Yes. Two billion won.

766
00:52:15,715 --> 00:52:16,883
Without the taxes.

767
00:52:18,885 --> 00:52:21,221
Who do you think you're talking to?

768
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:24,724
Do I what? Are you hearing yourself?

769
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:26,226
That was such a cliché line.

770
00:52:28,937 --> 00:52:31,314
Hey, you ordered your men
to kill me, didn't you?

771
00:52:31,398 --> 00:52:33,859
-What are you talking about?
-Whatever.

772
00:52:33,942 --> 00:52:38,154
Bring me two billion won in cash
by tomorrow.

773
00:52:38,238 --> 00:52:39,155
If you don't,

774
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:42,659
I'm going to disclose every order
I received from the Vision Team

775
00:52:42,742 --> 00:52:47,038
and all of your illegal activities,
starting with you.

776
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:48,206
All of it!

777
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:51,877
Mr. Nam, calm down. Let's talk about this.

778
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:54,462
No. There's no need for that.

779
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:57,424
Call me when you have the money. Bye.

780
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:03,638
-Eat this.
-Nice. Great job.

781
00:53:03,722 --> 00:53:05,223
-Great job!
-You did good!

782
00:53:05,307 --> 00:53:07,392
-You did it!
-You did it!

783
00:53:09,394 --> 00:53:11,313
That bastard…

784
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:14,983
Didn't I tell you

785
00:53:15,066 --> 00:53:17,527
that you have a lot more to gain
by releasing me?

786
00:53:17,611 --> 00:53:21,281
My client has kept his end of the bargain.

787
00:53:27,954 --> 00:53:28,914
What's this?

788
00:53:28,997 --> 00:53:30,540
The Vision Team emailed this

789
00:53:30,624 --> 00:53:34,294
to the company union leader
to oppress the union members.

790
00:53:37,422 --> 00:53:39,382
BABEL GROUP
ANTI-UNION STRATEGIES

791
00:53:39,966 --> 00:53:42,344
-How did you get this?
-This will be more than enough

792
00:53:42,427 --> 00:53:45,347
to get a search and seizure
warrant for the Vision Team, right?

793
00:53:51,978 --> 00:53:53,188
Yes.

794
00:53:53,271 --> 00:53:55,273
With this document, it should be.

795
00:53:57,609 --> 00:54:00,153
I have one more thing to ask you
before the raid.

796
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:20,715
Cheers.

797
00:54:26,304 --> 00:54:29,099
I think being a gangster suits me better
than being a lawyer.

798
00:54:29,182 --> 00:54:33,937
Same here.
I'm getting a rush of adrenaline.

799
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:35,563
Should I follow you to Italy

800
00:54:35,647 --> 00:54:37,315
-and become a consigliere?
-Just eat.

801
00:54:37,399 --> 00:54:38,984
-Me, too.
-Me, too.

802
00:54:39,067 --> 00:54:41,987
-Should I go, too?
-Great. We should all go. I'm in.

803
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:44,531
I would make a great Mafia member, right?

804
00:54:44,614 --> 00:54:45,490
Please eat.

805
00:54:46,241 --> 00:54:48,618
Talent-wise,
I think I'm the best one here.

806
00:54:48,702 --> 00:54:50,078
I mean, given my career…

807
00:54:51,204 --> 00:54:52,414
You do have a point.

808
00:54:54,499 --> 00:54:58,253
When you all go to Italy one day,
do you want to try splashing pigs' blood?

809
00:54:59,921 --> 00:55:01,297
Pigs' blood?

810
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:02,924
What's that about?

811
00:55:03,508 --> 00:55:06,928
There's this tradition our family followed
until the 1960s.

812
00:55:07,012 --> 00:55:10,390
On the day our rival family
holds a party to greet their new boss,

813
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:12,183
we used to splash pig's blood

814
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:15,186
on their new boss
to show them what we're capable of.

815
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:17,230
To intimidate them.

816
00:55:19,566 --> 00:55:22,444
That's a bit cruel.
It must have smelled bad.

817
00:55:23,278 --> 00:55:26,114
I don't like it either. It's too barbaric.

818
00:55:26,197 --> 00:55:29,325
But I'd love to see it once.
It'd look grotesque.

819
00:55:29,409 --> 00:55:30,535
I don't like it either.

820
00:55:31,286 --> 00:55:33,121
Why waste something so delicious?

821
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:36,624
Here.

822
00:55:41,421 --> 00:55:43,506
Eat this and go to sleep.

823
00:55:44,257 --> 00:55:46,259
I need to get some quality sleep. Okay?

824
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:53,641
Do you understand what I'm saying?

825
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:55,602
Do you?

826
00:56:01,733 --> 00:56:03,610
If you do understand what I'm saying,

827
00:56:04,944 --> 00:56:08,239
make sure to return the favor someday.

828
00:56:08,323 --> 00:56:09,949
I'm feeding you.

829
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:11,409
Okay?

830
00:56:17,165 --> 00:56:18,083
Eat it.

831
00:56:26,007 --> 00:56:26,925
That's right.

832
00:56:53,493 --> 00:56:55,078
Please tell us how you feel.

833
00:56:57,497 --> 00:57:00,500
I will fully cooperate
to the best of my abilities.

834
00:57:02,210 --> 00:57:05,839
And Babel will come back
as a company that the public can trust.

835
00:57:13,513 --> 00:57:15,682
You're being summoned
upon your inauguration.

836
00:57:15,765 --> 00:57:17,142
How do you feel about it?

837
00:57:17,225 --> 00:57:18,643
Do you deny the charges?

838
00:57:18,726 --> 00:57:21,354
-Anti-union activities…
-Breaking news.

839
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:24,357
Chairman Jang Han-seok of Babel Group

840
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:26,776
has appeared at the prosecutors' office

841
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:30,196
wearing a luxurious custom-tailored suit
made by the designer, Booralro.

842
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:32,991
What's your take
on the prosecution's summon?

843
00:57:33,074 --> 00:57:36,453
It looks like a certain prosecutor
is trying to assert dominance

844
00:57:36,536 --> 00:57:38,371
over a fine and competent businessman.

845
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:40,832
-This is such an outdated tactic.
-That's right.

846
00:57:40,915 --> 00:57:42,750
Just look at him.

847
00:57:42,834 --> 00:57:45,545
Have you ever seen a businessman
as intelligent and charismatic as him?

848
00:57:45,628 --> 00:57:48,590
That's right. On top of that,
he's very handsome.

849
00:57:48,673 --> 00:57:52,844
An intelligent, charismatic,
and handsome businessman.

850
00:57:52,927 --> 00:57:54,304
In addition to that,

851
00:57:54,387 --> 00:57:58,975
he's athletic, a good shot,
and an excellent artist.

852
00:57:59,058 --> 00:58:00,852
-In other words, he's…
-Goodness.

853
00:58:00,935 --> 00:58:04,731
Look at them kissing up to him.
Isn't that too much?

854
00:58:04,814 --> 00:58:08,359
They're all saying the same thing.
Everything is fake. They are all lies.

855
00:58:08,443 --> 00:58:11,279
There's no correlation
between the development of media

856
00:58:11,362 --> 00:58:12,822
and disclosure of the truth.

857
00:58:12,906 --> 00:58:15,116
Not long ago,
I used the media to my advantage.

858
00:58:16,242 --> 00:58:17,160
You're right.

859
00:58:17,243 --> 00:58:20,955
The Internet makes it very easy
to deceive people nowadays.

860
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:23,917
That's why I only believe
two things on the Internet.

861
00:58:24,542 --> 00:58:26,294
The weather and the time.

862
00:58:51,444 --> 00:58:53,821
I have one more thing to ask you
before the raid.

863
00:58:54,447 --> 00:58:55,865
What is it?

864
00:58:56,491 --> 00:59:00,328
Let Babel and Wusang know
that there's going to be a raid.

865
00:59:00,912 --> 00:59:02,747
-Pardon?
-We want the Vision Team

866
00:59:02,830 --> 00:59:05,041
to send their files somewhere else.

867
00:59:05,124 --> 00:59:07,126
Then we won't be able to get anything.

868
00:59:09,128 --> 00:59:10,296
Our goal

869
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:13,675
isn't to get evidence
of anti-union activities.

870
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:18,054
It's to prove that Chairman Jang
was the one who gave the orders

871
00:59:18,137 --> 00:59:19,639
for their anti-union activities.

872
00:59:23,184 --> 00:59:24,811
I'll guarantee this.

873
00:59:25,937 --> 00:59:28,147
Tonight at 7 p.m.,

874
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:33,987
Mr. Jang will give a lecture
to the young leaders of this country.

875
00:59:34,529 --> 00:59:37,031
I'll bet 10,000 won
that he will walk out of here

876
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:39,492
before the lecture.

877
00:59:50,211 --> 00:59:52,046
Mr. Jung.

878
00:59:52,714 --> 00:59:54,966
You've got a sense of humor now.

879
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:03,182
You brought us here. Why are you so quiet?

880
01:00:04,892 --> 01:00:06,060
You gave the orders

881
01:00:06,144 --> 01:00:08,104
for the anti-union activities, right?

882
01:00:08,187 --> 01:00:09,856
Even when you were at Wusang.

883
01:00:12,317 --> 01:00:13,568
He did no such thing.

884
01:00:13,651 --> 01:00:15,111
I see.

885
01:00:18,031 --> 01:00:19,490
Do you want some food?

886
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:24,078
We can eat. They have good food here.

887
01:00:24,954 --> 01:00:25,872
Sure.

888
01:00:33,755 --> 01:00:36,049
IN A MEETING
VISION TEAM LEADER PARK CHAN-KI

889
01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:45,808
Yes, Mr. Park.

890
01:00:46,434 --> 01:00:47,268
Yes.

891
01:00:48,269 --> 01:00:49,228
What?

892
01:00:49,312 --> 01:00:50,313
VISION TEAM 4

893
01:00:50,396 --> 01:00:51,564
Hey. Hurry up!

894
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:53,524
Hurry up.

895
01:00:53,608 --> 01:00:55,109
Get a move on!

896
01:00:55,193 --> 01:00:56,819
We have no time to shred them.

897
01:00:56,903 --> 01:00:59,280
Get all the files
and put them in Mr. Lee's car.

898
01:00:59,364 --> 01:01:00,698
-Hurry.
-Yes, sir.

899
01:01:00,782 --> 01:01:01,866
Faster!

900
01:01:02,575 --> 01:01:04,160
BUSINESS PROPOSAL
BABEL

901
01:01:04,243 --> 01:01:05,453
What do I do with this?

902
01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:11,876
EXPENSE JOURNAL
REVENUE AND EXPENSES

903
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:35,650
He's on the Elevator Two.
I repeat, Elevator Two.

904
01:01:43,908 --> 01:01:45,076
Wait!

905
01:01:48,955 --> 01:01:51,416
I haven't seen you before. Who are you?

906
01:01:56,045 --> 01:01:58,715
If you don't identify yourselves,
I'm calling the cops.

907
01:01:59,298 --> 01:02:01,467
My name is Nam Ju-sung.

908
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:02,969
I'm from Wangsimni.

909
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:05,722
INTERNATIONAL SECURITY
INTELLIGENCE SERVICE

910
01:02:12,061 --> 01:02:14,021
The higher-ups told us to be here

911
01:02:14,105 --> 01:02:16,649
to protect the Vision Team.

912
01:02:23,114 --> 01:02:24,240
Isn't this fake?

913
01:02:24,323 --> 01:02:26,284
Then why don't you call them and ask?

914
01:02:26,367 --> 01:02:30,037
If I'm telling the truth,
this is obstruction of justice!

915
01:02:33,916 --> 01:02:36,335
We're from the Wangsimni Branch!

916
01:02:36,419 --> 01:02:37,962
Way to go, rookie.

917
01:02:41,924 --> 01:02:44,093
I'll scold you
if you set foot in Wangsimni.

918
01:02:58,941 --> 01:03:00,693
Can you press B1 for me?

919
01:03:07,283 --> 01:03:08,743
You're going to Basement Three.

920
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:49,158
Do you need to take a dump?
What's the rush?

921
01:03:49,242 --> 01:03:50,618
Are you busy?

922
01:03:50,701 --> 01:03:52,370
-No.
-What are you hiding?

923
01:03:52,453 --> 01:03:53,830
Show it to us.

924
01:03:53,913 --> 01:03:56,123
-Show it to us.
-It's nothing.

925
01:03:56,207 --> 01:03:57,792
-Gosh, this is a lot.
-Gosh.

926
01:03:57,875 --> 01:03:59,961
-What's this?
-It's so heavy.

927
01:04:00,044 --> 01:04:00,962
Let me help you.

928
01:04:01,045 --> 01:04:02,672
It's not heavy at all. I got this.

929
01:04:02,755 --> 01:04:04,799
Gosh, this is heavy.

930
01:04:04,882 --> 01:04:07,802
How did you run carrying this
all by yourself?

931
01:04:07,885 --> 01:04:10,471
It's all right. You can leave it to us.

932
01:04:11,055 --> 01:04:14,642
The Booralro suit Chairman Jang Han-seok
wore today

933
01:04:14,725 --> 01:04:16,394
has been the talk of the town today.

934
01:04:16,477 --> 01:04:17,478
It's even become

935
01:04:17,562 --> 01:04:20,231
-a trending search word online.
-Have some.

936
01:04:20,314 --> 01:04:22,149
Mr. Jung, come on. Get to work.

937
01:04:23,192 --> 01:04:24,777
Or just let us go.

938
01:04:30,825 --> 01:04:31,909
Thank you for the food.

939
01:04:40,376 --> 01:04:42,545
A search warrant
for the Vision Team was issued,

940
01:04:42,628 --> 01:04:44,463
but we handled it thanks to a tip-off.

941
01:04:50,344 --> 01:04:53,598
So that's why you kept us here.

942
01:04:53,681 --> 01:04:56,100
So that you could raid
the Vision Team's office.

943
01:04:57,226 --> 01:04:59,395
Show us what you've got.

944
01:04:59,478 --> 01:05:01,272
I'm not sure if you'll get anything.

945
01:05:03,065 --> 01:05:04,609
Let me ask you one question.

946
01:05:06,110 --> 01:05:08,446
You've been a no-nonsense prosecutor
all this time.

947
01:05:09,155 --> 01:05:10,990
Why did you team up with a former-Mafia?

948
01:05:15,578 --> 01:05:17,288
I didn't team up with him.

949
01:05:17,371 --> 01:05:19,040
I'm just following the trend.

950
01:05:19,123 --> 01:05:20,333
What did you say?

951
01:05:20,416 --> 01:05:23,920
The trend these days
isn't forgiveness or harmony.

952
01:05:24,003 --> 01:05:25,796
It's eradication and isolation.

953
01:05:31,928 --> 01:05:33,763
Oh, right. You have a lecture, right?

954
01:05:34,263 --> 01:05:36,182
Go ahead and spread your filthy lies.

955
01:05:41,103 --> 01:05:43,689
You should eat. You won't have time later.

956
01:05:43,773 --> 01:05:45,900
-You should finish it.
-Sure.

957
01:05:49,195 --> 01:05:50,404
I'll take the oxtail soup.

958
01:05:51,322 --> 01:05:52,990
-Oxtail soup?
-Yes.

959
01:05:53,074 --> 01:05:54,659
Why didn't you order earlier?

960
01:05:55,326 --> 01:05:57,328
Can you ask for more kkakdugi?

961
01:05:57,954 --> 01:05:59,080
Breaking news.

962
01:05:59,163 --> 01:06:01,415
Chairman Jang Han-seok demanded

963
01:06:01,499 --> 01:06:04,001
-seolleongtang for dinner.
-I want it extra-large.

964
01:06:04,085 --> 01:06:06,087
And he asked for more kkakdugi.

965
01:06:06,170 --> 01:06:08,923
That is quite unprecedented.

966
01:06:09,006 --> 01:06:11,509
Chairman Jang asked for more kkakdugi.

967
01:06:11,592 --> 01:06:13,260
What could this mean?

968
01:06:14,095 --> 01:06:16,889
I think this is a subtle way
of letting the public know

969
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:19,684
that he is doing just fine.

970
01:06:21,852 --> 01:06:23,187
Hey. Stop that.

971
01:06:24,772 --> 01:06:28,067
You should have prepared
the money when you had the chance.

972
01:06:28,567 --> 01:06:29,944
That file can never get out.

973
01:06:30,653 --> 01:06:32,905
If it gets out,
it will be the end of you and me!

974
01:06:35,032 --> 01:06:37,868
Bring two billion won
to the place I told you.

975
01:06:37,952 --> 01:06:40,913
Bring it yourself.
If you don't follow my instructions,

976
01:06:40,997 --> 01:06:43,499
I'll send these documents
to the prosecutor right away.

977
01:06:44,125 --> 01:06:45,001
Bye.

978
01:06:49,714 --> 01:06:52,216
Yes. You did it. That was good.

979
01:06:52,842 --> 01:06:54,010
I did good, right?

980
01:06:54,635 --> 01:06:58,222
So could you give me a drumstick?

981
01:06:58,305 --> 01:06:59,765
I haven't eaten since yesterday.

982
01:06:59,849 --> 01:07:02,601
There are no drumsticks. This is boneless.

983
01:07:03,978 --> 01:07:06,272
I see. Then just give me any piece.

984
01:07:06,355 --> 01:07:08,774
This is good. Sure.

985
01:07:14,488 --> 01:07:16,240
Too bad. I finished everything.

986
01:07:17,241 --> 01:07:19,118
Please. Come on. Just one piece.

987
01:07:19,201 --> 01:07:21,120
Gosh, you guys are too harsh.

988
01:07:21,203 --> 01:07:23,748
Come on. It fell!

989
01:07:23,831 --> 01:07:26,542
Come on. Don't be so childish.

990
01:07:26,625 --> 01:07:30,004
Come on. Don't tease me with food.
Seriously.

991
01:07:33,090 --> 01:07:35,092
-Check the brightness of the monitor.
-Okay.

992
01:07:35,176 --> 01:07:38,012
And make sure that the lights
are all working.

993
01:07:44,143 --> 01:07:45,436
Can I ask you for a favor?

994
01:07:46,103 --> 01:07:47,229
Pardon?

995
01:07:48,147 --> 01:07:51,108
I want to throw a surprise event
for a woman.

996
01:07:53,110 --> 01:07:54,570
I'll pay handsomely for it.

997
01:07:57,114 --> 01:07:58,532
It's the chairman.

998
01:08:09,627 --> 01:08:10,711
Thank you.

999
01:08:13,380 --> 01:08:14,298
Sorry.

1000
01:08:14,882 --> 01:08:17,051
THE CORPORATE SPIRIT
OF CERTAINTY AND AUDACITY

1001
01:08:26,852 --> 01:08:27,728
All right.

1002
01:08:28,395 --> 01:08:29,897
Here's the man of the hour.

1003
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:34,944
He's my mentor, older brother,

1004
01:08:36,153 --> 01:08:37,696
and the leader of Babel Group.

1005
01:08:38,572 --> 01:08:39,782
Chairman Jang Han-seok.

1006
01:09:13,607 --> 01:09:16,110
Nice to meet you,
future leaders of our country.

1007
01:09:16,193 --> 01:09:17,486
I'm Jang Han-seok.

1008
01:09:29,707 --> 01:09:32,543
The future belongs to no one.

1009
01:09:33,878 --> 01:09:35,838
No one owns it yet.

1010
01:09:35,921 --> 01:09:39,592
So, the one who seizes it first
will come to own it.

1011
01:09:40,342 --> 01:09:42,553
But if you pick the wrong future,

1012
01:09:42,636 --> 01:09:44,013
you'll be doomed.

1013
01:09:47,057 --> 01:09:48,392
Who wrote the script?

1014
01:09:49,935 --> 01:09:52,021
To make a great future for yourselves,

1015
01:09:52,813 --> 01:09:55,399
you must be sure of yourselves
in the present moment.

1016
01:09:55,983 --> 01:09:57,985
And you must be audacious.

1017
01:10:00,070 --> 01:10:04,450
And Babel will once again
take an audacious step.

1018
01:10:05,451 --> 01:10:09,413
Babel Chemicals is developing
revolutionary batteries.

1019
01:10:10,206 --> 01:10:12,583
And once the development is complete
in two years,

1020
01:10:13,209 --> 01:10:15,586
we will jump
into the electric vehicle market.

1021
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:21,008
This is the vision of Babel Motors,
the leader of our future.

1022
01:10:21,592 --> 01:10:22,426
Let's take a look.

1023
01:10:32,478 --> 01:10:34,230
BABEL MOTORS,
THE NEW PARADIGM FOR THE FUTURE

1024
01:10:34,313 --> 01:10:37,024
What's this? How come
you only brought 300 million won?

1025
01:10:38,275 --> 01:10:41,195
This is all I could come up with for now.

1026
01:10:41,278 --> 01:10:44,990
Seriously. You're the mighty leader
of Babel Group's Vision Team.

1027
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:46,575
-Looks like there's been a mistake.
-Why are you…

1028
01:10:46,659 --> 01:10:48,744
Then I can't give you the evidence I have.

1029
01:10:49,328 --> 01:10:50,871
-What?
-Give it to me now.

1030
01:10:50,955 --> 01:10:52,706
May I have your attention please.

1031
01:10:52,790 --> 01:10:54,166
This is bad.

1032
01:10:54,917 --> 01:10:57,086
-Where are the staff?
-We're checking.

1033
01:10:57,169 --> 01:10:58,462
-Hurry and check.
-Where's the supervisor?

1034
01:10:59,755 --> 01:11:02,925
I heard the documents about
anti-union activities are pretty serious.

1035
01:11:03,008 --> 01:11:05,719
Your life will be over
if you try anything funny with that.

1036
01:11:05,803 --> 01:11:08,681
Me? No. It won't be me.

1037
01:11:08,764 --> 01:11:11,725
I'm just a union member
from Babel Chemicals.

1038
01:11:11,809 --> 01:11:13,018
My life won't be over.

1039
01:11:13,102 --> 01:11:15,813
You are the leader of the Vision Team.
You pull the strings.

1040
01:11:15,896 --> 01:11:19,441
Your life will be over
because you set everything up.

1041
01:11:19,525 --> 01:11:21,193
This didn't come from me.

1042
01:11:21,277 --> 01:11:23,904
I just do what
the chairman tells me to do.

1043
01:11:23,988 --> 01:11:25,614
That's not my concern.

1044
01:11:25,698 --> 01:11:27,324
The chairman ordered him?

1045
01:11:27,408 --> 01:11:28,617
Listen.

1046
01:11:28,701 --> 01:11:30,953
-You…
-What are you doing?

1047
01:11:31,036 --> 01:11:32,413
Turn it off!

1048
01:11:33,163 --> 01:11:35,791
You'd better keep your fingers
away from that button.

1049
01:11:35,874 --> 01:11:37,167
I'm just his puppet!

1050
01:11:37,251 --> 01:11:39,753
They mentioned his name.
Make this stop now.

1051
01:11:40,629 --> 01:11:42,589
-Tell me.
-I don't know that.

1052
01:11:42,673 --> 01:11:43,882
What are you going to do?

1053
01:11:46,385 --> 01:11:49,346
Wait. I don't know why you're doing this.

1054
01:11:50,597 --> 01:11:52,891
Come on. We can talk this out.

1055
01:11:52,975 --> 01:11:54,518
I wanted caramel popcorn.

1056
01:11:54,601 --> 01:11:57,187
Gosh. Regular popcorns are the best.

1057
01:11:57,271 --> 01:11:59,273
Or you can go ask him for money.

1058
01:11:59,356 --> 01:12:01,525
Why did you even ask me what I wanted?

1059
01:12:01,608 --> 01:12:02,735
Both of us will be dead.

1060
01:12:02,818 --> 01:12:04,236
-Ms. Hong.
-Fine. Let's all die.

1061
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:06,739
I'll show you something fun
to make up for it.

1062
01:12:06,822 --> 01:12:10,117
It will be as vivid as an 8K TV.

1063
01:12:10,909 --> 01:12:13,620
This already hit the spot for me.
There's more?

1064
01:12:13,704 --> 01:12:15,205
You said you wanted to see it.

1065
01:12:15,289 --> 01:12:16,874
-You go first!
-You first.

1066
01:12:16,957 --> 01:12:19,585
No, you go first, you bastard!

1067
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:22,921
Han-seo, hurry.

1068
01:12:23,005 --> 01:12:23,922
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

1069
01:12:24,006 --> 01:12:25,424
Get over here, you punk.

1070
01:12:25,507 --> 01:12:27,384
Hey, I told you to shut this down now!

1071
01:12:27,468 --> 01:12:29,219
-What are you doing?
-How old are you?

1072
01:12:30,137 --> 01:12:32,556
-Let go of me.
-Stop it. No photos.

1073
01:12:32,639 --> 01:12:33,682
I said no photos.

1074
01:12:49,907 --> 01:12:50,741
Five.

1075
01:12:51,784 --> 01:12:52,826
Four.

1076
01:12:53,911 --> 01:12:54,912
Three.

1077
01:12:55,829 --> 01:12:56,789
Two.

1078
01:12:58,123 --> 01:12:59,083
One.

1079
01:13:30,364 --> 01:13:31,198
That was awesome.

1080
01:13:35,327 --> 01:13:37,579
I feel like I'm a Mafia from the '60s.

1081
01:13:41,959 --> 01:13:43,544
Enjoy it.

1082
01:13:43,627 --> 01:13:45,379
See how it feels to be a real villain.

1083
01:13:46,797 --> 01:13:48,465
Stop taking photos!

1084
01:13:49,883 --> 01:13:52,177
-Stop it.
-No photos.

1085
01:14:54,656 --> 01:14:55,699
SPECIAL THANKS TO YOON KYUNG-HO

1086
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:28,482
This is really important.
We need good teamwork for this.

1087
01:15:29,191 --> 01:15:30,067
Wait.

1088
01:15:30,150 --> 01:15:32,861
Why is everyone here so talented?

1089
01:15:32,945 --> 01:15:34,613
Chairman Jang Han-seok's paper company.

1090
01:15:34,696 --> 01:15:37,199
-I've inserted the thumbstick.
-With this,

1091
01:15:37,282 --> 01:15:39,368
Jang Han-seok will be penniless.

1092
01:15:39,451 --> 01:15:43,121
That's when you can really prove
how loyal you are to me.

1093
01:15:43,205 --> 01:15:45,332
Arrange a meeting with Vincenzo.

1094
01:15:45,415 --> 01:15:47,334
Kill him. Hurry!

1095
01:15:48,460 --> 01:15:50,671
This is such a magical night

1096
01:15:51,296 --> 01:15:52,422
I will never forget.

1097
01:15:54,550 --> 01:15:59,513
