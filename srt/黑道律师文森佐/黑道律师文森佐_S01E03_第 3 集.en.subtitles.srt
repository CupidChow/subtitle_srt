1
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:25,126
Enjoy the party.

2
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:27,921
Let's talk.

3
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:32,300
This way.

4
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:37,180
Hey!

5
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,147
Damn it.

6
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:48,983
Let's go.

7
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,904
-What?
-What do you want?

8
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:54,739
I need to take your temperature.

9
00:01:58,576 --> 00:01:59,786
Go on.

10
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:05,875
-Go in.
-Damn it.

11
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:09,170
Officer Kim, why are you here?

12
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:11,339
-What?
-You know you can't be here today.

13
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:14,384
Gosh, it wasn't my choice.
I'm on security detail today.

14
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:15,844
-Security detail?
-Yes.

15
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:17,095
For who?

16
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:32,193
MATTEO SPONZA
ITALIAN AMBASSADOR TO KOREA

17
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:34,445
Damn it.

18
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:37,198
What the…

19
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:40,994
EPISODE 3

20
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:52,088
You paid for this big party
out of your own pocket,

21
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,799
so you could stop them
from tearing this place down.

22
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:57,635
This isn't goodwill or bravado.

23
00:02:58,344 --> 00:02:59,596
So what's your angle?

24
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:03,182
Why are you doing this? For what?

25
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:06,185
You wear
a different Booralro suit every day.

26
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:09,355
It makes me wonder what you could
possibly want to do with the plaza.

27
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,526
You know Booralro?

28
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,198
Doesn't everyone?

29
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:21,326
Booralro is Milan's master tailor.

30
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:25,121
So tell me why you are doing this.

31
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:31,711
I fell in love with this place.

32
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:32,795
Why?

33
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,672
Love has no reason.

34
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:36,049
It should.

35
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:38,092
Everyone pretends there's no reason,

36
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:39,802
but there always is.

37
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:43,723
I prefer love that has no reason.

38
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:45,808
What is this?

39
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:50,188
You're trying to make this sound romantic
when we both know it isn't.

40
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:55,235
Vincenzo.

41
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:56,819
Come here!

42
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:59,572
Sure. I'll be down there in a second,
Mr. Ambassador.

43
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:00,823
It's a great party.

44
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:15,922
Why did he suddenly whisper like that?

45
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:18,967
My goodness! Hey!

46
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,928
-Oh, my. It's been a while, guys.
- Hello.

47
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,471
Take one.

48
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:26,474
My goodness.
What brings you all the way here?

49
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:28,601
-It's free. You're doing your job.
-Drink up.

50
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:29,811
Gosh, you look scary.

51
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:34,899
Food is the most important
Aspect of living

52
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:44,158
Yes.

53
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:49,247
What?

54
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:52,709
The Ambassador of Italy?

55
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:55,295
Why is he there?

56
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:57,755
Hey, just bulldoze…

57
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:03,344
Wrap it up.

58
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:06,222
Cha-young! You!

59
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,558
Gosh, this is driving me nuts.

60
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:11,102
This is a major problem.
You should've told me!

61
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:12,895
Were you even thinking or what?

62
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:15,189
How will you fix this?

63
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:21,654
What if the researcher talks to the press
or the victim's family?

64
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:22,739
Right!

65
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:25,199
He won't be able to
make a move right away.

66
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:26,284
What?

67
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:28,286
-How can you be so sure?
-Right.

68
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:30,538
I've been a lawyer for eight years now.

69
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:32,749
I assure you I have the best hunches.

70
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,292
Hunches?

71
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:38,421
I've been a prosecutor for 20 years.

72
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:41,674
I don't think you should be
talking about hunches before me.

73
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:44,510
-Right.
-You've been a prosecutor for 20 years,

74
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:47,305
-but it's your first year as a lawyer.
-What?

75
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:48,431
I'll make myself clear.

76
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:50,600
I didn't tell you
not because I was scared,

77
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:54,062
but because I knew I could fix it
and didn't want to worry you.

78
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:55,104
Goodness.

79
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,732
She thought about
how her bosses would feel.

80
00:05:57,815 --> 00:06:01,527
Gosh, Ms. Hong with eight years
of experience is such a generous lawyer.

81
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:04,614
-Sir. Ms. Choi.
-There she goes again.

82
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,910
If you trust me, give me your confidence,
not your criticism.

83
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:11,287
Goodness. It scares me when she does this.

84
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:12,789
Let's trust her, then.

85
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:17,043
But if you fail to handle this,
we will no longer trust you

86
00:06:18,377 --> 00:06:20,463
and you'll be fired. Okay?

87
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:25,760
Thank you for your understanding.

88
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:32,892
Don't think about going home today.
Get me a list of Yu Min-chul's family,

89
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:34,852
relatives, friends, and colleagues.

90
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:37,647
And…

91
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:42,860
get the expenses ready in cash
in the morning.

92
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:49,742
Why do you need this much money?

93
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:50,993
So I can give the money

94
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:53,371
to anyone that gives me a clue
where he might be.

95
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:57,750
You're not hosting some TV show here.
Why give out money?

96
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:01,254
If a problem can be solved using money,
we should make use of it.

97
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:04,215
That way, no one gets hurt
and everyone is happy.

98
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:22,400
-We did it!
-Yes!

99
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:24,318
-I'll get going now.
-We did it.

100
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:26,404
-No, join us.
-Mr. Hong!

101
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:28,322
-You should join us!
-Bye.

102
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:30,950
-Everyone, over there.
-Let's go.

103
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:32,910
-You know…
-Let's do this!

104
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:35,121
-Plaza.
-Plaza.

105
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:36,789
-I'm good with anything.
-Go.

106
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:38,291
-Let's go.
-Go.

107
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:39,876
-My gosh.
-Let's go.

108
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,627
-All right.
-Geumga

109
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:43,629
-Plaza!
-Plaza!

110
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:45,673
-We are the tenants.
-Yes, we are.

111
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:48,468
-We will win!
-Win!

112
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:50,678
-Geumga.
-Geumga. Let's go!

113
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:52,472
-Go, Geumga!
-Go!

114
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:55,391
-Good work.
-Yes.

115
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:58,853
-Come here!
-My gosh.

116
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:01,772
It's nice and warm here.

117
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:06,402
It's from yesterday. It didn't go bad.
Try some.

118
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:09,030
-Is it good?
-It's tteokbokki.

119
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:12,450
I bet the party must have cost
at least 10 million won.

120
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:15,244
No. It must have cost
at least 20 to 30 million won.

121
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:18,039
On top of that, Mr. Cassano
paid for everything.

122
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,667
Until yesterday,
you called him all kinds of names.

123
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,085
But today, he's Mr. Cassano?

124
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:24,879
Gosh, you punk.

125
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:26,380
I didn't trust him at first.

126
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:29,634
But seeing what he did for the plaza,
maybe, he's sincere.

127
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:31,219
If he had an ulterior motive,

128
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:33,387
-he wouldn't spend a fortune.
-She's right.

129
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:36,057
If they don't give up,
he'll keep throwing parties.

130
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,059
He'll spend 100 million won in no time!

131
00:08:39,393 --> 00:08:40,895
-Listen.
-Yes?

132
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:43,814
-I don't trust him 100 percent.
-But?

133
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:47,109
But for now, I do believe
he is on our side.

134
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,778
-Right.
-Yes.

135
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:51,113
Lately, Mr. Cassano and I have been

136
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:53,950
communicating like people in Italy do.

137
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:59,872
Actually, I think you're hiding from him.

138
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:02,708
I'm not hiding from him.
It's a game we play.

139
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:05,169
In Italy, we hide from people
we click with.

140
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:07,004
It's like the Italian Mafia Game.

141
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:11,008
If he continues to help us like this,

142
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:14,136
he may be the savior
our merciful Buddha has sent for us.

143
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,054
Merciful Buddha.

144
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:17,348
-Amen.
-"Amen"? That's not the one.

145
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:18,975
Now that I think about it,

146
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:22,228
don't you think the lawyer
from Italy is really handsome?

147
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:26,983
He has such great skin.
And his cologne smells so good.

148
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:28,985
-Right? You noticed it, too.
-Yes.

149
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:31,862
-It smells great.
-I'll be completely honest.

150
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:35,825
He has such a great figure.

151
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:38,160
But I thought he wasn't your type at all.

152
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,621
What kind of woman
wouldn't like a man like him?

153
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:56,470
NANYAK TEMPLE BOILER CONSTRUCTION
DEMOLITION COUNTERMEASURE

154
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:59,348
Parties won't be enough
to stop the demolition.

155
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:01,642
I need a better plan.

156
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:07,189
RDU-90, KEY CHARACTERISTICS

157
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:11,027
BABEL PHARM LAWSUIT - DANGER

158
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,738
Please keep a closer eye
on your researchers.

159
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:17,950
Of course not.
They can't go out even for an hour.

160
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:21,746
Yes. Please, I really need your help here.

161
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:25,625
No way.

162
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,251
Gosh. What's going on here?

163
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:31,130
-Come here.
-Gosh, what's she doing?

164
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:33,341
-She's unbelievable.
-Gosh.

165
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:37,094
Awesome.

166
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:39,055
Awesome!

167
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:43,809
Isn't that so weird?

168
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:44,810
What's she doing?

169
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,021
Awesome!

170
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,109
-Awesome.
-Unbelievable.

171
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:54,070
So this is how she made it to the top.

172
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,532
Nice bracelet.

173
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:00,326
What do you know about it?

174
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:04,121
Isn't that the new Blamino bracelet?
It's the most popular one.

175
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:05,373
Okay, Mr. Trivia.

176
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,291
What is it?

177
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:11,962
Since I'm Mr. Trivia,

178
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:14,423
let me end my internship,
so I can be your partner.

179
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:15,841
Why would I do that?

180
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:20,262
Well, we can work together,
go watch baseball together,

181
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,765
and have fried chicken and beer.
How nice is that?

182
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:24,683
That's not working. It's dating.

183
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:26,602
Even better.

184
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:28,604
We'll work hard

185
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:30,231
and rely on each other.

186
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:35,319
I don't date people from work
because it's exhausting and immature.

187
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:37,363
Quit dreaming.

188
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,826
-And the thing I asked for?
-Oh, right.

189
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:45,746
I got it from
the Italian Lawyer Association.

190
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:47,456
He's a real lawyer.

191
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,918
-Any criminal records?
-He's clean.

192
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:53,712
He's very handsome.

193
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:54,880
VINCENZO CASSANO

194
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:56,924
-Are you interested in him?
-"Interested"?

195
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:58,968
Right? Was it love at first sight?

196
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:02,430
-That's why you turned me down.
-Hey!

197
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:04,265
Don't talk about my life like that.

198
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:10,771
Why are you glaring at me like that?

199
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:14,650
You know what? You made me think
that I was an awful cook all this time.

200
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:16,569
But you were wrong.

201
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:17,903
Did you see yesterday?

202
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:19,405
Everyone at the party

203
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:23,159
enjoyed my margherita pizza.
Did you see that or not?

204
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:25,411
The Italian ambassador is from Italy.

205
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:28,414
The couple tasted my pizza
and gave me a thumbs-up.

206
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:29,623
That's all I need.

207
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:34,920
Well, the thing with drunk people is…
What's that Korean expression?

208
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:38,048
Oh, right. People can't tell
between poop and gold.

209
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:41,427
No, my food is good!
You're the only one who says otherwise.

210
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,762
-Everyone likes it.
-Make me the same pizza, then.

211
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:46,932
Okay. Fine. Wait here.

212
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:58,194
Taste it.

213
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:02,781
I know it tastes good.

214
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,537
Doesn't it taste amazing?

215
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,922
What? What is it this time? Why?

216
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:23,677
I guess the basil and cheese
are practicing social distancing.

217
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:25,179
They don't mix at all.

218
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:29,892
And are the tomatoes quarantined
or something?

219
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:31,393
I can't taste them at all.

220
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:36,982
Thanks for showing me

221
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:40,653
what a piece of garbage
that looks like pizza tastes like.

222
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:41,987
You know?

223
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:45,574
Damn it!

224
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,041
Hey, it's Vincenzo!

225
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:01,298
Have we met?

226
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:05,719
-We met at the party last night.
-The party.

227
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:08,764
-Is that where we met?
-No.

228
00:14:08,847 --> 00:14:11,600
Yes. That was
our first time meeting there.

229
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:20,067
Are you sure about that?

230
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:23,654
Mr. Cassano!

231
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:25,573
Mr. Hong is here.

232
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:26,615
Okay.

233
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:52,308
By the way,
what's that cologne he's wearing?

234
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:09,575
-Hello.
-Hi.

235
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:13,162
I'm not here as a customer.

236
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:18,208
When I tasted your pizza
at the party yesterday,

237
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:20,502
I was incredibly moved.

238
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:23,589
So I came here, wishing
to become your culinary apprentice.

239
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:26,300
Right? Wasn't it really good?

240
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:28,177
-Yes.
-Damn it.

241
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:33,557
But I'm not looking for an assistant.
Please, leave.

242
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:35,392
Just give me a corner to sleep in.

243
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:37,811
You don't have to pay me or feed me.

244
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:41,857
I'll assist you, clean,
wait tables, and do menial jobs.

245
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:42,858
Master.

246
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:43,859
What?

247
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,529
As soon as I had
a bite of your pizza yesterday,

248
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,908
I heard the tolling
of Florence's Duomo bell.

249
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:52,826
And when I had my second bite,

250
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:56,580
the boat horn from a harbor in Naples
resonated throughout my body.

251
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:07,424
I want to create my own little Italy
with your guidance.

252
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:12,471
But you really don't need me
to pay for your labor or food?

253
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:14,390
No. I just need a place to sleep.

254
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:15,516
And…

255
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:18,310
I just need you, Master.

256
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,190
So what's your name?

257
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:29,989
I'm sure you know about

258
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:32,616
Babel Pharmaceuticals' new drug,
RDU-90's main component.

259
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:34,827
Yes.

260
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:37,454
It's a substance called coisanic.

261
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:39,331
Are you also aware

262
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:43,544
that coisanic is considered narcotic?

263
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:44,586
A narcotic?

264
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:48,507
That's news to me.

265
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,093
According to our expert's opinion,

266
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:53,846
it just relieves pain.

267
00:16:56,557 --> 00:17:00,394
Babel Pharmaceuticals deceived you,
and everyone was in on it.

268
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:03,689
Gosh, I had no idea.

269
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:09,403
So if this drug hits the market,
aren't they basically selling narcotics?

270
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:10,362
Yes.

271
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:13,323
Officially, more people
will be addicted to painkillers.

272
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:17,286
What's more dangerous is,
because of narcotic pain meds,

273
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:20,622
more people will become drug addicts
like in the States.

274
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:21,749
Then,

275
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:25,878
this drug might open up the doors to
mass-distribution of narcotics in Korea.

276
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:28,589
Perhaps, like the States,
South America, and Italy,

277
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:31,175
huge drug cartels might spring up.

278
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:32,843
It hasn't happened yet,

279
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:35,554
but drugs will spread like wildfire
in this small country.

280
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:40,392
I don't even want to think about it,
but if this goes through,

281
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:43,604
even young kids will be able to buy drugs
like you see in movies.

282
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:47,524
-It'll be around their homes and schools.
-Jeez.

283
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:49,860
How could they make something like this?

284
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:53,781
I don't care if I go to prison.
I want to burn them down!

285
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:55,532
All of the drugs!

286
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:59,286
We must stop them. We must do
whatever it takes to stop them.

287
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:13,842
Yes.

288
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:17,638
Right away.

289
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:44,373
When you install it,

290
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:46,458
-be careful with the--
-There's no need for that.

291
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:48,252
What is all this?

292
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:54,341
Mr. Cassano, you cannot do this.

293
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:55,592
We didn't agree to this.

294
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:58,053
Save the money for the boiler
for your temple.

295
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,471
-Can you move your feet?
-No.

296
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:03,267
And I will foot the bill
for your monthly electricity.

297
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:06,562
Gosh, no. You cannot do that.

298
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,814
-Can you get that side?
-This side?

299
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:10,399
-But…
-I can put one right here.

300
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:26,498
Sir, can you lift
the right side of your bottom?

301
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:37,801
It's all set.

302
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:40,929
Thank you.

303
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:46,810
-Can you get that one? Put it right here.
-This one?

304
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:55,235
A member of the Mafia

305
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:57,988
who is Catholic
is putting electric pads for the monks.

306
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,489
What is happening?

307
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:01,617
-Two, three.
-Is it the union of religions?

308
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:04,953
This man is so generous.

309
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,458
-Give me a cigarette.
-Just one?

310
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,297
If you have one, hurry up.

311
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,466
How come you never have your own?

312
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:18,926
Hey, give me one, too.

313
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,011
-I want two.
-Give me one.

314
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:22,638
Come on. Be quiet.

315
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,056
Give me a lighter.

316
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:26,350
You don't have one?

317
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:28,518
-Of course, I do.
-Just give it to me already.

318
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:30,729
-Yes.
-Give me the lighter.

319
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:33,148
Didn't your mom tell you not to smoke?

320
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:37,569
Jeez. Don't bring her up now.
It's embarrassing.

321
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:40,030
-Beat it.
-Haven't you heard?

322
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:43,033
-If you smoke at an early age--
-That our bones will rot?

323
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:44,826
They're already rotten.

324
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:48,413
Give me some money before you go, mister.

325
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:57,339
Look at him. He's got a nice watch.

326
00:20:58,173 --> 00:21:01,426
All right. If you promise me
that you will never smoke again,

327
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,178
I'll give you some money.

328
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,305
You have no idea
how scary kids are these days.

329
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:07,266
We go after everyone that pisses us off.

330
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:09,351
All right.

331
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:12,980
Toss all of your cigarettes
in this trash can here.

332
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:16,191
Guess what the scariest kind of drunk is.

333
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:21,863
If you say "punch drunk,"
I'll be disappointed.

334
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,323
Bingo.

335
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,118
My arm!

336
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:30,247
Damn it.

337
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,340
You little punks.

338
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:41,258
Lousy brats.

339
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:42,759
-Stop it.
-Damn it.

340
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:45,220
Let's go.

341
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:51,476
Come here.

342
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:59,067
-Toss it now.
-Damn it.

343
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:03,488
Fine. I'll throw it out.

344
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:08,994
I'll check every time I see you.

345
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:11,580
-Got it?
-Damn it. What the heck?

346
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:20,172
A Mafia member
who disciplines delinquents?

347
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:23,467
Is this a way of repenting
for his dark past?

348
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:26,595
The more I observe him,
the harder it is to figure him out.

349
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:47,491
It's my first and last advice to you.

350
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,039
Wait.

351
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:56,833
You can threaten me,

352
00:22:56,917 --> 00:23:00,045
but you're in no position
to give me advice!

353
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:06,968
We'll see

354
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:10,722
which one of us will be

355
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,391
begging the other.

356
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:15,685
This will be fun.

357
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:20,607
Cheetah!

358
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:22,901
Cheetah, are you okay?

359
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:24,528
Mr. Cho.

360
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:26,738
Can you look into him?

361
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:36,331
We'll soon find out

362
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:39,042
who'll end up on their knees.

363
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:49,719
My youngest brother
also majored in pharmacology.

364
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:52,597
He works late every day in the lab.

365
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:55,183
Then, he comes home all exhausted.

366
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:57,811
And he worries about his career.

367
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:02,899
Cha-young.

368
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:05,485
No. Let me be.

369
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:07,487
Cha-young.

370
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:10,115
Thanks.

371
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:25,172
That's why
Min-chul reminds me of my brother.

372
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:27,799
I'm sure things have been tough.

373
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:31,595
I'm worried that he might do something
he'll regret if he's alone.

374
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:34,222
It's been a few months
since I talked to Min-chul.

375
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:37,851
Please. If he did contact you,

376
00:24:37,934 --> 00:24:39,352
tell me.

377
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:42,981
I will compensate you handsomely
for your information.

378
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:45,400
I have enough money.

379
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:51,573
It's a hefty sum.

380
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:55,619
We're really trying to help Min-chul.

381
00:24:56,494 --> 00:24:58,121
If he contacted you--

382
00:24:58,205 --> 00:25:00,290
If you don't leave, I'll call the police.

383
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:02,959
He'll call the police. Let's go.

384
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:23,480
Here.

385
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:30,153
How could he not fall for my tears?

386
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:32,530
I feel hotter because I cried.

387
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:34,699
No matter how hard I think about it,

388
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:38,745
if I were Min-chul, your dad would
be the only person I would go to.

389
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:40,664
Jipuragi.

390
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:45,252
Try to talk to your dad.

391
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:46,753
You're his daughter.

392
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:48,880
You two can have an honest conversation.

393
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:50,924
I would've done that if it'd work.

394
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:58,348
If he decides to blow the whistle,
you'll be in big trouble.

395
00:25:58,431 --> 00:26:01,643
Hey, you're from New York.
Why are you so nosy?

396
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:03,728
Why worry about other people?

397
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:07,857
No. I only worry about you, Cha-young.

398
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,027
Without me,
who's going to play along with your skit?

399
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:13,238
Without me, how will you find your car?

400
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:15,073
Oh, right. Where did I park my car?

401
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:18,910
-Near Exit B in Basement Two.
-Okay.

402
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:27,627
Cha-young, doesn't working
for Wusang give you a lot of headaches?

403
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:29,296
Want to jump ship?

404
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:33,008
My friend from Boston is
starting a law firm in Korea.

405
00:26:33,591 --> 00:26:36,803
A new law firm won't be able
to afford my salary.

406
00:26:46,604 --> 00:26:47,522
Yes, Mr. Seo.

407
00:26:47,605 --> 00:26:51,067
Ms. Choi invited lawyers
with experience of more than five years

408
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:52,444
for dinner today.

409
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:54,195
Tell her I can't go. I have work.

410
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:55,947
She told me you had to be there

411
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:58,575
even if other lawyers can't make it.

412
00:26:58,658 --> 00:26:59,617
Fine.

413
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,954
Damn it. She cares about me way too much.

414
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:05,498
It's not hard at all.

415
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:08,376
I have a knack for turning the tables.

416
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:10,795
Gosh.

417
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:13,840
Please trust me on this. I can win this.

418
00:27:26,227 --> 00:27:28,271
NAMDONGBU DISTRICT COURT
HEARING NOTIFICATION

419
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:44,621
I know this is a tough decision.
May I ask why?

420
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:51,169
I realized it when I watched the trial.

421
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:55,632
That if I stay silent,
a lot of people will be wronged.

422
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:58,051
Yes. I'm glad you made up your mind.

423
00:27:58,635 --> 00:27:59,844
Thank you so much.

424
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:06,059
Then, what is their biggest lie
that they have been spreading?

425
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:08,269
The clinical trial of the new drug

426
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:10,355
was basically murder.

427
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:12,941
-Pardon?
-The higher-ups gave the order.

428
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:15,777
We were ordered to inject
the new drug, RDU-90,

429
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,362
to five test subjects infinitely.

430
00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:19,572
They told us to see how much
they could endure.

431
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:20,990
How could they do that?

432
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:23,576
And RDU-90 is not just a painkiller.

433
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:25,829
It's a narcotic painkiller.

434
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:59,738
Babel Pharm didn't care about
the test subjects' lives from the start.

435
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:02,282
I tried to drop out of the experiment,

436
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:04,242
but they threatened to hurt my family.

437
00:29:04,325 --> 00:29:07,746
Will you appear in court as a witness
and testify what you just told me?

438
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:10,373
You will guarantee
the safety of me and my family, right?

439
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,462
I can't guarantee it now,
but I'll do whatever it takes.

440
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:16,963
What do you mean?

441
00:29:17,046 --> 00:29:19,007
How can I testify without that guarantee?

442
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:20,925
Besides…

443
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:24,888
there's no guarantee
that you will not expose me.

444
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:28,349
No, Mr. Yu. No one will find out
about our meeting today,

445
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:31,060
and I will take all the risks.
Please trust me.

446
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:33,730
No. Unless my family's safety
is guaranteed,

447
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:36,232
I cannot testify in court. I'm sorry.

448
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:38,985
Mr. Cassano,

449
00:29:39,068 --> 00:29:42,113
I already knew what kind of drug it was.

450
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:45,533
I pretended to be clueless,
so I could take all the risks.

451
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,786
I will make sure to stop them.

452
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:51,998
-Mr. Hong.
-Mr. Cassano.

453
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:53,291
Do you have…

454
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:55,251
Right, you don't smoke.

455
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:02,175
Have you grasped the core problem
of this lawsuit?

456
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:03,802
The core problem?

457
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:07,514
Babel Pharmaceuticals,
the release of narcotic pain medication,

458
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:09,849
political lobbyists under the radar,

459
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:12,393
a huge rebate,
and fabrication of a lawsuit.

460
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:14,604
The entire ordeal is run like a cartel.

461
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:16,940
I know that much.

462
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:20,401
If you do, shouldn't you back off?

463
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,076
They're not businessmen. They're monsters.

464
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,495
They couldn't care less
about the lives of others.

465
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:33,873
If I keep fighting, I'll win one day.

466
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:37,544
Mr. Hong,
you cannot defeat these monsters.

467
00:30:38,461 --> 00:30:40,713
People can defeat monsters.

468
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:43,550
No. That's only possible in myths.

469
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:46,094
You sound pessimistic today.

470
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:48,930
You've come to a dead end now.

471
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:50,306
You can't go further!

472
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:53,726
I'll do whatever it takes to break through
even if it breaks my fist.

473
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:01,651
When you reach a dead end,

474
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:05,280
the wisest thing you can do
is to turn back.

475
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:12,036
Hello?

476
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:14,080
Yes.

477
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:16,499
When?

478
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:20,336
Which hospital?

479
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:23,965
Okay. I'll be right there.

480
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:24,883
Okay.

481
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:34,350
You need to come with me.

482
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:37,020
Where?

483
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:37,937
You'll see.

484
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:45,778
Why did she have to go to work?
She shouldn't have.

485
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:48,323
Goodness.
Being a public defender is so hard.

486
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:50,575
Okay. Yes, over there.

487
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:52,285
Let's go.

488
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:55,455
CORRECTIONS

489
00:31:57,707 --> 00:31:58,917
Let's go in.

490
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,961
Go ahead. I'll wait for you outside.

491
00:32:02,545 --> 00:32:05,340
You're here, anyway.
Say a few nice things to her.

492
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:07,884
But…

493
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:15,975
Hello. I'm her attorney.

494
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:17,644
Okay.

495
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:26,653
I was right. Aren't you glad
you were close to a big hospital?

496
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,321
Yes.

497
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:31,157
Gosh, how can you smile right now?

498
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,034
You almost died!

499
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:34,285
Let's just say

500
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:38,122
this was a rehearsal for my funeral.

501
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:42,001
By the way, who is he?

502
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,512
This is…

503
00:32:54,597 --> 00:32:58,101
He's a lawyer who's been helping me
with my recent case.

504
00:32:58,935 --> 00:32:59,811
Isn't he handsome?

505
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:02,939
Yes.

506
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:05,692
He is indeed handsome.

507
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:21,749
I need to make a phone call.

508
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:23,209
I'll give you some privacy.

509
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:29,674
I'm going to file for a retrial.

510
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:33,094
You can't do anything about it
without my consent.

511
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:35,471
Suit yourself.

512
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:36,931
If you die like this,

513
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:40,101
you're only making life easier
for those criminals.

514
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:43,688
I stopped caring about getting justice
a long time ago.

515
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:46,733
Don't complicate things.

516
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:25,104
Yes.

517
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:27,356
This is Na Deok-jin from Barbel E&C.

518
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:29,317
You texted me this morning.

519
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:40,244
-Bottoms up.
-Thank you.

520
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:42,830
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

521
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:44,499
Bottoms up.

522
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:46,334
-Thank you.
-This is expensive.

523
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:48,252
Thank you.

524
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:51,339
All right.

525
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:54,842
Today…

526
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:58,554
we'll forget that we're lawyers
and have some fun!

527
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:00,264
-Yes!
-Okay!

528
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:07,271
Ms. Choi, what is your idea of fun?

529
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:10,525
Does anyone here have
a special talent or something?

530
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:12,443
Mr. Seo is the best impersonator.

531
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:15,530
He does one heck of an impression.

532
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:16,948
Let's see it, then. Do it.

533
00:35:17,031 --> 00:35:19,075
-Okay.
-Do it!

534
00:35:19,158 --> 00:35:21,953
-Do it!
-Do it!

535
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:24,080
"I'm Ko Gwang-ryeol.

536
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:25,957
Goni asked me to come here.

537
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,126
He's very busy with work right now.

538
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:30,378
So he asked me to back you up.

539
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:32,588
It's a small company, you see.

540
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:34,924
It's a small apartment."

541
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:36,968
-This is it.
-He's good.

542
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:38,511
-He's good.
-Yes, he's good.

543
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:40,763
-It's Agui this time.
-Go ahead.

544
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:42,890
"Stop. Are you cheating?

545
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:45,226
You gave Madam Jung and me
the bottom cards.

546
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:47,979
-Do you think I'm a joke?"
-"Check the Cards!"

547
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:50,148
"Don't touch the cards.
Or you'll lose a hand.

548
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:52,066
Bring me the hammer."

549
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:55,069
"I shouldn't have done that."

550
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:58,114
Go to sleep. No, not here.
Go sleep over there.

551
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:01,325
Good job. Give it up for him.

552
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:06,289
-Good job.
-You're good.

553
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:09,250
Who's next? Anyone else?

554
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:11,878
Is that it?

555
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:17,133
All right, then. Ms. Hong,
Wusang's top dog. You're up.

556
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:19,260
Ms. Hong.

557
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:21,220
Hong Cha-young.

558
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:24,891
-Hong Cha-young.
-Hong Cha-young.

559
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:26,475
I don't do stuff like that.

560
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:28,436
Of course, you do. Just do it.

561
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:30,605
This kind of thing makes me uncomfortable.

562
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:36,652
I'm not making you do this
to reward you, you know?

563
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:38,946
You've made a huge mistake.

564
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,281
I'm making you do it,

565
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:42,950
so you can make up for it
and redeem yourself.

566
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:49,624
Then, I'll impersonate someone as well.

567
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:51,334
Great. Let's give it up.

568
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:11,187
Awesome!

569
00:37:12,688 --> 00:37:13,689
Awesome!

570
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:26,285
Awesome!

571
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:29,956
Awesome!

572
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:33,251
Awesome!

573
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:39,173
Awesome!

574
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:42,385
Awesome!

575
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:46,764
Awesome!

576
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:49,475
Awesome!

577
00:37:57,191 --> 00:37:58,484
You're drinking coffee.

578
00:37:59,902 --> 00:38:03,614
Why did you want to meet?
I'm a busy man, you know.

579
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:06,033
Do these two things I tell you to do.

580
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:09,161
-You're ordering me around now.
-First.

581
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:13,332
Make sure Geumga Plaza doesn't
get demolished for two months.

582
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:14,500
Second.

583
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:18,421
When we demolish the plaza,
my people will take care of it.

584
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:23,342
Have you gone mad or something?

585
00:38:23,926 --> 00:38:26,053
What are you babbling on about?

586
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:36,397
Now I'm curious.

587
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:48,284
NAME: HWANG JAE-SUK
NAME: SUNG DONG-SU

588
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,745
Didn't I tell you?

589
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:52,830
That I'm not going to take it anymore.

590
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:56,584
It's the list of real estate agents
you secretly took bribes from.

591
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:59,211
The transcripts of the recording

592
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:02,381
in which Park Seok-do threatened
the store owners under your order.

593
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:04,383
How…

594
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:23,152
Photos of you at Shaina Hotel
with Kim Mo-ran of

595
00:39:23,235 --> 00:39:24,904
Management Team Two, your mistress.

596
00:39:24,987 --> 00:39:27,156
-In broad daylight and--
-Hey.

597
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:30,618
Can you stop, please?

598
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:34,288
This will be enough
to bury you professionally.

599
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:37,666
Yes. It's more than enough,
so I'm begging you.

600
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:40,503
These photos can never be revealed.

601
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:44,173
As long as you follow my orders,
they'll never see the light of day. But…

602
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:48,928
you should end things with Ms. Kim fast

603
00:39:49,011 --> 00:39:52,264
and go back to your family.
You're married, for God's sake.

604
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:56,102
But I don't have any power
to postpone the demolition for two months.

605
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:58,062
A month is hard enough.

606
00:39:58,145 --> 00:40:00,606
And I don't have much power at work.

607
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:03,526
-I'm a mere employee there.
-That's not my concern.

608
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:04,777
Get it done.

609
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:06,112
If you fail,

610
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:09,240
I'll make sure you'll be condemned
for the rest of your life.

611
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:19,417
And let me warn you.
Don't try anything funny.

612
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:22,586
You'll be dead if anything happens to me.

613
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:26,799
Wait, sir.

614
00:40:28,717 --> 00:40:29,844
This is bad.

615
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:33,222
Goodness. I'm in big trouble.

616
00:40:33,305 --> 00:40:34,390
One more round.

617
00:40:34,473 --> 00:40:35,641
-Good night.
-Good night.

618
00:40:35,724 --> 00:40:37,852
-What? You're sending me home?
-Good night.

619
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:49,530
Come here, Ms. Hong.

620
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:01,542
Hong Cha-young.

621
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:04,712
If you mess with me again,

622
00:41:05,379 --> 00:41:07,590
that will be the end of you, you brat.

623
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:10,843
Do let me know when you get the chance.

624
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:14,263
I wouldn't mind a near-death experience.

625
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:18,142
Seriously. You're one big nutjob.

626
00:41:18,684 --> 00:41:22,271
The three-strike rule
doesn't apply to you.

627
00:41:22,354 --> 00:41:23,981
One strike, and you're done.

628
00:41:24,064 --> 00:41:25,733
I'm sorry to bring this up,

629
00:41:27,943 --> 00:41:30,112
but you should cut your nails.

630
00:41:30,779 --> 00:41:33,365
I think you just scratched my neck.

631
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:41,290
Let's go.

632
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:46,378
-Good night.
-Good night.

633
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:51,800
Gosh, she could've infected me
with the germs from her nails.

634
00:41:59,808 --> 00:42:01,185
Come home right now.

635
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:03,479
What? What is it this time?

636
00:42:04,271 --> 00:42:07,107
Gosh. Why does he keep calling me?

637
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:12,279
Tear down everything
even if there's a party tonight.

638
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:13,239
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

639
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,700
What if there are people
like the Italian Ambassador?

640
00:42:18,452 --> 00:42:22,164
All right. Tear down everything
after you escort them somewhere else.

641
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:23,666
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

642
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:26,043
-Get in.
-Let's go.

643
00:42:26,126 --> 00:42:27,586
-Get ready.
-Go!

644
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:29,171
-Hey.
-Yes, Mr. Na.

645
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:30,214
Hey.

646
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:35,052
Leave Geumga Plaza alone

647
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:38,973
-for the next two months.
-Why?

648
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:40,808
Just do as I say!

649
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:44,311
If the plaza gets destroyed,
we'll be destroyed, too.

650
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:52,611
-Damn it. What is this?
-Hey, let's go!

651
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:54,572
-No, don't. Stop it.
-Destroy it!

652
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:57,783
Hey, stop! Wait! I told you to stop!

653
00:42:57,866 --> 00:42:59,660
Why is that forklift going so fast?

654
00:43:02,621 --> 00:43:04,290
-Turn off the engines!
-Stop!

655
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:06,959
Turn off the engines. Gosh, the fumes.

656
00:43:22,516 --> 00:43:23,851
LAWYER HONG YU-CHAN

657
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:25,894
How could you leave without telling me?

658
00:43:25,978 --> 00:43:27,855
Come to my house. Let's drink soju.

659
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:43,203
So the narcotic pain meds
of Babel Pharmaceuticals

660
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:45,372
will turn people into drug addicts.

661
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:48,042
And drug cartels will spring up in Korea.

662
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,045
So you want me to stop them?

663
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:53,422
At the expense of my lawsuit?

664
00:43:53,505 --> 00:43:56,884
The lawsuit isn't what matters right now.
The core problem is narcotics.

665
00:43:56,967 --> 00:43:58,552
Who fed you such nonsense?

666
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:01,263
Was it Vincenzo Cassano?

667
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:05,684
Are you guys on some kind of debate team?

668
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:07,811
He's from Italy.

669
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:10,898
He knows the severity of the danger
and drug cartels.

670
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:15,903
Other pharmaceutical companies
produce narcotic pain meds too.

671
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:18,739
-Why are you coming after Babel?
-They're different.

672
00:44:19,448 --> 00:44:21,909
They'll use lobbyists
to make the drug accessible

673
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:24,578
and mass-produce the drug
like it's a digestive pill.

674
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:26,038
Then, a lot of people will--

675
00:44:26,121 --> 00:44:28,540
I guess it's true that
no matter how smart,

676
00:44:28,624 --> 00:44:31,710
people will cling to conspiracies
once they're cornered.

677
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:34,296
Cha-young, this isn't a conspiracy theory.

678
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:36,048
This is the truth and our future.

679
00:44:38,967 --> 00:44:40,511
That must be your fellow debater.

680
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:43,347
Enjoy your debate then.

681
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:02,324
Please stop telling my dad nonsense.

682
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:08,163
Drugs? Cartels?

683
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:10,249
Do you think this is
some American TV show?

684
00:45:10,332 --> 00:45:11,625
Does it sound that absurd?

685
00:45:11,708 --> 00:45:12,751
Yes.

686
00:45:12,835 --> 00:45:16,088
At this rate, Babel Pharmaceuticals
will rule the world or something.

687
00:45:16,713 --> 00:45:18,966
When you continuously turn lies
into the truth,

688
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:20,968
you become blinded to the truth.

689
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:24,138
Now, you are diminishing
my honor as an attorney.

690
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:35,274
Care to translate?

691
00:45:35,357 --> 00:45:37,860
There's no honor among thieves.

692
00:45:41,363 --> 00:45:46,326
One day, when you're exposed as someone
who has no right to be saying such things,

693
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:48,704
I will mock you
every single second I see you

694
00:45:50,038 --> 00:45:51,915
to the point you want to kill me.

695
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:56,295
Let me say one more thing
before you do that.

696
00:45:59,548 --> 00:46:00,757
Stupid.

697
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:03,135
Idiot.

698
00:46:05,846 --> 00:46:08,223
-Translate!
-No translation for that.

699
00:46:11,685 --> 00:46:13,729
My gut tells me they weren't good words.

700
00:46:13,812 --> 00:46:16,690
I bet he was cursing at me.
He's so annoying.

701
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:21,737
I'm so enraged that I'm feeling cathartic.

702
00:46:24,781 --> 00:46:26,158
It's all my fault.

703
00:46:27,784 --> 00:46:30,621
Yes. I'll fix it as soon as possible,
so it doesn't harm you.

704
00:46:30,704 --> 00:46:31,538
Yes.

705
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:38,045
No. Whenever you scold me like this,

706
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:39,880
I can tell I'm growing.

707
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:42,090
Yes.

708
00:46:45,427 --> 00:46:46,678
The villa?

709
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:52,518
No. Please do as you please.

710
00:46:53,727 --> 00:46:57,648
Yes. Okay. Have a good night.

711
00:46:57,731 --> 00:46:58,774
Bye.

712
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:14,873
What the hell does he want?

713
00:47:27,594 --> 00:47:28,428
Mr. Hong.

714
00:47:30,013 --> 00:47:31,557
That lady earlier…

715
00:47:33,725 --> 00:47:35,519
Was her name Oh Gyeong-ja?

716
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:38,605
Is she okay?

717
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:43,151
She's not.

718
00:47:43,986 --> 00:47:45,487
She only has six months to live.

719
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:55,205
If she's in the final stage,
she must be in a lot of pain, right?

720
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:01,295
If you were curious,

721
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:04,047
you should've asked your mom yourself.

722
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:11,847
Why don't you go visit her
and ask her yourself next time?

723
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:22,232
How did you know?

724
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:25,193
I've been a lawyer for 30 years.

725
00:48:25,777 --> 00:48:27,362
I've got quite a hunch.

726
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:31,908
And why do you think
I dragged you to the hospital?

727
00:48:32,534 --> 00:48:33,785
You're so slow.

728
00:48:36,121 --> 00:48:39,124
When you asked me
if I was a public defender,

729
00:48:39,207 --> 00:48:40,876
I already figured it out.

730
00:48:42,878 --> 00:48:45,672
No. Actually, it was that day.

731
00:48:48,884 --> 00:48:50,344
Defendant Oh Gyeong-ja

732
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:52,888
was often criticized
by Chairman Hwang Deok-bae

733
00:48:52,971 --> 00:48:56,475
and his family for her improper behaviors
as a housekeeper.

734
00:48:57,684 --> 00:49:01,188
On the day of the incident, when
he said she didn't do her job properly,

735
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:04,316
she was livid and assaulted him
which led to his death.

736
00:49:05,233 --> 00:49:06,777
The defense rests.

737
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:09,321
Your Honor,

738
00:49:10,155 --> 00:49:11,323
Defendant Oh Gyeong-ja

739
00:49:11,406 --> 00:49:13,909
had abandoned her own child in the past.

740
00:49:14,743 --> 00:49:17,037
I'm submitting her affidavit
of voluntary relinquishment

741
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:19,081
of parental rights
to an orphanage in Incheon.

742
00:49:19,164 --> 00:49:21,041
That's irrelevant to this case.

743
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:23,001
Defendant. Be quiet.

744
00:49:24,836 --> 00:49:28,006
You're my lawyer. Say something.

745
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:30,342
I was sexually harassed.

746
00:49:30,425 --> 00:49:32,886
His whole family is lying!

747
00:49:32,969 --> 00:49:33,887
Don't say anything.

748
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:36,890
-That day, five years ago,
-This will work against you.

749
00:49:38,058 --> 00:49:40,102
I saw a young man in a rage.

750
00:49:41,436 --> 00:49:42,646
And I could feel the rage

751
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:45,857
as I was sitting next to him.

752
00:49:47,526 --> 00:49:50,028
No one would get so mad over some case

753
00:49:51,613 --> 00:49:53,115
unless their family is involved.

754
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:05,877
And this confirmed my suspicion.

755
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:09,840
HANJU PRISON FOR WOMEN

756
00:50:24,104 --> 00:50:27,190
Do you really not want to
visit your mother?

757
00:50:30,569 --> 00:50:32,112
I won't force you.

758
00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:37,492
And I won't ask you
to forgive your mother lightly.

759
00:50:40,162 --> 00:50:44,833
But you shouldn't let your yearning
turn into regret.

760
00:51:28,877 --> 00:51:29,920
What's this?

761
00:51:34,174 --> 00:51:35,592
What is this smell?

762
00:51:41,223 --> 00:51:42,349
What is this?

763
00:51:42,891 --> 00:51:44,267
What?

764
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:59,825
Around 3:30 a.m. today, there was
an incident, believed to be

765
00:51:59,908 --> 00:52:02,702
a gas explosion, at a villa in Yangyang,
Gangwon Province.

766
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:05,789
Employees of Babel Pharmaceuticals'
Drug Development Division

767
00:52:05,872 --> 00:52:08,250
were at the villa for a company getaway

768
00:52:08,333 --> 00:52:11,670
and were caught in the explosion, which
took the lives of the 14 researchers.

769
00:52:11,753 --> 00:52:13,296
-No.
-The fire authority confirmed

770
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:15,423
-This isn't right!
-12 researchers were dead

771
00:52:15,507 --> 00:52:16,716
at the scene.

772
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,927
And two survivors' entire bodies
were burned

773
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:21,805
-Mr. Hong.
-and were transported to a hospital.

774
00:52:21,888 --> 00:52:23,849
But they died during treatment.

775
00:52:23,932 --> 00:52:25,392
The police suspect the gas was…

776
00:52:26,434 --> 00:52:27,519
Cha-young.

777
00:52:28,353 --> 00:52:32,524
Can you not represent
Babel Pharmaceuticals?

778
00:52:32,607 --> 00:52:34,693
How dare you ask me that?

779
00:52:34,776 --> 00:52:36,778
So many people involved have died.

780
00:52:36,862 --> 00:52:39,239
People related to the case
are dropping like flies.

781
00:52:40,198 --> 00:52:41,992
I don't want anything to happen to you.

782
00:52:42,576 --> 00:52:43,618
I'm not going to die.

783
00:52:44,452 --> 00:52:47,455
Besides, I represent
Babel Pharmaceuticals.

784
00:52:49,541 --> 00:52:52,294
People who died today
were their employees.

785
00:52:52,377 --> 00:52:53,503
So that doesn't matter!

786
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:55,714
Why are you so sensitive lately?

787
00:52:55,797 --> 00:52:57,841
Are you emotionally unstable or something?

788
00:53:01,469 --> 00:53:03,138
Yell at me in Korean.

789
00:53:04,055 --> 00:53:05,307
In Korean.

790
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:07,434
Do you think I'm worried just for kicks?

791
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:08,685
Is that what you think?

792
00:53:08,768 --> 00:53:11,938
I've been thinking about this,
and I have a bad feeling about it.

793
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:14,232
Intern Jang Jun-woo.

794
00:53:14,816 --> 00:53:16,693
Why are you suddenly so protective of me?

795
00:53:16,776 --> 00:53:18,278
Don't cross the line.

796
00:53:18,778 --> 00:53:21,907
And I told you not to speak English
when we're working.

797
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:23,658
Do you think we're in the States?

798
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:32,250
The briefing didn't even start yet.

799
00:53:32,334 --> 00:53:34,502
I'm going out to pretend
that I'm in the States.

800
00:53:35,128 --> 00:53:36,880
I won't talk to you in Korean.

801
00:53:39,424 --> 00:53:40,759
That punk…

802
00:53:40,842 --> 00:53:42,761
Hey! Intern!

803
00:53:46,222 --> 00:53:48,558
You're dead meat today!

804
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:54,105
Jeez. This was way too big.

805
00:53:56,358 --> 00:53:57,442
Gosh, this…

806
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:01,321
How can he get rid of everyone?

807
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:03,657
Don't you think he's sending us a message?

808
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:07,160
"Get things sorted ruthlessly like this."

809
00:54:07,243 --> 00:54:10,956
Or, "If you don't sort things out,
you'll end up like them."

810
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:13,792
Gosh, no way. That's ridiculous.

811
00:54:14,292 --> 00:54:18,421
Come on, you're jumping to conclusions.
You're scaring me.

812
00:54:19,172 --> 00:54:22,926
I'm not jumping to conclusions. I think
Chairman Jang is giving us a scolding.

813
00:54:23,009 --> 00:54:25,261
It's not in his nature to think--

814
00:54:25,345 --> 00:54:26,388
It's Chairman Jang.

815
00:54:26,471 --> 00:54:27,430
It's…

816
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:32,686
Yes, sir.

817
00:54:34,854 --> 00:54:36,690
We'll file a claim for compensation.

818
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:39,693
Yes. Pardon?

819
00:54:39,776 --> 00:54:41,945
Yes.

820
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:43,989
I see.

821
00:54:44,739 --> 00:54:49,577
Then, I will be there by noon
with Ms. Choi.

822
00:54:50,412 --> 00:54:51,454
Yes--

823
00:54:52,414 --> 00:54:54,708
-He hung up.
-Am I finally meeting him?

824
00:54:57,002 --> 00:54:58,795
I should get it ready.

825
00:54:59,379 --> 00:55:00,964
Get what ready?

826
00:55:02,173 --> 00:55:04,968
My secret crystal ball

827
00:55:05,051 --> 00:55:07,303
that gives me all the answers.

828
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:12,809
What was that?

829
00:55:13,518 --> 00:55:16,312
Myung-hee. I mean, Ms. Choi.

830
00:55:16,396 --> 00:55:17,647
That was hot!

831
00:55:23,028 --> 00:55:23,903
I'm on my way.

832
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:25,822
The fire investigation's not over yet.

833
00:55:25,905 --> 00:55:27,866
-How could the case be closed?
-Gosh.

834
00:55:27,949 --> 00:55:30,702
We found enough evidence
at our initial inspection.

835
00:55:30,785 --> 00:55:33,163
You must check if this was arson
with the NFS!

836
00:55:34,539 --> 00:55:37,709
We have no evidence that it was.
Stop getting in our way.

837
00:55:37,792 --> 00:55:39,377
I'm not getting in your way.

838
00:55:39,461 --> 00:55:41,379
-I warned you.
-Warn me what?

839
00:55:41,463 --> 00:55:42,839
I'm asking about the protocol.

840
00:55:42,922 --> 00:55:44,591
Come on. Stop it!

841
00:55:44,674 --> 00:55:46,634
-Let go of me.
-Hey!

842
00:55:46,718 --> 00:55:49,304
-Don't lay a finger on him.
-Who are you?

843
00:55:49,804 --> 00:55:52,182
If you don't follow the protocol,
I'll camp out here.

844
00:55:52,265 --> 00:55:53,850
-Let's go.
-Suit yourself.

845
00:55:53,933 --> 00:55:55,560
-Let go of me.
-Let's go.

846
00:55:55,643 --> 00:55:57,687
-Wait. No.
-Suit yourself.

847
00:55:57,771 --> 00:55:58,855
Damn it.

848
00:55:59,439 --> 00:56:00,774
Let's go.

849
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:11,576
Why won't you take my advice?

850
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:14,370
That I should back off this case?

851
00:56:14,454 --> 00:56:16,873
How can you say that
when 14 people were burned alive?

852
00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:21,878
The only thing you can do now
is to be angry and mourn for them.

853
00:56:21,961 --> 00:56:25,298
-But that's not a lawyer's job.
-It is for me.

854
00:56:25,381 --> 00:56:27,175
I will not cave in without a fight.

855
00:56:27,258 --> 00:56:31,179
If you don't, you'll pay the price for it.
I know that more than anyone.

856
00:56:31,262 --> 00:56:34,516
As long as I can punish
Babel Pharmaceuticals, I can give my life.

857
00:56:35,975 --> 00:56:38,144
Why are you being so reckless?

858
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:39,979
Because I was destined for this.

859
00:56:40,647 --> 00:56:43,066
Even though I know
that the game has been rigged,

860
00:56:43,149 --> 00:56:44,901
I must give it my all to beat them.

861
00:56:45,944 --> 00:56:47,237
That's my fate.

862
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:53,827
Smart people may rule the world,

863
00:56:54,744 --> 00:56:59,582
but reckless and stubborn people like me
protect this world.

864
00:57:34,534 --> 00:57:38,413
Don't worry about the money. Make sure
the bereaved families are compensated.

865
00:57:39,164 --> 00:57:40,874
Yes, sir. We will.

866
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:43,084
Gosh, my villa.

867
00:57:44,502 --> 00:57:46,588
I used a lot of good materials
for the villa.

868
00:57:47,172 --> 00:57:48,465
Come on.

869
00:57:49,174 --> 00:57:51,634
Look at the trouble we're in
because of one researcher.

870
00:57:52,218 --> 00:57:53,887
I'm sorry. We'll work harder.

871
00:57:54,554 --> 00:57:55,555
Oh, right.

872
00:57:55,638 --> 00:57:58,516
Thank you for giving us a scolding
with the villa incident.

873
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:01,728
What? That wasn't a scolding.
I was just blowing off steam.

874
00:58:02,937 --> 00:58:05,815
Anyway, can't you really find
the researcher that ran away?

875
00:58:06,524 --> 00:58:08,067
We'll find him in a few hours.

876
00:58:09,611 --> 00:58:13,239
Apparently, Ms. Choi has
a magic crystal ball.

877
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:16,201
A magic crystal ball?

878
00:58:16,284 --> 00:58:19,329
-A magic crystal ball?
-It's just something I have.

879
00:58:21,956 --> 00:58:24,792
Ms. Choi, I recruited you to Wusang,

880
00:58:24,876 --> 00:58:27,378
so tell me anything you want.
I'll get it for you.

881
00:58:28,421 --> 00:58:29,589
In that case,

882
00:58:30,798 --> 00:58:32,550
buy me the Namdongbu Prosecutors' Office.

883
00:58:36,471 --> 00:58:39,933
Buy you what? What's that?

884
00:58:40,433 --> 00:58:42,936
I'm talking about
the Namdongbu Prosecution Service.

885
00:58:43,603 --> 00:58:44,437
I see.

886
00:58:47,315 --> 00:58:49,025
That's…

887
00:58:49,901 --> 00:58:52,320
How can I buy that for you?
Is that on the market?

888
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:04,707
Gosh, isn't he so funny?

889
00:59:06,668 --> 00:59:09,128
He asked if that was on the market.

890
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:12,674
Is the listing based on rent or deposit?

891
00:59:19,347 --> 00:59:22,934
Mr. Han, you're
such a bad judge of character.

892
00:59:23,685 --> 00:59:24,602
What do you mean?

893
00:59:25,603 --> 00:59:28,731
Do you really believe
that punk's the head of Babel Group?

894
00:59:30,149 --> 00:59:31,943
He's young and wild.

895
00:59:32,026 --> 00:59:34,112
So he's not the typical chairman
we're used to.

896
00:59:34,195 --> 00:59:36,906
He's slow, can't grasp the situations,

897
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:39,409
-and acts pretentious.
-Gosh, what is it this time?

898
00:59:39,492 --> 00:59:42,829
-What's the problem now?
-Never mind. It's nothing.

899
00:59:43,746 --> 00:59:45,248
Goodness.

900
00:59:49,544 --> 00:59:51,921
-Damn it.
-What is it?

901
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:54,882
It's my magic crystal ball.

902
00:59:55,508 --> 00:59:57,427
We found the runaway researcher.

903
01:00:00,179 --> 01:00:02,974
I knew you could do it!
Ms. Choi. No, Myung-hee!

904
01:00:04,392 --> 01:00:05,393
Get off me.

905
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:07,103
But this is too bad.

906
01:00:08,104 --> 01:00:11,149
The researcher and Hong Yu-chan
have already talked.

907
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:12,900
What?

908
01:00:21,826 --> 01:00:22,827
Yes, Mr. Yu.

909
01:00:24,078 --> 01:00:24,996
I will…

910
01:00:27,582 --> 01:00:28,541
testify.

911
01:00:30,668 --> 01:00:33,338
When I saw how my colleagues
got murdered at the villa,

912
01:00:33,421 --> 01:00:36,674
it made me think that
I could end up like them.

913
01:00:36,758 --> 01:00:41,346
So I've decided to reveal the truth
before that happens to me.

914
01:00:42,305 --> 01:00:43,514
I'm glad to hear that.

915
01:00:44,098 --> 01:00:47,101
Yes. I will go and get you
tomorrow morning.

916
01:00:47,685 --> 01:00:49,896
Yes. See you tomorrow.

917
01:00:49,979 --> 01:00:50,938
Okay.

918
01:01:00,365 --> 01:01:01,824
See? It worked.

919
01:01:01,908 --> 01:01:04,202
-That was legendary.
-Exactly.

920
01:01:04,285 --> 01:01:06,204
-I'm your boss now.
-Of course.

921
01:01:06,704 --> 01:01:07,872
-Go ahead.
-All right.

922
01:01:07,955 --> 01:01:10,208
-Don't move. Bring it closer.
-Come on.

923
01:01:10,291 --> 01:01:11,668
Should I teach it to the guys?

924
01:01:11,751 --> 01:01:13,920
Of course. We can't be the only ones.

925
01:01:14,629 --> 01:01:16,714
Let me see. It worked before.

926
01:01:28,476 --> 01:01:30,061
What am I doing here?

927
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:34,649
This is stupid. Why am I doing this?

928
01:01:45,451 --> 01:01:46,452
Yes.

929
01:01:47,161 --> 01:01:49,122
I shouldn't be distracted anymore.

930
01:01:50,748 --> 01:01:53,501
Let's wrap this up quickly and leave.

931
01:01:54,544 --> 01:01:56,212
Well, we bought some time,

932
01:01:56,838 --> 01:01:59,590
but we can't keep delaying
the demolition with parties.

933
01:01:59,674 --> 01:02:01,843
-Right.
-That's right.

934
01:02:02,593 --> 01:02:04,971
Now, it's time for us
to duke it out with them.

935
01:02:05,513 --> 01:02:07,181
There must be blood from both--

936
01:02:07,265 --> 01:02:08,433
It won't involve blood.

937
01:02:08,516 --> 01:02:12,061
I would like to make
a better suggestion for you.

938
01:02:17,275 --> 01:02:20,153
I'm planning to purchase a mall
in the neighboring area.

939
01:02:20,236 --> 01:02:23,030
And I will relocate you guys there.

940
01:02:23,114 --> 01:02:24,407
-What?
-What?

941
01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:27,368
What do you mean? You'll relocate us?

942
01:02:27,452 --> 01:02:31,164
I will give you the mall free of charge.

943
01:02:31,914 --> 01:02:33,291
-What?
-For free?

944
01:02:33,374 --> 01:02:35,585
-Yes.
-I don't believe it.

945
01:02:35,668 --> 01:02:37,003
Why would you do that for us?

946
01:02:37,086 --> 01:02:39,714
-Because that's the best way.
-Wait.

947
01:02:41,174 --> 01:02:43,092
There's a Western proverb that goes,

948
01:02:43,176 --> 01:02:45,970
"The only free cheese is
in the mouse trap."

949
01:02:46,053 --> 01:02:47,805
He does have a point.

950
01:02:47,889 --> 01:02:49,974
Free things in life can be dangerous.

951
01:02:50,057 --> 01:02:52,560
No, it's not dangerous at all.

952
01:02:52,643 --> 01:02:55,772
Once I purchase the building,
you can just move there.

953
01:02:55,855 --> 01:02:58,399
I see. Then, we don't have to do a thing.

954
01:02:58,483 --> 01:02:59,567
That's amazing.

955
01:03:00,818 --> 01:03:02,904
But who are you?

956
01:03:02,987 --> 01:03:05,865
-Right. Who are you?
-He's my apprentice.

957
01:03:05,948 --> 01:03:09,285
He has so much respect for my food.
He's my pupil.

958
01:03:09,827 --> 01:03:11,078
-I see.
-I see.

959
01:03:11,162 --> 01:03:13,247
-Nice to meet you.
-Hi.

960
01:03:13,831 --> 01:03:17,418
Mr. Cassano sounds pretty genuine.
Why don't we trust him?

961
01:03:17,502 --> 01:03:19,796
We just met him.
How do we know if he's genuine?

962
01:03:20,671 --> 01:03:21,589
I think I do.

963
01:03:22,423 --> 01:03:24,091
-Think about it.
-Okay.

964
01:03:24,175 --> 01:03:26,761
Why would he try to con us?
We have nothing.

965
01:03:26,844 --> 01:03:28,304
-We got nothing.
-Right.

966
01:03:28,387 --> 01:03:30,848
You can never see through a person's mind.

967
01:03:30,932 --> 01:03:32,850
-Larry.
-Yes?

968
01:03:32,934 --> 01:03:36,270
You keep getting dumped
because you're a bad judge of character.

969
01:03:39,774 --> 01:03:41,818
I've never been dumped in my life!

970
01:03:41,901 --> 01:03:43,361
Because I've never dated anyone.

971
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:46,906
Everyone.

972
01:03:47,573 --> 01:03:49,951
Faith and trust are the beginning
of good deeds

973
01:03:50,034 --> 01:03:52,370
and the path to Nirvana.

974
01:03:53,037 --> 01:03:54,413
Let's take this chance

975
01:03:54,497 --> 01:03:56,958
to execute good deeds by trusting him.

976
01:03:58,292 --> 01:03:59,126
Yes.

977
01:04:01,170 --> 01:04:02,547
Thank you, sir.

978
01:04:07,301 --> 01:04:08,344
Everyone.

979
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:12,557
Then, I'll take it
that you accepted my offer.

980
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:20,940
One, two.

981
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:23,568
Come on in.

982
01:04:28,823 --> 01:04:29,907
Did you ask to see me?

983
01:04:30,491 --> 01:04:33,119
Yes. One, two. Sit down.

984
01:04:37,081 --> 01:04:38,541
All right.

985
01:04:46,048 --> 01:04:49,594
As of today, you are off any cases

986
01:04:49,677 --> 01:04:52,555
that involve Babel Group.

987
01:04:54,098 --> 01:04:55,641
I can't do that.

988
01:04:58,311 --> 01:05:01,397
This isn't coming from me.
It's coming from Mr. Han.

989
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:03,232
Even so, I cannot do that.

990
01:05:04,358 --> 01:05:05,526
Who do you think you are?

991
01:05:07,528 --> 01:05:09,155
Do you think you run this law firm?

992
01:05:12,283 --> 01:05:15,036
I cannot comply with it
because this is an order

993
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:16,996
without any explanation.

994
01:05:17,079 --> 01:05:19,040
Of course, there is an explanation.

995
01:05:19,123 --> 01:05:20,958
You're going easy on your dad.

996
01:05:21,042 --> 01:05:22,460
I've never gone easy on him.

997
01:05:23,002 --> 01:05:25,296
He's my opposing counsel, not my dad.

998
01:05:26,422 --> 01:05:29,258
Of course, you say that.

999
01:05:29,342 --> 01:05:33,179
But family comes first, not your job.

1000
01:05:34,013 --> 01:05:36,432
You failed to beat him
at the first hearing.

1001
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:38,517
That's all.

1002
01:05:39,310 --> 01:05:42,855
Yes. I'm telling you the truth.
We have hope now.

1003
01:05:42,939 --> 01:05:45,024
Yes. Just trust me.

1004
01:05:46,275 --> 01:05:47,360
Sure.

1005
01:05:50,488 --> 01:05:52,615
I have no idea what's going on with him.

1006
01:05:53,115 --> 01:05:55,159
But he's in a good mood all of a sudden.

1007
01:05:55,826 --> 01:05:56,994
-All of a sudden?
-Yes.

1008
01:05:57,078 --> 01:05:59,372
I'll call you again tomorrow night.

1009
01:05:59,455 --> 01:06:00,831
Okay.

1010
01:06:02,208 --> 01:06:04,293
Mr. Cassano. Did you have lunch yet?

1011
01:06:04,377 --> 01:06:05,461
Not yet.

1012
01:06:05,544 --> 01:06:07,338
-Order him something.
-Shall I?

1013
01:06:07,421 --> 01:06:10,007
How about we order tangsuyuk
and some drinks?

1014
01:06:10,091 --> 01:06:12,218
-Do you mean that? That's a first!
-Of course.

1015
01:06:12,301 --> 01:06:13,469
Hold on.

1016
01:06:18,724 --> 01:06:21,519
You and I need to talk, Mr. Hong Yu-chan.

1017
01:06:21,602 --> 01:06:23,145
She said, "Mr. Hong Yu-chan."

1018
01:06:23,229 --> 01:06:24,939
It's a red alert, so I'll evacuate.

1019
01:06:31,112 --> 01:06:33,990
I can understand
that you don't want to help me.

1020
01:06:34,073 --> 01:06:38,285
-Then at least, don't ruin my future.
-When did I ruin your future?

1021
01:06:38,369 --> 01:06:41,497
Thanks to you,
I'm about to lose my ground at work.

1022
01:06:41,580 --> 01:06:43,499
I'm going from being the top dog
to a mutt.

1023
01:06:43,582 --> 01:06:46,085
Right. You got what you deserved.

1024
01:06:46,168 --> 01:06:47,670
You're a man of conscience.

1025
01:06:47,753 --> 01:06:49,922
Why won't you accept
our values are different?

1026
01:06:50,006 --> 01:06:53,217
It's not about being different.
It's about what's right and wrong.

1027
01:07:02,143 --> 01:07:03,561
As I always have,

1028
01:07:04,603 --> 01:07:06,522
I'll say some hurtful things.

1029
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:13,362
If you lived a righteous life,
why did you let Mom die like that?

1030
01:07:13,446 --> 01:07:17,366
You were so busy taking care of others,
you let her die alone on the table.

1031
01:07:17,450 --> 01:07:18,993
I told you to stop bringing it up.

1032
01:07:19,076 --> 01:07:22,121
No. I will bring this up
as long as I'm alive.

1033
01:07:22,204 --> 01:07:24,623
The fact that you made
Mom and my life miserable.

1034
01:07:24,707 --> 01:07:25,750
Get out.

1035
01:07:28,502 --> 01:07:31,589
Do you even feel guilty
when I bring her up?

1036
01:07:32,715 --> 01:07:35,051
You'd jump into the fire to save others,

1037
01:07:35,676 --> 01:07:37,428
but why did you neglect her like that?

1038
01:07:38,554 --> 01:07:39,847
I don't want to hear it.

1039
01:07:40,514 --> 01:07:41,557
Leave.

1040
01:07:42,391 --> 01:07:47,146
You can save thousands of people
from injustice.

1041
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:51,275
But you will never be forgiven
for letting her die like that.

1042
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:01,494
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

1043
01:08:02,578 --> 01:08:05,081
Sorry about that.
You saw the ugly side of my family.

1044
01:08:06,749 --> 01:08:08,501
No, I'm sorry.

1045
01:08:10,086 --> 01:08:11,087
It's okay.

1046
01:08:20,096 --> 01:08:21,388
Damn it.

1047
01:08:22,681 --> 01:08:24,934
How can he not apologize?

1048
01:09:20,948 --> 01:09:21,866
What is it?

1049
01:09:22,575 --> 01:09:24,243
Couldn't you have been more mature?

1050
01:09:24,326 --> 01:09:26,162
-What?
-Earlier,

1051
01:09:26,245 --> 01:09:29,206
you didn't sound like a hotshot lawyer,
but a spoiled brat

1052
01:09:29,874 --> 01:09:31,167
like the girl in the photos.

1053
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:33,711
Don't play dirty.
Why bring up my humiliating past?

1054
01:09:33,794 --> 01:09:37,631
All the criticisms children give
their parents will come back as regrets.

1055
01:09:42,511 --> 01:09:44,054
Don't do something you'll regret.

1056
01:09:44,638 --> 01:09:46,849
Regret is the most painful thing in life.

1057
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:54,565
He and I will drink at his regular spot.
Come if you want to.

1058
01:09:57,484 --> 01:10:00,029
You don't have to apologize.
You can just join us.

1059
01:10:01,322 --> 01:10:03,616
Gosh. "Apologize"?

1060
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:05,534
As if.

1061
01:10:27,389 --> 01:10:28,766
CRYSTAL BALL

1062
01:10:35,773 --> 01:10:36,815
Hey.

1063
01:10:37,816 --> 01:10:39,068
You can start now.

1064
01:10:46,992 --> 01:10:47,826
No.

1065
01:10:48,869 --> 01:10:50,037
Both of them.

1066
01:10:50,788 --> 01:10:53,958
NAMDO AUNTIE'S RESTAURANT

1067
01:10:55,459 --> 01:10:58,545
I'd stay strong,
but days like this get to me.

1068
01:10:59,129 --> 01:11:01,924
I mean, when these jerks torture my girl.

1069
01:11:02,508 --> 01:11:04,093
No matter how much I scold her,

1070
01:11:04,593 --> 01:11:06,762
she's my precious little girl.
How dare they?

1071
01:11:09,431 --> 01:11:10,599
She'll get through it.

1072
01:11:11,475 --> 01:11:13,811
Ms. Hong is strong.

1073
01:11:14,979 --> 01:11:17,481
Aren't you truly the strong one?

1074
01:11:20,567 --> 01:11:23,696
I'm not that strong or good,
for that matter.

1075
01:11:24,738 --> 01:11:27,866
Weak people don't go to their moms' trials
if they were abandoned.

1076
01:11:27,950 --> 01:11:31,620
I only went to see how miserable she was.

1077
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:34,164
Do you mean that?

1078
01:11:37,126 --> 01:11:38,043
Yes.

1079
01:11:38,544 --> 01:11:43,382
Don't give Ms. Hong a reason
to check how miserable you are.

1080
01:11:45,134 --> 01:11:48,721
You're telling me to stop fighting Babel
because I'll be miserable.

1081
01:11:52,099 --> 01:11:55,060
I will keep fighting them.

1082
01:11:55,936 --> 01:11:57,479
And I have more power to fight.

1083
01:11:58,981 --> 01:12:03,402
And that power will put you
in more danger, won't it?

1084
01:12:07,823 --> 01:12:12,161
I don't like that you're the only one
exposed to all those risks.

1085
01:12:13,245 --> 01:12:16,832
I want you to take
the coward's way out this time.

1086
01:12:18,542 --> 01:12:22,129
For me, running away
isn't the coward's way out.

1087
01:12:23,630 --> 01:12:25,424
It's putting other people in danger.

1088
01:12:26,133 --> 01:12:27,176
Okay?

1089
01:12:47,946 --> 01:12:49,698
I'm not going there to see my dad.

1090
01:12:50,282 --> 01:12:53,869
I'm going to the restaurant to eat tofu
with kimchi and an assortment of jeon.

1091
01:13:04,838 --> 01:13:05,881
Excuse me.

1092
01:13:07,091 --> 01:13:08,050
It's for you.

1093
01:13:09,259 --> 01:13:11,804
-What's that?
-The man you talked to earlier

1094
01:13:11,887 --> 01:13:13,972
told me to give this to you.

1095
01:13:23,690 --> 01:13:24,733
What?

1096
01:13:59,476 --> 01:14:00,310
Who is it?

1097
01:14:02,938 --> 01:14:04,857
-Who is it?
-We're from the police.

1098
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:06,442
What's this about?

1099
01:14:06,525 --> 01:14:09,778
We're doing an inspection.
A murder suspect was seen around here.

1100
01:14:10,487 --> 01:14:12,739
We just need to check your identification.

1101
01:14:25,335 --> 01:14:28,297
I ask for your cooperation.
Could you open the door?

1102
01:14:28,881 --> 01:14:30,507
You don't have a Busan accent.

1103
01:14:31,425 --> 01:14:33,677
Right. I'm from Seoul.

1104
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:36,972
I see. Hold on.

1105
01:14:42,227 --> 01:14:44,354
Open it quickly. I'm busy today.

1106
01:14:44,438 --> 01:14:46,315
Okay. Wait.

1107
01:15:03,248 --> 01:15:04,249
Damn it.

LAWYER HONG YU-CHAN

1109
01:15:38,867 --> 01:15:42,162
Here's a thing. Jackie Chan.

1110
01:15:42,788 --> 01:15:44,873
I love his movies.

1111
01:15:44,957 --> 01:15:45,958
Why?

1112
01:15:46,041 --> 01:15:49,503
He wins not because
he's a master of martial arts,

1113
01:15:49,586 --> 01:15:51,588
but because he never gives up.

1114
01:15:51,672 --> 01:15:54,216
Even if he messes up,
he tries again for 10 or 100 times.

1115
01:15:54,299 --> 01:15:57,261
He keeps trying until he gets it right.

1116
01:16:00,013 --> 01:16:01,723
I'm going for a smoke.

1117
01:16:10,857 --> 01:16:12,651
Goodness, it's pouring.

RDU-90, KEY CHARACTERISTICS

1120
01:16:55,110 --> 01:16:57,362
Sir, can I get a cigarette?

1121
01:16:57,446 --> 01:16:58,447
Sure.

1122
01:16:59,239 --> 01:17:01,199
Here you go.

1123
01:17:01,283 --> 01:17:02,326
The light?

1124
01:17:03,493 --> 01:17:04,494
Here.

1125
01:17:07,873 --> 01:17:10,000
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

LAWYER HONG YU-CHAN

1130
01:18:23,615 --> 01:18:24,783
Goodness.

1131
01:18:29,996 --> 01:18:32,374
It's pouring.

1132
01:18:36,503 --> 01:18:37,796
Mr. Hong.

1133
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:40,841
Are you hiding something from me?

1134
01:18:42,259 --> 01:18:43,301
I am.

1135
01:18:44,136 --> 01:18:46,054
My sincerity which no one knows about.

1136
01:18:53,979 --> 01:18:57,274
"It takes a devil
to drive out another devil."

1137
01:18:58,734 --> 01:19:00,694
That's the only Italian proverb I know.

1138
01:19:02,487 --> 01:19:03,780
Remember what I told you?

1139
01:19:04,489 --> 01:19:06,658
Only monsters can beat monsters.

1140
01:19:07,993 --> 01:19:09,619
But I can't be a monster.

1141
01:19:10,662 --> 01:19:12,706
I wish a real monster would appear

1142
01:19:13,206 --> 01:19:16,877
and deal with all these evil men,
whether it's legal or not.

1143
01:19:20,964 --> 01:19:23,300
But that's not possible in real life.

1144
01:19:31,016 --> 01:19:32,392
Mr. Cassano.

1145
01:19:34,895 --> 01:19:37,939
You can't be that monster, right?

1146
01:19:50,368 --> 01:19:52,037
Someone has been calling you.

1147
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:53,371
What? Who?

1148
01:19:57,542 --> 01:19:58,543
RDU-90.

1149
01:20:01,046 --> 01:20:02,422
Isn't that the researcher?
